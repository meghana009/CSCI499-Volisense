overview real gdp growth remained unexpectedly sluggish in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recent indicators point to substantially weaker than previously expected activity also in the first half of 2019 while some temporary factors are likely to have contributed to the slowdown in activity in late 2018 the broad based worsening of economic sentiment indicators across countries and sectors in recent months suggests that more persistent adverse factors have also been at play and that the underlying cyclical momentum is somewhat weaker than previously assessed in the shorter term a combination of global uncertainties such as threats of an escalation of protectionist measures and the possibility of a disorderly brexit as well as adverse domestic factors in some euro area countries are likely to continue to weigh on euro area activity thereafter the baseline assumes that these domestic and global headwinds gradually fade out and that the fundamental factors supporting the euro area expansion remain broadly in place these factors include notably the very accommodative stance of monetary policy rising wages a recovery in foreign demand and some fiscal loosening as these favourable factors are expected to gradually prevail real gdp growth is projected to increase from 1 1 in 2019 to 1 6 in 2020 and 1 5 in 2021 compared with the december 2018 projections real gdp growth for 2019 has been revised down by 0 6 percentage point hicp inflation is expected to continue to decrease in the course of 2019 and to rise over the remainder of the projection horizon reaching 1 6 in 2021 the decrease in hicp inflation in 2019 is accounted for by a sharp decline in hicp energy inflation reflecting the recent drop in oil prices hicp inflation excluding energy and food is projected to pick up gradually over the projection horizon reflecting the continued but more moderate strengthening in economic activity and the tightening of labour markets compared with the december 2018 projections hicp inflation has been revised down over the entire projection horizon mainly reflecting recent weaker data outturns the weaker outlook for economic growth and a downward revision to the oil price assumptions 1 real economy growth weakened notably in the second half of 2018 and exhibited increased divergence among the largest euro area countries see chart 1 the slowdown in real gdp growth from quarterly rates of 0 4 in the first half of 2018 to 0 2 in the second half is partly related to specific factors that affected activity among the largest euro area countries this was particularly the case in germany and italy which recorded substantial declines in gdp growth rates from quarterly rates of 0 4 in the first half of 2018 to a standstill in the second half of the year in germany and from 0 2 to negative rates for the same periods in italy in germany the sharp slowdown in the second half of 2018 was partly related to disruptions in the car industry which have proved to be more persistent than previously expected but it also reflected broader weakness across sectors in italy uncertainty financial market volatility and deterioration in business confidence had an increasingly adverse impact on economic activity quarterly gdp growth in france and spain in the second half of 2018 slightly exceeded the pace seen in the first half of the year chart 1 euro area real gdp quarter on quarter percentage changes seasonally and working day adjusted quarterly data note the ranges shown around the central projections are based on the differences between actual outcomes and previous projections carried out over a number of years the width of the ranges is twice the average absolute value of these differences the method used for calculating the ranges involving a correction for exceptional events is documented in new procedure for constructing eurosystem and ecb staff projection ranges ecb december 2009 available on the ecb s website with few exceptions recent sentiment indicators have broadly worsened reflecting domestic and global uncertainties as well as an earlier than expected weakening of the underlying cyclical momentum the economic sentiment indicator esi compiled by the european commission has continued to decline in recent months with its decline being broad based across euro area countries and across sectors while remaining above historical averages the industrial services and consumer confidence indices included in the esi have fallen to levels last seen in late 2016 the purchasing managers indices also continued to decline in recent months as the assessment of new export orders and inventory stocks worsened the broad based downward surprises in economic releases may reflect a stronger than previously expected impact of global uncertainties in particular related to global trade disputes and brexit as well as the impact of the aforementioned uncertainties in italy and possible adverse impacts of the protests in france they may also suggest that the underlying cyclical momentum has weakened earlier than previously expected acknowledging the increasingly mature cyclical position of the euro area economy these factors are reflected in downward revisions to real gdp growth for the coming quarters over the medium term the baseline assumes a gradual dissipation of global and domestic headwinds allowing fundamental factors supporting the euro area expansion to regain traction see table 1 in particular the baseline assumes no disorderly exit of the united kingdom from the european union and that the current level of uncertainty regarding global trade and domestic policies in some euro area countries gradually normalises the fading away of these negative headwinds will give way to a number of favourable fundamental factors the ecb s monetary policy stance is expected to remain very accommodative and to continue to be transmitted to the economy lending to the private sector should remain resilient spurred by low interest rates and favourable bank lending conditions for both households and non financial corporations growth in private consumption and residential investment should also benefit from rising wage growth and net worth as well as from declining unemployment at the same time business investment will continue to expand against a background of rising profits high capacity utilisation and likely labour saving investment in the context of increasing labour shortages euro area exports are expected to benefit from the projected recovery in euro area foreign demand and by some competitiveness gains finally the fiscal stance is expected to move from broadly neutral in 2018 to loosening over the full horizon see section 3 table 1 macroeconomic projections for the euro area annual percentage changes note real gdp and components unit labour costs compensation per employee and labour productivity refer to seasonally and working day adjusted data 1 the ranges shown around the projections are based on the differences between actual outcomes and previous projections carried out over a number of years the width of the ranges is twice the average absolute value of these differences the method used for calculating the ranges involving a correction for exceptional events is documented in new procedure for constructing eurosystem and ecb staff projection ranges ecb december 2009 available on the ecb s website 2 including intra euro area trade 3 the sub index is based on estimates of actual impacts of indirect taxes this may differ from eurostat data which assume a full and immediate pass through of tax impacts to the hicp 4 calculated as the government balance net of transitory effects of the economic cycle and temporary measures taken by governments nevertheless the fading out of some tailwinds will restrain the recovery in economic growth over the latter half of the projection horizon the technical assumptions imply that financing conditions will become gradually less favourable although they will continue to support growth in addition following several years of robust growth employment is expected to grow at a somewhat lower rate over the medium run mostly reflecting increasingly binding labour supply shortages in some countries real disposable income is expected to maintain its solid momentum in 2019 and 2020 before weakening in 2021 this reflects offsetting developments in nominal disposable income growth and consumer price inflation in 2019 and 2020 while both weakening nominal income growth and slightly higher inflation dampen real income growth in 2021 the contribution of gross wages and salaries to nominal disposable income growth is projected to decline somewhat in 2019 due to the impact of weaker employment growth and to remain broadly unchanged thereafter as an expected increase in nominal wage growth compensates for a further slowdown in employment growth non labour income declined in the second half of 2018 and is projected to recover gradually over the projection horizon broadly in line with profits the contribution of net fiscal transfers is expected to turn positive in 2019 for the first time since 2010 reflecting a mix of cuts to direct taxation and rising transfers to households it is expected to turn broadly neutral in 2020 and 2021 private consumption is projected to recover in the near term but uncertainties in some countries are likely to weigh on its momentum private consumption has decelerated in the course of 2018 looking forward still relatively favourable consumer confidence further expected improvements in labour market conditions and rising real wages per employee suggest stronger consumption growth over the next few quarters further compounded by a positive effect of fiscal loosening in certain countries at the same time a persistent adverse impact of domestic uncertainties in some euro area countries is assumed to weigh on private consumption in the coming quarters private consumption growth should be supported in the medium term by favourable financing conditions and rising net worth bank lending rates are projected to increase moderately over the projection horizon however the impact of rising bank lending rates on gross interest payments is expected to be limited due to the long maturity of household debt and the relatively low share of variable rate debt on the households balance sheet thus despite the increase in lending rates gross interest payments are expected to remain at low levels and therefore to continue to support private consumption in addition net worth is projected to increase by around 2 5 in real terms each year over the period 2019 21 spurred by the continued robust valuation gains on real estate holdings which explain more than half of the projected increase rising real net worth should support consumption even though household gross indebtedness remains at levels prevailing before the start of the global financial crisis box 1 technical assumptions about interest rates exchange rates and commodity prices compared with the december 2018 projections the technical assumptions include lower oil prices a weaker effective exchange rate of the euro and lower interest rates the technical assumptions about interest rates and commodity prices are based on market expectations with a cut off date of 12 february 2019 short term rates refer to the three month euribor with market expectations derived from futures rates the methodology gives an average level for these short term interest rates of 0 3 for 2019 0 2 for 2020 and 0 0 for 2021 the market expectations for euro area ten year nominal government bond yields imply an average level of 1 0 in 2019 1 3 in 2020 and 1 5 in 2021 compared with the december 2018 projections market expectations for short term interest rates have been revised down by 2 basis points for 2019 17 basis points for 2020 and 31 basis points for 2021 while long term interest rates have been revised down by around 40 basis points over the full horizon as regards commodity prices on the basis of the path implied by futures markets by taking the average of the two week period ending on the cut off date of 12 february 2019 the price of a barrel of brent crude oil is assumed to decrease from usd 71 1 in 2018 to usd 61 7 in 2019 and to ease further to usd 60 6 in 2021 this path implies that in comparison with the december 2018 projections oil prices in us dollars are 8 6 lower in 2019 8 2 lower in 2020 and 8 0 lower in 2021 the prices of non energy commodities in us dollars are assumed to rebound over the projection horizon bilateral exchange rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the projection horizon at the average levels prevailing in the two week period ending on the cut off date of 12 february 2019 this implies an average exchange rate of usd 1 14 per euro over the period 2019 21 which is broadly unchanged from the december 2018 projections the effective exchange rate of the euro against 38 trading partners is 0 9 weaker than entailed in the december 2018 projections technical assumptions the expansion of residential investment is expected to continue albeit at a more moderate pace confidence in the construction sector and rising granted building permits suggest a continued expansion of housing investment in the next few quarters nonetheless the pace of this expansion is expected to slow this weakening is also suggested by surveys showing a recent decline in the share of households planning to undertake home improvements over the next year such moderation may emerge partly as financing conditions are set to become slightly tighter but also as a result of increasingly binding capacity constraints in the construction sector and adverse demographic trends in some countries business investment is expected to continue recovering over the projection horizon albeit at a rather subdued pace business investment is estimated to have lost some momentum in the second half of 2018 looking ahead business investment is expected to remain rather subdued in 2019 as persistent concerns about global trade policies a no deal brexit and a hard landing in china appear to have increasingly adversely affected business confidence across countries in general however a number of favourable fundamentals are expected to continue to support business investment in the euro area capacity utilisation in manufacturing remains above its long term average and a large share of manufacturing firms report lack of equipment as a factor limiting production financing conditions are expected to remain supportive albeit gradually tightening over the projection horizon profits are expected to increase which adds further to the sizeable liquid asset overhang firms have built up in recent years and companies may increase investment as a means of compensating for labour related supply side constraints box 2 the international environment after peaking in the second half of 2017 global growth momentum has continued to moderate economic activity in the advanced economies decelerated in the third quarter of 2018 slightly more than expected in the december 2018 projections due to the weaker performance of some non euro area european economies and a somewhat deeper contraction in japan growth in emerging market economies was steady broadly in line with the december 2018 projections survey based evidence suggests that global growth decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018 and weakened further in early 2019 global manufacturing activity has slowed against the backdrop of the maturing business cycle in key advanced economies in addition the pace of this slowdown has been accentuated by growing uncertainties weighing on the global economy such as the escalation of the trade dispute between the united states and china financial stress in emerging market economies during the summer months and more recently signs of slower growth in china with knock on effects on other asian economies the slowdown of global manufacturing activity also weighed on global trade global growth is projected to decrease slightly this year amid increasing headwinds these headwinds include weaker global manufacturing activity and trade in an environment of high and rising policy and political uncertainty although the sizeable pro cyclical fiscal stimulus in the united states including lower taxes and increased public expenditures continues to provide impetus to us and global growth this year the partial federal government shutdown the longest on record in the united states is likely to have weighed on us activity and the upcoming discussions on the debt ceiling could further erode us consumer confidence in china a slowdown in domestic demand is projected to persist in the first half of this year as the policy support announced recently is expected to take some time to materialise at the same time lower oil prices are expected to provide support to growth in oil importing countries while weighing on the activity of oil exporters looking further ahead global growth is projected to pick up somewhat over the medium term this reflects three key factors that shape the global growth path over the projection horizon first the cyclical momentum in advanced economies will slow as capacity constraints become increasingly binding and policy support gradually diminishes amid positive output gaps and low unemployment rates across key advanced economies in the united states the boost to growth from the fiscal stimulus will peak in 2019 and the federal open market committee is likely to proceed with its gradual policy normalisation albeit more cautiously second an orderly transition to a lower growth path less dependent on investment and exports is expected to continue in china finally growth is expected to recover in several emerging market economies that are currently going through or have recently experienced deep recessions this applies especially but not exclusively to argentina brazil and turkey in this regard the projections assume that last year s intensification of trade tensions between the united states and china weigh mainly on activity in these two countries overall the pace of global expansion will settle at below pre crisis rates and in line with potential global growth global growth excluding the euro area is projected to decline to 3 5 this year from 3 7 in 2018 and to increase slightly to 3 6 over the period 2020 21 compared with the december 2018 projections the global growth projections are broadly unrevised the international environment annual percentage changes 1 calculated as a weighted average of imports 2 calculated as a weighted average of imports of euro area trading partners slowing global industrial activity heightened trade tensions and a weaker asian tech cycle are expected to weigh on global trade this year implying a more pronounced slowdown in global trade than in activity looking further ahead the global trade projections are anchored around the view that global imports will grow broadly in line with activity euro area foreign demand which expanded by 4 in 2018 is expected to slow significantly falling to 2 2 in 2019 before picking up to 3 3 and 3 4 in 2020 and 2021 respectively compared with the december 2018 projection exercise euro area foreign demand has been revised down notably in 2019 and to a lesser extent in 2020 largely reflecting disappointing data in late 2018 and the projected weaker import demand from china the rest of emerging asia and european economies outside the euro area extra euro area exports are projected to grow slightly faster than foreign demand in the near term and in line thereafter following a decline in the first quarter of 2018 extra euro area exports are estimated to have recovered gradually in the second and third quarters and to have outpaced foreign demand in the fourth quarter the resulting market share gains in the fourth quarter partly reflect country specific factors as these unwind and as foreign demand remains rather sluggish in 2019 extra euro area export growth is expected to remain subdued in the short term while still growing somewhat faster than foreign demand during 2019 implying slight gains in market share the relative strength of extra euro area exports vis à vis foreign demand in the short term reflects improving price competitiveness across euro area countries compounded by a further normalisation of car exports over the medium term extra euro area exports are expected to grow in line with foreign demand see box 2 extra euro area imports are estimated to have slowed to below the pace of exports in the fourth quarter of 2018 implying a positive contribution from net trade to real gdp growth looking ahead extra euro area imports are expected to grow broadly in line with total demand domestic demand plus exports as imports are projected to rise somewhat faster than exports the contribution of net trade to economic growth is projected to turn slightly negative in 2019 and to be broadly neutral over the remainder of the projection horizon employment growth is projected to decline given weakening activity and increasingly binding labour shortages in some countries forward looking surveys suggest modest employment growth in the near term employment growth is expected to be dampened in the near term mainly by the sharp slowdown in activity over the medium term employment growth is likely to remain subdued as labour supply is expected to limit further employment growth in some countries and labour demand is projected to moderate in line with the slowdown in activity the expansion of the labour force is expected to moderate over the projection horizon the labour force is expected to continue to expand reflecting the projected net positive immigration of workers the expected integration of refugees and ongoing increases in the participation rate nevertheless these factors are projected to fade over the projection horizon and the adverse impact of the ageing of the population on labour force growth is expected to increase as older cohorts leave the workforce in higher numbers than younger cohorts enter it the unemployment rate is expected to decline to 7 5 in 2021 the unemployment rate stood at 7 9 in the fourth quarter of 2018 which is the lowest level observed since the third quarter of 2008 looking ahead the number of unemployed persons is projected to decline by around 0 9 million to 12 9 million by the end of the projection horizon still somewhat above the level of its pre crisis trough while the unemployment rate is expected to drop in almost all euro area countries over the projection horizon individual country levels are expected to still exhibit substantial differences labour productivity is projected to recover over the projection horizon following its strong momentum in 2017 labour productivity per worker declined slightly in quarter on quarter terms during the course of 2018 reflecting the unexpected weakening of activity and some labour hoarding in response to labour shortages a moderate acceleration in productivity growth in quarter on quarter terms is expected later in 2019 as activity regains momentum beyond that labour productivity is expected to increase at a pace close to its pre crisis average rate of 1 0 supported by an increase in the number of hours worked per person and some gains in total factor productivity compared with the december 2018 projections real gdp growth has been revised down substantially for 2019 and slightly for 2020 the notable downward revision in real gdp growth for 2019 is driven by the weaker data outturn in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a less favourable assessment of the short term outlook reflecting a more lasting adverse impact of specific factors in some euro area countries and heightened global policy uncertainties the medium term projection for real gdp growth is broadly unchanged given the assumption that a gradual dissipation of the global and domestic headwinds will allow the expansion to regain traction 2 prices and costs hicp inflation is expected to continue to decrease until the fourth quarter of 2019 and to pick up over the remainder of the projection horizon reaching 1 6 in 2021 see chart 2 the decline in headline inflation in 2019 is mainly accounted for by a significant decrease in hicp energy inflation given the recent strong drop in oil prices and downward base effects related to their previous increase in 2018 in 2020 and 2021 hicp energy prices are expected to rise at subdued rates consistent with the relatively flat oil price futures curve hicp food inflation is envisaged to hover around rates of 1 9 over the projection horizon hicp inflation excluding energy and food will be on a gradual upward path reaching 1 6 in 2021 the pick up in hicp inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be supported by the more gradual but continued economic recovery moreover tightening labour markets will support wage growth leading to higher domestic cost pressures rising non energy commodity prices and rising underlying global prices will also bolster hicp inflation excluding energy and food chart 2 euro area hicp year on year percentage changes note the ranges shown around the central projections are based on the differences between actual outcomes and previous projections carried out over a number of years the width of the ranges is twice the average absolute value of these differences the method used for calculating the ranges involving a correction for exceptional events is documented in new procedure for constructing eurosystem and ecb staff projection ranges ecb december 2009 available on the ecb s website wage growth is expected to increase somewhat further over the projection horizon as labour markets continue to tighten and measures that have dampened wage growth in some countries over the past few years expire growth in compensation per employee is projected to rise from 2 2 in 2018 to 2 6 in 2021 at the same time unit labour cost growth is expected to decline somewhat over the projection horizon as productivity is envisaged to strengthen the main driver behind the pick up in wage growth is the envisaged further improvement in euro area labour market conditions over the projection horizon with increasing labour market tightness in some parts of the euro area beyond the cyclical momentum the significant recent pick up in headline inflation can be expected to contribute to a pick up in wage growth in euro area countries where wage formation processes include backward looking elements in addition the wage dampening effects of crisis related factors such as the need for wage moderation to regain price competitiveness in some countries and pent up wage restraint in view of binding downward rigidities in nominal wages during the crisis should gradually abate as the economic expansion continues some countries have also introduced increases in minimum wages which might pass through to the wage distribution profit margins are expected to develop more favourably over the projection horizon than in 2018 profit margins have been squeezed over the last few quarters on account of a surge in unit labour costs reflecting the weakening in economic activity that has led to a drop in productivity growth in addition deteriorations in the terms of trade related to the past increases in oil prices weighed on profit margin developments both factors should lose importance over the next few quarters as the paces of economic activity and productivity pick up while the terms of trade are expected to improve given the recent fall in oil prices external price pressures are expected to recede in 2019 and to rise moderately over the remainder of the projection horizon the annual growth rate of the import deflator is envisaged to decrease in 2019 compared with 2018 and to rise gradually thereafter this profile is strongly determined by the movements in oil prices which pushed up import prices in 2018 and are expected to dampen their developments in 2019 at the same time non oil commodity prices and underlying global price pressures are assumed to rise and contribute to the gradual increase in import prices compared with the december 2018 projections the projection for hicp inflation has been revised down for the whole projection horizon the downward revision in hicp inflation mainly reflects the assumption of significantly lower oil prices particularly in 2019 and 2020 and a lower path for hicp inflation excluding energy and food in turn the downward revision in hicp inflation excluding energy and food reflects the impact of lower oil prices via indirect effects weaker recent data outturns a more moderate outlook for economic activity and some limited reassessment of the strength of the pass through of wages to prices 3 fiscal outlook the euro area fiscal stance is assessed to have been broadly neutral in 2018 and is projected to loosen from 2019 onwards the fiscal policy stance is measured as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance net of government support to the financial sector in 2019 the main contribution to the looser fiscal stance stems from cuts to direct taxes and social security contributions as well as higher government expenditure in some countries for 2020 further loosening is projected the main contributions to this stem from further cuts to direct taxes and social security contributions still rather strong expenditure growth and higher transfers for 2021 the baseline incorporates some loosening that is mostly related to expenditure growth in some countries the euro area budget balance is projected to deteriorate in 2019 and to remain broadly unchanged for the rest of the projection horizon while the debt ratio remains on a downward path the widening in the government deficit is due to a deterioration in the cyclically adjusted primary balance this is partly offset by a slight decline in interest expenditures resulting from the replacement of high cost old debt with new debt issued at lower interest rates the declining path of the government debt to gdp ratio is supported by positive primary balances and a favourable interest growth rate differential the euro area deficit outlook has deteriorated significantly compared with the december 2018 projections in particular for 2020 and 2021 the higher budget deficit is due to a less favourable primary balance and a lower cyclical component reflecting the weaker macroeconomic outlook the debt to gdp ratio is projected to be higher mainly reflecting an increasing interest growth rate differential in 2019 owing to the downward revision of gdp growth and lower primary balances box 3 sensitivity analyses projections rely heavily on technical assumptions regarding the evolution of certain key variables given that some of these variables can have a large impact on the projections for the euro area examining the sensitivity of the latter with respect to alternative paths of these underlying assumptions can help in the analysis of risks around the projections this box discusses the uncertainty around some key underlying assumptions and the sensitivity of the projections with respect to these variables 1 alternative oil price paths this sensitivity analysis aims to assess the implications of alternative oil price paths the technical assumptions for oil price developments underlying the baseline projections based on oil futures markets predict a rather flat profile for oil prices with the price of a barrel of brent crude oil at usd 60 6 in 2021 two alternative oil price paths are analysed the first is based on the lower 25th percentile of the distribution provided by the option implied densities for the oil price on 12 february 2019 this path implies a gradual decline in the oil price to usd 46 0 per barrel in 2021 which is 24 1 below the baseline assumption for that year using the average of the results from a number of staff macroeconomic models this path would have a small upward impact on real gdp growth around 0 1 percentage point in 2020 and 2021 while hicp inflation would be 0 2 percentage point lower in 2019 0 5 percentage point lower in 2020 and 0 3 percentage point lower in 2021 the second path is based on the upper 25th percentile of the same distribution and implies an increase in the oil price to usd 77 8 per barrel in 2021 which is 28 3 above the baseline assumption for that year this path would entail a faster increase in hicp inflation which would be 0 4 percentage point higher in 2019 0 5 percentage point higher in 2020 and 0 2 percentage point higher in 2021 while real gdp growth would be slightly lower down by 0 1 percentage point in each year of the projection horizon 2 an alternative exchange rate path this sensitivity analysis investigates the effects of a strengthening of the exchange rate of the euro this scenario is consistent with the distribution of the option implied risk neutral densities for the usd eur exchange rate on 12 february 2019 which is heavily skewed towards an appreciation of the euro the 75th percentile of that distribution implies an appreciation of the euro vis à vis the us dollar to an exchange rate of usd 1 31 per euro in 2021 which is 15 above the baseline assumption for that year the corresponding assumption for the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro reflects historical regularities whereby changes in the usd eur exchange rate correspond to changes in the effective exchange rate with an elasticity of just above one half in this scenario the average of the results from a number of staff macroeconomic models points to real gdp growth being 0 1 percentage point lower in 2019 0 6 percentage point lower in 2020 and 0 3 percentage point lower in 2021 hicp inflation would be 0 1 percentage point lower in 2019 0 6 percentage point lower in 2020 and 0 4 percentage point lower in 2021 box 4 forecasts by other institutions a number of forecasts for the euro area are available from both international organisations and private sector institutions however these forecasts are not strictly comparable with one another or with the ecb eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections as they were finalised at different points in time additionally they use different partly unspecified methods to derive assumptions for fiscal financial and external variables including oil and other commodity prices finally there are differences in working day adjustment methods across different

facility the credit facility will be used to fund the arrangement and replace shawcor s existing senior credit facility shawcor anticipates that a portion of the credit facility will be syndicated to other banks or financial institutions it is anticipated that the credit facility will be entered into prior to the end of the first quarter of 2019 on january 30 2019 the company gave notice to the senior note holders that it will repay on march 7 2019 the entire principal amount outstanding with a accrued interest approximately us 199 8 million and a make whole amount estimated at approximately us 5 2 million offshore guyana deepwater projects on october 4 2018 the company announced that its pipe coating division had been assigned work from saipem valued at approximately c 110 million to provide thermal insulation and anticorrosion coating services for the liza i and ii deepwater development projects located offshore guyana coating work under the liza i project commenced in march 2018 at shawcor s channelview texas facility and additional work will be completed at shawcor s veracruz mexico facility work on liza i is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019 coating work under the larger liza ii project which is conditional on a final investment decision or fid by the pipeline operator is expected to be executed at the veracruz and channelview facilities 1 1 outlook shawcor s financial performance is correlated with oil and gas infrastructure spending and the resultant demand for the company s products and services adjusted ebitda1 for the fourth quarter of 2018 was in line with expectations and reflected typical seasonal slowdowns in several of the company s businesses along with the ongoing investments in the pipe coating business for idle assets and project pursuit costs in preparation for the expected increase in activity in the second half of 2019 and beyond the fourth quarter saw continued momentum in north american demand for shawcor s products and services specifically in composite pipe technologies pipe coating products and integrity management field services full year 2018 results were slightly better than the expectations the company communicated a year ago based on the annualized adjusted ebitda1 run rate of the fourth quarter of 2016 2018 was a pivotal year as it demonstrated that the company can deliver profitable results on its diversified base business despite having no contribution from the core pipe coating business or a large pipe coating project the company expects that its operating results in the first half of 2019 will be negatively impacted by the continued lower pipe coating activity higher costs for idle assets and large project pursuits and a very soft winter drilling and completion season in western canada the company expects revenues to sequentially improve throughout 2019 particularly in the second half of the year and to deliver improved annual operating results over 2018 this expectation reflects stable demand throughout the year for the base business particularly in north america and increased activity in pipe coating in the second half of the year from international and offshore projects 1 ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap measures and do not have standardized meanings under gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies see section 6 0 reconciliation of non gaap measures for further details and a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda the company believes that 2018 represented the bottom of the offshore global oil gas capex cycle and that this market is poised for consistent growth over the next several years the likelihood of large projects being sanctioned to replace production in the near to medium term is strengthening driven by several years of absent investment or short cycle investment prioritization in the industry now coming to an end as key reservoirs are no longer able to sustain peak production levels the increase in high decline rate shale production and geopolitical challenges which are affecting several important producing regions additionally the increased demand for greener technology will be supportive of investments in gas specifically lng the company continues to see demand growth in north america land markets and an increased level of activity in the international and offshore markets as evidenced in its current bids outstanding the company remains well positioned to capitalize on this continuing positive trend in project activity through its global footprint technology portfolio and execution history the company continued its strategic efforts to position itself as the partner of choice in the pursuit of several large projects which are characterized as greater than 100 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 the liza i ii awards representing approximately 110 million of work related to deep water development projects located offshore guyana provided further evidence that the low point in the offshore pipe coating cycle has been reached liza i and ii is a multi phase project and characteristic of the type of project planning that the company is seeing with greater frequency in an effort to reduce large project costs operators are engaging large global engineering procurement contracting epc companies who are utilizing standardized engineering approaches and selecting preferred suppliers to participate in the planning process significantly earlier than in the past this new contracting approach gives shawcor greater visibility and awareness on future possible project wins recently this same process was followed in an as yet unsanctioned offshore australia project where a conditional non binding letter of award was signed between the selected epc company and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 100 million in revenue for 2020 although the exact timing of when large projects are sanctioned is difficult to predict the company believes that there is still a strong likelihood that some of these projects will be sanctioned in 2019 and beyond because they are not directly linked to oil and gas commodity prices as they involve energy security or reservoir access considerations based on this the company believes that its diversified base business and expected higher pipe coating activity in 2019 will deliver improved operating results particularly in the second half of the year however the company has confidence to deliver stronger results in 2020 from the expected build in backlog in 2019 as confidence has increased that the investment in international projects will be sanctioned with a positive impact on the offshore pipe coating business shawcor continued its growth strategy of diversifying the base business through organic and inorganic initiatives investments in expanding the composite product offering both in operating envelope and geographic reach deployment of next generation inspection technology and capacity expansion in the automotive heat shrink market have been made in addition the company announced that it had entered into an arrangement agreement to acquire all of the shares of zcl composites inc north america s largest manufacturer and supplier of environmentally friendly fiberglass reinforced plastic underground storage tanks this inorganic investment is supported by long term fundamental drivers similar to those which support shawcor such as aging infrastructure and it leverages shawcor s material science expertise in advanced composite materials to provide customers with superior systems for both their conveyance and storage needs it further demonstrates shawcor s commitment to diversifying its portfolio and increasing its base business to provide a foundation for long term technology developments and profitable base business growth further detail on the outlook for the pipeline and pipe services segment by region and in the petrochemical and industrial segment is set out below pipeline and pipe services segment north america market demand in shawcor s north american pipeline segment businesses is closely tied to well completions and the build out of new and the repair replacement of old transmission pipeline infrastructure these activities drive the demand for small diameter pipe coating and joint protection composite pipe for gathering line applications octg pipe inspection and refurbishment and gathering line girth weld inspection it is expected that demand in north american land activity will continue in line with rig counts and wells completed particularly in the united states however the rate of growth will slow down in the first half of 2019 due to the lack of take away capacity in the permian basin and early indications that suggest a soft winter season in western canada and resume in the second half of 2019 as take away capacity in the permian is addressed through several transmission pipeline projects currently underway the increased breadth of the company s portfolio as well as the continued adoption rate of shawcor s composite pipe systems technology over traditional steel products is helping to absorb these slight headwinds in addition the company continues to experience strong demand for its pipe coating capabilities from increased activity in the gulf of mexico and larger diameter onshore transmission line projects which is improving the utilization of our u s based coating facilities pipeline and pipe services segment latin america the company continues to expect increased activity in the recently reactivated facilities in mexico and brazil related to the continued activity in the gulf of mexico and smaller offshore brazilian projects this is supported by the liza ii project that is now under contract which is expected to be executed in the company s veracruz facility and contribute positive results in the second half of 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment europe middle east africa and russia emar shawcor s emar pipeline region continues to be negatively impacted by reduced capital spending by national and international energy companies the company will continue executing work on the awarded contract to provide anti corrosion and concrete weight coatings related to an offshore qatar pipeline the company continues to pursue several large projects in the region that if won could provide significant work beyond 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment asia pacific the region s project activity will continue to be depressed due to the lack of offshore project investments the company is actively pursuing several large projects that are related to the development of gas reservoirs that could be awarded in 2019 in addition composite products have recommenced their penetration in the australian onshore market and are gaining traction in several other countries in the region as composites gain further acceptance petrochemical and industrial segment shawcor s petrochemical and industrial segment businesses continue to deliver solid revenue and operating income based on stable demand in the global automotive market and european and north american industrial markets these markets generally follow gdp activity however the segment is well positioned to capture the growing trend of electrification on automobiles with specified sealing water blocking and insulating systems along with customized application equipment for tier i assembly customers demand for wire and cable products continues to be strong and supply chain constraints for drawn wire from copper rods have eased from the third quarter of 2018 order backlog the company s order backlog consists of firm customer orders only and represents the revenue the company expects to realize on booked orders over the succeeding twelve months the company reports the twelve month billable backlog because it provides a leading indicator of significant changes in consolidated revenue the order backlog of 459 million as at december 31 2018 was above the 395 million order backlog as at september 30 2018 reflecting the inclusion of the liza ii project and other awards moving from bid to backlog in addition to the backlog the company closely monitors its bidding activity and the value of outstanding firm bids is over 1 0 billion up 160 million from last quarter due to increasing bidding activity for pipe coating in the offshore and international markets included in the firm bid is an as yet unsanctioned offshore australia project where a conditional non binding letter of award was signed between the selected epc company and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 100 million in revenue for 2020 the company is also working with customers on a number of other projects and the budgetary estimates at the end of the fourth quarter were almost 1 9 billion although the timing of these projects remains uncertain the company s bid and budgetary figures represent a diverse portfolio of opportunities to sustain and build the backlog through 2019 and beyond 2 0 consolidated information and results from

supplemental measures that provide a meaningful indication of the company s results from principal business activities prior to the consideration of how these activities are financed or the tax impacts in various jurisdictions and for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing capital or tax structures the company presents adjusted ebitda as a measure of ebitda that excludes the impact of transactions that are outside the company s normal course of business or day to day operations adjusted ebitda is used by many

and adjusted ebitda1 were in line with expectations given the typical seasonal slowdown in several of our businesses and the negative impact of lower activity and investments being made in our pipe coating business our annual 2018 results demonstrated the company s ability to deliver positive results from our diversified portfolio despite not having any contribution from a large pipe coating project and are aligned with expectations we communicated one year ago mr orr added future growth in earnings will be underpinned by the continued stability of our diversified base business particularly in north america and the strengthening of our backlog from the securing of projects that are now visible and are under bid the strengthening of the offshore capex cycle coupled with a demonstrated base business and solid long term industry fundamentals are providing us with increased confidence to continue to invest in opportunities to deliver our long term growth strategy this

arrangement to acquire all of the shares of zcl composites inc zcl for 10 00 per share in cash and by way of a statutory plan of arrangement the price per share implies an aggregate fully diluted equity value for zcl of approximately 308 million zcl is north america s largest manufacturer and supplier of environmentally friendly fiberglass reinforced plastic underground storage tanks zcl has two plants in canada four in the us and one in the netherlands serving the fuel water wastewater and oil gas markets the arrangement will be considered by zcl shareholders on march 26 2019 and requires the approval of 66 2 3rd of the votes cast at the meeting subject to receipt of shareholder and court approval closing of the transaction is expected in early april 2019 shawcor has entered into a commitment letter with the toronto dominion bank and national bank of canada as co lead arrangers providing a us 500 million four year senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility the credit facility will be used to fund the arrangement and replace shawcor s existing senior credit facility shawcor anticipates that a portion of the credit facility will be syndicated to other banks or financial institutions it is anticipated that the credit facility will be entered into prior to the end of the first quarter of 2019 on january 30 2019 the company gave notice to the senior note holders that it will repay on march 7 2019 the entire principal amount outstanding with a accrued interest approximately us 199 8 million and a make whole amount estimated at approximately us 5 2 million offshore guyana deepwater projects on october 4 2018 the company announced that its pipe coating division had been assigned work from saipem valued at approximately c 110 million to provide thermal insulation and anticorrosion coating services for the liza i and ii deepwater development projects located offshore guyana coating work under the liza i project commenced in march 2018 at shawcor s channelview texas facility and additional work will be completed at shawcor s veracruz mexico facility work on liza i is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019 coating work under the larger liza ii project which is conditional on a final investment decision or fid by the pipeline operator is expected to be executed at the veracruz and channelview facilities 1 1 outlook shawcor s financial performance is correlated with oil and gas infrastructure spending and the resultant demand for the company s products and services adjusted ebitda1 for the fourth quarter of 2018 was in line with expectations and reflected typical seasonal slowdowns in several of the company s businesses along with the ongoing investments in the pipe coating business for idle assets and project pursuit costs in preparation for the expected increase in activity in the second half of 2019 and beyond the fourth quarter saw continued momentum in north american demand for shawcor s products and services specifically in composite pipe technologies pipe coating products and integrity management field services full year 2018 results were slightly better than the expectations the company communicated a year ago based on the annualized adjusted ebitda1 run rate of the fourth quarter of 2016 2018 was a pivotal year as it demonstrated that the company can deliver profitable results on its diversified base business despite having no contribution from the core pipe coating business or a large pipe coating project the company expects that its operating results in the first half of 2019 will be negatively impacted by the continued lower pipe coating activity higher costs for idle assets and large project pursuits and a very soft winter drilling and completion season in western canada the company expects revenues to sequentially improve throughout 2019 particularly in the second half of the year and to deliver improved annual operating results over 2018 this expectation reflects stable demand throughout the year for the base business particularly in north america and increased activity in pipe coating in the second half of the year from international and offshore projects 1 ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap measures and do not have standardized meanings under gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies see section 6 0 reconciliation of non gaap measures for further details and a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda the company believes that 2018 represented the bottom of the offshore global oil gas capex cycle and that this market is poised for consistent growth over the next several years the likelihood of large projects being sanctioned to replace production in the near to medium term is strengthening driven by several years of absent investment or short cycle investment prioritization in the industry now coming to an end as key reservoirs are no longer able to sustain peak production levels the increase in high decline rate shale production and geopolitical challenges which are affecting several important producing regions additionally the increased demand for greener technology will be supportive of investments in gas specifically lng the company continues to see demand growth in north america land markets and an increased level of activity in the international and offshore markets as evidenced in its current bids outstanding the company remains well positioned to capitalize on this continuing positive trend in project activity through its global footprint technology portfolio and execution history the company continued its strategic efforts to position itself as the partner of choice in the pursuit of several large projects which are characterized as greater than 100 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 the liza i ii awards representing approximately 110 million of work related to deep water development projects located offshore guyana provided further evidence that the low point in the offshore pipe coating cycle has been reached liza i and ii is a multi phase project and characteristic of the type of project planning that the company is seeing with greater frequency in an effort to reduce large project costs operators are engaging large global engineering procurement contracting epc companies who are utilizing standardized engineering approaches and selecting preferred suppliers to participate in the planning process significantly earlier than in the past this new contracting approach gives shawcor greater visibility and awareness on future possible project wins recently this same process was followed in an as yet unsanctioned offshore australia project where a conditional non binding letter of award was signed between the selected epc company and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 100 million in revenue for 2020 although the exact timing of when large projects are sanctioned is difficult to predict the company believes that there is still a strong likelihood that some of these projects will be sanctioned in 2019 and beyond because they are not directly linked to oil and gas commodity prices as they involve energy security or reservoir access considerations based on this the company believes that its diversified base business and expected higher pipe coating activity in 2019 will deliver improved operating results particularly in the second half of the year however the company has confidence to deliver stronger results in 2020 from the expected build in backlog in 2019 as confidence has increased that the investment in international projects will be sanctioned with a positive impact on the offshore pipe coating business shawcor continued its growth strategy of diversifying the base business through organic and inorganic initiatives investments in expanding the composite product offering both in operating envelope and geographic reach deployment of next generation inspection technology and capacity expansion in the automotive heat shrink market have been made in addition the company announced that it had entered into an arrangement agreement to acquire all of the shares of zcl composites inc north america s largest manufacturer and supplier of environmentally friendly fiberglass reinforced plastic underground storage tanks this inorganic investment is supported by long term fundamental drivers similar to those which support shawcor such as aging infrastructure and it leverages shawcor s material science expertise in advanced composite materials to provide customers with superior systems for both their conveyance and storage needs it further demonstrates shawcor s commitment to diversifying its portfolio and increasing its base business to provide a foundation for long term technology developments and profitable base business growth further detail on the outlook for the pipeline and pipe services segment by region and in the petrochemical and industrial segment is set out below pipeline and pipe services segment north america market demand in shawcor s north american pipeline segment businesses is closely tied to well completions and the build out of new and the repair replacement of old transmission pipeline infrastructure these activities drive the demand for small diameter pipe coating and joint protection composite pipe for gathering line applications octg pipe inspection and refurbishment and gathering line girth weld inspection it is expected that demand in north american land activity will continue in line with rig counts and wells completed particularly in the united states however the rate of growth will slow down in the first half of 2019 due to the lack of take away capacity in the permian basin and early indications that suggest a soft winter season in western canada and resume in the second half of 2019 as take away capacity in the permian is addressed through several transmission pipeline projects currently underway the increased breadth of the company s portfolio as well as the continued adoption rate of shawcor s composite pipe systems technology over traditional steel products is helping to absorb these slight headwinds in addition the company continues to experience strong demand for its pipe coating capabilities from increased activity in the gulf of mexico and larger diameter onshore transmission line projects which is improving the utilization of our u s based coating facilities pipeline and pipe services segment latin america the company continues to expect increased activity in the recently reactivated facilities in mexico and brazil related to the continued activity in the gulf of mexico and smaller offshore brazilian projects this is supported by the liza ii project that is now under contract which is expected to be executed in the company s veracruz facility and contribute positive results in the second half of 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment europe middle east africa and russia emar shawcor s emar pipeline region continues to be negatively impacted by reduced capital spending by national and international energy companies the company will continue executing work on the awarded contract to provide anti corrosion and concrete weight coatings related to an offshore qatar pipeline the company continues to pursue several large projects in the region that if won could provide significant work beyond 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment asia pacific the region s project activity will continue to be depressed due to the lack of offshore project investments the company is actively pursuing several large projects that are related to the development of gas reservoirs that could be awarded in 2019 in addition composite products have recommenced their penetration in the australian onshore market and are gaining traction in several other countries in the region as composites gain further acceptance petrochemical and industrial segment shawcor s petrochemical and industrial segment businesses continue to deliver solid revenue and operating income based on stable demand in the global automotive market and european and north american industrial markets these markets generally follow gdp activity however the segment is well positioned to capture the growing trend of electrification on automobiles with specified sealing water blocking and insulating systems along with customized application equipment for tier i assembly customers demand for wire and cable products continues to be strong and supply chain constraints for drawn wire from copper rods have eased from the third quarter of 2018 order backlog the company s order backlog consists of firm customer orders only and represents the revenue the company expects to realize on booked orders over the succeeding twelve months the company reports the twelve month billable backlog because it provides a leading indicator of significant changes in consolidated revenue the order backlog of 459 million as at december 31 2018 was above the 395 million order backlog as at september 30 2018 reflecting the inclusion of the liza ii project and other awards moving from bid to backlog in addition to the backlog the company closely monitors its bidding activity and the value of outstanding firm bids is over 1 0 billion up 160 million from last quarter due to increasing bidding activity for pipe coating in the offshore and international markets included in the firm bid is an as yet unsanctioned offshore australia project where a conditional non binding letter of award was signed between the selected epc company and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 100 million in revenue for 2020 the company is also working with customers on a number of other projects and the budgetary estimates at the end of the fourth quarter were almost 1 9 billion although the timing of these projects remains uncertain the company s bid and budgetary figures represent a diverse portfolio of opportunities to sustain and build the backlog through 2019 and beyond 2 0 consolidated information and results from

supplemental measures that provide a meaningful indication of the company s results from principal business activities prior to the consideration of how these activities are financed or the tax impacts in various jurisdictions and for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing capital or tax structures the company presents adjusted ebitda as a measure of ebitda that excludes the impact of transactions that are outside the company s normal course of business or day to day operations adjusted ebitda is used by many analysts in the oil and gas industry as one of several important analytical tools to evaluate financial performance and is a key metric in business valuations it is also considered important by

products and services specifically in composite pipe technologies pipe coating products and integrity management field services full year 2018 results were slightly better than the expectations the company communicated a year ago based on the annualized adjusted ebitda1 run rate of the fourth quarter of 2016 2018 was a pivotal year as it demonstrated that the company can deliver profitable results on its diversified base business despite having no contribution from the core pipe coating business or a large pipe coating project the company expects that its operating results in the first half of 2019 will be negatively impacted by the continued lower pipe coating activity higher costs for idle assets and large project pursuits and a very soft winter drilling and completion season in western canada the company expects revenues to sequentially improve throughout 2019 particularly in the second half of the year and to deliver improved annual operating results over 2018 this expectation reflects stable demand throughout the year for the base business particularly in north america and increased activity in pipe coating in the second half of the year from international and offshore projects 1 ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap measures and do not have standardized meanings under gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies see section 6 0 reconciliation of non gaap measures for further details and a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda the company believes that 2018 represented the bottom of the offshore global oil gas capex cycle and that this market is poised for consistent growth over the next several years the likelihood of large projects being sanctioned to replace production in the near to medium term is strengthening driven by several years of absent investment or short cycle investment prioritization in the industry now coming to an end as key reservoirs are no longer able to sustain peak production levels the increase in high decline rate shale production and geopolitical challenges which are affecting several important producing regions additionally the increased demand for greener technology will be supportive of investments in gas specifically lng the company continues to see demand growth in north america land markets and an increased level of activity in the international and offshore markets as evidenced in its current bids outstanding the company remains well positioned to capitalize on this continuing positive trend in project activity through its global footprint technology portfolio and execution history the company continued its strategic efforts to position itself as the partner of choice in the pursuit of several large projects which are characterized as greater than 100 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 the liza i ii awards representing approximately 110 million of work related to deep water development projects located offshore guyana provided further evidence that the low point in the offshore pipe coating cycle has been reached liza i and ii is a multi phase project and characteristic of the type of project planning that the company is seeing with greater frequency in an effort to reduce large project costs operators are engaging large global engineering procurement contracting epc companies who are utilizing standardized engineering approaches and selecting preferred suppliers to participate in the planning process significantly earlier than in the past this new contracting approach gives shawcor greater visibility and awareness on future possible project wins recently this same process was followed in an as yet unsanctioned offshore australia project where a conditional non binding letter of award was signed between the selected epc company and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 100 million in revenue for 2020 although the exact timing of when large projects are sanctioned is difficult to predict the company believes that there is still a strong likelihood that some of these projects will be sanctioned in 2019 and beyond because they are not directly linked to oil and gas commodity prices as they involve energy security or reservoir access considerations based on this the company believes that its diversified base business and expected higher pipe coating activity in 2019 will deliver improved operating results particularly in the second half of the year however the company has confidence to deliver stronger results in 2020 from the expected build in backlog in 2019 as confidence has increased that the investment in international projects will be sanctioned with a positive impact on the offshore pipe coating business shawcor continued its growth strategy of diversifying the base business through organic and inorganic initiatives investments in expanding the composite product offering both in operating envelope and geographic reach deployment of next generation inspection technology and capacity expansion in the automotive heat shrink market have been made in addition the company announced that it had entered into an arrangement agreement to acquire all of the shares of zcl composites inc north america s largest manufacturer and supplier of environmentally friendly fiberglass reinforced plastic underground storage tanks this inorganic investment is supported by long term fundamental drivers similar to those which support shawcor such as aging infrastructure and it leverages shawcor s material science expertise in advanced composite materials to provide customers with superior systems for both their conveyance and storage needs it further demonstrates shawcor s commitment to diversifying its portfolio and increasing its base business to provide a foundation for long term technology developments and profitable base business growth further detail on the outlook for the pipeline and pipe services segment by region and in the petrochemical and industrial segment is set out below pipeline and pipe services segment north america market demand in shawcor s north american pipeline segment businesses is closely tied to well completions and the build out of new and the repair replacement of old transmission pipeline infrastructure these activities drive the demand for small diameter pipe coating and joint protection composite pipe for gathering line applications octg pipe inspection and refurbishment and gathering line girth weld inspection it is expected that demand in north american land activity will continue in line with rig counts and wells completed particularly in the united states however the rate of growth will slow down in the first half of 2019 due to the lack of take away capacity in the permian basin and early indications that suggest a soft winter season in western canada and resume in the second half of 2019 as take away capacity in the permian is addressed through several transmission pipeline projects currently underway the increased breadth of the company s portfolio as well as the continued adoption rate of shawcor s composite pipe systems technology over traditional steel products is helping to absorb these slight headwinds in addition the company continues to experience strong demand for its pipe coating capabilities from increased activity in the gulf of mexico and larger diameter onshore transmission line projects which is improving the utilization of our u s based coating facilities pipeline and pipe services segment latin america the company continues to expect increased activity in the recently reactivated facilities in mexico and brazil related to the continued activity in the gulf of mexico and smaller offshore brazilian projects this is supported by the liza ii project that is now under contract which is expected to be executed in the company s veracruz facility and contribute positive results in the second half of 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment europe middle east africa and russia emar shawcor s emar pipeline region continues to be negatively impacted by reduced capital spending by national and international energy companies the company will continue executing work on the awarded contract to provide anti corrosion and concrete weight coatings related to an offshore qatar pipeline the company continues to pursue several large projects in the region that if won could provide significant work beyond 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment asia pacific the region s project activity will continue to be depressed due to the lack of offshore project investments the company is actively pursuing several large projects that are related to the development of gas reservoirs that could be awarded in 2019 in addition composite products have recommenced their penetration in the australian onshore market and are gaining traction in several other countries in the region as composites gain further acceptance petrochemical and industrial segment shawcor s petrochemical and industrial segment businesses continue to deliver solid revenue and operating income based on stable demand in the global automotive market and european and north american industrial markets these markets generally follow gdp activity however the segment is well positioned to capture the growing trend of electrification on automobiles with specified sealing water blocking and insulating systems along with customized application equipment for tier i assembly customers demand for wire and cable products continues to be strong and supply chain constraints for drawn wire from copper rods have eased from the third quarter of 2018 order backlog the company s order backlog consists of firm customer orders only and represents the revenue the company expects to realize on booked orders over the succeeding twelve months the company reports the twelve month billable backlog because it provides a leading indicator of significant changes in consolidated revenue the order backlog of 459 million as at december 31 2018 was above the 395 million order backlog as at september 30 2018 reflecting the inclusion of the liza ii project and other awards moving from bid to backlog in addition to the backlog the company closely monitors its bidding activity and the value of outstanding firm bids is over 1 0 billion up 160 million from last quarter due to increasing bidding activity for pipe coating in the offshore and international markets included in the firm bid is an as yet unsanctioned offshore australia project where a conditional non binding letter of award was signed between the selected epc company and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 100 million in revenue for 2020 the company is also working with customers on a number of other projects and the budgetary estimates at the end of the fourth quarter were almost 1 9 billion although the timing of these projects remains uncertain the company s bid and budgetary figures represent a diverse portfolio of opportunities to sustain and build the backlog through 2019 and beyond 2 0 consolidated information and results from

adjusted ebitda as a measure of ebitda that excludes the impact of transactions that are outside the company s normal course of business or day to day operations adjusted ebitda is used by many

in 1966 economist paul samuelson mocked that the stock market had forecast nine of the last five recessions not much has changed since then economists still disagree on what drives the boom bust business cycle in the us economy many rule of thumb recession predictors have been identified as a result at least five of these predictors are currently flashing red one of them is the us business cycle the us economy has never gone longer than a decade without a recession a milestone which is fast approaching another is the stance of the us federal reserve four of the last five episodes of fed rate rises have been followed by a recession with the latest episode already underway investors expect at least four more rate rises before december 2019 possibly there ll have to be more given us president donald trump s pro cyclical fiscal stimulus the sugar hit when the economy is already overheating term spreads are another predictor flashing red a flattening yield curve when short and long term interest rates start converging has predicted every us recession in the last 60 years another recession predictor is how much spare capacity there is in the economy the last 10 us recessions were preceded by a closing of the output gap the us output gap is now near zero employment is heading beyond full employment and while inflation and wages are moving slowly they are beginning to shift there are other forces most coming from trump which also warn of a slowing us economy the stimulus effects of his tax cuts will subside in 2019 and 2020 with no evidence that they have delivered the promised increase in sustained growth through an uptick in investment and productivity trump s trade war a tax on us businesses and consumers is dragging on growth in unpredictable ways because of cross border supply chains on current trends us gdp growth is forecast to fall by one third by 2020 according to the international monetary fund imf leaving a much smaller buffer for shocks others already forecast a us recession around 2020 including bank of america merrill lynch the economist intelligence unit and two thirds of the economists surveyed by the national association for business economists a slow down in the us economy will have significant implications for asia the imf estimates that a 1 percentage point decrease in us growth typically reduces growth in the emerging markets by 0 6 of a percentage point a more complicated story may emerge this time around the big increase in trade among asia s economies has led some to believe that asia is less reliant on the big industrial economies the opposite is true asia s intra regional trade is driven in large part by cross border production chains that are linked to demand from the major industrial economies asia s trade dependence on the united states has in fact increased not decreased according to imf analysis increased reliance on international wholesale funding has made asian banks more exposed to the process of global deleveraging hélène rey of the london business school shows that the global economy remains as influenced as ever by the stance of us monetary policy evidenced by the recent impact of fed rate rises on asia s economies the biggest concern isn t the fire it is the lack of water with which to put it out historically the us federal reserve has needed to cut interest rates by 5 percentage points to support the us economy during a downturn it currently has less than half that with which to stimulate the economy corporate and household balance sheets are similarly weak fiscal stimulus is possible trump is clearly not averse to it but any package must now be negotiated through a democratic house of representatives and a republican senate by an ideologically untethered president all have very different views on what stimulus should look like many republicans prefer none while they agree on the merits of infrastructure investment it is unlikely to come fast enough to provide the necessary short term stimulus in the absence of fiscal stimulus the us federal reserve will return to quantitative easing the purchase of securities with newly created central bank reserves to depress long term interest rates or some other form of unconventional monetary policy even this has political risks the fed s balance sheet is 20 per cent of gdp quantitative easing let alone measures like helicopter money is looked at suspiciously by many in the us congress on both the right and the left the fed may find its independence under further attack particularly if it is accused of causing the recession as trump logic will certainly try to do the only certainty is volatility particularly for asia the last round of quantitative easing saw money flood into asia in search of high yields the dollar denominated debt of emerging market firms other than banks quadrupled conversely if risks increase capital flowing back into the united states will drive the dollar up causing more stress for emerging markets already struggling with their dollar denominated debt stocks asia s economies might welcome the increase in investment from a fresh round of quantitative easing but it would also wreak havoc for their exchange rates equities and bond markets it would make macro financial management even more difficult in economies trying to reform their weak financial systems asia best build its domestic buffers now before the next storm hits adam triggs is director of research at the asian bureau of economic research crawford school of public policy the australian

while our economy continues to add jobs at a solid pace demand appears to have softened against a backdrop of greater downside risks prudence counsels a period of watchful waiting especially with no signs that inflation is picking up with balance sheet normalization now well advanced it will be appropriate to wind down asset redemptions later in the year 1 the modal outlook let me start by discussing prospects for the u s economy policymakers tend to distinguish the most likely path which i will refer to as the modal outlook from risks around that path events that are not the most likely to happen but that have some probability of happening and that if they do materialize would have a one sided effect both the modal outlook and the risks around it have important implications for monetary policy but in somewhat different ways let me first discuss the modal outlook while the economy performed very well last year i have revised down my modal outlook for this year in part reflecting some softening in the recent spending and sentiment data this softening could be a harbinger of some slowing in the underlying momentum of domestic demand in the initial estimate released last week real gross domestic product gdp rose at a 2 6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 however the latest report on retail sales showed a sharp decline analysts note that there is some reason to be skeptical of that report it is subject to revision and other data sources suggest a more muted movement although the magnitude of the drop may be revised smaller coming in the last month of the quarter that decline suggests that growth in consumer spending may be held down in the first quarter of this year surveys of consumer sentiment which may provide some additional insight into the strength of spending in the first quarter fell on net between november and january and rebounded partially in february the lengthy government shutdown likely contributed to the january decline and although recent readings are below those that prevailed for much of 2018 they are still in a range consistent with ongoing spending growth other spending indicators have also shown some slowing residential construction data have been soft for some time reflecting in part earlier increases in interest rates and homebuilders report that supply constraints on available lots shortages of skilled workers and tariffs on inputs are also contributing to the slowdown business investment registered strong gains last year including in the latest quarter but there are some indications of softening there as well the latest data on capital goods orders for example suggest some softening in equipment spending gains surveys of businesses such as the institute for supply management s purchasing managers index and similar regional indexes have generally moved lower over the past six months reversing much of the run up seen in 2017 and late 2016 the national federation of independent business s small business optimism index is also lower than its mid 2018 peak although it remains well above the levels of 2015 and much of 2016 the weaker foreign outlook also acts as a crosscurrent to the modal outlook while strong foreign growth provided tailwinds early last year foreign growth projections have been revised down repeatedly more recently 2 the slowdown of foreign growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed with growth likely running below potential for most of last year economic activity slowed noticeably in the second half of 2018 in china where policymakers have been trying to achieve a balance between restraining very elevated levels of domestic debt on the one hand and maintaining strong aggregate growth on the other the protracted trade conflict with the united states has further complicated that challenge concerns about china s slowdown are reverberating globally as was true in 2015 16 although the incidence is somewhat different while germany had appeared to be weighed down primarily by transitory factors late last year some of the weakness in industrial production now appears likely to be more persistent in part reflecting spillovers from china the euro area is also seeing slowing in some other large member economies global weakness in trade and manufacturing has also weighed on japan the slowdown in foreign demand spills over into the united states through a variety of channels although the dollar has weakened somewhat lately its earlier appreciation and slowing foreign growth contributed to a decline in exports and a fall in import prices over the second half of last year in contrast the recent step down in long term rates and easing in the dollar have lessened pressures on yields in emerging markets and provided more policy space in some cases in the united states financial markets saw substantial volatility late last year which may still be affecting sentiment from september to december of last year financial conditions tightened considerably with the stock market falling as much as 20 percent and corporate bond premiums rising this year much of that tightening has reversed the s p 500 has made up more than half of its earlier losses and corporate risk spreads have reversed much of their earlier tightening long term treasury yields rose from september through november and have since more than retraced returning to the levels of early 2018 while the dollar has edged down from the peaks reached in the fall it is about 7 percent higher than the lows seen early last year overall the softer spending data in the u s and the slowdown abroad along with earlier financial volatility are likely weighing on the modal outlook and might in turn warrant a softening in the modal path for policy risks to the outlook let me turn now to the second category of crosscurrents facing the u s economy the risks around the modal outlook policy uncertainty has been elevated recently and has been cited as an important factor in the financial volatility late last year although some of the risks have been anticipated for some time recent events have brought them into heightened focus and the accumulation of these risks could lead to some erosion in sentiment that could in turn feed into activity trade dispute escalation remains a risk the tariffs and trade disruptions that have occurred so far are estimated to have had relatively modest effects on aggregate growth and inflation although damaging disruptions have been concentrated in some sectors such as soybeans while recent reports suggest some progress the prospect of additional tariffs in the trade conflict with china or on automobiles have been cited frequently as a risk in earnings reports and reports from business contacts the recent longest ever government shutdown created hardship for many families and has increased attention on upcoming fiscal negotiations on current estimates the debt ceiling will need to be raised around the fall the bipartisan budget act which is estimated to boost gdp growth by 0 3 percentage point on average per year in 2018 and 2019 is scheduled to expire in 2020 if agreement is not reached spending levels could fall back to the sequester caps which would amount to a significant headwind there are also important downside risks abroad most immediately a no deal brexit would have adverse consequences for britain and potentially more broadly given london s role as a financial center within the euro area countries such as italy and france face domestic challenges and a hard landing in china would have spillovers through financial and trade channels employment inflation and policy in contrast to the softening in spending indicators job gains have remained strong so far job gains have averaged 240 000 per month over the past three months more than twice the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force the january unemployment rate of 4 percent is near a multidecade low the strong labor market has drawn many americans into productive work and the overall employment to population ratio for workers between the ages of 25 and 54 is now within 1 2 percentage point of its pre crisis peak many of the main measures of wages have been increasing at rates not seen on a sustained basis in almost 10 years although labor s share of overall income remains stubbornly depressed 3 nonetheless recent data on claims have shown some softening and i will be watching a broad set of labor market indicators carefully including the payrolls data for february which will be released tomorrow just as the economy is performing well on the maximum employment goal set by the congress it is also close to meeting our price stability mandate following many years of low readings the core price index for consumer purchases for the 12 months through december was up 1 9 percent 4 that reading lines up with the median summary of economic projections sep forecast from a year ago so inflation is very close to the committee s 2 percent objective and its earlier expectation even so we will need to be vigilant to ensure inflation achieves 2 percent on a sustained basis as i have observed for some time underlying trend inflation may be running slightly below the committee s 2 percent objective many statistical filtering models put underlying inflation modestly below 2 percent and some survey measures of inflation expectations are running somewhat below pre crisis levels similarly the difference between the yields on nominal and inflation indexed treasury securities is lower than it was before the crisis and that difference may provide some insight into market participants views of underlying inflation 5 the fact that estimates of underlying trend inflation remain a bit on the soft side reinforces the evidence that the phillips curve is very flat a key element of the post crisis new normal that i have noted previously 6 the responsiveness of price inflation to resource utilization at the national level has been very weak for some time this raises the possibility that the economy may have room to run as the unemployment rate has fallen to levels not seen in many decades we have heard concerns that the steeper phillips curve of the past might reassert itself perhaps in a nonlinear manner 7 but all available evidence suggests inflation expectations remain well anchored to the upside indeed the contours of today s new normal suggest we should be equally attentive to a risk of erosion in inflation expectations to the downside a range of evidence suggests that the long run neutral rate of interest the rate of interest consistent with the economy growing at its potential rate and stable inflation is very low relative to its historical levels the low long run neutral rate limits the amount of space available for cutting the federal funds rate to buffer the economy from adverse developments and is likely to increase the frequency or length of periods when the policy rate is pinned at the lower bound in turn more frequent or extended episodes when inflation is below target and policy is at the effective lower bound risk pulling down private sector inflation expectations in a self reinforcing downward spiral which could further compress the monetary policy buffer to cushion downside shocks 8 the federal open market committee fomc has made clear that the 2 percent inflation goal is symmetric 9 as the median sep forecasts have indicated a number of committee members have previously projected a policy path consistent with inflation rising somewhat above 2 percent for a time which is in line with the symmetry of the target there is a separate discussion of policies that would pre commit to make up for past misses on inflation such as temporary price level targeting which may be important in circumstances with a low long run neutral rate and more frequent effective lower bound episodes 10 i expect this will be part of our review of monetary policy strategies tools and communication practices later this year 11 our policy goal now is to preserve the progress we have made on maximum employment and target inflation core inflation last year came in around target it is heartening to see so many american workers coming back into the jobs market with rising wages our business contacts note they are currently hiring and investing in training workers who may not have been considered just a few years ago with regard to policy modest downward revisions to the baseline outlook for output and employment would call for modest downward revisions to the path for our conventional policy tool the federal funds rate helping to offset some of the weakness that would otherwise weigh on the economy moreover basic principles of risk management would suggest that the increase in downside risks warrants a modest downward revision to the modal path for policy these downside risks if realized could weigh on economic activity 12 so heightened downside risks to output and employment would argue for a softer federal funds rate path even if the modal outlook for the economy were unchanged at a time when the modal outlook appears to have softened a bit and risks appear more weighted to the downside than the upside the best way to safeguard the gains we have made on jobs and inflation is to navigate cautiously on rates risk management in an environment of a low long run neutral rate and an attenuated relationship between resource utilization and overall inflation supports this approach watchful waiting will allow us to gather more information about domestic momentum and foreign growth as well as some of the policy risks weighing on sentiment balance sheet normalization let me turn now to the second tool used by the federal reserve in recent years asset purchases recall that after reducing the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound of zero in the 2008 09 recession the fomc sought a mechanism for providing additional stimulus in order to achieve maximum employment and target inflation 13 the federal reserve purchased longer term treasury securities in an effort to push down longer term interest rates to support economic activity an approach sometimes referred to as quantitative easing it also purchased agency mortgage backed securities for the same reason as well as to provide support to the housing sector which was at the heart of the crisis although the empirical estimates vary most conclude that the asset purchase programs were successful in supporting the recovery 14 once recoveries become well established the federal reserve moves its policy settings to more normal levels our current extended recovery is no exception the federal reserve first started moving the federal funds rate to more normal values once the expansion was well established and then it started normalizing the balance sheet once normalization of the federal funds rate was well under way of course the benchmark for normalization has changed since before the financial crisis demand has grown for the fed s liabilities from a variety of sources the demand for u s currency has grown notably relative to nominal gdp the treasury department now holds large balances in its account at the fed as an important part of its cash management and foreign central banks hold larger deposits than in the past in addition the demand from commercial banks for deposits at the fed that is reserves appears to have increased substantially spurred by new liquidity regulations and their own internal liquidity management practices the largest banks hold substantial amounts of so called high quality liquid assets to protect against the risk of a sudden run on their uninsured short run liabilities as occurred during the financial crisis so it appears that the new normal size of the balance sheet is likely to remain greater relative to the size of the economy than it was before the financial crisis how much larger is still an open question for the past decade the federal reserve has operated a regime with reserves that are very abundant relative to banks demand for reserves the current framework relies on the federal reserve s interest rate on reserves to control the federal funds rate in the context of the provision of ample reserves in contrast the pre crisis framework featured a scarce supply of reserves which the federal reserve would vary on a daily basis to control the federal funds rate by closely matching the demand for reserves the fomc recently affirmed that it would continue to operate the current framework 15 this approach makes sense for a variety of reasons the current framework has been effective in providing good control of the policy rate and ensuring effective transmission to other money markets and the financial system not only is the demand for reserves likely to remain much higher than it was before the crisis but it is also likely that there will be fluctuations in reserves along with other elements of the fed s liabilities such as the deposits the treasury holds with the fed accommodating those swings with scarce reserves would require much larger daily open market operations than was the case before the crisis by remaining in a regime with ample reserves the fed is able to control short term interest rates without the need to conduct daily open market operations because there are ample reserves the federal funds rate and other short term interest rates are determined along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve as a result the system can absorb swings in the demand and supply of reserves with limited need for open market operations the alternative of pushing reserves close to the transition point between the flat and steep parts of the demand curve would likely lead to active intervention as an ongoing feature along with volatility in rates given that the committee is now operating with two instruments it is important to note that the committee clarified that it would seek to use only one tool actively at a time and that the preferred active tool would be the federal funds rate when it is above the effective lower bound i want to make it clear that we would not want our two tools to be working at cross purposes for instance we would not want the balance sheet to be shrinking at a time when the fomc thought it was appropriate to cut the federal funds rate after holding the size of the balance sheet roughly flat since mid 2014 once the normalization of the federal funds rate was deemed well under way in october 2017 the committee started to allow the size of the balance sheet to shrink in line with the pledge to hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively 16 we have made substantial progress as demonstrated by the level of reserves reserves are already down by 40 percent since their peak and are likely to be down by more than half this summer in my view asset redemptions should come to an end later in the year which would provide a sufficient buffer of reserves to meet demand and avoid volatility we have gathered information from market contacts and have surveyed banks to assess their demand for reserves 17 i would want to see a healthy cushion on top of that to avoid unnecessary volatility and ensure that the federal funds rate will be largely insulated from daily swings in factors affecting reserves with regard to the composition of the balance sheet i favor moving eventually to a portfolio of only treasury securities that is without any agency mortgage backed securities remaining it is important to do so in a way that continues to avoid market disruptions that shift will be under way naturally albeit slowly as these securities mature and are replaced by treasury securities 18 for the portion of our portfolio in treasury securities the federal reserve currently holds no treasury bills and our portfolio has a much longer weighted average maturity than the current stock of treasury securities outstanding in the market or than our pre crisis portfolio which was more heavily weighted toward short dated securities than the holdings of the public when the federal reserve system begins once again purchasing treasury securities we will need to decide what maturities to purchase given how far out of step the system s current portfolio is from common benchmarks however it might make sense to weight those purchases more heavily toward treasury bills and other shorter dated treasury securities for a time further into the future there may be good reasons to shift toward greater holdings of shorter term securities to provide greater flexibility however i want to emphasize that i do not expect this issue to be addressed for some time conclusion the most likely path for the economy appears to have softened against a backdrop of greater downside risks our goal now is to safeguard the progress we have made on full employment and target inflation prudence counsels a period of watchful waiting and with balance sheet normalization now well advanced it will soon be time to wind down our asset redemptions references ball laurence joseph gagnon patrick honohan and signe krogstrup 2016 what else can central banks do pdf geneva reports

reading time 12 minutes the impression most casual observers receive today from cuba is that since raúl castro assumed power in 2006 the country has been going through a dramatic transition to a market economy but while what the younger castro brother has called structural reforms are important steps toward a market under cuba s revolutionary government they are a far cry from the radical policies that have been common throughout latin america and lag far behind the transformations in china and vietnam below is a summary of the seven principal structural reforms under way in cuba including an assessment of their advances obstacles and economic social effects to determine how far the reforms have moved and whether they are working or not 1 1 updating the existing economic model according to the 2011 cuban communist party congress outline for the reforms the lineamientos the goal is not to substantially transform the actual model but to update it keeping the hegemony of state central planning and property over the market and non state property the agreements set out in the congress did not specify the role of the state and non state sectors and left serious gaps in the roadmap it took more than two years for the cuban government to elaborate a preliminary concept of the updating that concept allowed for the expansion of the market and non state property but in an economy largely still driven and determined by state planning and state agencies a model that historically including in cuba has proven to be inefficient 2 distribution of idle state land in 2009 the cuban government announced a plan under which it retains ownership over unused land but allows farmers under usufruct to cultivate it and keep what they produce either for themselves or to sell two laws from 2008 and 2012 regulate the process the second more flexible law expanded the size of the plot and allowed the building of homes and barns as well as the planting of forests and orchards formerly banned but the land is granted only under a 10 year contract at the end of that period the state can either reassume control of the land reimbursing the farmers investment based on its assessment or renew the contract if the owner of the lease dies his relatives working the plot can also inherit the contract during the contract period farmers have access to state micro credit and can open bank accounts and sell produce to tourism entities such as hotels and restaurants in 2013 the government ended the practice of acopio in three out of 15 provinces havana mayabeque and artemisa which required that 70 percent of the harvest must be sold to the state at prices set by the government below the market price and in 2014 the state created the first wholesale market for agricultural supplies since 2009 about 3 7 million acres of idle state land have been distributed to 174 275 of these farmer leaseholders 97 percent of whom are individuals about 77 percent of the leaseholders however lack experience in agriculture despite the gains the 2012 law governing these farms remains restrictive the state can terminate or not renew a contract if the farmer fails to comply with his or her obligations including acopio or for reasons of public or social interest in addition the farmer is now required to be tied to a state controlled cooperative or a state farm both notoriously inefficient to receive inputs or services and to market his her produce the complex and cumbersome regulations also place obstacles to hiring non family workers and limit investment to 0 67 percent of the size of the plot restrictions justified as a means of preventing the concentration of wealth state microcredit is also insufficient in contrast the successful agricultural reforms in china and vietnam place no limits on farmers contracts land use is granted for indefinite periods and the farmers decide what to plant and where to sell it at market prices 3 dismissal of unneeded state employees and expansion of non state jobs about 1 8 million workers are officially estimated as unnecessary or 36 percent of the total labor force according to my estimates cuba s low open officially acknowledged unemployment rate in 2008 it was 1 6 percent one of the lowest in the world was accomplished by creating hidden unemployment with the government and state firms retaining unnecessary employees but at the cost of declining labor productivity and wages in 2011 the government acknowledged the economy s labor redundancy and announced a plan to dismiss surplus state employees and expand the non state sector including self employment and non agricultural production and service cooperatives to absorb the laid off workers here some definitions are in order the self employed or cuentapropistas own their tiny businesses in the cooperatives coops the state maintains ownership of the premise and rents it to coop members who manage the business sell their products services at market prices and keep the profits self employed individuals and coops can sell lease and buy to or from state entities hire non family employees open bank accounts receive state microcredit and buy inputs in the emerging wholesale market since last june all restaurant food service and personal service establishments are to be managed by non state entities there are restrictive rules defining and governing both types of enterprises the types of self employment allowed by the new rules are quite specific and cover mostly unskilled jobs only a few of the officially sanctioned categories could qualify as skilled jobs coops must go through four bureaucratic steps to win approval and the final decision is left to the council of state an executive office chaired by raúl state inspectors monitor businesses compliance with health and other regulations impose fines for alleged violations in hygiene or inputs and can close self employed micro businesses taxes are many and heavy including a labor tax that rises in tandem with the number of employees hired again arguably to avoid wealth concentration but in effect punishing those who create more non state jobs there are also severe constraints to growth for the self employed and coop members as in the farming sector micro credit and inputs are insufficient and wholesale markets are limited and in an experimental stage the erratic and inconsistent history of government policies in the sector has also created uncertainty in recent years the state has shut down food or service stands on household porches in havana banned the sale of imported products and shut down 3d cinemas the bureaucracy is also a barrier often because of conflict of interest when cuentapropistas compete with state enterprises partially as a result of these factors one fifth of the self employed enterprises fail despite the barriers and limits to growth state employment declined from 82 percent to 75 percent of the labor force from 2006 to 2012 though below the target originally set and non state employment grew proportionally at the end of 2012 365 000 state employees had been dismissed only one fifth of the official 2015 target the number of self employed tripled from 2006 to 2014 but after subtracting those existing before the reforms the net was only 17 percent of the 2015 goal of 1 8 million by last may 498 coops had been authorized but only half were operating to meet the government s goals the number of self employed must quadruple in the next 18 months 4 wages social services and rationing the 2008 salary reform increased the nominal wage and allowed moonlighting and payment based on productivity it also removed the previous salary cap and legalized bonuses in hard currency the effect of the reform is unknown but the average wage adjusted for inflation in 2013 was a quarter of its level in 1989 at the same time the government has reduced general public benefits to cut its fiscal deficit from 2007 to 2008 the cost of social services peaked at 55 percent of the budget and 37 percent of gdp the highest in latin america education and health care are universal and free workers did not contribute to pensions the retirement age was one of the lowest in the region at 55 for women and 60 for men although cuba enjoys the region s second highest life expectancy rationed goods are sold below cost and until the recent reforms meals in workers cafeterias were subsidized in 2009 raúl acknowledged the financial unsustainability of social services subordinating them to available fiscal resources and reducing them something not done even during the severe crisis of the 1990s at the same time the government shuttered thousands of public services deemed inefficient also dismissing 16 percent of health care personnel university enrollment in humanities dwindled while it increased in natural sciences and mathematics and entry to universities was tightened finally the retirement age was raised by five years for both sexes and workers were required to contribute to pensions the government also increased public utility rates and prices at hard currency state shops as a result of this belt tightening social expenditures fell from 55 percent of the budget in 2007 to 51 percent in 2013 while relative to gdp they declined from 37 percent to 27 percent in the same period future reductions however confront two realities that will limit how far they can go first is the inevitable ballooning of the long term deficit to care for the country s aging population the second largest proportionally in the region second is the need to maintain a safety net for the most needy although rationing quotas are lean and only cover basic food needs for seven to ten days a month they are vital for lower income individuals who don t receive remittances from abroad cuban economists have recommended replacing rationing with a social welfare system targeting those who are most at risk raúl accepted this advice and removed several ration items now sold in the market at prices three to four times higher 5 housing purchase and sale in 1960 the government ended house sales and mortgages prevented the construction of private housing and stipulated that residents pay rent to the state whereupon after 20 years they become homeowners as a result 95 percent of the population are homeowners today but the state s construction of housing never met population growth this combined with the deterioration and destruction of existing stock due to lack of maintenance and hurricanes has left a housing deficit of between 600 000 to one million units a 2011 reform authorized the buying and selling of houses at market prices to cubans and permanent non cuban residents as well as ownership of a second home for recreation purposes and granted the right to relatives of cubans who had permanently left the island to inherit the house after more than half a century in which the housing market had been frozen dwellings now may be sold to change residency or raise capital about 90 percent of all state microcredit is geared to build or repair housing between 2011 and 2013 133 000 dwellings were sold in addition to 168 500 donated homes probably due to the legalization of previous illegal sales nevertheless as with all elements of the reform process there are snags and inefficiencies buying a house requires registering the property in the state real estate registry but only 17 percent of owners have done so the permission to build a dwelling demands procedures at four state agencies that take about 132 days to complete corruption bribery and tax fraud are common the law prohibits non resident foreigners including cubans who have emigrated from purchasing property limiting the market to local residents for whom a cheap house around 5 000 can cost the equivalent of 21 years of the average cuban annual income of 236 as a result since the reform sales have amounted to only 3 6 percent of the housing stock of 3 7 million 6 foreign investment one of the greatest drags on cuba s economic growth is the low level of domestic investment which stands at half the regional average according to the cuban government s own data jump starting the economy will require between 2 billion and 2 5 billion annually in june the government issued a long anticipated update to its 1995 regulations governing foreign investment the law extends foreign investment to all sectors except health care education and armed forces and exempts foreign investors from personal income tax labor tax and taxes on select imports new investors are also granted a grace period of eight years before paying the country s tax on profits and a one year postponement of sales tax obligations investors can open accounts in convertible currency in foreign banks as well as directly import and export decisions on new investment are guaranteed to take no more than 60 days under the law cuban legal persons presumably cuban businesses are permitted to be investors which can potentially include cubans living abroad finally the law offers guarantees to foreign investors including compensation in case of expropriation one of the intended draws for this much needed investment is the special development zone in the port of mariel zona especial de desarrollo mariel again however there are some significant drawbacks the new law maintains the requirement that cuban workers must be hired by a state agency hence it prohibits investors from directly hiring and firing employees and requires companies to submit labor disputes to a state agency for resolution in the same vein the law maintains the system whereby investors pay salaries in hard currency to the cuban government which in turn pays a fraction of the salary in pesos to the workers it also prohibits investment by cuban individuals including the self employed foreign investment can be expropriated for reasons of public utility or social interest and in several cases conflict resolution is left to local courts instead of the international court of arbitration as of today no new foreign direct investment projects have been approved 7 unification of the dual currency since 1995 there have been two currencies in circulation in cuba the national peso cup and the convertible peso cuc neither is traded in the world market and the cuc is overvalued the official exchange rate for the population is 25 cup for one cuc but in the state enterprise sector the cup is equal to the cuc such monetary duality created serious distortions for instance workers are paid their salary in cup but part of their expenses is paid in cuc currency duality makes it impossible to assess and compare business efficiency export profitability and competitiveness in the global economy unifying the two currencies is essential but while this will bring benefits in the long run it will be very complex and will have to proceed in two stages first in the state enterprise sector and then in the population in the former the cuc has been gradually devalued since 2012 for select cooperatives and companies last march the government announced the broad outlines of a plan for monetary unification in the enterprise sector according to the plan the cuc will be devalued and disappear while the cup will appreciate and become the future currency a zero day will start the process and an index of reform of wholesale prices will be set to calculate the corresponding retail prices and revalue all accounting prices in cup as well as inventories and investments the law ensures the value of people s bank savings the legal norm for unification is extremely complex the government has yet to unveil the timetable and the zero day has not been set the price index to revalue the cup and the date to eliminate the cuc in the enterprise sector are similarly unknown cuban economist pavel vidal has predicted that the process will begin in january 2015 at a rate of 10 cup for one cuc although unification for the population will be much later anticipating this cubans have already started changing cuc for cup to the point that some state exchange agencies have run out of cup and had to temporarily close how are we doing so far it is difficult to assess the impact of the reforms a task made harder by the lack of reliable statistical series published by the government at a macro level the reforms have failed to generate the economic growth the country needs official growth targets since 2009 have not been met and economic growth has been among the lowest in the region cuba s annual average rate of 1 7 percent from 2009 to 2014 suggests that the reforms have not helped to boost economic growth even these relatively paltry economic growth rates have been masked by the island economy s dependence on venezuela the oil rich bolivarian state accounts for 43 percent of cuban trade supplies 60 percent of its oil needs and is the leading direct investor i estimate the combined value of the whole economic relationship with venezuela at about 13 billion tantamount to 21 percent of cuban gdp however as the serious economic and political problems mount in venezuela negative economic growth double digit inflation declining oil production and political instability cuba s deep ties to venezuela look increasingly risky at the same time reforms in the agricultural sector while important have failed to fill gaps in production a year after the 2009 agricultural reforms agricultural output fell by 5 percent and grew 0 5 percent in 2012 but against a goal of 2 2 percent the preliminary estimate for 2013 is 2 6 percent growth in the sector but the production index in 2013 was below the 2005 level except in three crops rice corn and beans part of the early growth came from the non state sector which expanded in 2011 and 2012 in terms of cultivated land and agricultural production while state land and output shrank in both indicators however the opposite was true in 2013 when non state agricultural production remained stagnant or with little growth efforts to reduce public sector spending have also had adverse social consequences cuts in health care services such as the closure of hospitals and clinics the reduction of doctors diagnostic tests and other procedures and the shutdown of subsidized workers cafeterias have reduced access to social services removal of goods from rationing and their sale at much higher market prices as well as increases in public utility tariffs and hard currency shops prices have affected consumption and efforts to streamline public sector employment although missing the targets have pushed up the open unemployment rate from 1 6 percent to 3 4 percent of the labor force from 2008 to 2013 still the second lowest in the region but high by cuban standards at the same time real wages and real pensions shrank by 73 percent and 50 percent respectively from 1989 to 2013 the number of homes built fell by 77 percent from 2006 to 2013 there are 480 000 elderly cubans 60 years or older who are considered to be in need of services but only 15 825 spaces for the elderly are available in nursing homes and hospitals confronting an expanding vulnerable population raúl has promised that nobody will remain unprotected but between 2006 and 2012 the number of beneficiaries of social assistance relative to the total population decreased from 5 3 percent to 1 5 percent and the budget expenditure in social assistance went from 2 2 percent to 0 4 percent in 2011 the party congress ordered the government to end assistance to those individuals who are already supported by relatives a measure that ignores the widespread level of need in cuba on the whole the structural reforms undertaken by raúl have been generally positive and the most important to date under the cuban revolution they have advanced much further than previous reform attempts and are clearly oriented toward the market but suffocating state regulations obstacles and taxes have created disincentives and impeded the progress necessary to achieve substantial effects raúl has declared that the reforms are quite complex must be tested by experiment and should not be hurried so as to avoid costly error his motto is slowly but without pause but time and age raúl has promised to retire in 2018 at the age of 86 conspire against such an attitude updating the model as the government is attempting to do while retaining central planning and the predominance of state property over the market and non state property has not succeeded in cuba nor has it succeeded anywhere else the reform processes in china and vietnam in contrast were faster and ultimately more successful in increasing economic growth and social welfare while keeping the governing party in power cuban leaders argue that replicating the sino vietnamese model isn t feasible due to significant differences with those countries nevertheless the lack of substantial economic results from the reforms and the risks to the island s most vulnerable populations suggest this argument should be reexamined accelerating and deepening the market oriented reforms will not only improve cubans standard of living but give the ongoing reform process a much needed sense of legitimacy

amsterdam pharm presents its preliminary unaudited financial report for the full year ended 31 december 2018 the company will hold a conference call at 13 00 cet 07 00 esttoday dial in details can be found on page 11of this report chief executive officer sijmen de vries said throughout 2018 as for 2017 we continue to see consistent growth in the numbers of patients benefitting from ruconest in acute attacks of hereditary angioedema hae the initial significant surge in growth was caused by patients starting ruconest therapy after we had providedunrestrictedemergency treatments free of charge to cope with the supply shortages of competitor plasma c1 inhibitor products we retained many of these patients and added newpatients throughout the year the increasing sales from our growing patient base resulted in pharming s first year of net profit despite intense competitive pressure resulting from recent product launches it also enabled us to increase investment to expand our pipeline embarking on ambitious development plans for improved delivery methods for ruconest in hae and for new larger indications we also continued to advance our existing pipeline programs for pompe disease and fabry s disease we are confident that with our increasing patient reach and advancing pipeline we will to continue to deliver significant value to all our stakeholders chief executive officer s commentary 2018 was an exciting year for pharming we built on the strong foundations of the successful re launch of ruconest in the usa in 2017 continuing impressive product sales growth from 88 7 million in 2017 to 134 3 million in 2018 an increase of 51 as well as strong growth in the usa we continued to develop ruconest in all key markets in europe direct sales grew well during the year particularly in the major markets of western europe resulting in strong gains in france and the uk and continued growth in germany austria and the netherlands first year of net profits as result of the steady sales growth the company was profitable at the net level in every quarter and for the year as a whole total net profit for the year ended at 25 0 million representing a net margin of 19 and well ahead of analysts forecasts operating profit for the year i e ebit before a one off small non cash correction almost doubled to 40 6 million 2017 21 9 million on the same basis representing an improved operating margin of 30 2017 24 this was achieved despite significant investments in providing free of charge emergency support to patients during the stock outages of competitors at the start of the year as a result of the continued sales growth in the usa we achieved the sales level required to trigger the first us 20 million milestone payment due to bausch health companies inc formerly valeant pharmaceuticals international inc which was duly made earlier this week if sales growth continues at or near the current level the remaining us 45 million milestones will also be triggered in this or future years as a result we have prudently made a non cash provision for additional fair value of the contingent consideration in the balance sheet and a corresponding charge to the profit and loss account of 21 2 million 25 0 million in addition the increasing profitability of pharming means that we are likely to be able to use all of our accumulated net operating tax losses and so we have increased the deferred tax asset which recognises these by a net amount of 25 6 million 2017 9 4 million being mainly the tax effect of the total accumulated losses to date in the netherlands these two provisions reflect our strong confidence in the performance of our us and eu commercial teams and patients increasing confidence in the use of ruconest as their therapy of choice to treat attacks of hae clear product differentiation the hae market remains dynamic and patient choice continues to increase as new products enter the market for prophylaxis ruconest has a unique potential competitive advantage in that it is currently the only product with the future potential to be approved for both prophylaxis and treatment of attacks of hae furthermore in order to increase the convenience of ruconest for patients we are developing new forms of ruconest with new routes of administration to address both acute attacks and prophylaxis of hae such as painless intradermal sub cutaneous and intramuscular dosage forms with a new ready mixed liquid vial investing in sustainable long term growth at the end of 2017 we explained our strategy for sales growth in hae based on creating an optimized sales infrastructure for our needs during 2018 we have been able to develop this strategy further to add programs for new routes of administration for ruconest and preparation for expansion of rhc1inh into other larger indications specifically pre eclampsia and acute kidney injury we also continued preparation of a clinical trial program for a glucosidase for pompe disease this enhanced strategy and developing pipeline provides pharming with excellent potential to deliver strong sustainable growth for the long term in these very large areas of unmet medical needs none of these achievements and development programs would be possible without the support expertise and hard work of all our employees i would like to take this opportunity once again to thank all pharming employees as well as all of our investors partners and debt providers for their support and commitment throughout 2018 which enabled us to execute on the commercial development of the company to create a platform for continued growth i look forward with confidence to continuing the upward trajectory of pharming in 2019 with sales increasing further new exciting pipeline projects and new

the briefing was intended to inform shareholders potential investors and other interested parties about pharming s current and planned activities in the areas of the capital markets day included presentations from key opinion leaders in hae and pre eclampsia professor marc riedl professor of medicine at the university of california san diego clinical director of the us haea angioedema center and a world expert on the diagnosis treatment and etiology of hereditary angioedema and professor gustaaf dekker of the school of obstetrics and gynaecology at the university of adelaide and a world expert on the etiology and treatment of pre eclampsia made presentations of the potential value of c1 esterase inhibitor in these conditions in january the u s food and drug administration fda accepted for review pharming s supplemental biologics license application sbla for ruconest for routine prophylaxis to prevent attacks in adult and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema hae the fda indicated that the sbla was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and set an action date of september 21 2018 for routine prophylaxis to prevent attacks in adult and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema hae the fda indicated that the sbla was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and set an action date of in september the company received a complete response letter crl regarding the sbla for ruconest unfortunately as a result of the limited size of the phase ii studies and the limited duration of the treatment periods the statistical hurdle for a final review question on a small subgroup of patients could not be achieved as part of pharming s continued commitment to hae patients the company is developing new forms of ruconest with new routes of administration to increase convenience and these programs will address the review question as part of new prophylaxis and acute studies unfortunately as a result of the limited size of the phase ii studies and the limited duration of the treatment periods the statistical hurdle for a final review question on a small subgroup of patients could not be achieved as part of pharming s continued commitment to hae patients the company is developing new forms of ruconest with new routes of administration to increase convenience and these programs will address the review question as part of new prophylaxis and acute studies in october pharming announced positive results from a phase ii investigator initiated study of ruconest in a double blind placebo controlled clinical trial in patients at risk of nephropathy resulting from contrast enhanced examinations the study was led by dr michael osthoff at the university hospital basel basel switzerland the positive results were especially clear in the sub group of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions such as stent insertions the intent to treat analysis in this group showed that patients on ruconest had a median percentage change in peak urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin within 48 hours the primary endpoint for the study and a generally recognized early marker of acute renal injury of 11 3 in the ruconest arm and 205 2 in the placebo arm p 0 001 the overall assessment of the study also showed trends that patients undergoing more invasive interventions and procedures requiring higher volumes of contrast medium experienced a stronger benefit from the ruconest treatment this data therefore supports additional clinical investigations for the use of rhc1inh in this new indication where there is significant unmet medical need and forms the basis for a follow on study that is currently being designed in december pharming announced the presentation of results from an investigator initiated real world observational study of therapies in acute attacks of hae the study examined and compared re dosing rates inter alia for human c1 esterase inhibitor c1inh in recombinant and plasma forms to icatibant in seven individual patients at risk of hae attacks a total of 69 attacks were recorded the study was led by professor dr marcus magerl of the department of dermatology and allergy at the charité universitätsmedizin berlin berlin germany the main outcome of the study was that treatment with c1inh treatments requires significantly less re dosing than icatibant to resolve hae attacks the full results of the study will be published by the investigators in due course financial highlights as part of the valeant transaction in december 2016 the company raised 104 million in new funding through a combination of a rights issue a new senior loan and both ordinary and amortizing convertible bond issues the company took the decision early in 2017 to refinance these bonds which also meant refinancing the senior debt facility as well this refinance was completed in may 2017 with orbimed advisors on slightly better cash terms for the company than the instruments it replaced in early 2018 we were able to eliminate almost all of the remaining warrants and convertibles so that at the year end 2018 our balance sheet and shareholding are clear of these complicating factors this has also reduced the damaging effects of ifrs fair value adjustments relating to those warrants and convertibles which were a big feature of the 2017 financial statements the company raised 104 million in new

also reduced the damaging effects of ifrs fair value adjustments relating to those warrants and convertibles which were a big feature of the 2017 financial statements these exercises together with the exercise of employee options during the first open period for many quarters resulted in a balance sheet which has only one debt facility the us 100 million loan from orbimed advisors repayments of this debt facility began in september 2018 despite repayments of in total us 16 7 million of the debt in the third and fourth quarters cash increased during the year by over 21 5 million to 81 5 million from 60 0 million at the end of 2017 restatement of prior year following a reassessment of the adjustments made at the end of 2017 under ifrs we have decided to reclassify some charges and capital items which gives a more accurate picture of the redemption of the ordinary convertible bonds and exercise of related warrants this has resulted in a net change to the net result for 2017 from an 80 0 million loss to a 76 2 million loss and a restatement of the year end equity position from 18 8 million to 16 1 million with the balance 0 9 million shown in loans and borrowings in

reasons for this increase were the increased sales in the us and eu operating costs operating costs increased to 75 0 million in 2018 net of grant income 2017 55 3 million on the same basis this increase was substantially due to the added cost of clinical research activities relating to the new indications and forms of ruconest as well as the development cost write back referred to above there were small increases in marketing and sales activities both in the us and in europe mainly in france and the united kingdom and in general and administrative costs marketing and sales costs of 34 5 million 2017 31 4 million reflect pharming s additional new full direct commercialization activities in the us and in france and the united kingdom in europe which were increased slightly during the year as a result of additional sales representatives in the usa r d costs within these figures increased from 18 7 million in 2017 to 28 9 million in 2018 the increased costs mainly relate to developing the new versions of ruconest preparing for the clinical studies of rhc1inh in pre eclampsia and acute kidney injury and continuing work on the preparation and production of a glucosidase for pompe disease and a galactosidase for fabry disease using pharming s proprietary technology platform general and administrative costs increased to 12 2 million 2017 6 0 million the increase is mainly related to the addition of senior management in the eu and us costs incurred in connection with management of a more internationally active company operating result operating results improved very strongly to a profit of 38 0 million in 2018 from 21 9 million in 2017 an increase of 73 in spite of considerable increases in marketing and sales and r d activity mainly due to the effect of strong sales growth and efficient production of ruconest in major markets the basic underlying adjusted operating result was 40 6 million but this was reduced by a one off write back of previously capitalised development costs of 2 6 million relating to a superseded version of the small vial now under development operating costs increased significantly reflecting the increased activity preparing for new clinical studies for pre eclampsia and acute kidney injury as well as development work on new forms of ruconest including the concentrated liquid vial format and intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of administration financial income and expenses the 2018 net loss on financial income and expenses was 37 1 million compared with a loss of 107 6 million a year earlier this is mainly due to two items i the interest on loans and borrowings and non cash adjustments thereto totalling approximately 14 3 million and ii the increase in the provision for contingent consideration i e the milestones due to bausch health companies inc upon reaching certain sales targets of 21 2 million a loss was also recorded on the change of value of the loans and borrowings as a result of exchange rates during the year taxation as a result of the growth in sales it is now probable that the company will be able to use all its remaining net operating tax losses from previous years going forward the board of management has therefore elected to report an increase in the deferred tax asset in accordance with ifrs reflecting the timing differences between the tax value of those losses and the time when they can be exercised this has led to another credit to the income tax charge i e a positive movement of 24 1 million in 2018 2017 9 4 million net result for the first time in its history pharming group reported net profits in 2018 the net result of a profit of 25 0 million represented a reversal of the loss of 76 2 million in 2017 the main point of difference was the very large adjustments to profit required in 2017 in connection with the amortizing bonds and their subsequent refinance together with a significant adjustment to fair value of derivative financial liabilities stemming from the large share price rise during 2017 the elimination of these instruments has resulted in simplification of the capitalization table which has led to much smaller adjustments relating to fair value changes during 2018 together with a stronger operating result from larger sales this has enabled the company to reach net profitability which we believe will be sustainable in future periods inventories inventories reduced slightly from 18 3 million in december 2017 to 17 3 million in december 2018 largely due to the increase in sales above the effect of movement of inventory from lower value raw materials to higher value drug product this level of inventory should enable us to meet the naturally improving sales level especially in the us and in europe cash and cash equivalents the cash position including restricted cash increased from 60 0 million at year end 2017 to 81 5 million at year end 2018 this was mainly due to the strong sales performance of ruconest especially in the third and fourth quarters and occurred despite considerable increases in marketing and r d activities and the repayment of over 14 5 million 16 7 million of the orbimed loan facility cash generation has been strong across all four quarters of 2018 as sales revenues grew and as faster credit collection was achieved the company s current pattern of sales growth together with the strong cash generation and cash balance and the tight control over costs going forward forms the basis of the board of management s view that pharming group should be accounted for as a going concern as the company s sales are largely in us dollars and the company s debt is largely in us dollars a natural hedge exists which means that any decline in the us dollar exchange rate over the year to reduce sales reported in euros has a balancing effect of reducing the size of the debt liability when reported in euros and vice versa these movements had a total cash effect of a gain of 2 9 million 2017 loss of 1 1 million other financial liabilities the strong sales performance in 2018 has led the board of management to increase the book value of the contingent consideration from 28 3 million in 2017 to 49 5 million us 56 6 million in 2018 this is essentially a provision for potential future costs specifically the remaining sales milestone payments to valeant of contingent liabilities taken on in the context of the reacquisition of the commercial rights for ruconest in north america in december 2016 this is a strong expression of confidence in the sales performance in the usa for ruconest which we believe will continue for the time being despite increased competition in the hae marketplace as the first milestone amount was due to be paid in the first quarter of 2019 the amount of this payment 20 0 million or 17 5 million is shown in the current liabilities section of the balance sheet as at 31 december 2018 with the remainder shown under long term liabilities release of part of this provision will have the effect of negating the effect of the milestone payment on the company s income statement in the first quarter 2019 deferred tax assets at the same time because we believe that we will continue to generate positive net quarterly results and thus taxable profits in 2019 and beyond we have recorded an increase in the deferred tax asset to 35 1 million 2017 9 4 million in respect of net operating losses which we expect to be able to use in future periods the net effect of this change is an increase in the net result of 24 1 million after many years of operating losses this is a similar strong statement in support of our belief in the underlying sustainable performance of the company equity the equity position changed from 16 1 million in december 2017 to 61 8 million in december 2018 mainly due to the changes in the net result achieved by the company the equity increases from conversion or redemption of options warrants and bonds this represents an increase of 284 performance of pharming shares during 2018 the pharming stock price fluctuated around an average price of 1 15 per share the year end price was 0 76 2017 1 13 with a high of 1 57 in both january and june 2017 and a low of 0 68 in december 2018 the closing number of shares as at the reporting date was 621 501 238 2016 579 014 891 new issues of

options as at the date of this report the fully diluted number of shares is 663 472 724 and the number of shares in issue is 622 002 770 outlook 2019 for the remainder of 2019 the company expects continued growth in revenues from sales of ruconest mainly driven by the us and western europe operations operations continued achievement of positive net earnings during the year continued investment in the expansion of production of ruconest in order to meet the growing demand for ruconest internationally investment in further clinical trial programs for ruconest with low volume concentrated liquid intramuscular and subcutaneous versions of ruconest for both acute treatment and prophylaxis of hae as well as research into other more convenient routes of administration investment in clinical trials to explore pre eclampsia and acute kidney injury for ruconest rhc1inh investment in development of the new pipeline programs in pompe disease and fabry s disease and other new development opportunities and assets as these occur increasing marketing activity where this can be profitable for pharming such as opening new countries for ruconest we will continue to support all our teams and marketing partners in order to enable the maximization of the sales and distribution potential of ruconest for patients in all territories as we continue to believe that ruconest

on monday the benchmark shanghai composite index rose above the 3 000 point level for the first time since last june taking its gains since the beginning of this year to a whopping 24 per cent satisfying the popular definition of a bull market a 20 per cent rally from a recent low china s other main stock indices are also in bull market territory with the chinext gauge of small caps and technology shares up a staggering 38 per cent since the end of january in corporate debt markets the spread or risk premium on chinese high yield bonds has plunged 135 basis points this year one of the sharpest declines among the leading emerging markets according to data produced by jpmorgan the yuan meanwhile has risen to its strongest level versus the us dollar since last july this year s strong gains in chinese assets have been part of a broader rally the msci all country world index a gauge of stocks in developed and developing economies has increased more than 10 per cent this year while the s p 500 index is on the verge of re entering a bull market however mainland listed stocks which were the world s worst performing major equity market last year have experienced the sharpest rebound while the rally stems from a confluence of factors progress in us china trade negotiations the federal reserve s decision to put its interest rate hiking campaign on hold beijing s more forceful fiscal stimulus measures and attractive equity valuations in china the most significant catalyst has been the actions of american president donald trump it was the adverse effects of trump s trade offensive on us business and consumer confidence coupled with the broader tariff induced slowdown in the global economy that led to the fed s crucial decision in late january to take a patient approach to further changes in rates hints from fed policymakers just after christmas that a dovish tilt was forthcoming were enough to trigger a sharp rally across global markets in early january the yuan enjoyed its best week against the dollar since 2005 while the shanghai composite was up nearly 5 per cent by the end of the month having dropped nearly 8 per cent in the last six weeks of 2018 yet the rally in chinese assets really took off after trump stated on february 12 that he was considering extending a march 1 deadline for imposing new tariffs on us 200 billion of chinese imports in the fortnight leading up to the president s decision on february 24 to let the deadline slide the shanghai composite jumped a further 11 6 per cent as markets seized on trump s new found willingness to reach an accord as soon as this month resisting pressure from trade hawks to maintain tariffs as leverage to extract concessions from beijing on intellectual property protection and structural reforms a surge in asset prices that initially began as a reaction to a dovish fed morphed into a rally driven by an increasingly dovish trump the political calculations of america s mercurial president who desperately needs a big win as pressure on him mounts the probe into links between his presidential campaign team and russia is about to reach its conclusion and the economic costs of the trade war become apparent are now the most important determinant of market sentiment trump s eagerness to reach a trade agreement not only stems from his fixation with the us stock market this year s sharp rally has emboldened the president to cut a deal particularly after the dramatic sell off at the end of last year but is also attributable to his increased sensitivity to the regions of america s economy that have been most negatively affected by his protectionist policies and what is more which voted for trump in the 2016 election in an insightful paper published by four prominent us based economists earlier this week the authors which include pinelopi goldberg the world bank s chief economist found that retaliatory tariffs imposed by china and several other of america s trading partners have hit trump supporters the hardest partly because of steep duties on us soybean imports workers in very republican counties bore the brunt of the costs of the trade war in part because retaliations disproportionately targeted agricultural sectors the paper notes still while the fed has won plaudits for its dovish shift trump is finding it much more difficult to strike a dovish tone on china not only are both parties in the us congress urging the president to hang tough in negotiations with beijing there are concerns even in markets that a hasty and weak agreement would fall apart quickly souring sino us relations further and putting markets under renewed strain this would not be the first time that a trump driven rally ends in tears investors in china s surging stock market would do well to bear this in mind source south china morning post

things aren t going to plan in trump s tariff world with us trade data overnight showing the trade deficit blew out to a 10 year high in 2018 whether this hardens the president s attitude to a structural deal with the china trade talks or he chooses a quick win is hard to say but with an election to fight next year you can almost hear the clanking as the white house swings its heavy artillery in the direction of the other perceived trading bloc culprits having dealt with the north american free trade agreement nafta washington s sights may well turn to japan and europe the us is already in preliminary trade talks with japan a fact lost among the china noise the euro zone is the prize though with the us running an eye watering usd169 3 billion deficit in 2018 according to the us census bureau with a slowing global economy and a potentially ugly economic hit from brexit the euro zone can ill afford a trade stand off with washington and with interest rates at 0 the european central bank is short of monetary policy wiggle room one thing is for sure long after the us china trade deal is put to bed we will not have heard the last of the word tariff in 2019 in other news the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd downgraded world growth and the bank of canada boc released the doves instead of the hounds the boc held rates steady overnight but joined other central banks two step line dance u turning on previously hawkish rhetoric wall street wilted under the barrage of news with the s p falling 0 65 the dow jones down 0 51 and the nasdaq taking a 0 95 hit the s p has traced out multiple daily highs in 2019 at the five month resistance at 2 820 00 implying that trade hopes and central bank dovishness may have run their course for now the small cap russel 2000 fell by over 2 on wall street to 1 535 00 overnight its biggest one day fall in 2019 it too has tested and failed at longer term technical resistance at 1 600 00 asia s data highlight today is the australian trade balance which was due at 0830 singapore time with an expected surplus of aud 2 90 billion given the sell off in australian dollars aud following yesterday s gdp miss we can expect more fireworks this morning when it is released globally the highlight will undoubtedly be the european central bank ecb rate decision where we expect the ecb to hold at 0 00 much attention will be on the ecb president draghi s press conference afterwards and in particular how dovish or not the ecb has become fx the dollar reigned supreme overnight as the waves of negative headlines sapped investor confidence leading to haven buying of the greenback the aud collapsed following yesterday s poor australian gdp number now sitting at 0 7030 this morning just above support at 0 7000 traders likely have itchy trigger fingers today a poor trade balance reading could see support tested strongly the usd cad rose 100 points to 1 3450 overnight following the boc s dovish statement with a string of other poor data a political crisis and an impending election it is hard to see the canadian dollar finding too many friends in the near term however it s likely the us dollar will remain firm in asia against the regional currencies equities regional stock markets will likely endure a tough start to the day following the dismal showing overnight by wall street world growth and tariff fears are likely to be on investors lips and will cap rallies in stocks during the asian session gold gold held its important 1 280 00 support overnight but the bounce was anaemic being capped at 1 290 00 an ounce for now gold s best hope as the dollar strengthens is safe haven buying as investors rotate out of stocks on global uncertainty oil much lower us official gasoline inventories cancelled out the negative news from wall street leaving brent crude and wti almost unchanged at usd65 95 and usd56 25 respectively the balance may adjust to the bearish side in asia if trade worries push regional equity markets deep into the red
by recently i have had several journalists academics and progressive activists ask me my opinion on some of the key economic questions of the day here are some of my replies on trump tax cuts and us growth current immigration debates wages expanding income inequality in the us on what is the real rate of inflation today and whether proposals for universal guaranteed income debt jubilee modern money theory green new deal are solutions to today s economic problems question 1 is us economic growth under trump due to his tax cut policy and what is the future of average or low wage americans today dr rasmus the nominally higher us gdp growth in 2017 18 has little to do with the trump tax cuts the trump tax cuts passed in early 2018 amounted to more than 4 5 trillion over the decade targeting to wealthy households businesses investors and corporations which have been front loaded in 2018 offsetting this are 1 5 trillion in tax hikes for wage earners that begins to hit this year and accelerates after 2022 assumptions about 3 gdp growth for another decade with no recession produces a further offsetting of 1 5 trillion the net result supposedly is the 1 5 trillion reported by the press but the 4 5 trillion cuts for business and investors have not gone into real investment and generated the trump 2017 18 gdp growth rates real investment in structures and equipment declined steadily over 2018 as the trump tax cuts took effect measured in percent terms compared to the preceding quarter residential construction was negative every quarter in 2018 commercial construction with a lag turned negative in the second half of 2018 and equipment spending fell from 8 5 in the first quarter to 3 4 by october 2018 so if the trump tax cuts did not go into real investment creating real employment and real gdp where did it go it went into stock buybacks dividend payouts and m a activity several us banks research departments estimate buybacks plus dividends for just the fortune 500 largest companies in the us will reach a record 1 3 trillion in 2018 add the largest 2000 or 5000 companies and its close to 2 trillion hundreds of billions more for m a this diversion of the trump tax cuts to financial markets is the main determinant driving stock markets even after corrections and other financial asset markets the government grossly over reports wage gains for the average and low paid workers in the us independent source reports show that more than half of us workers received no wage gain at all in 2018 the official reported wage gains of 3 are skewed to the top 10 of the labor force dragging up the average wage moreover the data is for full time employed only leaving out tens of millions of part time temp workers wages and it doesn t adequately account for local taxes and interest on debt that reduces the take home wage further then inflation is under estimated making the real wage appear higher so average workers at best stagnated with most experiencing a decline in real wages the rate of inflation in the us is especially under estimated for median worker family households while inflation is rising for rents medical education and other major items in household budgets so the immediate future will mean even less real wage gains for the majority of us workers if workers were doing so well today as trump and the business and mainstream press report why is it that 7 million of them have defaulted on their auto loans probably a like amount for education loans the defaults of which are grossly under reported and why is credit card auto loans and education loan debt now all over 1 trillion each and total household debt load approaching 14 trillion question 2 with undocumented immigrants at 10 12 million do you believe trump s claim that immigrants are invading the us economy dr rasmus immigrants are certainly not invading the us the 10 12 million number has been stable for several years and for immigrants for some countries like mexico the numbers are in sharp decline it is true that more immigrants are coming from central american countries like honduras salvador and guatemala but that is due to the economic crises and violent breakdown of the social order in those countries which is due largely to us support for the corrupt elites of those countries who encourage the gang violence in their countries and do nothing about the economic crises if there is a problem with immigration in the us it is a problem of highly educated tech workers being brought in on h1 b and l 1 visas and rich asians who can buy themselves a green card residency by promising to spend 50 000 when they come these groups are taking the best jobs the high paying tech and other professional jobs and have been since the 1990s but trump is agreeing with the us tech companies to keep bringing them in taking jobs us workers should and could get trump s immigration policy and draconian action against immigrants from latin america and elsewhere is about his re election plans in 2020 by creating enemies within and outside the us he diverts his political base from the real problems of america blame the foreigner in our midst has always been a useful fascist argument and trump is marching down that road as witnessed in his latest constitutional power grab by declaring national emergencies to build his wall and invoking phony national security to justify his trade wars question 3 do you believe the widening gap between rich and poor in the era of trump can boost americans interest in socialism dr rasmus the income and wealth gaps in the us are not only widening but doing so at an accelerating pace us neoliberal policy under obama was to subsidize capital incomes through federal reserve cheap money and by extending and expanding his predecessor george w bush tax cuts for business and investors he gave more than 5 trillion in tax cuts to business and investors more than even bush trump policy has accelerated the tax cuts even further and he s now stopped the fed from raising interest rates so we have subsidization on steroids now by both fiscal and monetary policy the direct consequence is booming stock and corporate bond markets fed by 1 trillion annual stock buybacks and dividend payouts every year since 2011 now at record 1 3 trillion in 2018 as wage incomes for the 90 of americans remain stagnant barely rise or decline the direct consequence is accelerating income inequality and wealth gaps but it s mainly due to the shift toward financial profits by american and increasingly global capitalists that s been building since the 1980s will this boost interest in socialism it already has a clear majority well over 60 of people aged 34 and younger in the work force have indicated in various recent polls that they prefer socialism over capitalism it s not by accident therefore that trump and the us business press has been launching an offensive to attack the idea of socialism once again this shift in public opinion will continue as the trump policies continue to create a growing gap in income wealth and opportunity in america question 4 some critics of us economic statistics on inflation say that inflation may be as high as 9 6 or at least more than 5 what s your view on this dr rasmus i agree the cpi rate is actually higher i don t think it s 9 6 but certainly not 2 1 core or 2 4 headline the shadow stats source has long critiqued us stats including inflation also employment and wage data both of which i ve been criticizing this past year the cpi is higher than reported for several reasons first as shadow stats notes they make arbitrary assumptions about product quality improvements that lower the actual rate second they use what s called chain price indexing that smooths out and lowers the rate over time third the weights for the basket of goods in the cpi is outdated this is especially true for median income and below families there should be different weights and definition of the basket for different levels of income but there isn t middle income and below families are experiencing greater inflation due to rising drug and health prices rising local taxes and utilities rising interest rates on mortgages and rising rents rent prices are under reported in particular since they are smoothed out by including what s called imputed rents that is assumptions about home owners paying themselves a rent yes that s illogical but true in the methodology which hasn t changed much for years but when added to direct rents results in a lower average there s also issues with how the data is collected on prices of course we re talking here about prices for goods and services not prices for financial assets which have accelerated several fold since 2009 as bubbles have grown i suspect that real cpi is about 3 5 to 4 not the 2 1 that of course means that real us gdp is not 3 in 2018 but actually less than 1 in real terms the price index for gdp real adjustment is the gdp deflator index which is notoriously even lower than the cpi or the pce which the fed uses watch the first quarter 2019 gdp come in closer to 1 in official reporting later this spring that means the trump tax cuts of more than 4 trillion over the coming decade front loaded in 2018 have had very little effect on real gdp most of it has gone to stock buybacks dividend payouts and m a financing buybacks pus dividends for the just the fortune 500 will equal around 1 3 trillion for 2018 a record real investment has been sliding throughout 2018 when the tax cuts took effect residential construction contracted every quarter commercial construction lagged but turned negative as well in the second half of the year and equipment investment declined from 8 5 at the beginning of 2018 to 3 4 by the end it s a real fiction that trump tax cuts are responsible for the 3 plus growth in 2018 it s mostly been due to government spending especially defense and to consumption driven by household debt for the bottom 80 although nicely rising compensation for the top 10 has driven consumption as well trump cut paycheck withholding in 2018 so that average households would think the tax cut was putting more money in their wallets but it wasn t and now in 2019 most households will start feeling the bite of more taxes the 4 to 4 5 trillion actual trump tax cuts are going to the wealthiest individuals businesses and corporations especially the us multinationals that will be offset by 1 5 trillion in tax hikes for wage earners which really starts to hit about 2022 plus phony assumptions about 3 plus gdp growth rates for the next decade with no recession that s how trump gets his 1 5 trillion total deficit from the tax cuts it s a big fiction that the press also fails to report reporters are either stupid or the policy is to report the 1 5 trillion in other words it s not just price stats that are inaccurate but gdp wages and jobs data as well the only thing holding up the house of cards is debt for households now approaching 14 trillion for the national government now 22 trillion and going to 34 trillion by 2028 for state and local governments trillions more and for private business well over 20 trillion more a big problem with leveraged loan debt junk rate corporate debt half of investment grade i e bbb which is also junk and who knows what in derivatives and margin borrowing by investors question 5 progressive proponents of public banking and what s called modern monetary theory both believe that the federal reserve could simply create money for all citizens economic benefit not just for the banks what s your view on this and specifically on the idea of a guaranteed basic income what s called a debt jubilee of legal forgiveness of debts of households and a green new deal dr rasmus the fed isn t feeding the banks to avoid a recession the fed is feeding the financial markets to prevent a third major contraction since feb 2018 that is coming cheap money in excess keeps rates low or in this case prevents them from rising further but the money doesn t go into real investment it goes into asset markets or flows offshore to emerging markets or into m a activity or into stock buybacks and dividend payouts in the trillions annually this year 1 3 trillion after 6 years of an average of a trillion a year yes the fed could provide credit to households and non banks but that s not why it was created it was created like all central banks to subsidize the banks with cheap credit and to bail them out when they binge too much and create a crisis in the postscript to my 2017 book central bankers at the end of their ropes i provide language for legislation and a constitutional amendment that would radically change the mission of the fed to serve all society not just bankers and investors but the fed was set up in 1913 to only lend to the banks and since 2018 the shadow banks which now control more assets than the commercial banks like chase wells citi etc as for proposing a debt jubilee that s just nonsense so long as there s a capitalist system the capitalists will never allow a debt forgiveness on a major scale you d have to change the system before to allow it what about guaranteed basic income something like that is inevitable mckinsey consultants recently estimated that artificial intelligence technology or ai will destroy 30 of all the job occupations in the us by 2030 already more than 50 million of the us labor force are part time temp gig or what s called contingent or precariat labor force they re working two and three part time jobs to make ends meet and still can t ai will drive that total to well over half of the labor force the system just can t manage that many low and underpaid workers consumption will collapse despite providing ever more household debt to fund consumption however as most are proposing guaranteed basic income now it smacks of welfare and that makes it an easy ideological target for capitalists it s all about raising wages and creating real jobs that families can survive on we need to be more creative than just ubi but it does bring attention to the crisis of insufficient wage income for tens of millions of americans mostly young workers and the older that are forced to work into their seventies and until they drop funding medicare for all it s possible to envision how the fed as the epicenter of a public banking system part of my proposal could provide funding for the infrastructure for medicare for all in a new layer of clinics and public doctor offices locally but the real funding for medicare for all should come from taxing financial markets that would be more acceptable to voters ditto for green new deal initiatives progressives enamored with public banking or other monetary solutions i e modern monetary theory advocates tend to over estimate the potential for monetary solutions to the economic crisis now maturing long run as real investment continues to slow productivity falls prices tend toward stagnation and deflation wages interest rates goods services global growth slows and capitalists turn increasingly to financial asset markets to make their profits instead of past approaches of making things and new services that are useful and provide income for consumption that is the slow grinding crisis of capitalism today i support a public bank but only as a small part of a larger solution that must include fiscal policy industrial policy and external trade exchange rate money flows policies money and banking are only part of the new program needed but the program means nothing without political organization the lack of that is the key characteristic of the time we live in it all comes down to the organization question where can people turn to participate in realizing the new ideas not the democratic party certain not the trumpublicans there s no republican party left it s now trump s and the unions as they grow weaker turn to the dems to save their ass so forget a labor party based on the unions that s nostalgia of the 1930s won t come again mmt theory is just another equilibrium theory that concludes that money can be created without limit just use it for progressive programs i don t believe that the fed s free money for the bankers and investors since 1980 and especially since 2000 and accelerating after 2009 is leading to unsustainable deficits and debt the 22 trillion will be 34 trillion in less than ten years and the interest on it will be 900 billion a year per the cbo that means capitalists will either have to give up their tax cuts reduce their war spending budget or massively attack social security medicare education etc guess which one is coming the trumpublicans make no apologies for it and the dems lie about how they won t either meanwhile sanders keeps acting the political don quixote tilting at the dem party trying to reform it which keeps shitting on him and will do so perpetually the warrens bookers and other ersatz progressives will talk the talk the dem party moneybags and leaders will encourage them to do so in order to outflank and dissipate sanders progressive message but in the end whomever of the progressives gets the next dem presidential 2020 nomination the party leaders will ditch their proposals and programs and bring them in line don t forget obama in 2008 sounding like a progressive but once in office put the bankers back in charge of his administration but biden s the front runner anyway so it s not likely the party will even choose warren booker or any of the other ersatz progressive wannabes and sanders clones in short while i ve probably written more about central bankers and financial markets than most on the left latest book coming in march is alexander hamilton and the origins of the fed i m not a proponent of primary reliance on monetary policy and banking system restructuring as a solution and nothing matters without having first resolved the organization question

in fourth quarter 2018 representing year over year growth of 50 1 platform gmv increased by 155 2 million from 307 0 million to 462 2 million representing year over year growth of 50 6 the increases in gmv and platform gmv were primarily driven by a 57 5 increase in number of orders from 600 100 in fourth quarter 2017 to 945 200 in fourth quarter 2018 which primarily resulted from a 44 6 growth in active consumers to 1 4 million and an increase in transactions per active consumer as we saw strong demand from consumers across our global markets these factors were partially offset by the 4 9 decrease in aov from 670 4 to 637 3 which mainly reflects the foreign currency translation impact of the u s dollar appreciation over the past year as well as increased investments in our customers which resulted in a lower level of fulfilment revenue relative to platform gmv revenue revenue increased by 69 1 million year over year from 126 5 million in fourth quarter 2017 to 195 5 million in fourth quarter 2018 representing growth of 54 6 the increase was primarily driven by higher platform services revenue platform services revenue increased by 67 1 million or 67 9 year over year

million in fourth quarter 2017 to 101 3 million in fourth quarter 2018 the increase was primarily driven by the increases in cost of goods associated with first party sales as well as the delivery packaging and transaction processing expenditures incurred as a result of an increased number of orders in fourth quarter 2018 as compared to the prior year period our gross profit margin decreased from 51 2 in fourth quarter 2017 to 48 2 in fourth quarter 2018 primarily due to lower fulfillment revenue per order on average as marketplace cost efficiencies were offset by investments in customer initiatives including our loyalty program additional factors impacting gross profit margin include an increased mix of first party sales which have a different gross margin profile than our third

resulted from performance marketing efficiencies in driving platform gmv growth these efficiencies partially offset the gross profit margin impact on platform order contribution margin which decreased

services increased by 6 0 million or 49 5 in fourth quarter 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 which was primarily driven by a 54 7 increase in technology staff headcount and higher software and

general and administrative costs as a percentage of adjusted revenue decreased from 51 6 in fourth quarter 2017 to 33 3 in fourth quarter 2018 reflecting improved efficiency of corporate and platform service costs as well as a reduction of accrued employee compensation expense share based payments decreased by 4 9 million or 63 4 in fourth quarter 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the fair value re measurement of our cash settled share based payment awards and provision for employment related taxes on share based payment awards adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was 14 6

reflecting benefits from our prior period investments to support our growth as well as improved efficiencies in selling general and administrative expenses which have grown at a slower rate than adjusted revenue loss after tax loss after tax decreased by 44 9 million or 81 9 year over year in fourth quarter 2018 to 9 9 million this was driven by a year over year decrease in the operating loss

future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements including but not limited to purchasers of luxury products may not choose to shop online in sufficient numbers our ability to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable or to generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis the volatility and difficulty in predicting the luxury fashion industry our reliance on a limited number of retailers and brands for the supply of products on our marketplace our reliance on retailers and brands to anticipate identify and respond quickly to new and changing fashion trends consumer preferences and other factors our reliance on retailers and brands to make products available to our consumers on our marketplace and to set their own prices for such products fluctuation in foreign exchange rate our reliance on information technologies and our ability to adapt to technological developments our ability to acquire or retain consumers and to promote and sustain the farfetch brand our ability or the ability of third parties to protect our sites networks and systems against security breaches or otherwise to protect our confidential information our ability to successfully launch and monetize new and innovative technology our dependence on highly skilled personnel including our senior management data scientists and technology professionals and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel josé neves our chief executive officer has considerable influence over important corporate matters due to his ownership of us and our dual

time in our other filings with the sec which are accessible on the sec s website at www sec gov in addition we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risks emerge from time to time it is not possible for our management to predict all risks nor can we assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements that we may make in light of these risks uncertainties and assumptions the forward looking events and circumstances discussed in this release are inherently uncertain and may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward looking statements accordingly you should not rely upon forward looking statements as predictions of future events in addition the forward looking statements made in this release relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this release except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events consolidated statement of operations reclassification we have revised previously reported revenues and cost of revenues for each of the first three quarters of 2018 to reflect certain sales originally reported on a third party basis i e net revenue presentation as being on a first party basis i e gross revenue presentation these revisions had no impact on gross profit or loss after tax in those periods and had no impact on any of our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial position changes in equity or cash flows during 2018 the group has determined that these revisions are immaterial to the previously reported financial information and there is no impact on any previously issued annual financial statements there was no impact to other prior periods non ifrs and other financial and operating metrics this release includes certain financial measures and metrics not based on ifrs including adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted revenue platform services revenue platform gross profit platform order contribution and platform order contribution margin as well as operating metrics including gmv platform gmv active consumers number of orders and average order value management uses adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted revenue platform services revenue platform gross profit platform order contribution and platform order contribution margin as measurements of operating performance because they assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations for planning purposes including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our strategic initiatives and to evaluate our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our business adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted revenue platform services revenue platform gross profit platform order contribution and platform order contribution margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies and analysts calculate these measures in the same manner we present adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted revenue platform services revenue platform gross profit platform order contribution and platform order contribution margin because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies management believes that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non ifrs financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations many investors are interested in understanding the performance of our business by comparing our results from ongoing operations period over period and would ordinarily add back non cash expenses such as depreciation amortization and items that are not part of normal day to day operations of our business by providing these non ifrs financial measures together with reconciliations to ifrs we believe we are enhancing investors understanding of our business and our results of operations as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives items excluded from these non ifrs measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted revenue and platform services revenue have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to or a substitute for loss after tax revenue or other financial statement data presented in our consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance some of the limitations are such measures do not reflect revenue related to fulfilment which is necessary to the operation of our business such measures do not reflect our expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments such measures do not reflect changes in our working capital needs such measures do not reflect our share based payments income tax credit expense or the amounts necessary to pay our taxes although depreciation and amortization are eliminated in the calculation of adjusted ebitda the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any costs for such replacements and other companies may calculate such measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures due to these limitations adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted revenue and platform services revenue should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business and are in addition to not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with ifrs in addition the non ifrs financial measures we use may differ from the non ifrs financial measures used by other companies and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with ifrs furthermore not all companies or analysts may calculate similarly titled measures in the same manner we compensative for these limitation by relying primarily on our ifrs results and using these non ifrs measures only as supplemental measures platform gross profit platform order contribution and platform order contribution margin are not measurements of our financial performance under ifrs and do not purport to be alternatives to gross profit or loss after tax derived in accordance with ifrs we believe that platform gross profit platform order contribution and platform order contribution margin are useful measures in evaluating our operating performance because they take into account demand generation expense and are used by management to analyze the operating performance of our platform for the periods presented we also believe that platform gross profit platform order contribution and platform order contribution margin are useful measures in evaluating our operating performance within our industry because they permit the evaluation of our platform

guidance on an ifrs basis a reconciliation of the company s adjusted ebitda guidance to the most directly comparable ifrs financial measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts and is not

asian markets are mixed today despite selloff in us overnight investors are generally non committal probably waiting for more concrete developments regarding us china trade negotiations and brexit though the decline in us treasury yields is worth a note as 10 year yield closed back below 2 7 handle at 2 692 it remains to be seen if last week s strong rise was a false dawn as more evidence of global slowdown surfaced non farm payroll report with wage growth on friday would probably firm up the tone in dollar yields and us stocks but for now focus will turn to ecb meeting first euro is

be at least off the table temporarily the most important change in the statement is in the last paragraph boc now said the outlook continues to warrant a policy interest that is below its neutral

another meaningful vote on brexit deal could be held in the uk parliament but bloomberg reported that positions on both sides are hardening rather than converging both the uk and eu are counting on the other to back down eu officials are pessimistic about the chance of any breakthrough this week in particular unnamed eu officials described the talks with uk attorney general geoffrey cox earlier

the trump xi trade deal is a clear example according to the statement from the white house the united states has agreed not to increase tariffs from 10 to 25 per cent in return china has agreed to buy a substantial amount of exports from the united states to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries this is not how economies work america s trade deficit with china reflects its dependency on the chinese to finance us investment and consumption china s promise to buy a substantial amount of us agricultural goods for example will require us farmers to expand production doing so will require investment given americans do not save enough to finance this increase in investment where does it come from the answer is overseas this inflow of capital will push up the us dollar worsening the trade deficit when the agricultural products are finally bought by china the us dollar will go up again worsening the trade deficit even further the deal between trump and xi will change the composition of the us trade deficit american farmers will undoubtedly be better off but the deal will not change the underlying saving and investment behaviour and will not therefore alter the overall trade balance the deal does however achieve plenty of other things it undermines the rules based global trading system it will divert trade away from other countries including australia s farmers and energy suppliers it will do nothing to support global growth it will do nothing to address the ongoing challenges in the trading system it doesn t even promise a reduction in the existing tariffs this deal highlights that the united states is increasingly a source of risk for the world america s trade war is disrupting asian supply chains it threatens growth and prosperity throughout the region tightening financial conditions led by the us federal reserve are shaking asian financial and currency markets a turbulent us stock market is reverberating around regional stock markets trump s attacks on institutions such as the us federal reserve at home and the world trade organization abroad threaten the predictability and certainty of policies that underpin investment and consumption elevated geopolitical tensions around the reimposition of us sanctions on iran risk cascading into other challenges in the region at the heart of these risks is enormous policy uncertainty what will trump do next the mid term election results certainly weakened the trump administration a democrat controlled house of representatives is a welcome constraint on his power but wounded beasts are unpredictable trump might respond to weakness domestically by projecting strength abroad us presidents have limited influence when it comes to domestic policy the opposite is true when it comes to foreign policy particularly in trade finance and security trump s next move will be heavily influenced by what happens in the us economy the economic recovery will soon be the longest in us history it began well before trump entered the white house trump has used a strong economy to justify and expand his policy agenda the economy is currently on full throttle with the stimulus of the trump tax cuts superimposed on economic recovery but what happens if the us economy falters given that so many of the world s risks are coming from the united states the possibility that might happen warrants serious consideration in this week s lead essay adam triggs warns that all the indicators suggest that the next us recession is right around the corner it is a matter of when not if and the implications for asia are significant the region best get ready now as triggs notes signals that predict us recessions are far from perfect but what is striking right now is just how many of them are now flashing red one relates to the pattern of the us business cycle the us economy has never gone longer than a decade without a recession a milestone which is fast approaching another is the monetary policy stance of the us federal reserve four of the last five episodes of fed rate rises have been followed by a recession with the latest episode already underway investors expect at least four more rate rises before december 2019 term spreads are another predictor flashing red a flattening yield curve when short and long term interest rates start converging has predicted every us recession in the last 60 years another recession predictor is how much spare capacity there is in the economy the last 10 us recessions were preceded by a closing of the output gap the us output gap is now near zero employment is heading beyond full employment and while inflation and wages are moving slowly they are beginning to shift triggs is not alone in his warning of a looming us recession many are forecasting an upcoming us recession bank of america merrill lynch the economist intelligence unit and two thirds of the economists surveyed by the national association for business economists all predict a recession around 2020 the implications for asia are as complicated as they are serious triggs argues that should the us economy in fact slow down the us federal reserve will need to resort almost immediately to quantitative easing or some other form of politically controversial unconventional monetary policy the last time the united states did this it sent a wall of capital towards asia while asian economies welcomed the increased capital inflows they did not welcome the volatility it wreaked on their financial markets and exchange rates let alone when the tide pulled back at the end of it what should asia do now is the time for asia to build domestic buffers against external economic shocks wherever possible in fiscal policy monetary policy and the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves but when the shock actually hits regional cooperation will be key to seeing it off strengthening regional crisis response efforts like the chiang mai initiative multilateralization and the asean 3 macroeconomic research office is the starting point building the political will and framework for effectively activating regional support is even more important better linking these regional mechanisms to global institutions like the international monetary fund is key to ensuring effective surveillance of risks and strong responses if things go bad and putting in place adequate swap arrangements to buttress these regional and multilateral mechanisms is an essential supplement there is much that asia can do to weather the upcoming storm but it needs to fix the roof while the sun is still shining the eaf editorial board is located in the crawford school of public policy college of asia and the pacific the australian national university

believes the presentation of the non gaap measures above provide useful information to investors and shareholders as the measures provide increased transparency and the ability to better analyze

disclosure standards which are not comparable in all respects of united states or other foreign disclosure standards for example the united states securities and exchange commission the sec generally permits oil and gas issuers in their filings with the sec to disclose only proved reserves as defined in sec rules but permits the optional disclosure of probable reserves and possible reserves each as defined in sec rules canadian securities laws require oil and gas issuers in their filings with canadian securities regulators to disclose not only proved reserves which are defined differently from the sec rules but also probable reserves and permits optional disclosure of possible reserves each as defined in ni 51 101 accordingly proved reserves probable reserves and possible reserves disclosed in this news release may not be comparable to us standards and in this news release crescent point has disclosed reserves designated as proved plus probable reserves probable reserves are higher risk and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than proved reserves possible reserves are higher risk than probable reserves and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than probable reserves in addition under canadian disclosure requirements and industry practice reserves and production are reported using gross volumes which are volumes prior to deduction of royalties and similar payments the sec rules require reserves and production to be presented using net volumes after deduction of applicable royalties and similar payments moreover crescent point has determined and disclosed estimated future net revenue from its reserves using forecast prices and costs whereas the sec rules require that reserves be estimated using a 12 month average price calculated as the arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period consequently crescent point s reserve estimates and production volumes in this news release may not be comparable to those made by companies using united states reporting and disclosure standards further the sec rules are based on unescalated costs and forecasts all amounts in the news release are stated in canadian dollars unless otherwise specified forward looking

march 6 2019 a concluding statement describes the preliminary findings of imf staff at the end of an official staff visit or â missionâ in most cases to a member country missions are undertaken as part of regular usually annual consultations under article iv of the imf s articles of agreement in the context of a request to use imf resources borrow from the imf as part of discussions of staff monitored programs or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments the authorities have consented to the publication of this statement the views expressed in this statement are those of the imf staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the imfâ s executive board based on the preliminary findings of this mission staff will prepare a report that subject to management approval will be presented to the imf executive board for discussion and decision paraguay has grown rapidly in the past decade and a half contributing to a sharp drop in poverty prudent macro policies with low inflation and low government deficits played an important role vulnerabilities have declined with a significant reduction of both external and public debt the key challenge going forward will be to sustain this rapid growth as the factors that have propelled it in the pastâ including the boom in agriculture commodity pricesâ may provide less support going forward improving the business climate and governance will be key to continued convergence to higher living standards near term outlook gdp grew by around 3â¾ percent in 2018 driven by strong domestic demand fueled by a rebound in credit growth while the contribution of net exports was negative but growth was uneven a strong first half of the year was followed by a weaker second half as paraguay felt spillovers from regional financial turbulence the crisis in argentina led to an increase in risk aversion toward the region which contributed to a depreciation of the guarani against the dollar although by less than the depreciation experienced by neighboring countries as a result the guaranã appreciated sharply vis ã vis the argentinean peso and the brazilian real the impact was felt in a sharp drop in tourism and cross border trade weather related shocks in agriculture also contributed to the slowdown in growth for 2019 growth is expected to reach around 3â½ percent growth is being affected by a drought early in the planting season which will reduce the soybean harvest this should be partially offset by a pickup of tourism and cross border trade which will benefit from the unwinding of the real exchange rate shock that occurred in 2018 risks to growth are broadly balanced developments in neighboring countries will be key agricultural commodity prices are another risk factor the strength of domestic demand is also uncertain and will depend on the recovery of government investment now that the transition to a new government is completed the continued commitment of the new government to the fiscal responsibility law is welcome fiscal policy in 2019 will be neutral with the deficit changing little from that in 2018 nontax revenue estimates in the budget appearâ as in previous yearsâ overly optimistic and reaching the target will necessitate containing expenditureâ as has been done in the past the monetary policy rate was on hold in 2018 and both gdp growth and gdp levels remained broadly in line with potential inflation fell to 3 2 percent by the end of the year the result of the decline in oil prices and the reduction in prices of imports from neighboring countries in february 2019 the bcp cut the monetary policy rate from 5â¼ to 5 percent citing uncertainty about the external environment and incipient weakening of domestic demand the current monetary policy stance appears appropriate year on year inflation should move back to 4 percent by yearâ s end the middle of the central bankâ s target range as last yearâ s real exchange rate appreciation reverses exchange rate flexibility should help to absorb shocks exchange rate intervention should continue to aim at preventing disorderly market conditions and mitigating excess volatility only longer term growth challenges paraguay has grown rapidly with real gdp growing by an average 4â½ percent annually in the past decade and a half well above the latin america average this has contributed to a sharp decrease in poverty rates from 58 percent in 2002 to 26 percent currently nonetheless poverty remains high by regional standards rapid growth was partly the result of a bounce back from the crisis in the late 1990s and prudent macro economic policies inflation and exchange rate volatility came down as the central bank shifted to inflation targeting while prudent fiscal policy reduced public debt from 52 percent in 2002 to around 20 percent currently fiscal policy remained conservative during the commodity price boom as a result paraguay did not go through the boom bust that its neighboring countries experienced the global agricultural commodity price boom which led to a sharp expansion of agricultural exports also played an important role in dollar terms agricultural exports are now 5 times what they were in 2003 sowing areas for the main crops are 2â½ times what they were fifteen years go the surge in commodity prices spilled over to the non tradable sector through an appreciation of the real exchange rate which boosted incomes the rapid growth in incomes led to a surge in domestic demand in some respects the economy looks very different from fifteen years ago the share of electricity and water has fallen by two thirds to 8 percent of gdp the share of services is now almost 50 percent of gdp exports have diversified and external vulnerabilities have declinedâ total external debt of the private and public sector has fallen from almost 200 percent of gdp in 2002 to 40 percent currently the key question going forward is how to maintain rapid growth of real incomes paraguayâ s economy is still heavily dependent on the agriculture sector but agricultural prices are already off previous highs and may decline further as global demand slows and agricultural land cannot continue to expand at the same rate as in the past future growth will increasingly need to come from the non agriculture non electricity export sector which is growing rapidly but is still small for this higher private sector investment is needed including from abroad improving the business climate and governance low taxes and low energy prices are important attractions of paraguay for domestic and foreign investors but these are offset by a weak business climate and governance a better business climate and improved governance would help facilitate diversification and productivity growth compared to other countries in the western hemisphere and europe paraguay scores relatively weak on business climate and governance indicators cross country data show that there is a strong link between the value of these indicators and gdp per capita policies that focus on improving transport infrastructure rule of law and the quality of education would be particularly helpful the mission estimates that reforms in these areas would not only have the largest impact on growth but also have the most support from the private sector in this context the mission welcomes the new government initiatives to increase the ease of doing business these include legislation to simplify the process of small business registration a new bankruptcy law and legislation to allow companies to use moveable assets as collaterals the government is also seeking to get rid of outdated bureaucratic procedures for businesses and to increase digitization in government services to facilitate higher competition in key industries the national commission for competition has been revived which is tasked with combating monopolies and improving the transparency of industry regulations fiscal policy prudent fiscal policies in the past 15 years have reduced the debt to gdp ratio but fiscal space is limited as the deficit is close to the 1 5 percent ceiling under the fiscal responsibility law while fiscal space is limited spending needs are large to create room for the investment needed for some of the identified reform areas revenues which are low by international standards need to be increased current headline tax rates are low but effective tax rates are even lower the personal income tax rate is 10 percent but this tax yields only 0 1 percent of gdp reducing exemptions and deductions and improving tax compliance will raise effective tax rates even if headline rates remain unchanged the mission looks forward to the proposals of the tax commission that is tasked with modernizing and simplifying the tax system there should also be some room to reprioritize expenditure within the existing envelope spending levels in paraguay are low compared with other countries but spending composition is lopsided with a high share of government expenditure going to wages while there is a need to increase infrastructure and social spending including health and education indeed the government wage bill in paraguay is similar as a percent of gdp to that in other countries in the regionâ even though the role of the government is much smaller the mission looks forward to the upcoming recommendations of the expenditure review commission financial sector financial soundness indicators show the banking sector is well capitalized and profitable and risk based supervision is progressing supervision of financial cooperatives should continue to be strengthened there is scope to improve supervision of the casas de credito and casas comerciales supervision standards for this sector should be adopted quickly it remains important to establish a pension fund supervisor currently pension funds administer the publicâ s trusted money under a few overly rigid rules but without oversight supervision would mitigate risks allow pension funds to invest in a wider range of assets and facilitate the development of a domestic capital market restoring the long term sustainability of the pension system is another challenge that should be tackled now before the demographic windfall dissipates this can be achieved through timely and gentle parametric adjustments to pension age benefits and contribution rates implementing all these structural reforms and continuing with prudent macroeconomic policies would allow paraguay to continue growing rapidly and improving living standards for all paraguayans we would like to thank the government for its warm hospitality

let s start by examining the recent measures taken by the federal reserve bank fed on 12 19 2018 the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate from 2 25 to 2 5 it was a controversial decision given that the us economy was growing at the average post war rate of 3 5 inflation ranged between 2 and 2 4 and unemployment rate around 4 as expected the fed s decision triggered turbulence in the financial markets from then on the kind of massive sell off in december and subsequent volatility in the us stock markets the fact that the fed reduced its predicted interest rate hikes from three to two in 2019 and the shrinking size of its balance sheet or unwinding are indicative signs of an economic slowdown and perhaps of a possible economic recession balance sheet in addition to interest rates the balance sheet is the other tool used by the fed to manage the economy the balance sheet is largely a vast portfolio of u s treasury government bonds the fed bought to stimulate the economy a program started in 2008 and known as quantitative easing currently the combined effects of higher fed funds rates and balance sheet reduction could lead to a drastic reduction in liquidity and credit higher bond rates bond issuers need to pay a higher interest rate when they issue new bonds and a possible severe drop in stocks markets but we have to be especially precise on how the fed is going to reduce the balance sheet unwinding here s how it works treasury securities are paid off by the government when they reach their maturity date the fed buys or it does not purchase fewer securities than are maturating previously the fed replaced those securities with purchases of other securities so as to keep the balance sheet constant but now the underlying idea is stopping the replacement of securities that mature the fed destroys money through the unwinding process on the contrary when the fed is buying securities it is creating money i consider that this way of balance sheet reduction can balance the liquidity but we have to take into account that market participants can feel that this gradual reduction is getting too rapid and therefore will slow the economy too fast furthermore in recent weeks the fed took a more flexible posture toward raising interest rates indicating a data dependent approach this means that fed will raise interest rates if it thinks the data indicate that a tightening of financial conditions is required this flexible position can enhance confidence in financial markets around the world yield curve the federal funds rate has a decisive influence on the treasury yields we therefore need to focus on the behaviour of the yield curve because it is seen as a key factor to predict recessions when short term rates are higher than long term rates the yield curve is said to have inverted a recession tends to follow in the next couple of years when such a situation has occurred it is understood that the inverted yield curve predicts recessions because when short term rates are higher than long term rates it means that bond markets expect short term rates to fall soon that is what happens in a recession when central banks cut rates to stimulate the economy lately the difference between three month and 10 year treasury yields has shown a steady narrowing the yield on the 10 year treasury is a key financial measure in the world it is viewed as a proxy for longer term growth and inflation expectations in the u s in addition it is a potential competition for stocks because if the 10 year treasury exceeds a certain percentage threshold until a couple months ago before the stock market crash as a result of the fed hikes rate it was around 3 it will become a better investment than the riskier stock market we should bear in mind the fact that financial markets tend to focus on the 10 year rate as a form to assess economy inflation and long term interest rates therefore if a stable situation is expected over the next decade investors will buy 10 year treasury and that demand will send yields lower otherwise they will put their money into short term treasuries that reduces 10 year treasury demand and the prices drops sending yields higher the interest on 10 year treasuries is therefore becoming a benchmark rate there is also a perception that if 10 year treasury borrowing costs normalize to 3 2 over the next five years the cost of servicing the federal debt will more than double even if the economy continues to grow at the average post war rate of 3 5 and the fed meets its 2 inflation target as a result paying back government borrowing will consume the credit needed to sustain growth it is important to keep in mind that higher yields translate into the real economy by higher borrowing costs for corporations and higher mortgage rates which can result in mass layoffs stagnant growth lower stock prices and recession in this regards some experts say that what really matters is the difference between the two year yield and the 10 year yield since if it close to zero the risk of recession increases in recent months this difference stands at around 0 171 global debt pie we should be aware that the global debt is close to 244 trillion which represents a global debt to gdp ratio of 318 in this context it must be noted that according to the imf since 1950 private debt has been the driving force behind the steady rise of global debt added to this highly leveraged measured by the amount of debt over equity value corporations and a slowdown in global growth are another burning subjects for stock markets and the economy as a whole take for example the amount and growth in corporate debt in us and china the us corporate debt amounts to around 6 3 trillion its highest levels since world war ii and the cash to debt ratio reached a record low of 12 in 2017 below the 14 level in 2008 china s corporate debt to gdp ratio is above 150 in the case of china as a great part of its corporate debt is denominated in us dollars a currency risk is added for the european union we can see that in 2017 12 of the 28 member states were considered to have a private debt above the indicative threshold determined in the macroeconomic imbalance procedure of 133 of gdp these indicators attempt to prevent future economic crises notably the cases of cyprus and luxembourg with private debts of around 316 of gdp or ireland with values close to 243 and the netherlands around 252 it is obvious that a marked slowdown in the global gdp growth in a generalized environment of high interest rates could lead to debt services difficulties if incomes are not rising faster than debts since indebtedness is the most usual method of financing fiscal benefits arising from the leverage it is easy to become trapped in a vicious circle of increasing debt and higher borrowing costs this situation decreases the companies credit rating by increasing the risk of default and could trigger a domino effect on the debt service payments at global level there we have a latent risk factor and as a result more unstable economies in my view it would be necessary to keep equilibrium between debt and equity financing as the excessive debt have a negative impact on the market value of the shares geopolitical factors trends in global financial markets have strong repercussions in the real economy knowledge of these trends is therefore essential a high put call ratio is a useful tool to detect economic downturns since this is indicative of a bearish sentiment therefore it is a good barometer of the stock market trends based on the fact there is a global economic slowdown in 2019 according to the main international bodies the global economy is expected to grow at between 2 9 to 3 5 per cent the main issues that could worsen this situation are a renewed commercial tensions between us and china stronger than anticipated slowdown in global growth and brexit situation concerning the international stock indices assuming that there are no extraordinary events which distort forecasts and the current socio economic situation i think there will be highs and lows within a usual range for example the dow jones index in the last 52 weeks ranged from 21 712 to 26 951 and dropped to 23 675 on 18th december therefore it did not reach its lowest value in 52 weeks even in its worst december since the great depression european companies stock prices in some cases they were undervalued were the worst affected by the december stock market crash in particular the banking sector which has seen its shares prices fall sharply in my view greater control over high frequency trading and further restriction of short term operations would reduce the volatility in global financial markets without any doubt oil price is another global financial crisis risk factor every day we hear about the negative effects that high oil prices have on the economy therefore should we assume that low oil prices are positive generally speaking lower oil prices are a great stimulus for the economy because that means lower production costs extra cash in consumers pockets higher savings and or investments china u s india and many oil importing countries benefited from lower oil prices while russia iran saudi arabia and venezuela and the rest of opec countries were harmed some point out that the downward path in oil prices that we have seen in recent times is due to shale oil which now accounts for half of the supply in the u s market moreover fracking and other new drilling technologies have made the shale oil and gas revolution a reality at this point a question arises do the economic benefits derived from fracking compensate socio environmental damage it is important to bear in mind that an oil price drop may be due to higher supply or a decrease in demand because of slowing growth in the global economy the first case is not dangerous the market would make a correction in order to strike a balance between supply and demand keep in mind that if the second scenario is linked to a persistent decline in the main stock indices it can be an early signal of the beginning of a global economic financial crisis yet the following data give us some reasons for cautious optimism in that regard oil prices had a decreasing trend in two decades the 1980s and 1990s in which the two biggest booms in the us stock market took place while the 1970s when oil prices soared was the worst decade since the great depression for stocks editor s picks related articles how 2030 agenda provides chance for countries to escape middle income trap and help finance global development climate bailout a financial tool to save the climate there is a relationship between oil prices inflation income and interest rates for example about one and half months ago as a result of oil prices hitting 50 a barrel there was less pressure on inflation which translated to less pressure on central banks to raise interest rates it is estimated that every 10 per barrel fall in oil prices boosts incomes by about 0 5 to 0 7 percent of gross domestic product in major emerging market oil importers obviously the decline in oil prices will benefit the importing countries and will hurt producers but oil imports can be made more expensive by a stronger dollar since china is the world s largest importer of oil a strong dollar and the trade war with the u s can be factors of global economic imbalances generally speaking we have two opposing trends that influence oil prices while u s tries to get prices down saudi arabia and russia seek to manage production to support prices any increase in oil prices would have a negative impact on economic growth and consumer spending in oil importing countries furthermore quick rises in oil prices seem to be contributing factor to recessions now oil prices at triple digit levels 100 125 or 150 could lead to a severe global economic downturn the global oil market is an extreme volatile market because it is influenced by geopolitics affairs for example the u s sanctions to iranian exports by reducing a certain number of iran s oil barrels from the market every day increase prices and hamper the global economic expansion thus national interests in order to stabilize prices any of the big crude producers can cut its own outputs and economic factors can trigger turbulent price swings even with modest surpluses and shortages because in the short run consumers needs are rigid the outlook is worrying as additional disturbances pile up currently as a result of the weakening demand from china and the global economic downturn global oil supply remains high with respect to demand venezuela is another source of concern it receives the greatest attention from international authorities especially from the united states it possesses the biggest oil reserves in the world and the u s has been historically its biggest oil buyer the current instability of the country clearly generates instability in oil prices at global level editors note the opinions expressed here by impakter com columnists are their own not those of impakter

this post is also available in spanish tax havens are locations around the world where wealthy individuals criminals and terrorists as well as governments and government agencies such as the cia banks corporations hedge funds international organizations such as the vatican and crime syndicates such as the mafia can stash their money so that they can avoid regulation and oversight and very often evade tax according to nicholas shaxson tax havens are now at the heart of the global economy which is why as he explains it the term tax haven is a bit of a misnomer because such places aren t just about tax what they sell is escape from the laws rules and taxes of jurisdictions elsewhere usually with secrecy as their prime offering see the tax haven in the heart of britain a tax haven or secrecy jurisdiction then is a place that seeks to attract business by offering politically stable facilities to help people or entities get around the rules laws and regulations of jurisdictions elsewhere see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world tax havens are a vitally important part of the global infrastructure of corruption and criminality see giant leak of offshore financial records exposes global array of crime and corruption that enables privileged individuals and their organizations to legally and illegally steal money from the rest of us particularly those in developing countries and to have the services of a vast network of accountants bankers lawyers and politicians often from captured legislatures to help them do it and to ensure that they get away with it how many tax havens are there where are they how much money do they have who uses them why how do they work why does all this matter to us and what can we do about them tax havens how many and where are they in his book treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world author and financial journalist nicholas shaxson identified about sixty secrecy jurisdictions or offshore groups around the world which he divided into four categories as follows the most important category by far is those tax havens that form the spider s network of havens centred on the city of london it has three main layers there are two inner rings britain s crown dependencies of jersey guernsey which includes the sub havens of sark alderney and brecqhou and the isle of man and its overseas territories such as the cayman islands bermuda the british virgin islands and gibralter which are substantially controlled by britain the third layer is an outer ring with a more diverse array of havens like hong kong singapore the bahamas dubai and ireland which are outside britain s direct control but have strong historical and current links to that country and the city of london which i will discuss below this network controls almost one half of all international bank assets the second category of tax havens is those in europe notably including switzerland luxembourg see explore the documents luxembourg leaks database the netherlands belgium and austria as well as microstates such as liechtenstein and monaco while geneva bankers had sheltered the secret money of european elites since at least the eighteenth century the european havens got going during world war i as governments raised taxes sharply to pay for the war the third category of tax havens is that focused on the united states it has three tiers as well at the federal level the us government offers a range of tax exemptions secrecy provisions and laws designed to attract foreign money this means for example that us banks can legally accept proceeds from a range of crimes as long as the crimes are committed overseas the second tier involves individual us states such as florida where central south american elites do their banking and the countries adversely impacted are prevented by us secrecy provisions from accessing relevant data and where much mob and drugs money is hidden too delaware nevada and wyoming where even terrorist money is protected by secrecy provisions the third tier of the us network is the overseas satellites such as the american virgin islands the marshall islands liberia and panama with the latter according to jeffrey robinson being one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as shaxson notes offshore finance has quietly been at the heart of neoconservative schemes to project us power around the globe for years few people have noticed the fourth category of tax havens identified by shaxson includes those that do not fit in the categories above such as somalia and uganda the incomplete list of tax havens on the website tax havens of the world will give you some idea of where these secrecy jurisdictions are located but there are important omissions in this list notably including the city of london corporation for a brief look at 15 tax havens again notably excluding some of the most important and some of the corporations that use them see what are the world s best tax havens and for a highly instructive and utterly sobering video documentary on british tax havens see the spider s web britain s second empire this documentary will inform you among many more important things that the building housing her majesty s revenue and customs the uk tax office is owned by an offshore company in bermuda to summarize the central aspect of the development of tax havens following world war ii the british establishment an old boys network of privileged elites had carved out a lucrative vehicle for themselves in the offshore world after the demise of empire they transformed themselves from administrators of empire to financial handlers for the global elite and multinational corporations see the spider s web britain s second empire before concluding this section it is worth emphasizing that as shaxson explains it the offshore world is not a bunch of independent states exercising their sovereign rights to set their laws and tax systems as they see fit it is a set of networks of influence controlled by the world s major powers notably britain and the united states each network is deeply interconnected with the others he goes on the world s most important tax havens are not exotic palm fringed islands as many people suppose but some of the world s most powerful countries shaxson quotes marshall langer a prominent supporter of secrecy jurisdictions it does not surprise anyone when i tell them that the most important tax haven in the world is an island they are surprised however when i tell them that the island is manhattan moreover the second most important tax haven is located on an island it is called the city of london the city of london corporation what is the city of london corporation also known as the square mile it is a 1 22 square mile slab of prime central london real estate that stretches from the thames at victoria embankment clockwise up through fleet street the barbican centre then to liverpool street in the north east then back down to the thames just west of the tower of london see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world according to shaxson the city of london corporation the modern period of which dates from 1067 yes that is not a typing error is the local government authority for the 1 2 square mile slab of prime real estate in central london that is the city of london the corporation is an ancient semi alien entity lodged inside the british nation state a prehistoric monster which had mysteriously survived into the modern world as a 19th century would be city reformer put it importantly shaxson explains the role of the city of london corporation as a municipal authority is its least important attribute this is a hugely resourced international offshore lobbying group pushing for international financial deregulation tax cutting and tax havenry around the world moreover it is the hub of a global network of tax havens sucking up offshore trillions from around the world and sending it or the business of handling it to london notably so powerful is the city of london that no sovereign or government of britain in a thousand years has had the courage to seriously take it on and attempt to subject it to british government control see the tax haven in the heart of britain how much money is in tax havens so how much of the world s wealth is stashed in tax havens around the globe according to the tax justice network in its 2012 report written by james s henry the price of offshore revisited new estimates for missing global private wealth income inequality and lost taxes a significant fraction of global private financial wealth by our estimates at least 21 to 32 trillion as of 2010 has been invested virtually tax free through the world s still expanding black hole of more than 80 offshore secrecy jurisdictions we believe this range to be conservative he goes on to emphasize that this is just financial wealth a big share of the real estate yachts racehorses gold bricks and many other things that count as non financial wealth are also owned via offshore structures where it is impossible to identify the owners henry also notes that given that credit suisse estimated global wealth in 2011 at 231 trillion the amount of money in secrecy jurisdictions is conservatively estimated at 10 of global wealth but other figures do indeed suggest this estimate is low shaxson cites compelling evidence that more than half of world trade passes at least on paper through tax havens over half of all banking assets and a third of foreign direct investment by multinational corporations are routed offshore moreover as long ago as 2008 the us government accountability office reported that 83 of the 100 biggest corporations in the usa had subsidiaries in tax havens and the following year using a broader definition the tax justice network discovered that ninety nine of europe s hundred largest companies used offshore subsidiaries and in each country the largest user by far was a bank see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world in any case the most recent estimate by the tax justice network indicates tax losses to profit shifting by multinational companies a pplying a methodology developed by researchers at the international monetary fund to an improved dataset of around 500 billion a year see new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals to reiterate then on the understanding that these estimates are probably quite low by 2010 between us21 and us32 trillion had been taken out of circulation so that it was beyond the laws financial regulations and taxes that the rest of us cannot escape but that figure has been added to by half a trillion dollars each year since by moving more money into tax havens and don t forget this figure does not include non financial wealth how many gold bricks yachts artworks and racehorses do you own and have stashed away somewhere free of scrutiny who uses tax havens and why as i mentioned above tax havens are used by wealthy individuals including businesspeople sports and pop stars criminals and terrorists as well as governments and their agencies banks corporations such as amazon and google international organizations and crime syndicates such as the medellin cartel while motives vary in essence the lack of regulation and oversight as well as tax evasion are the reasons that individuals and organizations use them an individual might want to hide stolen wealth to evade tax or cheat a divorced spouse out of their share of the family fortune a bank corporation crime syndicate international or terrorist organization might want to evade scrutiny of the source of their money and or evade tax on windfall or even ongoing profits legal and or otherwise a government might want to hide the dirty money it uses to finance black ops that is illegal and secret military violence such as that carried out by the cia but there are myriad explanations in john christensen s analysis of over 100 offshore clients of accounting firm deloitte touche he studied in jersey he found that the clients were engaging in insider trading market rigging failure to disclose conflicts of interest weapons trading illicit political donations contract kickbacks bribery fraudulent invoicing trade mispricing and tax evasion see the spider s web britain s second empire most people have heard of the money stashed away by corrupt dictators like suharto in indonesia ferdinand marcos in the philippines and mobuto sese seko of zaire now democratic republic of the congo each of whom stole from the people of their country however they could only do this with the help of western enablers and ongoing elite resistance to developing country attempts to create a more transparent and fairer process for collecting tax on cross border financial flows as a result alex cobham of the tax justice network observes worldwide developing nations lose in excess of 1trillion per year in capital flight and tax evasion to wealthy countries see the spider s web britain s second empire but these more public examples while terrible tend to obscure two important facts the amount stolen from sub saharan africans for example between 1970 and 2008 was at least five times the total amount of their foreign debt during that period see the spider s web britain s second empire and by highlighting these examples attention is drawn away from even worse and ongoing examples of such criminality by those corrupt criminal individuals and organizations including banks accountancy and legal firms corporations international organizations crime syndicates and governments committed to using outright theft fraud money laundering and other devices to steal wealth from ordinary people all over the world so for example if one follows the money trails of various lucrative financial operations some technically legal but immoral and others simply illegal apart from the world s major corporations one quickly comes across the names of the major and well known banks and financial institutions such as the bank of england barclays goldman sachs jpmorgan chase the big four accountancy firms deloitte ernst young ey kpmg and pricewaterhousecoopers and elite lawyers such as those in london s magic circle like clifford chance mourant du feu jeune and slaughter and may see for example treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals and looting with putin apparently like major corporations and crime syndicates few banks accountancy firms and lawyers have ethics policies that require them to follow the law and to exercise due diligence check out a client before signing a contract so that they can steer clear of handling illegal and immoral profits especially if they are monstrous in fact according to a us senate report virtually every major bank in the world especially the biggest in north america and europe holds accounts for offshore banks and or banks in suspect jurisdictions see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as eva joly mep vice chair of the panama papers committee of the european parliament succinctly puts it ordinary people are paying taxes rich people are not see the spider s web britain s second empire the vatican but perhaps the example which best illustrates the moral depravity of those who use tax havens is the vatican in his carefully researched book operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia author paul l williams recounts the efforts of the cia former nazis the sicilian american mafia the vatican and even freemasonry to resist an anticipated postwar invasion of western europe by those godless communists in the soviet union by establishing stay behind units clandestine military and paramilitary units throughout the countries of europe belgium denmark italy netherlands norway portugal led by former nazis and composed of die hard fascist fanatics this alliance to fight the cold war against the former soviet union and the rising tide of progressive governments in europe and the rest of the world particularly as the us war on vietnam gathered pace led as williams chillingly puts it to the toppling of governments wholesale slaughter and financial devastation around the world it was also of course the forerunner to its equivalent operation condor to resist and destroy if possible the spread of progressive movements ranging from communism to liberation theology throughout central south america while the vatican played a number of unsavory roles in this alliance including its facilitation of massive numbers of heroin addictions its use of counterfeit securities participation in false flag attacks that killed thousands and strings of gangland slayings support of military juntas that massacred tens of thousands and the purging of progressive priests including archbishop óscar romero of san salvador and two jesuit priests denounced by fr jorge mario bergoglio now pope francis in argentina see who is pope francis jorge mario bergoglio and argentina s dirty war and causing the financial destitution of thousands of families one of its key ongoing functions designed to maximize the vatican s power while highlighting its moral and spiritual bankruptcy was to act as god s banker for many of these operations see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia it did this for example by accepting mafia medellin cartel collected drugs money for a 15 20 cut into the vatican bank technically istituto per le opere di religione or institute for the works of religion and then laundering it through its shell companies such as cisalpine overseas bank astolfine sa united trading corporation erin sa bellatrix sa belrose sa starfield sa and nordeurop establishment in tax havens in the bahamas liechtenstein luxembourg panama and switzerland with the cia providing services such as the transport of mafia medellin cocaine to drug dealers in the us its share of the drug profits cycled through its own cia controlled banks including continental illinois castle bank trust and bank of credit and commerce international but eventually involving many of the most prestigious banks in the us as the money was passed to the vatican bank were used to finance key aspects of operations gladio and condor with weapons also supplied by the cia from nato arsenals but there was plenty of vatican money in these operations too as an aside so devastating was the fallout from the ongoing exposure of the many aspects of vatican corruption that by the beginning of the twenty first century roman catholic membership was falling by 400 000 per year in the usa alone but the trend was even stronger in europe with magnificent churches and cathedrals becoming museums visited solely by tourists parishes being boarded up seminaries and convents closed and parochial schools consolidated and this was before the plague of pedophilia had fully hit further decimating the church s tattered reputation to this day the vatican bank remains one of the world s leading laundries for dirty money see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia how do tax havens work each tax haven offers its own unique combination of services after all it is a tough market competing for the world s wealth and so each jurisdiction has developed its own set of services designed to maximize its attractiveness to potential clients in essence this means that there is some ongoing competition to reduce regulatory and oversight requirements so that each tax haven can attract clientele this has become so extreme that basic requirements of banking for those who do it legally such as proof of identity are not required in the offshore world in fact even your true name can be withheld if you wish it is easier to avoid any risk of embarrassment from exposure this way as a result virtually any jurisdiction will open an account or as many accounts as you want in whatever names you specify then usually employing a variety of devices ranging from secret bank accounts nominee directors usually locals who play no part in the organization bar give it their name and structures such as shell companies that exist on paper and perhaps a wall plaque somewhere but nothing else and trusts which unlike the legitimate version appear to separate responsibility and control from the benefits of ownership but actually do not to processes such as transfer pricing a technique by which companies shift paper profits into low tax countries and costs into high tax countries to minimize or eliminate tax payments and often employing a convoluted process that rapidly shifts monies through several jurisdictions so that it becomes untraceable because authorities must get permission to access each jurisdiction in turn in any effort to trace the money profits are effectively hidden and any accountability to authorities of any kind utterly eliminated see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world for one simple example of such a strategy employing a technique known as the double irish dutch sandwich which is legal see google shifted 23bn to tax haven bermuda in 2017 filing shows but you can read other examples here the tech giants will never pay their fair share of taxes unless we make them and 7 corporate giants accused of evading billions in taxes why does the existence of tax havens matter to us well the simple answer to this question is that just a fraction of the money hidden in tax havens would feed clothe house and provide clean water medical care and educational opportunities to everyone on earth it would eliminate the 100 000 deaths by starvation related diseases each day it would eliminate poverty and homelessness and as one byproduct of having these material needs met it would facilitate the emergence of an informed engaged and empowered human population to tackle the vast range of environmental climate and military threats that currently threaten biosphere collapse and imminent human extinction see human extinction by 2026 a last ditch strategy to fight for human survival as professor prem sikka puts it more simply because of the penetration by financial services executives of the british state including the treasury it deprives people of opportunities to have healthcare education security justice and ultimately a fulfilling life see the spider s web britain s second empire fundamentally then tax havens and their secrecy are at the heart of those elite institutions and processes that functionally undermine democracy and give extraordinary power to certain anonymous individuals and their entities without accountability see the spider s web britain s second empire of course the elites that control the tax haven networks are not about to let this change tax havens are simply too important as part of the global infrastructure for maintaining elite profit power and privilege and for resisting grassroots efforts to bring peace justice and ecological sanity to our world and that is why they are protected by government legislation and legal systems with an army of accountants auditors bankers businesspeople lawyers and politicians ensuring that they remain protected so don t forget laws are designed to control and punish you no matter how trivial your infringement a parking fine a littering offence a petty theft but if you have enough money the law simply does not exist and you can evade taxes legally and in the full knowledge that your vast profits even from immorally acquired wealth such as sex trafficking gun running endangered species trafficking conflict diamonds and drug trafficking are lawful and will escape regulation and oversight of any kind see the rule of law unjust and violent let me give a personal example i have been a war tax resister since 1983 i have a conscientious objection to paying taxes to the australian government to deploy military forces in other countries to kill people in my name so instead of paying taxes to kill for many years i donated the equivalent amount to organizations engaged in peace development environment and human rights work and to pay the rent for my use of indigenous land as some of many outcomes to this conscientious and highly public resistance garnering national media attention at times in 1991 i was bankrupted in 1992 i was convicted of contempt of court for my conscientious refusal to cooperate with the bankruptcy trustee and in 1993 my passport was seized in 1999 i was advised that i will be bankrupt forever because of my ongoing conscientious refusal to finance the killing in the same period since 1983 trillions and trillions of dollars of tax have been illegally and secretly evaded as wealthy individuals and corporations criminals and crime syndicates international organizations and governments channel their incomes and profits through tax havens laws and legal systems throughout the world make this possible and provided it is done correctly it is quite straightforward to avoid any penalties for secretly evading payment of taxes or hiding money acquired through criminal activity but the point as you can see is that tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations meant that many of these individuals and corporations didn t pay taxes to kill people either they just didn t pay taxes at all o f course their motive was personal gain their way was legal they incurred no penalty and of course they didn t pay an equivalent amount to support peace and justice causes more fundamentally however the trillions of dollars they took from the global economy were made by killing and exploiting people and the planet in a significant variety of other ways ranging from sex trafficking gun running conflict diamonds and trafficking in drugs and endangered species to simply starving people to death at the rate of 100 000 people each day by managing the global economy using tax havens as a primary tool to extract maximum profit richard brooks documents how this legal exploitation occurs in another way in his book the great tax robbery how britain became a tax haven for fat cats and big business the vast tax evasion by elites in britain including by diverting funds through tax havens attracts just five prosecutions each year per 1 billion of evasion of direct taxes in contrast benefits fraud by those on unemployment and disability pensions attract 9 000 prosecutions each year per 1 billion of fraud so theft by the poor warrants the full force of the law but not theft by elites who write the law and largely control the political and legal processes in relation to it hence under the guise of relationship taxing that is building a relationship between tax authorities and corporate executives and tailoring tax payments to corporate wishes to the extent the law allows corporations have long known that if you don t like the law we ll see what we can do as is obvious from this example attempts at government reform including to defeat tax havens in the direction of making elites financially and legally accountable both nationally and internationally for the responsibilities which the rest of us cannot escape are invariably for show and in any case achieve zero of substance for example the attempt to approve a blacklist of tax havens at the g20 gathering in 2009 was resisted by the chinese premier on behalf of chinese elites who like other national elites keen to have political control but judicial separation from their offshore centres opposed the listing of notorious havens hong kong and macau see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world the global elite is clearly in control with national governments and international organizations powerlessly doing as instructed so complete is this control in fact that brooks notes that in britain anti tax avoidance laws had to be relaxed to accommodate companies tax avoidance schemes brooks concludes that british taxation policy really had been so comprehensively captured by the world s biggest corporations that screw the poor policies could be written into the statute books at their whim without a pang of conscience being felt anywhere in whitehall clearly however his comment can be applied to virtually any government in the world so does it matter to you that these tax havens exist and do what they do what can be done about tax havens authors such as nicholas shaxson and richard brooks suggest a raft of measures to correct the large number of faults that facilitate the secrecy protection from regulation and tax evasion that individuals corporations organizations criminals and terrorists utilize in tax havens for shaxson these include financial reforms such as blacklisting of tax havens so that their rogue state status is public knowledge greater transparency for example through government sharing of information about the local income and assets of each other s citizens and by requiring multinational corporate activities in each country to be made visible rather than hidden behind international figures promoting the needs of developing countries which need their tax bases protected far more than they need aid or debt relief confronting the british spider s web of tax havens by abolishing the city of london corporation and submerging it into a unified and fully democratic london taxing an entire multinational group as a single unit and then allocating the appropriate amounts of its income out to the different jurisdictions in which it was earned and allow it to be taxed as each jurisdiction decides onshore tax reform such as a land value tax because land cannot be moved offshore and so tax on it must be paid locally and by a direct distribution of mineral wealth in any country to each of its inhabitants who can then be taxed tackling the enablers the accountants lawyers individual bankers businesspeople and not just the clients so that they go to jail rethinking the meaning of corporate responsibility because corporations are given a wealth of capital in public infrastructure an educated and healthy workforce with which to work so that corporations are transparent about their affairs and pay tax as part of their corporate responsibility re evaluating the meaning of corruption insiders abusing the common good in secrecy and getting away with it and so worsening inequality and entrenching vested interests and unaccountable power so that we see more clearly all of the actors and their activities and changing the culture that fawns over people who abuse the system for personal gain see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world and some progress appears to be occurring along lines he suggests for example a version of automatic information exchange aie by which governments make sure that essential information is made available to other jurisdictions as a matter of routine has been discussed by the oecd and while full of loopholes see loophole usa the vortex shaped hole in global financial transparency some commitments have been made for the list of commitments as at november 2018 see aeoi commitments however the usa has not made this commitment and while switzerland for example finds this objectionable see the u s hasn t signed the aeoi agreement reciprocity demanded the reality is that it makes little difference for example ico services which specializes in the formation of offshore companies and offshore banking will assist you to get around the aeoi requirement their website advertises that asset holders need to start looking for alternative jurisdictions for protecting their assets there are some reputable jurisdictions that are still outside the aeoi e g cyprus but u s states of delaware and some others shouldn t be dismissed but if you want a more established name to help you take advantage of a tax haven in the usa you really can t go past rothschild co so to check out what they are offering here is rothschild s primer how to launder money in u s real estate and avoid blacklists moreover the aeoi agreement outlaws bank secrecy but not trust secrecy which dates from the crusades on which the british model is based the trust lies at the core of the british secrecy model so it does not address the cornerstone of british tax haven secrecy and explains why the british were happy to see the cayman islands commit to the aeoi in short the british government would be happy to kill off bank secrecy so that they can capture a larger market share based on trust secrecy see the spider s web britain s second empire separately from this initiative in 2018 the uk parliament enacted a new law requiring its overseas territories including notorious tax havens like bermuda the cayman islands and the british virgin islands to start disclosing the owners of corporations they register by 2020 in theory this could shut down a huge amount of offshore tax evasion and other financial crimes because individuals from anywhere in the world including the united states have long been able to set up secret corporations in these tax havens to stash their money see new uk law may shut down the biggest tax havens aside from the u s however while the report pointed out that the new law obviously does not impact the usa or of course switzerland or and the easy rerouting options available if these havens are effectively or even actually shut down it failed to mention that this initiative does not in any way address the city of london corporation so the impact of this initiative must be very limited unless it is followed by some pretty drastic initiatives in westminster washington bern and elsewhere in summary while one cannot disagree with any of shaxson s fine suggestions or be displeased that public pressure has led to some effort being made by the oecd and the uk parliament to address elements of the tax haven scourge the reality is that the extent of the changes necessary are not going to happen without enormous grassroots pressure strategically applied and they are very unlikely to happen as reforms of the existing capitalist system this is simply because the global elite is solidly in control of the institutions and processes of global capitalism including its compliant governments and international organizations and will readily stymie any attempt at serious reform of tax havenry particularly given the number of major reforms needed and the number of nations in which these reforms must be enacted to state two obvious examples the city of london corporation has not existed for 1 000 years because it has no defense and the changes noted above have only made the us more attractive as a secrecy jurisdiction meanwhile with the aim of promoting financial innovation switzerland has recently made things easier for smaller financial technology companies thus making tax havenry more attractive to those who might not have otherwise considered it see swiss watchdog to propose looser anti money laundering rules for fintechs so given that most tax havens are protected by host government legislation and there is no international mechanism to control them the tax haven industry generally is not under threat of being held to account in any significant way and despite the more elaborate explanation offered above there is a simple reason for this unofficially of course illegal money laundered through tax havens has become an essential and sometimes stabilizing element of the global financial system see drug money saved banks in global crisis claims un advisor so what can we do that will make a difference given the deeply entrenched and long standing nature of this problem clearly it needs to be addressed at various levels fundamentally we can nurture our children so that we do not destroy their conscience see my promise to children remember all of those corrupt criminal accountants bankers businesspeople priests and popes lawyers and politicians that kept creeping up in the discussion above the people who maintain the entire infrastructure that allows tax havens to exist and those who manage and profit from it too do they care about you do they care about the people in africa asia and central south america who starve as a result of the types of policies that allow tax havens to exist and function do they care about those driven into poverty and homelessness in modern industrial economies because vast sums are drained out of them and hidden in secrecy jurisdictions do they care about the people killed by the military and other violence from which they profit and then hide the proceeds to evade tax do they care about the earth fundamentally do they care about themselves of course not but this is only because they are extraordinarily psychologically damaged individuals see the global elite is insane revisited with a more complete explanation in why violence and fearless psychology and fearful psychology principles and practice if we inflict enormous violence on a child throughout their childhood to compel their obedience how can we expect them to grow up to lead a life of integrity based on their conscience courage compassion empathy and love those who use tax havens are truly poor little rich boys and girls see love denied the psychology of materialism violence and war and why set up a shell company in panama the psychology driving illicit financial flows beyond tackling the problem at its source however we can also tackle manifestations of the problem but not by lobbying elites and their political agents there are no votes in it in any case to control this depravity for which they are well rewarded for a start we can boycott all of the major private banks in favor of those smaller or member owned banks that have a serious commitment to peace justice and ecological sustainability or we can seek out equivalent institutions like credit unions we can also create public banks based on ethical principles see what are public banks and how do they operate an introduction we can boycott large corporations like amazon apple gap google ikea microsoft and starbucks that use tax havens none of these corporations is a monopoly there are alternatives which can be investigated and employed assuming we can t go without some version of the product or service they offer whenever you can find a locally owned outlet that offers a local product or service we can boycott the catholic church god does not ask that you morally or financially support a corrupt organization that doesn t understand or represent morality and spirituality remember it was jesus who threw the moneychangers out of the temple if our conscience speaks loudly enough we can decline employment by any organization that is unethical such as those that use tax havens we can refuse to gamble refuse to buy the services of a sex worker who might even be illegally trafficked into the work refuse to buy the products of endangered species see for example killing elephants for pet food condemned and refuse to use illicit drugs these products and services are virtually always offered by industries controlled by criminal organizations so by buying them you are only harming yourself and or other people or species about whom you could choose to exercise a duty of care while also not contributing to the diversion of financial resources into tax havens we can encourage unions with members who work for organizations using tax havens to take a stand on the issue we can support existing organizations that work on the problem preferably those that offer grassroots alternatives the tax justice network an activist think tank and its sister organization the global alliance for tax justice campaign for systemic change if we are genuinely ambitious we can develop comprehensive nonviolent strategies to compel particular individuals and organizations to desist from using tax havens or even compel countries to close down tax havens see nonviolent campaign strategy this can easily be part of a larger strategy to transform the global economy into one that satisfies human and ecological needs particularly given the imminence of biosphere collapse as noted above see the flame tree project to save life on earth if violence and exploitation in all of their guises concern you consider signing the online pledge of the people s charter to create a nonviolent world so here is a final question for you to consider what might the world look like if all those trillions of dollars were being shared and spent where they are most needed

brexit has been confounding u s investors for nearly three years and the fog in london quite frankly isn t likely to lift soon no one of course can forecast the outcome of the highly complex politically charged trade portion of negotiations between the united kingdom and the european union but it s essential for u s investors and consumers to understand what s at risk as we move closer to the march 29 exit deadline first some basics the historic vote by britons to leave the union it joined 43 years earlier took place in late june 2016 the british government began the formal process to withdraw from the eu in 2017 eu rules provided for a two year period of negotiation britain s exit from the continent s political and economic bloc involved determining how to handle everything from how much money the u k contributes going forward to the eu to how people and products move between eu countries and the u k and other issues that period ends march 29 unless an extension is agreed to by the parties while the discussions are sensitive many financial experts say the odds are better that a chaotic brexit won t take place march 29 where britain would suddenly leave the eu the really negative scenario is closer on the calendar but a lot less likely said bill adams vice president and senior economist for the pnc financial services group a series of votes scheduled beginning tuesday creates more hope he said that britain will not be stuck in a no deal situation on march 29 even so others warn it may be a close call many remain unclear about what happens next even if a no deal situation is avoided from doomsday to eh the really negative scenario is a no deal brexit or what is known as a hard brexit that happens if the government has not agreed to a customs union or common standards to allow free movement of goods by march 29 it is a doomsday scenario where according to the bank of england forecast the u k nosedives into a severe recession triggering a collapse that would be worse than the financial crisis of 2008 not surprisingly not all the experts in britain agree that markets would collapse even so fear is building that there could be some shortages of produce and medicine if supply chains are abruptly disrupted warnings of chaos and mayhem crop up frequently a hard brexit could lead to a sizable recession in ireland experts say northern ireland which is part of the u k and the republic of ireland which has been an independent country since 1922 now benefit from a frictionless flow of goods and services under the existing agreement but there s a great deal of concern about what can happen next and there are fears of a mild recession in the eu countries and a serious global slowdown that would be a blow to many companies in the united states as well adams said one concern a hard brexit could weaken or drive down the value of the british pound drive up the u s dollar and make the imported products sold in the united states cheaper making it tougher for american companies to compete adams said here s a look at more brexit scenarios and their potential impact on companies and consumers in the united states no deal brexit would hit ford hard the exposure to a no deal brexit raises risks significantly for some major michigan companies including some in the auto industry take ford motor co for example which has said a no brexit deal would be catastrophic for the u k auto industry and ford s manufacturing operations there the total cost to us of a hard brexit not including currency exchange related effects could be 500 million to 1 billion in 2019 according to statements in the ford annual report released feb 21 ford which is a top selling automotive brand in britain operates two engine plants in britain the plants supply other ford plants in the european union and elsewhere the biggest risk surrounds the hard brexit scenario because the u k would lose access on march 29 to free trade agreements for goods and services with the eu and other countries frictionless free trade has enabled automakers to run just in time arrangements that include importing components as part of the manufacturing process automakers fear is the possibility of custom delays and tariffs as well as declining demand ford said it will take whatever action is necessary to preserve the competitiveness of its european business however given the political deadlock in the u k parliament we have no choice but to trigger our contingency planning to try and mitigate the damage of a no deal brexit said john gardiner director of communications at ford of britain this includes but is not limited to protecting vehicle and parts supply and increasing customs resources in the short term and a fundamental reassessment of our operations in the u k moving forward he said it is vital that any u k eu trade deal maintains frictionless trade so that the auto industry can plan and remain competitive for the long term gardiner said a hard brexit could result in trading with eu countries on world trade organization rules which might mean that british auto makers would face a 10 percent tariff on all car exports to the eu and it s possible that cars made in the eu and sold in the u k would face a 10 percent tariff a hard brexit could result in tariffs on auto components too component tariffs under wto can range between 2 percent to 4 percent and engines at 4 5 percent but there are rumors the british government could unilaterally cut some tariffs on auto components to limit a hard brexit s harm to its domestic auto industry what we are sure of is that a hard brexit would cause severe delays in moving goods across the border between the uk and eu due to customs infrastructure bottlenecks adams said these delays would be extremely disruptive to british manufacturers who are accustomed to bringing in components from the rest of the eu as easily as detroit car makers bring in transmissions from toledo adams said the possible introduction of wto tariffs would severely impact ford s operations especially in the u k the company said a hard brexit as ford stated in its annual report would likely result in a significant reduction in industry volumes in the united kingdom increased tariffs on u k imports and exports and delays at the u k border ford said it was still hopeful that a u k eu deal will be reached impact on gm fca may be less severe general motors which sold its european division to french automaker psa groupe in 2017 does not refer to brexit in its annual report because exposure for gm is minimal gm s decision a few years ago to sell the germany based opel and u k based vauxhall brands was part of an effort to exit markets where it wasn t making money or where it had a small market share fiat chrysler automobiles stated in its annual report released feb 22 although we do not believe brexit including a no deal brexit would have a direct material impact on our operations or materially impact our tax expense a no deal brexit or the terms of the final withdrawal agreement may result in greater restrictions on imports and exports between the u k and eu countries a fluctuation in currency exchange rates and additional regulatory complexity which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations fiat chrysler also noted among other things that brexit has also inspired certain political parties within other eu member states to consider withdrawal and raised the possibility of referendums on continued eu membership in other eu member states any of these events along with any political economic and regulatory changes that may occur could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations in europe according to the fiat chrysler annual report more ford stock shifts as wall street looks to what s next with volkswagen more with credit card debt up 7 5 next financial disaster could be you others are bringing up brexit too even seating supplier lear faces uncertainties southfield based automotive seating supplier lear corp noted in its most recent annual report that the company has significant operations in both the u k and the eu in 2018 our united kingdom and european union excluding the united kingdom sales totaled 1 3 billion and 6 1 billion respectively the report stated our supply chain and that of our customers are highly integrated across the united kingdom and the european union and we are highly dependent on the free flow of goods in those regions lear stated the ongoing uncertainty and potential re imposition of border controls and customs duties on trade between the united kingdom and european union nations could negatively impact our competitive position supplier and customer relationships and financial performance the report stated what s the likely cost for lear the annual report doesn t offer an estimate noting that much will depend on the specific terms of any agreement the united kingdom and the european union reach to provide access to each other s respective markets what does brexit means to your wallet for the typical american consumer there s not going to be a big effect of brexit said kyle handley assistant professor of business economics and public policy at the university of michigan ross school of business for u s firms it s actually a lot more complex handley said trade has become a scapegoat when people are upset about their wages or the lack of jobs brexit is part of a backlash against globalization he said as well as international trade the process involved with creating new trading relationships and rules though causes problems for businesses trying to determine where to build factories or hire workers for companies he said it can become more costly and complex to operate in the u k without tariff free access between the u k and the rest of europe the uncertainty has already driven some companies to shift operations out of the u k prepare for potential problems or put some projects and investments on hold battle creek based kellogg for example noted in its annual report with the uncertainty of the united kingdom exiting the european union commonly referred to as brexit we have begun preparations to proactively prepare for the potential adverse impacts of brexit such as delays at ports of entry and departure as a result we incurred pre tax charges of 3 million for the year ended december 29 2018 u s investors in general need to keep an eye on brexit news and warnings of any potential costs we shouldn t forget that stock prices on wall street tumbled dramatically back in late june 2016 when britons vote to leave the eu initially shocked global markets the u k found itself on the turbulent path to become the first country to leave the european union rocky times on wall street though ended fairly soon as a result 401 k investors who held on enjoyed breaking one record after another for the dow jones industrial average the dow closed at around 17 140 points within days of the u k news in june 2017 the dow was trading around 26 000 on march 1 and dropped back to around 25 700 on march 6 brexit is something that u s investors need to pay attention to since a messy brexit would likely cause further economic weakness in the u k and europe which hurts u s economic growth at the margin said christopher m ruth senior portfolio manager for key private bank in toledo many s p 500 companies do considerable business in the u k and europe auto companies aren t the only ones at risk other u s industries with significant u k and europe exposure include technology communication services health care and industrial companies stocks in such industries could face more volatility on concerns about lower demand for their products and services could brexit cut your 401 k in half many experts say the outlook isn t quite that dire i believe the current brexit uncertainly is unlikely to have any significant and lasting impact on u s stock prices said david sowerby managing director and portfolio manager for cleveland based ancora advisors sowerby noted that the initial referendum that passed in late june 2016 did not have any lasting negative impact on the u s stock market if there were to be any industries in the u s negatively impacted it would be marginal sowerby said perhaps he said there would be some impact on export growth for aircraft machinery and to a lesser extent motor vehicles will brexit drive the u s economy off a cliff unlikely economists maintain brexit does continue to create a great deal of uncertainty but it s just one factor and some say unlikely to trigger an economic downturn in the united states we don t see anything in particular that investors should do leading toward brexit said roger aliaga diaz chief economist of the americas for the vanguard group in valley forge pennsylvania the reality is that no one knows exactly when or what version of brexit may happen in the end aliaga diaz said additionally if a second referendum occurs the odds for a no brexit could rise significantly aliaga diaz said the united states economy is projected to grow at a rate of 2 percent in 2019 compared to 3 percent in 2018 while the economy is likely to slow down he said a u s recession is not anticipated to hit in 2019 he said we re more likely to see a soft landing for the economy contactsusan tompor at313 222 8876 or stompor freepress com follow her on twitter tompor read more on business and sign up for our business

on the struggles of america s working class and the rise of donald trump the number crunchers often get confused they ll say there s no crisis of economic mobility they ll say there s no stagnation of wages among blue collar workers and in the realm of politics they ll say that donald trump s base while reacting to his proclamation that the american dream was dead had no legitimate grievances that s because the number crunchers too often see individuals in too abstract a context as rows or cells on a spreadsheet to be sorted by individual traits such as age sex or income they fail to see people as they actually live in places as members of a community with a particular location on our globe it s the fatal abstraction once we look at people in places we see a much more complicated picture we see that many parts of america have incredible economic mobility but many regions are dreadful on that score we see that the places most affected by trade with china have seen serious wage drops and unemployment spikes for blue collar men and plenty of worse consequences that follow and we see that even if donald trump s earliest supporters were doing fine on paper they were living in places that were not doing fine start with how trade affects certain places in america the free market story of free trade says that all involved nations benefit when they reduce trade barriers between them this is true the united states economy as a whole is richer thanks to freer trade by one estimate our economy made an extra 2 trillion from trade liberalization since the 1950s but free trade was always going to produce some losers in the u s low skilled workers in manufacturing suffer because that manufacturing shifts to cheaper overseas locales the lower prices of goods though free up consumer money to spend on new goods or services to be produced presumably by the ex factory workers even if at a slightly lower wage never gonna be anything here visit the monongahela valley where the wheeling pittsburgh steel factory used to operate though and you ll see things didn t work out that way main street in fayette city is crumbling andrew duda sr used to work at the steel mill he was at vargo s newsstand practically the only business open on main street when i visited in 2016 just drive down through the river roads his son andrew duda jr said from here through monessen it s all shut down areas like this the clerk at vargo s piped in there s never gonna be anything here the senior duda an old union guy used to be a democrat but in 2016 he was fully behind trump when trump talks about the trade deals he s a hundred percent right that nafta that was the worst thing even before nafta and china s entry into the world trade organization international competition helped kill the wheeling pittsburgh plant and countless others the result wasn t merely lower wages in the mon valley it was economic and social devastation including high unemployment more men on disability more drug abuse and even more babies out of wedlock trade shocks hit some places hard economist david autor of mit focusing on the later more dramatic trade shock caused by china found rather than modestly reducing wage levels among low skill workers nationally these shocks catalyze significant falls in employment rates within trade impacted local labor markets autor has also found that the places in america exposed to competition with chinese manufacturing also saw more deaths more men on disability and less marriage that is the u s economy got cheaper goods and some factory towns got destroyed economist raj chetty has produced very different studies with a very similar theme where you live dramatically effects how you end up places themselves have causal impacts is how economist melissa kearney summed it up economic mobility is not really decreasing in america most of the numbers show some economists hold this up as evidence that the working class and poor aren t really stuck but chetty dug into the numbers on a local level and found very uneven levels of opportunity and mobility america may still be the land of opportunity he found but it s really many lands of opportunity and many other lands of hopelessness chetty writes intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the u s a kid born into the bottom quintile in salt lake city has an excellent chance one in ten of reaching the top quintile that same kid born in charlotte has only a 4 4 chance families and communities matter what distinguishes the places with the best mobility from those with the worst school spending or progressive taxation don t make much of a difference the data suggests the two biggest factors are the percentage of kids raised by intact families and the area s score on measures of social capital civic participation number of churches amount of volunteering and so on that is places with strong communities and strong families provide the most opportunity finally there s the question of trump my new book alienated america explores why people believe the american dream is dead and how that belief contributed to trump s instant explosion onto the political scene in mid 2015 different studies of trump s core voters turned up different results we found little evidence to suggest individual economic distress benefited trump one typical study proclaimed one study at vox com explained that science disproved the common sentiment that poor white americans came out in droves to put trump over the top in 2016 but a different study published at fivethirtyeight found trump significantly outperformed romney in counties where residents had lower credit scores and in counties where more men have stopped working the same researcher found more subprime loans more trump support more residents receiving disability payments more trump support lower earnings among full time workers more trump support plenty others found the same thing so how to explain the difference between the studies that found economic woe behind trump s win and those that found nothing of the sort the studies that denied the connection between economic woe and trump were studies of individuals the studies that saw that connection were studies of places it can be easy if you live in a well connected community in a thriving locality as so many of our academics commentators and politicians do and if you only study the topline aggregate data to miss what s going on beneath the surface and on the other side of the tracks the true story of america today is that we are a great country with many struggling places
mario draghi president of the european central bank ecb right and vitor constancio vice president of the european central bank ecb make notes during a news conference u s investors swarmed into sovereign debt and fled the volatility of stock markets on thursday after europe s central bank cut its gdp forecast rekindling fears that a slowdown overseas could send shock waves into the american economy money managers sought the relative safety of government debt after the european central bank s revised its euro area 2019 gdp expectations to 1 1 percent from 1 7 percent sending rates down across the board in europe the yield on the 10 year german bund was cut in half from 13 basis points to about 6 5 basis points while rates on italian debt fell as much as 19 basis points the yield on the 10 year u s treasury which has tended to mimic recent moves in german bunds fell 4 basis points but where the ecb took investors mostly by surprise was in its decision to announce a new round of stimulus and push back its timeline for future rate hikes at least through the end of 2019 it also lowered its inflation projection to 1 2 percent well below its target rate of just under 2 percent ecb president mario draghi didn t try to sugarcoat the situation either telling reporters thursday morning that the weakening in economic data points to a sizable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that will extend into the current year u s stocks which have outperformed their overseas peers for years swooned amid the ecb headlines both the s p 500 and the dow jones industrial average fell more than 1 percent following the forecast cut putting american stocks on track for their worst week of the year while it was no surprise to us the ecb has finally recognized how sick their economy is said andrew brenner of national alliance equities have finally woken up to the fact that the reason the fed is on hold is because of the awful outlook of the global economies unlike peers europe has used the ecb s easy monetary policy as a crutch to boost growth since the financial crisis the u s federal reserve in contrast has hiked rates several times over the past few years as the american economy collected itself in the aftermath of the recession the fed raised its overnight lending rate 25 basis points in december and has reduced the size of its massive balance sheet of mortgage backed securities and u s debt u s economic growth has thus far remained insulated from international economic turmoil in china and europe posting a gain of 2 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 that s given u s economists some comfort that the fed could move to lower borrowing costs in the future if the largest economy in the world faces another downturn us 10 year treasury yield vs german 10 year bund yield source factset i think what s interesting is that treasurys are keeping up with even with trade war fears subsiding global growth is becoming a bigger factor said priya misra head of global rates strategy at td securities they didn t leave anything in their back pocket misra added if i m the ecb i m really hoping today is enough to provide a floor the ecb s decision to introduce a new series of long term refinancing operations will offer cheap loans to euro area banks the so called tltros are aimed to create better credit conditions for customers which in turn helps drive europe s economy some like italian economist and bocconi university professor tommaso monacelli argued that europe s continued need for the type of support seen throughout the financial crisis is a troubling sign for europe s economy in a nutshell the tltro iii decision signals very strongly that the ecb has bleak forecasts on the evolution of the economy in 2019 20 monacelli wrote in an email the announced tltro iii will be the third injection of stimulus of this kind from the ecb but barring the new stimulus ecb president mario draghi said in a press conference that risks to the economy remain more generally it is obvious that a slowdown of growth is coming with ecb interest rates still at zero monacelli added that will put a disproportionate share of the required stimulus on the array of unconventional measures such as forward guidance and tltro whose effectiveness at stimulating economic activity is very doubtful cnbc s patti domm contributed reporting

cnn when felice robinson was hired at general motors lordstown plant in 1995 she thought the rest of her life was taken care of robinson who was then in her mid 20s had been bouncing around a series of low paid retail jobs when she learned the giant factory down the road was hiring the assembly line position came with generous health care benefits an hourly wage more than twice what she had been making at a menswear store and the promise of a secure retirement if she could hold on to the job for 30 years it was a whole different world robinson who s now 50 told cnn business in late february i couldn t believe how lucky i was to be making that kind of money without a college degree that world has been evaporating for decades now on wednesday when the lordstown plant will make its last chevy cruze and close its doors it will get even smaller for gm the move is part of an overall strategy to shift away from sedans and toward higher margin trucks and light suvs in an era of low gas prices gm is also pouring money into electric and autonomous cars which are still primarily in the research and development phase and with gm s investment in a ridesharing platform called maven the company is looking forward to a future in which fewer people own vehicles at all for workers the transition means uncertainty dislocation and immersion in a labor market with far fewer opportunities for those without training beyond a high school degree as recently as the early 2000s a job in an auto plant could be a launchpad to the middle class but those jobs are increasingly rare during the lordstown plant s heyday in the 1970s gm was one of the biggest private sector employers in the united states with more than 618 000 employees that number is now down to about 103 000 and the jobs that remain are not all what they once were since 1990 wages for us auto workers have declined 18 adjusted for inflation retirement benefits have declined as well as of 2017 only 8 of factories offered pensions those trends are especially pronounced in the youngstown ohio region an area about halfway between cleveland and pittsburgh in which lordstown sits thirty years ago about 1 out of 4 local workers were employed by the manufacturing industry now less than half that many are since the beginning of the great recession real hourly earnings have dropped by 8 in the area while rising 11 in the rest of the country all that has made gm jobs stick out full time production workers make between 61 000 and 88 000 a year after only a couple years on the job according to their united auto workers union contract not including additional overtime pay and bonuses that s well above the average wage in the youngstown area which was around 38 000 in 2017 unlike during the great recession gm is cutting these jobs along with about 1 400 more hourly positions at us plants elsewhere at a time when it s profitable and the national economy is strong that s an indication that gm sees its future as one with fewer factory floor workers not more of them and for the youngstown area losing the last major supplier of the type of jobs that made it a manufacturing powerhouse decades ago is a particularly symbolic blow about 400 of the 1 400 people who ll no longer go to work at gm s sprawling lordstown complex after this week have accepted transfers to other plants and will keep their healthcare and pensions other former workers at the plant which used to run 24 hours a day were not as fortunate as demand for the cruze weakened over the past two years its second and third shifts were cut and 3 000 people were laid off many of them won t be offered the same transfer opportunities this latest group will gm says that 350 lordstown workers are eligible for retirement those who transfer will get 30 000 in relocation assistance and that it s working to find new employment for anyone who wants it we understand that the decision that was made is very difficult for this community because it impacts people and families gm spokesman daniel flores told cnn business unfortunately customers are not buying the product at a volume that would justify continued production in the end we made this decision at a point in time where we have the ability to offer opportunities to people who want to keep working for gm robinson thinks she probably has enough seniority to get a placement at one of gm s other facilities like the metal fabrication plant in cleveland or the transmission factory in toledo she dreads transferring she ll have to leave her 68 year old aunt who needs support as well as the rest of her family and friends and the town she s always called home but she has little choice despite the strongest us labor market in a generation the economy is not generating the types of jobs that gm offered her as a young woman at least not in youngstown they have me by a chokehold there s nothing i can do robinson said i make 32 an hour i m not going to go get a 12 an hour job i couldn t survive on that at all i m going to get up and go ride it out try to get the best gig i can get and be done with them the good old days the loss of general motors won t be the first time the youngstown area took a shock to the heart it s been reeling ever since the sudden collapse of the local steel industry in the late 1970s when competition from cheap imports and the failure of american steel mills to compete led to the disappearance of nearly 50 000 jobs over five years through that time the auto industry became something of a lifeline the lordstown plant which opened in 1966 hired thousands of workers and thousands more worked in smaller independent machine shops that supplied auto parts to gm the gm plant floated the local government providing some 2 million a year in tax revenue said terry armstrong superintendent of the lordstown school district the lordstown school campus with its spacious lecture halls and a planetarium was built without debt the unionized jobs paid far above market topping out in the 30 an hour range for reasonably humane tasks like installing seatbelt harnesses securing engine brakes or driving forklifts former gm worker tom albright who retired in 2015 remembers being able to do his work faster than the rest of the line and then relax i could get ahead of the job for three hours and at that point i could go goof off for three hours said albright whose son still works in the plant those were the good old days it ain t like that anymore they get every nickel that they can out of that individual working that job on the floor but then cracks started to show in the us auto industry starting with competition from japanese automakers in the 1980s and continuing with nafta in 1994 employment slid as work was outsourced to lower paying suppliers including plants in mexico the lordstown plant wasn t immune to the changes that have been affecting the workforce more broadly in 2007 as the automakers were bleeding cash the union accepted the creation of a lower wage tier for entry level workers meaning that they made 45 less per hour and got a 401 k plan instead of a guaranteed pension after gm s bankruptcy in 2009 workers told cnn business the job became harder with management pressing for less downtime slowly but surely they became less and less thoughtful about the people who worked for them said robinson it s just not the same company that i used to work for it s so much more cutthroat and it s meaner i know that the old gm is gone but many in the community still recognize that those jobs feed families donate to local charities and buy cars they also generate other jobs since manufacturing brings in capital from outside the area rather than just recirculating it each factory position is estimated to get three or four more people working in fields like healthcare food service retail and education that s why last fall the united auto workers local 1112 and the region s chamber of commerce started the drive it home campaign a community effort to post signs send letters and work with politicians to convince gm to build another product at the lordstown plant it was meant to mimic another push two decades ago when lordstown was in competition with other cities to win another car model to replace the chevy cavalier that one worked with the help of officials at the plant who joined the effort the one difference is that this time plant management was not interested in participating said james dignan president of the youngstown warren regional chamber the plant management used to be very engaged locally but they re losing some of that tie and that feel from the company to the community dignan said they re working to get another user for the plant if gm decides to give it up permanently but to the local union workers getting another gm product is far preferable to getting another company these are their jobs and they ll likely still have more protections and higher wages than any other employer we don t want elon musk coming in we don t want amazon building a distribution center said david green who s been president of uaw local 1112 since last may he led another local within the plant in 2007 when the company asked to pay new workers lower wages i supported that because the promise was product and job security green said do what we had to do to keep working keep our communities and our families alive and thriving it feels like they betrayed us a little bit so far the company hasn t shown its cards and the uncertainty is what gets to people why take a transfer if it seems likely that lordstown will get a new car within the next year and you could come back for that matter what new employer would take a chance on someone who would bail as soon as lordstown re opened plenty of people remember how gm re opened its plant in spring hill tennessee in 2011 after having shuttered it two years earlier that s why for those who have the option the choice of whether to go or stay is so agonizing even though the job had its fair share of hardships tammy vennitti 55 was laid off with the second shift back in june last year she had signed up for a training course in order to keep her supplemental unemployment benefits and then put those plans on hold in january when gm called back those who d been laid off to fill in for the people who were being moved out to other plants vennitti applied for a transfer to a plant in toledo and she doesn t know if she ll get it or whether she d take it if she did given that she lives with her 27 year old daughter and 18 month old granddaughter but she needs the healthcare benefits to pay for the blood pressure pills her doctor put her on during the stress of being laid off for months not to mention care for a body that took a beating over 24 years of lifting 30 to 40 pounds 400 times a day gm s gold plated insurance paid for a shoulder replacement carpal tunnel surgery and cortizone shots for a knee that had no more cartilage to cushion her bones for 24 years i ve done nothing for this company and this union but bend over vennitti said this is all i ve ever done i never thought it would come to this the jobs of the future what s next for employment in youngstown the local chamber of commerce said there are 13 000 job openings in the area team neo an economic development non profit focused on northeast ohio said there will be strong demand in the coming years for workers in information technology healthcare and manufacturing but unlike the manufacturing jobs of the past which usually did not require education beyond high school 65 of those jobs will require a post secondary credential by 2021 the group estimates there are plenty of training opportunities since gm workers get assistance both from the state and the us department of commerce through trade adjustment assistance so far there s been strong interest in truck driving certificates an ohio state official said since those take only a few weeks to get and pay relatively well some workers saw the end coming early and took steps to prepare trish amato 43 was hired too late to get a traditional pension lessening the need to hang on to a gm job she used gm s tuition benefits to finish her bachelor s degree and get a master s degree in special education when she was laid off in 2018 amato thought about going to the plant at spring hill tennessee but she and her partner whose truck driving job also depends on lordstown being open didn t think they could afford the rent in the booming area south of nashville so instead they re thinking of trading in his big rig for a motorhome and traveling the country while she teaches online courses from the road a future that wouldn t have been possible without gm s help in going to school and that she wouldn t have embraced without gm shuttering the lordstown plant gm is hard to walk away from because the insurance benefits are awesome amato said gm gave us a good life am i disappointed in what they re doing for other people yes for me no if something like this didn t happen i wouldn t be able to follow a dream for the next generation the question is what kind of wages the new working class jobs will pay the local high school has started a training program for the logistics industry helping prepare kids for jobs in the many distribution centers that are popping up in the area that s our way of giving kids a little bit of a leg up said armstrong superintendent of the lordstown school district where about 15 of students have parents who worked in the plant but he said i don t see them paying what the gm jobs paid tj maxx for example is building a facility that will employ 1 000 people in the area job listings for entry level warehouse workers at its other locations range between 10 and 13 50 an hour the gm plant had also been a regular stop for politicians on the stump from john mccain to barack obama giving kids a sense that their town mattered on tuesday the school held a group photo to support the drive it home campaign students and staff alike wore blue and brought their gm cars but after this latest blow will lordstown students have confidence in a future in manufacturing it would be really hard to convince many of them of that right now with the plant closing armstrong said they re able to make the cars of the future we just have to make that chance available

us goods trade deficit surges to a record high in 2018 the trade deficit exploded last year despite the trump administration efforts to make america great again and the trend is unlikely to get any better in 2019 said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the us goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand fueled by lower taxes pulled in imports despite the trump administration s america first policies including tariffs aimed at shrinking the trade gap president donald trump is pursuing a protectionist trade agenda to shield u s manufacturing from what he says is unfair foreign competition trump who has dubbed himself the tariff man pledged on both the campaign trail and as president to reduce the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements the commerce department said on wednesday that a 12 4 percent jump in the goods deficit in december had contributed to the record 891 3 billion goods trade shortfall last year the overall trade deficit surged 12 5 percent to 621 0 billion in 2018 the largest since 2008 the trade deficit exploded last year despite the trump administration efforts to make america great again and the trend is unlikely to get any better in 2019 said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the white house has argued that reducing the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to its goal of 3 percent on a sustainable basis the government also sought to stimulate the economy with a 1 5 trillion tax cut package which jolted both consumer and business spending helping to lift imported goods to a record 2 6 trillion in 2018 the united states last year imposed tariffs on 250 billion worth of goods imported from china with beijing hitting back with duties on 110 billion worth of american products including soybeans and other commodities trump has delayed tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports as negotiations to resolve the eight month trade war continue businesses likely stocked up on imports in anticipation of further duties on chinese goods which ironically contributed to the deterioration in the trade deficit last year the goods trade deficit with china increased 11 6 percent to an all time high of 419 2 billion in 2018 the united states which also slapped duties on imported steel aluminum solar panels and washing machines had record imports from 60 countries in 2018 led by china mexico and germany perhaps donald trump will now discover that tweets and bluster alone won t dramatically shrink the trade deficit said scott paul president of the alliance for american manufacturing in washington the administration s fiscal policies have helped to boost the trade deficit while goods exports hit a record 1 7 trillion in 2018 they declined in the last three months of the year weighed by the u s china trade dispute slowing global demand and a strong dollar which is making american made goods less competitive on the international market the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading lower as investors awaited fresh developments on the trade negotiations labor market slowing economists expect exports to remain weak even if washington and beijing strike a trade deal that will take time and if the chinese growth is as soft as most economists believe it is hard to see how they can ramp up demand for u s products very much this year said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania a 1 9 drop in exports of goods and services drove the trade deficit in december to 59 8 billion the largest since october 2008 imports of goods and services increased 2 1 percent to 264 9 billion in december when adjusted for inflation the goods trade deficit surged 10 0 billion to a record 91 6 billion in december the jump in the so called real goods trade deficit suggests that the drag from trade on fourth quarter gross domestic product growth was probably bigger than the 0 22 percentage point estimated by the government last week economists expect the government will revise down fourth quarter gdp growth to a 2 3 percent annualized rate from the 2 6 percent it reported last thursday other data on wednesday suggested some slowing in the labor market though the pace of job gains remains more than enough to drive the unemployment rate down the adp national employment report showed private payrolls increased by 183 000 in february after surging 300 000 in january economists polled by reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 189 000 in february the adp report which is jointly developed with moody s analytics was published ahead of the government s more comprehensive employment report for february scheduled for release on friday the adp report is not considered a reliable predictor of the private payrolls portion of the government s employment report because of differences in methodology february s report was however in line with other labor market data including weekly applications for unemployment benefits and manufacturing and services sector surveys that have suggested some moderation in job growth following hefty gains in january it looks broadly consistent with our view that job growth remained solid in february despite cooling from the boomy figures reported for the prior several months said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york according to a reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180 000 jobs in february after jumping 304 000 in january the unemployment rate is forecast falling to 3 9 percent in february from 4 0 percent in january
the recolonization of latin america and the war on venezuela by james petras the western hemisphere is our region michael pompei us secretary of state introduction march 06 2019 information clearing house not since the us pronounced the monroe doctrine proclaiming its imperial supremacy over latin america nearly 200 years ago has a white house regime so openly affirmed its mission to recolonize latin america the second decade of the 21st century has witnessed in word and deed the most thorough and successful us recolonization of latin america and its active and overt role as colonial sepoys of an imperial power in this paper we will examine the process of recolonization and the strategy tactics and goals which are the driving forces of colony building we will conclude by discussing the durability stability and washington s capacity to retain ownership of the hemisphere a brief history of 20th century colonization and decolonization us colonization of latin america was based on direct us military economic cultural and political interventions with special emphasis on central america north america mexico and the caribbean washington resorted to military invasions to impose favorite trade and investment advantages and appointed and trained local military forces to uphold colonial rule and to ensure submission to us regional and global supremacy the us challenged rival european colonial powers in particular england and germany and eventually reduced them to marginal status through military and economic pressure and threats the recolonization process suffered severe setbacks in some regions and nations with the onset of the great depression which undermined the us military and economic presence and facilitated the rise of powerful nationalist regimes and movements in particular in argentina brazil chile nicaragua and cuba the process of decolonization led to and included the nationalization of us oil fields sugar and mining sectors a shift in foreign policy toward relatively greater independence and labor laws which increased workers rights and leftwing unionization the us victory in world war ii and its economic supremacy led washington to re assert its colonial rule in the western hemisphere the latin american regimes lined up with washington in the cold and hot wars backing the us wars against china korea vietnam and the confrontation against the ussr and eastern europe are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter for washington working through its colonized dictatorial regimes invaded every sector of the economy especially agro minerals it proceeded to dominate markets and sought to impose colonized trade unions run by the imperial centered afl cio by the early 1960 s a wave of popular nationalist and socialist social movements challenged the colonial order led by the cuban revolution and accompanied by nationalist governments throughout the continent including argentina bolivia venezuela peru ecuador and the dominican republic us multi national manufacturing firms were forced to engage in joint ventures or were nationalized as were oil mineral and energy sectors nationalists proceeded to substitute local products for imports as a development strategy a process of decolonization was underway the us reacted by launching a war to recolonize latin america by through military coups invasions and rigged elections latin america once more lined up with the us in support of its economic boycott of cuba and the repression of nationalist governments the us reversed nationalist policies and denationalized their economies under the direction of us controlled so called international financial organizations like the international monetary fund imf world bank wb inter american development bank the recolonization process advanced throughout the 1970 s and 1980 s under the auspices of newly imposed military regimes and the new neo liberal free market doctrine once again recolonization led to highly polarized societies in which the domestic colonized elites were a distinct minority moreover the colonial economic doctrine allowed the us banks and investors to plunder the latin countries impose out of control debt burdens de industrialization of the economies severe increases in unemployment and a precipitous decline in living standards by the early years of the 21st century deepening colonization led to an economic crisis and the resurgence of mass movements and new waves of nationalist popular movements which sought to reverse at least in part the colonial relationship and structures colonial debts were renegotiated or written off a few foreign firms were nationalized taxes were increased on agro exporters increases in public welfare spending reduced poverty public investment increased salaries and wages a process of de colonization advanced aided by a boom in commodity pieces twenty first century decolonization was partial and affected only a limited sector of the economy it mainly increased popular consumption rather than structural changes in property and financial power de colonization co existed with colonial power elites the major significant changes took place with regard to regional policies decolonizing elites established regional alliance which excluded or minimized the us presence regional power shifted to argentina and brazil in mercosur venezuela in central america and the caribbean ecuador and bolivia in the andean region but as history has demonstrated imperial power can suffer reverses and lose collaborators but while the us retains its military and economic levers of power it can and will use all the instruments of power to recolonize the region in a step by step approach incorporating regions in its quest for hemisphere supremacy the recolonization of latin america brazil argentina and the lima pact against venezuela as the first decade of the 21st century unfolded numerous latin american governments and movements began the process of decolonization displacing us client regimes taking the lead in regional organizations diversifying their markets and trading partners nevertheless the leaders and parties were incapable and unwilling to break with local elites tied to the us colonization project vulnerable to downward movements in commodity prices composed of heterogeneous political alliances and unable to create or deepen anti colonial culture the us moved to reconstruct its colonial project the us struck first at the weakest link of the decolonization process the us backed coups in honduras and paraguay then washington turned to converting the judiciary and congress as stepping stones for launching a political attack on the strategic regimes in argentina and brazil and turning secondary regimes in ecuador chile peru and el salvador into the us orbit as the recolonization process advanced the us regained its dominance in regional and international organizations the colonized regimes privatized their economies and washington secured regimes willing to assume onerous debts previously repudiated the us advances in recolonization looked toward targeting the oil rich dynamic and formidable anti colonial government in venezuela venezuela was targeted for several strategic reasons first venezuela under president chavez opposed us regional and global colonial ambitions secondly caracas provided financial resources to bolster and promote anti colonial regimes throughout latin america especially in the caribbean and central america thirdly venezuela invested in and implemented a profound and comprehensive state social agenda building schools and hospitals with free education and health care subsidized food and housing socialist democratic venezuela contrasted with the us abysmal dismantling of the welfare state among the reconstructed colonial states fourthly venezuela s national control over natural resources especially oil was a strategic target in washington imperial agenda while the us successfully reduced or eliminated venezuela s allies in the rest of latin america its repeated efforts to subdue venezuela failed an abortive coup was defeated as was a referendum to impeach president chavez us boycotts and the bankrolling of elections failed to oust the venezuelan government washington was unable to pressure and secure the backing of the mass of the population or the military coup techniques successful in imposing colonial regimes elsewhere failed the us turned to a multi prong continent wide covert and overt military political economic and cultural war the white house appointed juan guaido a virtual unknown as interim president guaido was elected to congress with 25 of the vote in his home district washington spent millions of dollars in promoting guaido and funding ngos and self styled human rights organization to slander the venezuelan government and launch violent attacks on the security forces the white house rounded up its recolonized regimes in the region to recognize guaido as the legitimate president washington recruited several leading european union countries especially the uk france and germany to isolate venezuela the us sought to penetrate and subvert the venezuelan populace via so called humanitarian aid refusing to work through the red cross and other independent organizations the white house fixed the weekend of feb 23 24 as the moment to oust president maduro it was a total unmitigated failure putting the lie to all of washington s fabrications the us claimed the armed forces would defect and join with the us funded opposition only a hundred or so out of 260 000 did so the military remained loyal to the venezuelan people the government and the constitution despite bribes and promises washington claimed the people in venezuela would launch an insurrection and hundreds of thousands would cross the border apart from a few dozen street thugs tossing molotov cocktails there was no uprising and less than a few hundred tried to cross the border tons of us aid remained in the colombian warehouses the brazilian border patrol sent the us funded protestors packing for blocking free passage across the frontier even us provocateurs who incinerated two trucks carrying aid were exposed the vehicles in flames remained on the colombian side of the border us sponsored boycotts of venezuelan oil exports partially succeed because washington illegaly seized venezuela export revenues the recolonized lima group passed hostile resolutions and re anointed trump s president guaido but few voters in the region took their pronouncements serious conclusion what are the colonized states expected to serve why has the white house failed to recolonize venezuela as it did in the rest of latin america the recolonized states in latin america serve to open their markets to us investors on easy terms with low taxes and social and labor costs and political and economic stability based on repression of popular class and national struggles colonized regimes are expected to support us boycotts coups and invasions and to supply military troops as ordered colonized regimes take the us side in international conflicts and negotiations in regional organizations they vote with the us and meet debt payments on time and in full the recolonized nations ensure favorable results for washington by manipulating elections and judicial decisions and by excluding anti colonial candidates and officials and arresting political activists the colonized regimes anticipate the needs and demands of washington and introduce resolutions on their behalf in regional organizations in the case of venezuela they promote and organize regional bloc like the lima group to promote us led intervention as washington proceeds to destabilize venezuela the colonized allies recycle us mass media propaganda and offer sanctuaries for opposition defectors and refugees in sum the recolonized elites facilitate domestic plunder and overseas conquests venezuela success in resisting and defeating the us drive for reconquest is the result of nationalist and socialist leaders who re allocate private wealth and re distribute public expenditures to the workers peasants and the unemployed under president chavez venezuela recruited and promoted military and security forces loyal to the constitutional order and in line with a popular socio economic and anti colonial agenda venezuela ensured that elections and judicial appointments were free and in line with the politics of the majority the venezuelans ensured that military advisers were independent of us military missions and aid agencies which plot coups and are disloyal to the nationalist state venezuelan social democracy its social advances and the massive reduction of poverty and inequality contributed to reinforcing commitments to endogenous cultural values and national sovereignty despite the us accumulation of colonial vassals throughout latin america and europe venezuela has consolidated mass support despite washington s capture of the global mass media it has not influenced popular opinion on a world scale despite us threats of a military option it lacks global support in the face of prolonged and large scale resistance washington hesitates in addition the latin americans colonized states face domestic social and economic crises and political resistance europe confronts a regional break up washington is riven by partisan divisions and a constitutional crisis the failure of the imperialist ultra s in washington to defeat venezuela can set in motion a new wave of decolonization struggles which can force the us to look inward and downward in order to decolonize its own electorate james petras is a bartle

bengaluru the indian rupee s weak start to 2019 is an indication of how it will perform over the coming year strategists in a reuters poll said citing uncertainty ahead of a general election in may and a potential trade conflict with the united states last year the currency tumbled about 10 per cent and hit a record low of 74 485 to the dollar in october marking its worse performance since 2013 driven by a sell off in emerging markets and a widening fiscal deficit as oil prices rose while the consensus showed the rupee would not breach that record over the next 12 months the currency was expected to weaken over 1 per cent to 71 28 in 12 months from about 70 50 on wednesday according to the poll of 50 currency strategists still in a general upswing for most currencies against the dollar the rupee recouped some of its 2018 losses last month but the indian currency which is down about 1 per cent this year is forecast to weaken nearly 2 per cent by end may suggesting upcoming elections are a clear risk the rupee s weakness has started kicking back in and will remain in play until the political dust settles said prakash sakpal asia economist at ing a separate reuters survey of equity strategists showed a majority win for the ruling bhartiya janata party bjp would be the most favourable outcome for stocks similarly the rupee s stability would be influenced by the status quo being maintained post election we expect a win for the bjp in may but it will be very difficult for the bjp to get a substantial majority which will complicate a further implementation of necessary reforms said hugo erken a senior economist at rabobank in the medium term we expect a gradual depreciation of the rupee due to a normalisation of inflation rates in case of a loss for the bjp in may we expect financial market volatility the rupee could potentially spike to 74 the levels that we saw during the indian rupee crisis last year in addition to concerns about economic growth which hit its slowest in five quarters late last year us president donald trump s plan to cut india out of its generalized system of preferences gsp which allows duty free entry of some indian exports into the united states is also likely to weigh on the rupee while the global trade anxiety remains a headwind to the indian economy and the rupee i wonder if it s now india on the us s radar after china based on what the latest development of the us ending the gsp may herald added ing s sakpal
america s trade deficit with the rest of the world rose to its highest level in history in 2018 as the united states imported more goods than ever including a record amount from china ballooning the deficit to 891 3 billion monica almeida the new york times written by jim tankersley and ana swanson america s trade deficit in goods with the rest of the world rose to its highest level in history last year as the united states imported a record number of products including from china widening the deficit to 891 3 billion and delivering a setback to president donald trump s goal of narrowing that gap the increase was driven by some factors outside trump s control like a global economic slowdown and the relative strength of the u s dollar both of which weakened overseas demand for american goods but the widening gap was also exacerbated by trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut which has been largely financed by government borrowing and the trade war he escalated last year advertisement it is a case of textbook economics catching up with some of trump s unorthodox economic policies economists have long warned that trump s tax cuts would ultimately exacerbate a trade deficit he has vowed to reduce as americans flush with extra cash bought more imported goods his trade war with beijing also widened the gap stiff tariffs on chinese goods helped slow china s economy crimping american exports which declined nearly 50 percent in december from the same month a year before all countries run trade deficits whenever they consume more than they produce said kimberly clausing an economist at reed college in oregon and when we borrow to finance tax cuts like we did with the tax cuts and jobs act we make these imbalances worse the trade deficit is the difference between how much a country sells to its trading partners and how much it buys it generally includes both goods and services though trump has focused almost exclusively on the deficit in goods he has long boasted that his trade policies would reduce that gap which he views as a measure of whether partners like china and the european union are taking advantage of the united states a diagnosis few economists share advertisement instead in a year in which trump imposed tariffs on steel aluminum washing machines solar panels and a variety of chinese goods the overall trade deficit grew 12 5 percent from 2017 or nearly 70 billion to 621 billion the commerce department said wednesday although the united states recorded a trade surplus in services the trade deficit in goods with the european union and mexico grew more than 10 percent as imports rose faster than exports in december the overall deficit in goods and services which includes everything from computers and washing machines to tourism and intellectual property rose 19 percent from the previous month to 59 8 billion it was the highest monthly trade deficit since 2008 when the u s economy was mired in recession several global economic factors explain the widening of the deficit last year china s slowdown has reduced consumer appetite for american goods as has slowing growth in europe the strength of the dollar in global currency markets has made it cheaper for american consumers to buy foreign made goods and more difficult for foreign customers to buy american made ones that helped fuel a record number of chinese goods imported into the united states the trade gap in goods between the united states and china hit 419 billion in 2018 deepening a bilateral deficit that has been a particular source of anger for trump advertisement while trump sees the trade deficit as a sort of economic score card for which country is on top most economists disagree with this perspective viewing trade deficits as a sign of neither economic strength nor weakness but a function of macroeconomic factors like investment flows fluctuations in the value of currency and relative growth rates and as the trade deficit widens trump s focus on it has resulted in a particular irony by his own metric the president is failing to right america s global trading relationships yet many of the president s critics do not blame him for this saying some fluctuations in the trade deficit are largely beyond his control the stronger trade deficit in the short run is telling you we re importing more so it s not a particular alarming development said lawrence h summers a harvard economist who directed the national economic council under president barack obama the president notwithstanding i d rather live in a country that capital is trying to get into rather than get out of the reason we have a trade deficit is people are investing in america trump has aimed tariffs at china europe canada and mexico to help reset the trade balance with other countries that he says engage in unfair practices to gain a competitive edge in global trade advertisement that is particularly true with china which trump and many business groups say tilts the balance of power by providing state subsidies blocking foreign competition and engaging in other tactics his top advisers are pressing beijing to commit to a specific target for reducing the bilateral trade imbalance between the countries while the chinese have offered to make large purchases of american products including soybeans and liquefied natural gas they have resisted setting a specific dollar target for the trade balance arguing that such a metric is largely beyond their control in a congressional hearing last week robert lighthizer trump s top trade negotiator held up a chart that showed a steadily rising trade deficit with china also marked on the chart were various negotiations past administrations had held with china which lighthizer said had failed to stem the deficit s rise he called the deficit with china along with china s unfair trade practices major threats to our economy the value of china s currency which is determined partly by the market and partly by the government weakened against the dollar last year blunting the effect of trump s tariffs by making chinese goods even cheaper the currency began rising again in the fall as president xi jinping of china met trump in argentina late last year to begin hammering out a trade pact said brad setser a senior fellow for international economics at the council on foreign relations china certainly allowed the market to push the value of the yuan down against the dollar over the summer setser said advertisement as part of the trade deal in the works the united states has secured a commitment from beijing not to artificially weaken its currency according to administration officials the relative strength of the u s economy is also a large factor in the widening deficit along with the 1 5 trillion tax cut trump signed in 2017 which accelerated growth last year money from the tax cuts helped americans buy more imported goods than ever in 2018 and to finance the tax cuts the government needed to borrow more dollars some of which came from foreign investors foreigners primarily get those dollars by selling more goods and services to americans which will necessarily widen the trade gap an effect that many economists predicted at the time trump signed the tax cuts the tax cuts are also helping to swell the federal budget deficit which trump similarly pledged to reduce and in fact eliminate as a candidate on tuesday treasury department figures showed the budget deficit widening and it is on track to top 1 trillion this fiscal year revenue from personal and corporate income taxes was down by 9 percent in january compared with the same month a year ago advertisement as with the trade deficit many economists are growing less alarmed by the budget deficit than in previous years however federal reserve officials and some economists warn that federal borrowing is growing too quickly and will ultimately swamp the u s economy with the united states paying huge sums of

open this photo in gallery vulnerabilities stemming from china and the weakening european economy combined with a slowdown in trade and global manufacturing high policy uncertainty and risks in financial markets could undermine strong and sustainable medium term growth worldwide the oecd said sean gallup getty images a decade after wall street hit its maximum level of pessimism the global economy is once again feeling a cold breeze on its neck the organization for economic co operation and development cut its outlook for growth on wednesday pointing to major risks particularly in europe also on wednesday the bank of canada acknowledged the current weak patch is likely to last longer than expected meanwhile the trump boom is fading economic growth in the united states is now limping along at an annual pace below 1 per cent according to the latest nowcast estimates from the federal reserve bank of new york the flurry of downbeat readings comes exactly a decade after the s p 500 hit its lowest level during the financial crisis on march 6 2009 that is just a coincidence of course but it does underline the ways in which today s market could wind up being just as treacherous for investors as the one a decade ago on the good news front no one expects a replay of the financial crisis big banks are more robust than they were before 2009 housing bubbles are not as widespread in its latest forecast the oecd projects the global economy will grow by 3 3 per cent in 2019 and 3 4 per cent in 2020 less than it expected a few months earlier but still a decent rate of expansion however there are plenty of threats economic prospects are now weaker in nearly all g 20 countries than previously anticipated the oecd said vulnerabilities stemming from china and the weakening european economy combined with a slowdown in trade and global manufacturing high policy uncertainty and risks in financial markets could undermine strong and sustainable medium term growth worldwide the most significant risk for investors and for the broader economy is that governments and central banks have only limited ability to push back against a slowdown a decade of low rates and unconventional stimulus measures has depleted the standard policy prescriptions cutting interest rates for instance is no longer the panacea it once was because rates have stayed low ever since the financial crisis central banks have only limited room to reduce them further before rates hit zero this limits the stimulus that central banks can deliver at least through conventional channels over the past five decades the federal reserve has typically slashed interest rates by five percentage points in a downturn with its key rate now at 2 5 per cent the u s central bank can cut by only half that amount before it runs out of ammunition the bank of canada has even less room to reduce rates and the bank of japan and the european central bank have no room at all how about more government spending that might be an excellent idea especially in notoriously tight fisted germany but many countries spent big during the crisis and are already carrying mountains of public debt from 2008 to mid 2017 global government debt more than doubled reaching us 60 trillion according to a recent mckinsey global institute report all this suggests any future downturn could be substantially tougher to emerge from than the previous one stock markets though do not seem to be registering any concern in both canada and the united states share prices have rebounded strongly in recent weeks and are now close to their previous peaks investors may be placing too much confidence in policy makers ability to bail them out of any trouble that may develop it is easy to understand why they may be confused on that score when the s p 500 slumped to the biblically ominous level of 666 on march 6 2009 washington was already rushing to restart the economy with a dizzying array of crisis era measures since then the benchmark has more than quadrupled many investors appear to be assuming that any future weakness will be met with an equally vigorous response that is far from a sure thing especially given the political hurdles that would have to be surmounted any slowdown is likely to require governments to shoulder a higher debt burden and central banks to delve further into their unconventional policy toolkit writes neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics what s more the deeper the downturn the further they ll have to go it s possible that this could run into political or institutional resistance
washington america s trade deficit in goods with the rest of the world rose to its highest level in history last year as the united states imported a record number of products including from china widening the deficit to 891 3 billion and delivering a setback to president donald trump s goal of narrowing that gap the increase was driven by some factors outside trump s control like a global economic slowdown and the relative strength of the u s dollar both of which weakened overseas demand for american goods but the widening gap was also exacerbated by trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut which has been largely financed by government borrowing and the trade war he escalated last year it is a case of textbook economics catching up with some of trump s unorthodox economic policies economists have long warned that trump s tax cuts would ultimately exacerbate a trade deficit he has vowed to reduce as americans flush with extra cash bought more imported goods his trade war with beijing also widened the gap stiff tariffs on chinese goods helped slow china s economy crimping american exports which declined nearly 50 percent in december from the same month a year before all countries run trade deficits whenever they consume more than they produce said kimberly clausing an economist at reed college in oregon and when we borrow to finance tax cuts like we did with the tax cuts and jobs act we make these imbalances worse the trade deficit is the difference between how much a country sells to its trading partners and how much it buys it generally includes both goods and services though trump has focused almost exclusively on the deficit in goods he has long boasted that his trade policies would reduce that gap which he views as a measure of whether partners like china and the european union are taking advantage of the united states a diagnosis few economists share instead in a year in which trump imposed tariffs on steel aluminum washing machines solar panels and a variety of chinese goods the overall trade deficit grew 12 5 percent from 2017 or nearly 70 billion to 621 billion the commerce department said wednesday although the united states recorded a trade surplus in services the trade deficit in goods with the european union and mexico grew more than 10 percent as imports rose faster than exports in december the overall deficit in goods and services which includes everything from computers and washing machines to tourism and intellectual property rose 19 percent from the previous month to 59 8 billion it was the highest monthly trade deficit since 2008 when the u s economy was mired in recession several global economic factors explain the widening of the deficit last year china s slowdown has reduced consumer appetite for american goods as has slowing growth in europe the strength of the dollar in global currency markets has made it cheaper for american consumers to buy foreign made goods and more difficult for foreign customers to buy american made ones that helped fuel a record number of chinese goods imported into the united states the trade gap in goods between the united states and china hit 419 billion in 2018 deepening a bilateral deficit that has been a particular source of anger for trump while trump sees the trade deficit as a sort of economic scorecard for which country is on top most economists disagree with this perspective viewing trade deficits as a sign of neither economic strength nor weakness but a function of macroeconomic factors like investment flows fluctuations in the value of currency and relative growth rates and as the trade deficit widens trump s focus on it has resulted in a particular irony by his own metric the president is failing to right america s global trading relationships yet many of the president s critics do not blame him for this saying some fluctuations in the trade deficit are largely beyond his control the stronger trade deficit in the short run is telling you we re importing more so it s not a particular alarming development said lawrence h summers a harvard economist who directed the national economic council under president barack obama the president notwithstanding i d rather live in a country that capital is trying to get into rather than get out of the reason we have a trade deficit is people are investing in america trump has aimed tariffs at china europe canada and mexico to help reset the trade balance with other countries that he says engage in unfair practices to gain a competitive edge in global trade that is particularly true with china which trump and many business groups say tilts the balance of power by providing state subsidies blocking foreign competition and engaging in other tactics his top advisers are pressing beijing to commit to a specific target for reducing the bilateral trade imbalance between the countries while the chinese have offered to make large purchases of american products including soybeans and liquefied natural gas they have resisted setting a specific dollar target for the trade balance arguing that such a metric is largely beyond their control in a congressional hearing last week robert lighthizer trump s top trade negotiator held up a chart that showed a steadily rising trade deficit with china also marked on the chart were various negotiations past administrations had held with china which lighthizer said had failed to stem the deficit s rise he called the deficit with china along with china s unfair trade practices major threats to our economy the value of china s currency which is determined partly by the market and partly by the government weakened against the dollar last year blunting the effect of trump s tariffs by making chinese goods even cheaper the currency began rising again in the fall as president xi jinping of china met trump in argentina late last year to begin hammering out a trade pact said brad setser a senior fellow for international economics at the council on foreign relations china certainly allowed the market to push the value of the yuan down against the dollar over the summer setser said as part of the trade deal in the works the united states has secured a commitment from beijing not to artificially weaken its currency according to administration officials the relative strength of the u s economy is also a large factor in the widening deficit along with the 1 5 trillion tax cut trump signed in 2017 which accelerated growth last year money from the tax cuts helped americans buy more imported goods than ever in 2018 and to finance the tax cuts the government needed to borrow more dollars some of which came from foreign investors foreigners primarily get those dollars by selling more goods and services to americans which will necessarily widen the trade gap an effect that many economists predicted at the time trump signed the tax cuts the tax cuts are also helping to swell the federal budget deficit which trump similarly pledged to reduce and in fact eliminate as a candidate on tuesday treasury department figures showed the budget deficit widening and it is on track to top 1 trillion this fiscal year revenue from personal and corporate income taxes was down by 9 percent in january compared with the same month a year ago as with the trade deficit many economists are growing less alarmed by the budget deficit than in previous years however federal reserve officials and some economists warn that federal borrowing is growing too quickly and will ultimately swamp the u s economy with the united states paying huge sums of interest on the debt diverting funds from social safety net programs like medicare and social security fed chairman jerome h powell warned lawmakers at a house hearing last week that the federal debt was on an unsustainable path powell was asked during the hearing if he would also say that the trade deficit was unsustainable i don t think i would say that he replied
president donald trump has waged a trade war unlike any the united states has seen since the 1930s upsetting our global allies and panicking markets as he s gleefully slapped tariffs on steel and chinese products and by just about any measure you pick his effort appears to have been an absolute flop consider the trade deficit which trump has promised to shrink on thursday the commerce department reported that it actually grew by 68 8 billion in 2018 reaching 621 billion as imports continued to outpace exports in december the monthly gap hit a 10 year high the timing of the announcement was almost poetic it came just over a year after trump tweeted that trade wars are good and easy to win as he is learning they are not because the president is obsessed with manufacturing jobs the white house likes to focus on the trade deficit in goods alone ignoring the contributions of services like finance and education but on that score its performance looks even worse the goods gap soared to an all time high of 891 3 billion last year it grew with china it grew with mexico it grew with canada like wile e coyote with a box of acme dynamite trump tried to blow up the global trade order and instead came out looking like a used matchstick advertisement why is the trade deficit widening part of the story likely has to do with the federal budget deficit which has surged thanks to the tax cut republicans passed in 2017 as the old saying goes trade deficits occur when countries spend more than they produce so all else equal when the government borrows money from overseas to finance its red ink you can expect americans to buy more imports higher deficits can also lead to higher interest rates which push up the value of the dollar and hurt the competitiveness of american exports when the tax bill passed many economists predicted that it would exacerbate the trade gap and undermine trump s central economic promise to blue collar voters in other words we re witnessing an entirely foreseeable own goal advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement the more you drill down into the stats the more embarrassing they seem for trump take the results of our tit for tat tariff skirmish with china which the white house has hoped would force beijing to negotiate better trade terms the white house placed levies on 250 billion of chinese goods china responded with tariffs on 110 billion of american goods including politically sensitive commodities like soybeans the result our imports from the people s republic rose last year and our exports to it fell this happened in part because china allowed its currency to depreciate against the dollar which canceled out some of the impact of trump s tariffs another entirely predictable outcome meanwhile the administration has been forced to spend billions bailing out farmers advertisement as the data have streamed in economists have begun to conclude that the trade war is also weighing on the broader u s economy the harm is not large but it is noticeable one study by researchers at the federal reserve and columbia university concluded that each month the tariffs cost americans 3 billion in extra taxes and 1 4 billion in lost economic efficiency the other by a team including world bank chief economist pinelopi goldberg estimates that the u s economy took a 7 8 billion loss in 2018 companies and consumers faced almost 69 billion in higher costs from the tariff but those were canceled out some by tariff revenues and the fact that domestic companies were able to raise their own prices advertisement advertisement the two papers also undercut one of trump s favorite talking points on trade the president frequently likes to say that tariffs are taxes on countries that sell goods to the u s his critics usually retort that no they re actually taxes on american businesses and consumers since as a legal matter they pay the cost in theory either could have turned out to be true u s companies might have chosen to pay the tariffs themselves and pass the expense on to their customers or they might have demanded that chinese suppliers or foreign steel factories lower their prices forcing them to effectively bear the burden of the levies advertisement in practice it turns out that trump was wrong and his critics were right both research teams found that american businesses paid the full cost of the tariffs and likely charged consumers more as a result just like the naysayers expected advertisement again trump s trade protectionism has only been a modest economic drag so far 7 8 billion is not a huge deal in the scheme of a 19 trillion economy the problem is that the u s has gotten little to nothing for it in return sure thanks to the administration s tariffs steel companies are enjoying record profits at nucor alone sales grew 23 percent in 2018 but the industry only added 2 400 jobs last year a 1 percent increase the peterson institute for international economics calculates that steel users will end up paying more than 650 000 for each new job eventually created advertisement advertisement we haven t exactly gotten the spectacular new trade deals trump promised during his campaign either the administration hoped that threatening our trade partners with tariffs would force them to negotiate new pacts that gave the u s a leg up in global commerce but the results have been underwhelming the new and sort of improved nafta makes some important changes around the edges of the agreement including key ones to international dispute settlement but is widely regarded as little more than a rebranding effort the agreement shaping up between china and the u s is looking like even more of a disappointment in return for lowering tariffs china would buy more u s agricultural goods and lower some barriers that keep u s companies from operating there it would do nothing regarding issues like intellectual property theft that are of much greater concern to u s corporations trump started an unprecedented trade war and all we re gonna get are some lousy soybean sales

washington the commerce department said wednesday that the united states last year posted an 891 2 billion trade deficit in merchandise the largest in the nation s 243 year history despite more than two years of president donald trump s america first policies the results were a sobering reminder that the laws of economics still apply to a president who had promised to supercharge economic growth while simultaneously shrinking the chronic u s trade deficit those twin promises proved incompatible as economists had predicted by cutting taxes and taking the lid off government spending trump gave the economy a shot of adrenaline by thinning government regulations he sought to further spur growth and hiring advertisement but as these efforts boosted take home pay americans spent more on foreign made iphones toyotas and heinekens and as the u s economy surged ahead of europe s and japan s four federal reserve interest rate hikes lifted the dollar making american exports more expensive macroeconomics end up ruling you can t wish it away you can t tariff it away said william reinsch a former commerce department official now at the center for strategic and international studies tariffs became a key part of trump s strategy for shrinking the trade deficit the difference between the country s high import bill and its lower export sales he used the import taxes on solar panels washing machines steel aluminum and assorted chinese goods to force china and other countries into negotiations with the aim of rebalancing trade flows but while negotiations remain underway with hopes of a deal with china this month the data released wednesday showed that significant improvement in the nation s trade balance remains an ambition rather than an achievement even with china which has been hit hardest by u s tariffs the trade gap reached a record 419 billion last year administration officials say they are working to overcome decades of poor trade policy trump this month labeled the trade deficit a disaster blaming horrible deals negotiated by his predecessors and rampant cheating by u s trading partners the president told a cheering crowd that he was standing up for the american worker something a president was doing for the first time in many many decades his chief trade negotiator robert lighthizer said last week that the administration has taken steps toward a more balanced and sustainable trading system by renegotiating agreements with south korea canada and mexico seeking a new deal with china and by increasing enforcement of u s trade laws but if the president s goal is to close the trade deficit the commerce department s final 2018 report which was delayed by the partial government shutdown showed how ambitious a goal that is last year s goods shortfall topped the 2006 record of 838 3 billion which was set as the housing bubble was peaking and marked the third consecutive year of rising deficits a broader measure which includes the services sector showed a 621 billion deficit more than 100 billion greater than the figure trump inherited from president barack obama it has been evident for months that trump was not shrinking a trade gap that he calls unsustainable and says represents a major transfer of wealth from americans to foreigners the president now begins his reelection drive with a core campaign promise unfulfilled and with a recent flurry of economic research showing that his embrace of tariffs is damaging the u s economy during the campaign donald trump claimed that large trade deficits represented failed leadership and flawed trade policies said house majority leader steny hoyer d md it is time for president trump to acknowledge that his scattershot approach to trade policy is failing and explain how he intends to change course and reverse these record deficits the president often cites the trade deficit as an indicator of u s decline and a sign that other nations discriminate against american companies many economists see it as far less consequential except as it reflects americans collective overspending just as he vowed to eliminate the trade deficit trump had also promised to trim the u s federal budget deficit a perennial republican goal during the 2016 campaign he had pledged to balance the budget relatively quickly but instead the tax cut and boom in government spending has spawned more red ink with the budget gap expected to hit 900 billion this year and the national debt nearing 18 trillion all that borrowing enables americans to ramp up their spending including on imported goods widening the trade deficit the second ingredient in the swollen trade deficit is the high dollar which acts as a price increase for american exporters making it harder to compete with foreign rivals today the dollar is 19 percent above its 10 year average against the currencies of major u s trading partners according to federal reserve data the commerce report comes amid indications that negotiations with china may be in their final weeks trump has been more eager for a deal as markets gyrated in recent months and forecasters said his tariff wars were threatening u s economic growth china has offered to buy a reported 1 2 trillion in additional american products over the next six years in a deal that reportedly would ease each side s tariffs usher in changes to beijing s state led economic model and include tough new enforcement mechanisms one thing is for certain wrote chris rupkey chief financial economist for mufg union bank wrote in a note to clients there will be a u s and china agreement on trade as the administration cannot allow the uncertainty to take a toll on economic growth any longer not when the presidential election is less than two years away but any such deal may not change the dynamics widening the trade deficit many economists say increased chinese purchases of u s goods would probably mean fewer sales to other countries shrinking the trade gap with china but leaving the global balance largely unchanged with the economy at or close to full employment u s farms and factories have a limited ability to sharply increase output to meet a sudden increase in chinese orders that reality is not going to change said economist matthew j slaughter dean of the tuck school of business at dartmouth college in a 2016 campaign speech trump called the trade deficit a politician made disaster and promised swift change we can turn it all around and we can turn it around fast he said trump has used tariffs more aggressively than any other american president since the 1930s in a speech saturday he called them the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country and credited them with bringing trade partners such as china to the bargaining table billions of dollars right now are pouring into our treasury he told the conservative political action conference adding that chinese exporters are absorbing almost the entire burden of the tariffs but a pair of new studies concludes that he is wrong when we impose a tariff it is the domestic consumers and purchasers of imports that bear the full cost of the tariffs said david weinstein an economics professor at columbia university who co wrote one of the papers weinstein said the president appears to be relying on a 2018 analysis of data from the 1990s when the united states represented a larger share of the global economy and enjoyed more leverage over exporters in other countries weinstein s study co written with mary amiti of the federal reserve bank of new york and princeton university s stephen redding reviewed what actually occurred last year after u s tariffs took effect it concluded that americans paid the entire tariff bill a second study by four economists from the university of california at los angeles yale university the university of california at berkeley and columbia university reached the same conclusion the best chance of the trade deficit shrinking anytime soon would require an economic downturn that no one wants in 2009 amid the great recession the trade deficit fell 40 percent from the peak three years earlier to about 506 billion if you want to lower the trade deficit have a recession reinsch said
as guy routh explained forty years ago in his magisterial book the origin of economic ideas economics has preposterous origins since the time of adam smith the new academic discipline was linked through the emerging class of merchants and manufacturers to the rich and powerful in general and fulfilled the ideological role of presenting the emerging capitalist system as the best of all possible worlds if there were any economic problems the solution was to enhance conditions for the working of markets the free enterprise system itself guided by an invisible hand would solve every problem in the most efficient way conscious social intervention was unneeded two centuries later despite the many honest economists who try to contribute knowledge about how the world works and how it might be improved the ideological function of economics still seems to be its major role economists continue to tell fairy tales that justify the world as it is and reject any criticism or project that conflicts with the social and economic foundations of capitalism our cherished free enterprise system nothing illustrates this better than a recent publication on climate change by economists of the international monetary fund climate change is together with nuclear war the major risk for the near future of humanity but while nuclear war may or may not happen in say the 21st century climate change is already here in the form of global warming and increasing frequency of extreme weather events in 2018 hundreds of people in california greece portugal and australia were killed by wildfires that according to the scientific evidence are very likely caused by climate change the worldwide death total attributed to climate change composed by the victims of heat waves storms droughts wildfires flooding and other consequences of global warming has reached close to a million per year out of a total of some 70 million annual deaths and can be expected to rise in the coming decades to many millions as scientific reports have shown many times the more fossil fuels we use the faster global temperatures will rise and the more the frequency of extreme weather events will increase consequently the more fossil fuels we burn the faster the annual count of deaths caused by global warming will rise in 2018 reports by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and by agencies of the us government indicated that climate change is advancing by big jumps and that the prospects for the next decades are now increasingly bleak despite this most economists and politicians are oblivious to the problem or as barack obama did in the journal science in 2017 they tell us not to worry as the problem is on the way to being solved if anything economists and politicians presently worry about international trade or the prospects for economic growth like the world bank the international monetary fund the rich and beautiful who meet annually for the world economic forum at davos and governments worldwide economists and politicians are glad and joyful that the world economy in the period 2012 2017 grew at rates between 2 and 3 per year and that according to preliminary reports it grew at even faster rates in 2017 and 2018 however some economists are worried about a forthcoming recession for instance larry summers former treasury secretary and harvard president ruminates that the economic expansion since the great recession ended in 2009 has been too long for business cycle standards and that both china and the us economy have recently shown weaknesses posing the ominous issue of another downturn that could reverse to zero or negative rates the growth of the global economy figure 1 annual change in co2 emissions million tonnes black squares and gdp million us 2010 dollars red circles for the world and the us economy the two problems climate change and the likelihood of another global recession are usually discussed as if they had nothing to do with each other in reality they are intimately connected this can be easily understood by any person who knows two facts first that climate change is linked to co2 second that basically every economic activity implies emissions of this gas so that the total amount of co2 emitted each year is strongly linked to the global amount of economic activity that amount is quantified in money units by a number called gross domestic product gdp thus substantial growth of gdp which for most economists politicians and businessmen is a blessing is a disaster in terms of climate change as it represents a big increase in co2 emissions and a further rise of the atmospheric concentration of co2 which is making our earth increasingly warm and unfriendly for all living beings inversely a recession of the world economy which in the usual public discourse is a catastrophe to be avoided at all costs would be a blessing from the point of view of climate change as it would represent an important reduction of the speed of the runaway train that is carrying us toward the cliff easily accessible data show with crystal clarity the strong statistical link between the size of the economy and the volume of emissions but that together with what we know about how co2 is produced is evidence for a causal link between economic growth and climate change for instance figure 1 shows how considering the world economy at large or just the us economy the annual change in co2 emissions closely follows the annual change in gdp the two graphs illustrate how the recessions of the mid 1970s and the early 1980s caused major declines in worldwide emissions which also occurred in the early 1990s when the soviet union and the soviet bloc melted down and eastern europe sank into major disarray for several years during which industrial activity basically ceased of course the graphs also show the strong impact of the great recession at the end of the past decade on us and global emissions what is obvious for the world economy and for the economy of the united states can be shown however for other countries basically for all of them figure 2 presents the same variables emissions growth and gdp growth for argentina mexico and spain in these three countries the drop in emissions caused by the great recession ten years ago is obvious but the graphs also illustrate the emission effects of local economic crises for instance the mexican tequilazo in 1995 and the argentinian corralito in 2001 2002 in both crises emissions plummeted in spain the economic crisis that started in 2008 was particularly deep and long as shown in the bottom panel of figure 3 by negative gdp growth in 2009 2011 2012 and 2013 emissions in that country obedient to the condition of the economy continued to decline for several years and only started growing again in 2014 now in spite of the fact that this causal link between gdp growth and co2 emissions is quite obvious mainstream economists and politicians never say a word about it why it seems to me that a plausible explanation is that this causal link undermines what is perhaps the basic tenet of economics the idea that economic growth is essential not only to maintain economic and political stability but also to solve any social problem for the economics profession economic growth is what the holy grail was for the knights of the round table to assert the existence of a causal link between economic growth and climate change is like claiming that the holy grail contains poison figure 2 annual changes of co2 emissions million tonnes black squares left scale and gdp million us 2010 dollars circles right square for argentina mexico and spain 1981 2014 one of the ways economists have denied the causal link between economic growth and environmental damage including climate change has been to claim that pollutants in general including co2 increase in the early stages of economic growth but then reach a plateau and decrease overall following a curve shaped as an inverted u if that inverted u pattern exists economic growth itself will take care of the need to reduce emissions thus economic growth would decouple or delink itself from emissions it would be something like the invisible hand of adam smith operating at a new level how perfect the market system is since the 1990s the economic literature has been filled with articles chapters and books demonstrating the reality of this inverted u curve that for reasons irrelevant here economists call the ekc in 2002 an economist working in this field asserted that the idea that pollutants increase and then decrease with economic development had become widely accepted among economists however the existence of the inverted u ekc curve for pollutants in general and for co2 emissions in particular is not at all obvious indeed since some economists began talking about it in the 1980s there were discordant voices that doubted that such a pattern can be found in the data papers arose from these differences of opinion as a result the economic literature over the past 30 years came to include plenty of increasingly complicated models to demonstrate the existence of the ekc generating what one of the participants in the controversy referred to as a thicket of mathematics and econometrics but the graphs shown here in figures 1 and 2 are very straightforward they can be produced basically for any country and they show clearly that emissions and gdp increase and decrease together which any rational person would interpret as quite strong evidence that one is causing the other in economic jargon it appears obvious that co2 emissions are procyclical meaning that they increase during expansions of the business cycle and decrease during economic recessions like prices employment sales of gasoline and consumption of electricity figure 1 presenting data for more than half a century does not suggest at all that the link between emissions and economic growth is less solid say in 1990 2015 than in 1960 1990 if there is any decoupling it is not apparent at all now enter some brainy economists associated with the international monetary fund and led by gail cohen who is executive director of the board on science technology and economic policy of the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine of the united states formerly she was at the congressional joint economic committee where she performed as deputy democratic staff director chief economist and senior economist in a recent paper published by the imf cohen and her coauthors tell us and show us that a first look at the data on emissions and real gdp yields little evidence of decoupling but immediately add that this first crack at the data is misleading why because in general cyclical developments can often obscure the trend relationship this is a mathematical thicket created for the consumption of fellow economists not the general public to put it in plain words what cohen et al say is that while higher gdp growth indeed appears to be associated with higher emissions so that emissions usually grow during economic expansions and decrease when there is a recession if we look at the long term trends of emissions and gdp in different countries the pattern is not always one of simultaneous growth of emissions and gdp because in some high income countries emissions have been decreasing while gdp increased this idea of gail cohen is very well illustrated by the top panels of figure 3 where annual emissions during the years 1960 2015 for france britain germany and the usa are plotted against gdp in the cases of the uk and germany it is obvious that greater gdp levels are associated with lower emissions while for the usa and france the picture is more complicated at any rate with a little bit of imagination and a lot of good will we can see the inverted u ekc in the graphs for the uk and germany and at least in the left portion of the graphs for the us and france the experience of these countries along with some econometric prestidigitations that cohen and her coauthors carry out in their paper convince them that decoupling of emissions and incomes is happening there so that the richest nations of the world have basically delinked co2 emissions from economic growth how fallacious this idea is can be illustrated by the fact that emissions which had been declining for years in germany the united states and other countries have recently increased coinciding with the economic recovery after the great recession the supposed long run decoupling does not apply in the short run besides looking at a relation between trends which is always a doubtful statistical exercise what cohen and her coauthors have done is something that has long been described with a pejorative term cherry picking it is true that some countries like france and the uk increased their gdp at the same time that they had a decline in emissions but there were specific reasons for that nuclearization in france and deindustrialization in both countries deindustrialization in particular and not any specific effects of some clean technology triggered by economic growth is the main reason that explains lower emissions in the handful of countries where emissions have declined in recent decades many other countries of the world indeed most of them show precisely the opposite experience long run increasing co2 emissions associated with long run gdp growth the bottom panels of figure 3 in fact show this for the largest emitter of co2 china and for two other emerging economies increasingly important as co2 emitters india and brazil in all of them the long term link between co2 emissions and gdp is obvious as both grow simultaneously indeed the last panel in the figure shows the link between the world economy as a whole quantified in terms of world gdp and global emissions of co2 these are directly related the greater is world gdp the greater are emissions something also shown in figure 1 figure 3 co2 emissions million tonnes plotted versus gross domestic product trillion us dollars of 2010 in the period 1960 2015 for seven countries and the world economy the obnoxious insistence of many intellectuals politicians and economists on preaching the virtues of economic growth is one of the notions that should be included in the list first proposed by bertrand russell s essay of ideas that have harmed mankind by action as in the case of gail cohen or omission as in that of most economists who have never discussed the question economists are guilty of hiding from researchers in other fields including many climatologists and geoscientists the obvious fact that climate change is directly linked with economic growth and that climate catastrophe cannot be avoided or limited without major changes in our ever expanding way of consuming and producing the consequence is that authors like james hansen with a clear understanding of the scientific issues implied by climate disaster and at the front of the fight for policies to prevent climate catastrophe believe that the policies they propose are not inconsistent with economic growth it is thanks to the insistence of economic growth enthusiasts that the eighth sustainable development goal agreed on by the general assembly of the united nations in 2015 is an annual economic growth rate of at least 7 since in the past 20 years with a rate of growth between 2 and 3 the world economy has produced co2 emissions growing on average 1 8 per year not much math is needed to guess how emissions would evolve with world economic growth of at least 7 to call that goal sustainable growth is like saying that drinking two bottles of whisky a day is sustainable drinking economic growth is the accelerator pedal for the runaway train that is transporting us into climate change land where a cliff awaits at the end of the trail gail cohen and the economists who coauthor her research agree that economic growth is accelerating the train but on the basis of flimsy evidence they argue that since in the long run this accelerator will be increasingly ineffective and can even become a brake we must not worry about stepping on it if we are to believe what knowledgeable people tell us about climate change human beings are in a terrible situation heading in the near future to major worldwide disasters there is no time to wait for the long run economists claiming that in the long run economic growth will take us to heaven are just telling fairy tales technical appendix references

the long run decoupling of emissions and output evidence from the largest emitters by gail cohen et al is available at www imf org en publications wp issues 2018 03 13 the long run decoupling of emissions and output evidence from the largest emitters 45688 the webpage titled decoupling of emissions and incomes it s happening voxeu org article decoupling emissions and incomes it s happening presents the main ideas and results of the imf paper in more accessible language for those with statistical background it is worth to mention that the results of the imf paper by cohen et al are largely based on a regression which looks very much like a spurious statistical exercise the model cohen et al compute for twenty countries is based on equation 3 on page 11 of the paper where the dependent variable is the trend of the log of emissions and the explanatory covariates are a constant the trend of the log of real gdp and an error term the trend of both log emissions and log real output is computed by cohen et al using the hodrick prescott filter with a smoothing parameter set at 100 thus what they are doing is to regress a trend on a trend which is just one of the typical examples of spurious regression see for instance gujarati basic econometrics 4th ed new york mcgraw hill 2003 pp 792 and 886 or bisgaards kulahci time series analysis and forecasting by example hoboken new jeersey john wiley sons 2011 for german data corresponding to the years 1990 2015 cohen et al find a real gdp trend elasticity of trend emissions of 0 6 without reporting the standard error of the estimate or the durbin watson of the regression they say though that the estimate is statistically significant at the 10 level of confidence i computed the model and obtained an elasticity of 0 692 with a standard error of 0 009 which is very consistent with the result reported by cohen et al however in my regression the durbin watson is 0 087 which makes the regression seriously suspicious of being a spurious one puzzlingly cohen et al also say that they find emissions and gdp cointegrated in the period 1990 2014 p 11 footnote 7 but cointegrated variables are precisely those that in the long run follow each other somewhat cointegration between two variables can be understood as exactly the opposite of decoupling economic growth and carbon emissions the

the government surprised the world in 2008 when the fed bailed out the banks at the expense of seniors and savers the fed dropped interest rates to historic lows while buying u s treasuries and bad loans through their quantitative easing qe program seniors and savers lost over 4 trillion in interest income they would have normally received the stock market tanked investors desperately searching for yield redeployed their money into the market and higher risk bonds retirees had to take on more risk in order to survive former fed chair ben bernanke called the consequences collateral damage seniors and baby boomers called it catastrophic damage as they downsized and altered their retirement plans since the 2016 election the fed raised rates 8 times in january 2019 they held rates but continue to sell off mortgages and treasuries it appears the fed is starting a u turn and we could soon see more qe chuck butler reports about the recent fed announcement the fed s fomc meeting ended with no rate hike and a short speech by fed chairman jerome powell the rate hikes might be on pause for a while and he sees the first rate cut in 2020 investors were blindsided last time this time around if we are not prepared it s our own fault do we really want more qe chuck predicted the u turn for quite some time it s time to talk with the master fed guru dennis chuck once again on behalf of our readers thanks for taking your time for our education qe was different it was more than a normal rate adjustment it included buying bad debts from banks and private companies i d like to unbundle that for a minute capitalism depends on rewarding those who do well and punishing those for making bad decisions i ve received hundreds of emails complaining about the fed while no one praised the fed saying they were better off today i agree with bill bonner when he says the fix was in and whether the man on the street knows how it worked or not he s beginning to resent it who really benefitted from qe by bailing out the banks and companies like ge didn t the fed reward incompetence at the expense of hard working taxpayers it s no wonder socialists scream capitalism doesn t work chuck thank you dennis for another invitation to speak to your readers i want to say this up front so it doesn t get mixed up with what else i have to say woodrow wilson shoved the fed down american s throats in 1913 i know we both agree the country would be better off more prosperous and less in trouble if we had never had a federal reserve i ve never viewed the 2008 fiasco as a failure of the free markets it was instead an abject failure of policymaking of government policy and central bank doctrine and methods martin wolf financial times ok i got that off my chest while i ve done a lot of studying of austrian economics i m nowhere near an expert however i do know my way around the ballpark to answer your first question as you pointed out last week wall street and the investor class reaped the greatest benefit of qe things have changed since the banks were allowed to become brokerage investment houses gillian tett warned us at the last count america s top five banks controlled 47 of banking assets compared with 44 in 2007 and the top 1 of mutual funds have 45 of assets headlines are saying the fed chair powell capitulated to wall street that should not be a surprise as to your second question i would say that is correct in a normal economy free of government and central bank intervention you experience booms and busts when excess builds it corrects with a recession cleaning out the excesses allowing bad companies to fail strong companies to thrive and the economy rebuilds once again since alan greenspan was fed chairman we ve not experienced anything like a normal boom bust economy we ve seen bailouts the greenspan put quantitative easing zero interest rate policies and so on taxpayers bailed out bad companies the economy wasn t allowed to clean out the excesses things today are worse than they were 10 years ago with regards to debt derivatives leveraged loans etc this might sound heartless but last year marked the 10th anniversary of the financial meltdown had we done what we used to do yes it would have been painful but it would be past us now had the fed government not intervened dennis the majority of the public opposed the bailouts our mutual friend economist john mauldin told me some prominent congressmen confided they would support more bank bailouts just don t call it qe they were ok bailing out the banks as long as they had some political cover the government has a great incentive to keep rates down every 1 increase adds 200 billion to the deficit chuck that concerns me is there anything we can do politically should we be focusing on trying to survive another round chuck unfortunately no sure we can gather up large groups of people like the tea party and make some noise in the end did they succeed at what they wanted done no should a central bank be raising rates so late in an expansionary cycle no the fed is only hiking rates right now to have some cushion to cut them in the next recession which by the way is right around the corner so yes we need to be focusing on surviving another financial debacle dennis the low interest rates blew up most pension plans many states are virtually bankrupt due to underfunded pensions mike maloney s video reports a record number of companies that can t even pay the interest on their debts if the fed follows suit like last time could qe4 qe5 called something else do even more harm i don t think the public wants to see private companies bailed out chuck well that depends if you ve worked for or owned stock in ge for example you are a stakeholder you would appreciate a bailout but your next door neighbor sure isn t going to like it the law of unintended consequences actions of people and especially of government always have effects that are unanticipated and or unintended we will likely see the fed continue in the same path i agree with mike maloney and to answer your question yes it will do more harm once again companies and individuals will load up with inexpensive debt the problem with debt is that it has to be repaid or defaulted on the congressional budget office cbo just announced that we ll be adding 1 trillion per year on top of the current 22 trillion and that s if everything goes right next meltdown we could very well be seeing 2 trillion annually added to our national debt russia china and even japan on a smaller size are dumping u s treasuries not buying who s going to buy all that debt issuance in the future the fed will just print dollars to buy the bonds while loading up ben bernanke s helicopter with all that money supply what do you believe will happen to the dollar i think you all know high inflation dennis one last question pundits use the term extend and pretend kick the problems down the road prolonging the inevitable correction that must take place when excess debt comes to a boil if more qe is coming wall street may be cheering today and crying tomorrow when the inevitable crash comes we got blindsided last time what should investors do to protect themselves this time around chuck dennis i hate to be sounding like a doom and gloom guy i just call them the way i see them when you play poker you look at your cards and decide to either fold or play what was given to you the one silver lining is we shouldn t be blindsided this time you and i have been warning readers in the daily pfennig i called the housing bubble 4 full years before the markets began to notice a problem in housing readers might get tired of the warning but many are taking heed we have time to make certain our stop losses are up to date i did some research a year ago and found a study of stock performance during a recession and it was ugly not just ugly tree ugly i m talking the whole darn forest ugly so you can see that getting these stop losses in place is a good idea there is never a bad time to sell stock and take a profit look at your allocation in gold silver both have been stuck in the mud for some time and look ready to breakout to the upside a market crash presents opportunities to find some real bargains just be patient i really want to end on a positive note so spend time with your loved ones hug them tell them you love them i m serious here when things get ugly and they will it s comforting knowing you are loved and you love someone thanks again for the opportunity to share my thoughts dennis here wow not much i can add to that if we have more extend and pretend we need to remain patient in the meantime enjoy the ride knowing you are prepared should another bailout appear imminent i will once again write my elected representatives chuck s free daily newsletter the daily pfennig is highly recommended for more information check out my website or follow me on facebook

good morning these are the top stories gerald butts tells committee wilson raybould s cabinet shuffle was independent of snc lavalin discussions in a much anticipated appearance before the house of commons justice committee gerald butts the former top adviser to prime minister justin trudeau said jody wilson raybould was not subjected to inappropriate pressure and suggested her concerns about improper interference in the snc lavalin prosecution only surfaced after she was demoted in a cabinet shuffle as robert fife steven chase and daniel leblanc report mr butts told the committee that ms wilson raybould believed she was being removed as justice minister and attorney general because of her refusal to negotiate an out of court settlement with snc lavalin an accusation he denied also in mr butts s testimony he acknowledged frustration with ms wilson raybould and her refusal to consider outside legal advice on a deferred prosecution at no time did the prime minister or anyone else in government direct or ask the attorney general to negotiate a remediation agreement he said he said in his opening statement that there was a breakdown in relations between the prime minister and ms wilson raybould as a result of the january cabinet shuffle where ms wilson raybould was assigned the veterans affairs portfolio initially mr trudeau offered ms wilson raybould indigenous services but mr butts said she turned it down because of concerns about enforcing the indian act the prime minister then offered veterans affairs later in the day the committee questioned privy council clerk michael wernick and deputy justice minister nathalie drouin both had appeared at the committee before but were called back after ms wilson raybould s testimony raised new questions about meetings

for a reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable us gaap measures orion delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 with performance led again by our rubber carbon black segment we met our guidance expectations for the year as we grew our full year adjusted ebitda to 294 1 million representing a 14 5 increase over 2017 our rubber team secured significant price increases in the 2017 to 2018 cycle this combined with good execution and solid volumes translated to strong performance in 2018 earlier in the year we had completed the consolidation of our korean facilities which has unlocked value for orion through improved operational efficiencies and the elimination of less profitable rubber grades while building the strength of our specialty manufacturing platform in asia this helped drive an increase in gross profit per ton and adjusted ebitda in our rubber segment during 2018 as well as monetize significant value for our shareholders via the sale of the land site during 2018 without this consolidation of our facilities our rubber volumes would have been essentially flat in the second half of 2018 similarly to the last quarter profitability in the specialty carbon black business was in line with our expectations following the strong performance of the segment in the first half of 2018 said corning painter chief

increased from 6 0 million as of december 31 2017 to 41 0 million as of december 31 2018 which is reduced by 1 5 million of capitalized transaction costs this resulted in a net cash amount of 14 5 million as of december 31 2018 as compared to 64 8 million as of december 31 2017 a decrease of 50 3 million which includes an increase in working capital of 58 9 million during this period associated with increases in feedstock prices the timing of collection of trade receivables due to the quarter end calendar and cash outflows associated with feedstock related payables the company s reported long term debt net as of december 31 2018 was 643 7 million composed of the non current portion of term loan liabilities of 650 0 million which is reduced by 6 3 million capitalized transaction costs accordingly net indebtedness was 635 5 million composed of gross term loan liabilities of 650 0 million less net cash of 14 5 million this represents a ltm adjusted ebitda multiple of 2 2 times compared to 2 3 times at the year ended december 31 2017 capitalized transaction costs as well as non current debt from financial derivatives and other non current liabilities are disregarded in computing net indebtedness under our lending agreements cash inflows from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 62 8 million consisting in particular of a consolidated profit for the period of 20 4 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of 26 3 million with other impacts almost offsetting each other net working capital totaled 282 9 million as of december 31 2018 compared to 324 6 million as of september 31 2018 net working capital ended 2018 at 69 days cash outflows from investing activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 70 5 million reflecting primarily expenditures for the acquisition of the acetylene plant in france of 36 6 million and capital expenditure of 33 9 million for improvements in the manufacturing network cash outflows for financing activities of 2018 amounted to 9 7 million consisting primarily of the quarterly dividend the regular interest payment and debt repayment 2019 outlook mr painter concluded we have positioned ourselves well for 2019 in the rubber segment we secured significant price increases for 2018 and again leading into 2019 in the specialty segment we enhanced our already leading product slate with the acquisition of the specialty black production platform for acetylene based grades we are revamping our incentive programs to provide a clearer line of sight between teams and their compensation and to put an even greater emphasis on profit over volume underlying demand is intact in our most important rubber segments in china the oem automotive segment has weakened and that is a headwind for our mechanical rubber goods carbon black there demand through a mix of destocking and underlying market conditions has softened in our specialty business this has become particularly evident in china cutting across several end markets while some of the china export markets should benefit from improved trade conditions the china automotive segment may have a longer cycle to recovery in any case we are focused on self help and not banking on a rebound later in the year consistent with this outlook we expect a full year adjusted ebitda for 2019 to be in the range of 280 million to 300 million with an expectation of delivering relatively flat growth in adjusted ebitda on a year over year basis while continuing to generate solid cash flow this outlook is based on current gdp expectations and that oil prices exchange rates and feedstock impacts will be at levels experienced late in the fourth quarter of 2018 if our specialty business remains on the current trajectory we are seeing at the start of 2019 and the economy in china remains subdued we will find ourselves towards the bottom end of this guidance range on the other hand robust performance in the rubber segment coupled with a pick up in the specialty business in the second half of 2019 particularly in china will position us towards the higher end of this guidance range other guidance metrics for 2019 include shares outstanding of 59 3 million before any further opportunistic buy backs and vesting of awards under the group s long term incentive program an underlying tax rate of 29 30 on pre tax income and capital expenditures reflecting an operating run rate consistent with the past of approximately 75 million but with the total rising to around 100 million due in large part to the already announced specialty line investment in italy this excludes epa related capex spending in the range of 80 million prior to any reimbursement from evonik ag depreciation and amortization for 2019 is estimated to be approximately 100 million this outlook does not consider contingencies described in note q to our consolidated financial statements as at december 31 2018 conference call as

certain other items adjusted ebitda is used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and make decisions regarding allocation of capital because it excludes the effects of certain items that have less bearing on the performance of our underlying core business our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations are a although adjusted ebitda excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and thus the cost of replacing assets or acquiring new assets which will affect our operating results over time is not reflected b adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest or certain other costs that we will continue to incur over time and will adversely affect our profit or loss which is the ultimate measure of our financial performance and c other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures differently because of these and other limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside our other us gaap based financial performance measures such as consolidated profit or loss for the period contribution margin is calculated by subtracting variable costs such as raw materials packaging utilities and distribution costs from our revenue we believe that contribution margin and contribution margin per metric ton are useful because we see these measures as indicating the portion of revenue that is not consumed by such variable costs and therefore contributes to the coverage of all other costs and profits adjusted eps is defined as profit or loss for the period adjusted for acquisition related expenses restructuring expenses consulting fees related to group strategy certain other items such as amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired from our predecessor and foreign currency revaluation impacts and assumed taxes divided by the weighted number of shares outstanding adjusted eps provides guidance with respect to our underlying business performance without regard to the effects of a foreign currency fluctuations b the amortization of intangible assets which other companies may record as goodwill having an indefinite lifetime and thus no amortization and c our start up and initial public offering costs other companies may use a similarly titled financial measure that is calculated differently from the way we calculate adjusted eps we define net working capital as the total of inventories and current trade receivables less trade payables net working capital is as well a non gaap financial measure and other companies may use a similarly titled financial measure that is calculated differently from the way we calculate net working capital the following tables present a reconciliation of each of

second quarter 2019 results conference call today s live webcast both audio and slide show may be accessed through the company s investor relations website at www cresud com ar by clicking on the banner webcast link the following presentation and the earnings release issued today are also available for download on the company s website before we begin i would like to mention to remind you that this call is being recorded and that information discussed may include forward looking statements regarding the company s financial and operating performance all projections are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially please refer to the detailed note in the company s earnings release regarding forward looking statements i will now turn the call over to mr alejandro elsztain chief executive officer please go ahead sir alejandro elsztain thank you very much good afternoon everybody we ll now begin our 6 month conference call 2019 and we can begin looking at page 2 that this is the first balance sheet that we are adjusting for inflation argentina adhered to these rules so this is the first time and matias later will explain in deeper explanation how this affects the balance sheet of cresud we can see that the adjusted ebitda for the 6 months we reached almost ars10 billion from those ars1 7 billion came from the agribusiness a very big a very important probably the biggest in our history and from other side the ars8 3 billion from the urban in israel and urban in argentina we can see that the final the net income the final is a loss of ars5 6 billion comparing to a gain of ars11 billion last year and this is mainly explained by the loss in the changes in fair value of irsa investment properties in argentina so because of the environment of inflation we have recognized the growth and this is the biggest event of the balance sheet of this semester and attributable to cresud shareholders it s ars3 9 billion we can see in the right part of the graph this is the record planted area of the group in the region between the 4 countries 258 000 hectares between argentina brazil paraguay and bolivia 100 of the wheat was harvest just only 16 of the soybeans and only 3 of the corn so the operational part of the business is going to be mainly the third and the fourth quarter of the year we keep developing land and we did last year 8 500 hectares of developing in the region we have closed two transactions of real estate the two are in brazil i m going to explain later and this is a sale a nominal sale of brl185 million of two farms two portions of the farms that we sold in last semester and when we see the agribusiness adjusted ebitda we can see a growth year to year of 432 and the pure farming ebitda just the grains parts it s 60 being just two quarters the smallest so now comes mainly the soybeans and the corn and finally the argentine rental the urban grew 6 2 in real terms the year to year the 6 months to 6 months and in israel rental grew 12 from other side we approved and we almost closed this new share repurchase plan for up to ars300 million the company did almost 94 of this repurchase as of today so the company was buying out shares we can move to the next page and in the next page in page 4 sorry page 3 we can see the evolution of planted area here we see the record that i spoke before the 258 000 representing a growth of 24 year to year and we can see the main cause that there are main are in 50 soybeans 29 corn 11 sugarcane so this comparing to our history is the record by far and we have enough good climate conditions carlos will explain that later from other side the development of land we can see that this 8 500 hectares coming 2 000 from argentina almost 2 000 from paraguay and 4 500 from brazil so the company accumulation of developing land surpassing the 200 000 hectares in the whole region if we move to next page we can see the 2 sales brazil s partial sales and this is explained on the graph that in the case of jatobã we are still 21 000 hectares we may need to resell part of them are leased and part of them are not leased but the idea is to keep selling so selling the third we closed the deal for brl177 million this is no this is not in actual value this represents a very important sale so in category the total sale of this farm comparing to the size of brasilagro and this is very important and this has a lot of room to reinvest in new other things the other sale site we sold a farm very small 100 hectares a small portion of alto taquari alto taquari still owns 5 000 hectares so we sold a very small amount of hectares at a very big price brl8 million representing a profit of almost brl6 million so this and we see on the graph the evolution on the years this year in half year we are in one of the big number of sales comparing to the past the last 10 years of sales we can see that this year we are still selling more than 50 million and majority gain the 47 million gain is in nominal but in real terms bringing the money today it s more than 30 million so this shows again the strength of the company related to buying and selling land so with that i will introduce now mr carlos blousson that will explain in detail the situation of the company in argentina and bolivia carlos blousson okay thank you alejandro good evening everybody let s begin with the page 5 about commodity prices and the global stocks as you can see in the graph year to year the prices remain low the soybean price decreased by 3 and corn increased by 14 the decline in soybean price is mainly due to the conflict between united states and china keeps going that has made the world stock growing as you can see in the graph and especially in the united states where the stocks rose up to 23 26 very very high the price of corn went higher due to the higher demand that has remained at a low level because the available stocks are too high also the group production or the group forecast of production of the total in this year in also puts pressure on the world prices let s move to the next page 6 this is regarding our yield today we have good prospects for 2019 campaign in argentina argentina weather conditions have recovered from the strong drought and the climate terms will be good prospects especially in argentina we now have the lowest you can see in the map in a lot of the presentation the planted area increased by 3 in argentina achieved a record in planting our productions regarding wheat productions we expect to grow by 6 to 19 million tons the corn by 40 to 45 million tons and the soybean by 51 to 53 million tons the total planted surface increase by 25 compared with the last year reaching 140 million tons it s a record in argentina the production mentioned before are easy to achieve under the right weather conditions now matias will continue with the presentation matias matias gaivironsky thank you carlos so if we move to page 7 here we have a breakdown a short version of our results operational results on irsa our commercial properties on irsa so we can see that the shopping malls the sales of our tenants decreased in real term in the last quarter by 16 so basically here we have our results are affected by the use of purchasing power of the people the salaries haven t adjusted at the same pace than the inflation in argentina and the inflation during the last two quarters in argentina so we can see that in nominal terms our sales grew 23 8 in the case of our offices the rent per square meter increased a little from the last year to 27 per square meter our occupancy is 90 as of december so we have a vacancy of 94 floors in two different buildings going forward our real estate this country and that we will recover similar occupation levels than the year ago also including the zetta building in polo dot that we will open soon probably in the next 2 or 3 months the occupancy will go up to 93 in the case of our hotels the occupancy was 68 5 and we will see later much better results in our operations since the evaluation and also you can see here that the rent or the rate per room increased to 205 against 185 last year in the case of our shopping centers occupancy occupancy went down to 95 here basically we have one cancellation of a contract walmart resigned their contract in dot shopping center so leaving aside that store that is a big store in dot the occupation would have been 98 7 and also walmart paid a penalty for resigning their contracts or it will be last time to rent again without losing profitability also an important event on the semester was the end of the concession of buenos aires design so for that reason our total stock decreased to 332 000 square meters in the case of the offices the size of our portfolio remains stable comparing with the previous year basically we sold 1 floor in 1 building so we grew to 83 200 square meters but we expect to almost double the size of our portfolio in the next two years because of the incorporation of the zetta building in polo dot and 200 della paolera going to page 8 we can see the main event on our operation in israel so in idb the main news are regarding clal we sold we did two more swap transactions in august 2018 and january 2019 so our current stake in clal insurance is 25 3 of the shares but the economic rights remain in 54 9 remember that in the beginning we used to have 55 of the shares so we remain in the same levels like at beginning of our acquisition so we are trying to selling the shares in the market regarding dic we have been very active in working in our structure so we sold shares in shufersal we reduced our stake to 26 and we acquired shares in other subsidiaries like in pbc in elron and in cellcom so we were active on that also we announced that our share repurchase plan of up to ils 120 million in dic so the remaining stock is currently no less than 10 and also we did a distribution in dividends of ils 100 million ils 60 million were in kind and ils 40 million were in cash we will remain active in working in this structure where we have to solve the concentration law phase 2 and we have to reduce one more layer by the end of this year so we have to work on that also in the case of idb we are in the process of selling israel or we sell the online store in israel so we are in the process of that disposal going to page 10 an important note regarding our financial statement is the adjustment for inflation argentina surpassed 100 of inflation accumulated during the last 3 years and according to ifrs rules any country that surpassed that threshold has to start adjusting their balance sheet by inflation so the argentina passed that during last semester and the cnv now allow the companies to adjust and it s an obligation for us so we uploaded in our website an explanation of all the effects on inflation adjustment here i will mention some of them but we have more details if you need to have more breakdown on all the details in our website so basically you have here 2 main effects one is regarding our comparative figures that now all the 2018 numbers were adjusted to reflect the current nominal value of their currency so basically we adjust all the figures of the previous year by 47 so first of all the quarter of the previous year we have to adjust for inflation at that quarter and then we express that figures into current figures multiplying the result by 1 47 that was the inflation when we see the different assets that we have we have the obligation to adjust all monetary nonmonetary assets in argentina so all our assets abroad brazil bolivia paraguay united states and idb in israel were not adjusted by inflation only we need to express previous year figures to the current purchasing power of the peso the nominal value of the peso in page 11 we can see the main assets in argentina remember that all our investment properties that are basically shopping center land reserves offices and farms that we leased to third parties are valued at fair value in our financial terms so we don t need to adjust by inflation only the result from the difference in the fair value before were all reflected in one line that was the appreciation of the fair value of investment properties now that effect is divided in two one goes to the line of inflation and if we surpass the inflation on the appreciation we re recognizing that line and if not we have a loss that is what happened in this semester and we will see a decrease or a loss in our investment properties that is basically the main explanation of our loss in this year regarding other assets we have to adjust for inflation if we go to page 12 we have our farms that were valued at historical values so acquisition cost plus capex so we used to be at 27 million as of june 30 2018 without adjusting anything now that is 87 million in our books that is lower than the fair value so we are not in the middle but we adjust some but it s not the fair value of the properties so we only need to adjust that inflation not to reflect the real value of that the real value here we have the appraisal that we have as of december 31 that was in the order of 260 million and then in page 13 the rest all the liabilities monetary liabilities we don t have to adjust because of they re monetary and the shareholders equity risk we have to adjust our equity by inflation and the effect of that is a loss in our income statement that if we don t adjust the asset at the same pace then we will have a loss so part of that of the investment properties in peso term generated a profit but the result you will see that is in the irsa case and it is our commercial properties a loss in the line of inflation in cresud since we have also a farm it s a profit in our financial statement so when we go to page 14 as alejandro mentioned we have our net income loss of ars5 6 billion against a gain of ars11 5 billion at the previous year attributable to our controlling shareholders is ars3 9 million against a gain of ars5 3 million so the main effect we can see by segment the agribusiness the performance was very good we have an operating income of 9 higher than the previous year remember that this year when we compare with the previous year we re already adjusted by 47 so on top of that cresud record a gain of 89 more than inflation in argentina business segment we can see a drop in our results in operating income from ars10 6 billion to a loss of ars3 8 billion basically you have the main difference in the line 4 the change in fair value that in the last year we posted a gain of ars8 3 billion against a loss of ars6 3 billion at this year in the israeli business segment to understand or to compare the results you need to also consider that the real appreciation or depreciation between the shekel and the peso that was 17 so to compare the previous year if you see numbers ahead of the 17 it s better performance or lower in the case of costs we can answer in more details in the following pages so if we move to page 15 we can see the figures for us reflect better our operational performance that is our adjusted ebitda because we are able to have a breakdown of all our segments starting with the agribusiness we can see farmland sales that increased significantly and here we have an accounting effect that is important to explain that in the case of shufersal that we saw that here is reflected a gain of shufersal when you go to our financial statement since we have part of that farm rented to third parties we have to value at fair value so when we sell the land we are not posting a gain because we already recognized that part of the gain when we valued that property but here in the adjusted ebitda we are including the gain against our historical cost in the case of the farming you can see that we have very good results something important to mention the results are changed in the when we come to adjust by inflation is that all the holding results that before were included in the lines of the segment for instance if we have a stock of grains or if we have a stock of cattle we recognize the difference in the value of the product in that line now with the inflation adjustment you have part of the results in the inflation line and part that surpass the inflation here in the segment so to calculate our gross margin will be difficult because we will have part of the holding results in the financial line and not in the operational line sorry for that it s not something that we decide it s the rule that we need to fulfill so for instance in the line 5 that we can see a drop or a loss in the cattle activity it s basically because the holding result were excluded in this line regarding the sugarcane that you can see a drop here 14 it s related to the farm san josã that we acquired last year that at the beginning we received some plantations that we don t have to plant this year so last year we had better results than this year regarding the other segment it s basically our operation in fyo the the agro industrial the meat packing facilities fyo posted very good result this year and the agro industrial they yield a loss but still generate a loss for that service segment regarding the urban segment as we explained in irsa shopping mall decreased by 10 basically because of the lower consumption in argentina during the last 6 years 6 months sorry the acceleration of inflation and the lag on salaries that had an effect on people who lost some purchasing power so that is affecting all metrics of consumption in argentina offices very good results since the revenues or the agreement are in dollars hotels very good results probably one of the best in the last year 563 more than the previous year and sales and development that is this semester we haven t sold important units yet in the last year we sold baicom and other properties so it s why we have this improvement and regarding israel real estate very good results 36 telecommunications in shekel term lower than the last year basically because of the competitive environment in the telecommunications sector in israel so therefore the main effects on the operational side and the financial line the net financial result remember that this year in page 16 this year we have an important devaluation we have the graph of the exchange rate in the bottom left that is semester the devaluation was 30 against a devaluation of 12 during the last year so that generated a higher interest rate and higher net exchange difference since all our debt or most of our debt is dollar denominated and then you can see in the line five all the effects of inflation goes to this line the adjustment for inflation here we have all the impacts of the different lines in irsa it s the same so basically we have dollar denominated debt so we are paying more interest in pesos term and more net exchange differences and in israel if we see that figure in shekels the net interest loss is decreasing so we are paying lower interest because we reduced some of the debt and also we refinanced part of the debt at a lower interest rate so that is decreasing and also the other important effect is regarding the situation of clal shares last year increased by 4 and then we will restate that figure by 47 so you have higher profit in the line 4 last year compared with this year and also there was another important effect in the line three that was the swap that we did at the dic level swap of the structure of debt so we issued new debt and at the beginning we had to incur a loss that was last year that is reflected in the 6 months of 2018 ars3 5 billion in the line three against a gain of ars113 million this year if we move to page finally in page 17 we can see our net debt as of december 31 our current net debt is 395 million and the net debt amortization schedule we were able to issue a new one at the end of the last semester so we have a debt amortization schedule the different breakdown and different year the short term is basically because in argentina the banks are forbidden to lend dollars to companies only they can lend dollars to exporters or exporter related and since cresud exports or sells its products to its exporters can access to that financial line and it s one of the most attractive in argentina in the current scenario so for that reason we will concentrate that in the short term so with this we finished the formal presentation now we open the line to receive your questions question and answer session operator alejandro elsztain thank you we did only half of the year the next third and fourth quarters are very active we do agricultural activities mainly we expect new conditions for that from other side the real estate is developing in argentina and in israel a lot and occupying those rental properties too so we ll keep working a lot in the whole region so thank you very much and we ll see you next quarter have a very good day bye operator thank you this concludes today s presentation you may now disconnect your line at this time and have a nice day
the indian rupee s weak start to 2019 is an indication of how it will perform over the coming year strategists in a reuters poll said citing uncertainty ahead of a general election in may and a potential trade conflict with the united states last year the currency tumbled about 10 percent and hit a record low of 74 485 to the dollar in october marking its worse performance since 2013 driven by a sell off in emerging markets and a widening fiscal deficit as oil prices rose while the consensus showed the rupee would not breach that record over the next 12 months the
the congressional budget office has released new projections for the federal deficit for the next decade the cbo is forecasting that federal deficits will average 4 4 percent of nominal gross domestic product this is up from a 2 9 percent average which was achieved over the past 50 years over the past four months from october 1 2018 through january 31 2019 the federal deficit came in at 310 billion up from 176 billion in the same time span from one year ago this represents a 77 percent increase note however according to the treasury department that in the first four months of fiscal 2018 experienced a shift in the timing of certain payments which made the deficit appear smaller without these timing sifts the deficit would have risen by 40 2 percent in this fiscal year furthermore it should be noted that these deficit numbers are being achieved after almost ten years of economic recovery this is not the usual historical picture therefore it seems that we are entering a period of time where the economic paradigm is changing we don t know what to call it yet but new dislocations will be building and we have no idea at this time what that will mean for the economy let s look back at the last 50 years mentioned above that means going back to 1969 as i have tried to document many times in this blog and as i am presenting in my book about this time period the 1960s really represented the beginning of what i now call the period of credit inflation the period began in the kennedy johnson years where deficits were promoted as the way to combat economic recessions but in the sixties the phillips curve became the excuse to run deficits all of the time so as to spur on economic growth added on to these ideas was the move to support housing through numerous programs that would spread credit to the middle classes richard nixon became president in 1969 and stated that he was entirely supportive of this approach to stimulating economic growth over time by the early 1970s we began to see the consequences of this philosophy as the sustained push to expand credit resulted in more and more money going into assets like housing gold art and other commodities added on to this continual effort to provide more and more credit to the economy we saw greater and greater amounts of risk taking and greater use of financial leverage on top of this the 1980s and 1990s was a peak time for financial innovation and in the 1990s we saw more and more asset price bubbles something that continues to this day however these results were connected to the fact that as the government provided more and more fiscal and monetary stimulus to credit inflation less and less money went into physical economic growth and more and more money went into chasing assets the economic growth of the american economy slowed down and these practices continued on after the great recession with economic growth for the almost ten years of the current expansion came in at a modest 2 2 percent compound rate of increase the worst on record price inflation consumer price inflation has remained very low during the current expansion while asset prices have shown substantial rates of increase stock prices have traded at all time highs commodity prices has been very buoyant as has the value of many other assets now we have rising government debt rising consumer debt rising corporate debt and at this late a date in the economic recovery and more debt is in the forecast the federal reserve is holding massive amounts of government debt on its balance sheetâ and it holds a massive amount of private debt on its balance sheet in the form of mortgage backed securities the question is where do we go from here and how do we finance the piles of debt now predicted for the future is this a new stage of credit inflation one where financial markets are just flooded with debt issues and liquidity is floating all over the place not only here but all over the world the european central bank for example just ended its flooding of the european banking system with quantitative easing but now is faced with the problem that with italy in recession brexit on the horizon and with slowing growth rates elsewhere in the european union that it must return to some kind of liquidity provision in order to face europe s slowdown in economic growth china is moving to provide greater stimulation to its economy after slower growth rates have been posted there economic growth as i have written does not seem to be dependent anymore upon demand side economic stimulus like deficit creating fiscal programs or loose monetary policy the supply side seems to be determining how fast the economy is growing and this i continue to argue is due to the assumption of credit inflation that is now built into the investing and speculating efforts of businesses and individuals but asset bubbles cannot be sustained forever by creating more and more debt if economic growth is low or non existent the debt cannot continuously be sustained ultimately there must be something real behind the debt something that produces real wealth the environment we have right now is not producing this real wealth to sustain the credit inflation that is taking over the paradox the united states faces is that its credit inflation is less than that of most of the rest of the world this is a good part of the reason that the value of the us dollar is so strong so i would argue that we are entering a strange new world where the economic expansion is long yet still going on but the credit inflation created by the government is also expanding creating many many dislocations in the world of asset prices we do not know how this will play out because the paradigm seems to have changed

monrovia be it as it may the george weah administration has received some commendations for taking decisive steps in acting upon the two investigative reports on the alleged missing containers full of liberian dollar banknotes amounting to us 16 billion report by lennart dodoo both reports one sanctioned by the government of liberia through the presidential investigation team pit and the other by kroll associates inc a firm hired by usaid through the american embassy in liberia established that there is no evidence to prove that a container full of local currency banknotes disappeared however both reports established discrepancies in the central bank of liberia s accounting and reporting system both reports pointed to the unauthorized printing of l 10 billion this is after the cbl had already printed an authorized amount of l 5 billion the sticky issue in the reports was however not the unauthorized printing of the l 10 billion rather the printing of excess over the authorized l 5 billion and the l 10 billion the excess banknotes which were not reported by the cbl amounted to over l 3 1 billion at the extra cost of us 835 367 78 at the expense of liberian tax payers the presidential investigation team in its report penned that officials of the bank acted criminally by conspiring to doctor and fix reports which were contrary to the actual amounts printed and received by the cbl this alleged conspiracy has landed at least five persons behind bars awaiting court trial these persons mr milton weeks former executive governor of the cbl mr charles sirleaf deputy governor for operations and son of ex president ellen johnson sirleaf and dorbor hagba director for banking richard walker director for operations and joseph dennis deputy director for internal audit are being held for economic sabotage fraud criminal conspiracy among others the full weight of the law has descended on them government vindicated before probe upon his arrival from israel over the weekend president george weah speaking to journalists at the roberts international airport ria said he sought the assistance of the u s embassy in the investigation because he knew his government was going to be vindicated president weah first of all we want to thank our international partners most especially the u s embassy and madam elder for first of all accepting when i called her to probe into this matter i wanted liberians to see that we re transparent and the only we could do that was to get an international group to probe into this alleged missing l 16 billion which of course we all knew that our government was going to be vindicated so we brought in the u s embassy to help us and today kroll was able to give a determination of what happened us 25 million mop up still confusing the arrests began just a couple of hours after the kroll report was released to the public on february 28 this raised many eyebrows with many asking how about the us 25 million intended to mop up excess liquidity the pit in its report recommended that given the many discrepancies noted in the manner in which the mop up exercise was conducted in relation to the infusion of the us 25 million into the liberian economy there was the need for a forensic investigation of the entire mop up exercise to be conducted in the midst of calls for arrest of finance and economic planning minister samuel tweah who chaired the technical economic management team temt to conduct the mop up exercise a group of young liberians who perhaps have not laid eye on any of the reports since their release carried banners to the ria to welcome min tweah from israel the banner read welcome back home minister samuel d tweah jr liberia s finest financial expert from the holy land of israel we stand by you with great trust and confidence as you continue to serve the people with dignity diligence and integrity it was easy to tell that these were a group of young hungry liberians being taken advantage of just to either maintain their jobs or continue getting handouts surprisingly the cbl also published an advertisement supplement in several dailies which attempts to prove that minister tweah the cbl and the technical economic management team temt did a fine job in the mop up exercise the temt included central bank governor nathaniel r patray iii co chair minister of state for presidential affairs nathaniel mcgill minister of commerce minister of state without portfolio chairman of the national investment commission commissioner general of the revenue authority of liberia and the economic advisor to the president frontpageafrica s analysis of the two investigative reports and the cbl statement shows that there is more confusion as to who is being real with the figures or are liberians being taken for a ride by this government the cbl statement according to the central bank it was mandated by temt to use direct mopping strategy since over 90 percent of currency in the economy is outside the banking system the statement also averred that cbl experience shows that convention foreign exchange auction through the commercial banks has had limited impact on the exchange rate for that matter the cbl decided to infuse the u s dollars by auctioning it to major importers licensed foreign exchange bureaus and small businesses the pit puts it this way the temt chaired by hon samuel d tweah jr minister of finance and development planning designed a process which involves direct mop up this means that the implementation even would directly engage businesses and nonbanking institutions to directly exchange united states dollars with liberian dollars accordingly between july 2018 and october 2018 a total of us 17 million was infused into the economy the remaining us 8 million is still with the cbl according to the cbl s statement giving a breakdown the cbl indicated us 15 million was mopped up from outside the banking system in exchange for l 2 303 363 898 in addition to that us 2 million was given to a major petroleum importer in exchange for l 313 141 800 00 through regular banking transaction to facilitate import of petroleum products pit points to us 14 million frontpageafrica noticed discrepancies in the figures given by cbl the pit and kroll while the cbl claims to have disbursed us 17 of the us 25 million promised by president weah in the mop up the pit investigative report stated that us 14 million was used instead over the period the pit report analysis of the implementation report submitted by the temt cbl shows that institutions businesses participated and received from cbl a total of us 14 million in exchange for a total of l 2 151 363 99 00 from july 17 2018 to september 18 2018 the disbursements of the us 14 million are as follows a a total of us 5 6 million was sold to institutions businesses to the major importers category b a total of us 1 4 million was sold to institutions businesses in the small business holders category c a total of us 7 million was sold to institutions businesses in the major foreign exchange bureaus category the pit concluded that temt cbl deviated from best practice which calls for the use of legitimate banking institutions and licensed foreign exchange bureaus or sae auction for said exercise instead the temt cbl carried out direct mop up by engaging foreign exchange bureaus and local businesses other than the commercial banks the investigative team also established that some businesses institutions received lesser amounts than what was reported by cbl for example the union local forex bureau located on carey street received a total of us 5 500 00 on two separate disbursements us 3 000 on july 17 2017 and us 2 300 00 on august 16 22017 however the cbl in its report stated that the total amount of us 161 900 00 us 103 720 00 on july 17 2018 and us 58 400 00 on august 16 2018 was received by union local forex bureau the pit also noted that principle of know your customer kyc was not observed throughout the mopped up exercise thereby creating the platform for illegal business dealers to clean their illegal money kroll says us 15 million kroll s report rather shows that on july 10 2018 the cbl submitted a request to travelex global and financial services for a drawdown of us 20 million from a bank account held with the federal reserve bank of new york the

file in this tuesday march 5 2019 file photo the cape kortia container ship heads into the port of tacoma in commencement bay the u s trade deficit jumped nearly 19 percent in december pushing the trade imbalance for all of 2018 to widen to a decade long high of 621 billion the gap with china on goods widened to an all time record of 419 2 billion ap photo ted s warren file for years president trump has been obsessed with trade deficits incorrectly viewing them as a good measure of which countries are winning and which are losing the united states has run a trade deficit for decades thereby designating us a perennial loser in trump s worldview he promised to turn things around by picking a few easy to win trade wars instead by trump s own measure we re bigger losers than ever before the trade deficit just jumped to its largest size in a decade even worse our deficit in goods which trump for some reason emphasizes most just hit its largest level ever there are a few takeaways from this news including that trade was probably a bigger drag on growth last year than previously forecast but the bigger question is this why exactly is the trade deficit expanding when trump promised it would shrink the answer largely though not exclusively has to do with trump s own economic policies to be clear trade deficits whether bilateral or otherwise are not necessarily bad nor are they a sign that we re being somehow cheated by other countries they reflect broader trends in the economy including savings and investment rates small or shrinking trade deficits are also not necessarily a measure of a healthy economy in fact as bloomberg news shawn donnan points out the year the u s trade deficit shrank the most was 2009 which was not exactly a blockbuster year for the economy we were at the tail end of the great recession then and because the economy was bad americans bought less stuff from abroad today the u s economy is healthy with economic growth relatively robust this is partly because of the fiscal stimulus trump has been pumping into the economy through both his tax cuts and federal spending hikes consumers have more money to spend which means they demand more stuff and companies have ramped up their imports to satisfy that demand simultaneously other countries including china and members of the european union have not been doing so hot with the u s economy doing well while other economies are faltering and the federal reserve raising rates the dollar has strengthened making foreign products look cheaper and making our exports more expensive i e less competitive in other countries that too leads to higher trade deficits and it s one of many reasons team trump might want to cool it with the schadenfreude about other countries economic woes so in some ways then trump s preferred metric of winning is a victim of his own fiscally driven economic success but it s also a victim of his trade policy failures he has picked trade wars the world over with friends and foes alike he has also threatened even more tariffs including an additional hike in tariffs on chinese goods a new national security driven duty on auto imports etc these actions and threats have led to some predictable consequences one is that u s companies have stocked up on some imported goods to beat the tariffs which increases imports in the short run higher imports equal bigger trade deficit another is that other countries have levied their own retaliatory tariffs on our own products most famously red state goods such as soybeans and bourbon so there has been less demand for u s exports lower exports also equal bigger trade deficit trump has pledged that once his brilliantly negotiated deals go through the new north american free trade agreement gets ratified by congress china fully capitulates to all his wildest demands the european union and japan suddenly decide to buy more of our cars etc our balance of trade will turn around there s reason to be skeptical however and not only because some of these objectives seem like fantasies even the ones that look more plausible such as the implementation of the new nafta seem unlikely to move the needle after all the new nafta looks an awful lot like the old nafta plus some language cribbed from the pacific trade pact trump pulled us out of in fact the most significant change in the new nafta deal involves new content rules for autos which are intended to lead to more manufacturing and manufacturing jobs in the united states but as trade experts have pointed out these new rules may be so costly to comply with that they could have the opposite of their intended effect leading manufacturers to source less rather than more content from north america which could mean a boost to auto and auto parts imports which would contribute to you guessed it a wider trade deficit catherine rampell catherine rampell s email address is crampell washpost com follow her on twitter crampell
since the election of hugo chavez in 1998 venezuela has undergone a period of intense racial and class conflict as a multiethnic subaltern coalition has begun to assert itself politically against a

the country into two groups underclass mobs and respectable civil society this article which analyses media coverage at crucial points of conflict 1998 9 2002 2013 and 2014 finds that western media have overwhelmingly matched the local media portraying only the largely dark skinned working class chavista groups as vicious mobs hordes and thugs while representing the white upper class opposition as civil society since the election of hugo chavez in 1998 venezuela has undergone a period of intense racial and class conflict as a multiethnic subaltern coalition has begun to assert itself politically against a previously hegemonic and inordinately dominant white elite scholars have highlighted the local media s racial and class snobbery when covering social movements and civil society attempting to split the country into two groups underclass mobs and respectable civil society this article which analyses media coverage at crucial points of conflict 1998 9 2002 2013 and 2014 finds that western media have overwhelmingly matched the local media portraying only the largely dark skinned working class chavista groups as vicious mobs hordes and thugs while representing the white upper class opposition as civil society t oday venezuelans struggle as their economy implodes and their latin american neighbours lurching to the right threaten sanctions against the socialism of current president maduro but the present set of contradictions follows years of demonisation of former president hugo chavez and his supporters by the western media since chavez s election in 1998 the country has undergone a period of intense class and racial conflict since the election of hugo chavez as president in 1998 chavez the first non white leader in the majority non white country s history was re elected three times and led a popular movement against the entrenched white elite since 1998 venezuela has become a site of permanent struggle between the middle and upper classes and the subaltern masses that chavez drew his support from the country has thus drawn a great deal of media interest from around the world from both the left and the right this article using content and discourse analysis explores how seven influential western newspapers represented the subaltern civil society groups that supported the chavista project and the mostly elite groups that oppose it it finds an almost unfailing double standard of representing civil society groups that support the chavistas as dangerous gangs of thugs and any group opposing them as respectable civil society groups no matter how questionable their actions civil society is generally understood as the aggregate of non governmental organisations and institutions aiming to further the interests and will of citizens within a nation it consists of ngos unions social movements professional associations and many more groups that collectively try to improve society yet many academics who have studied the local venezuelan media have argued that that media label only middle class groups as forming civil society while demonising working class groups as hordes gangs or riffraff 1 previous work has detailed the close connections between the venezuelan elite venezuelan media and western journalists with western media often hiring local elite journalists as correspondents and taking their cue and political line from local publications 2 what has never been studied before is how the international media represent venezuelan civil society in order to explore the question of how the international media portray who does and does not constitute venezuelan civil society a sample from seven leading western publications was taken from the nexus and newsbank databases of all relevant articles over 400 words containing the word venezuela in the text those newspapers were the new york times the washington post the miami herald the guardian the independent the times london and the daily telegraph see table 1 the dates selected were from peak periods of interest across the chavista period 1998 they were the 1998 9 election and inauguration of chavez the 2002 coup attempt the 2013 death of chavez the 2013 election of nicolas maduro and the 2014 protests against the government as it produces far more articles on venezuela than the other newspapers the date ranges for the miami herald were slightly curtailed in order to prevent it dominating the sample this produced a total of 501 articles 232 from left of centre publications 229 from right of centre and 40 from centrist newspapers 302 of them american and 199 british these articles were then analysed using content and discourse analysis but to set this media coverage in context some background to venezuela s recent history is needed the venezuelan social context due to the implementation of neoliberalism during the 1980s and 1990s inequality between the classes in venezuela greatly increased and poverty rose rapidly this led to profound social dislocation particularly after the 1989 caracazo when the government ordered a military crackdown on working class protesters from the barrios resulting in the massacre of thousands the event and the economic crisis of the 1990s led to the breakdown of the traditional social order and to the election of a former military officer and political outsider hugo chavez as president in 1998 chavez who came from a poor family campaigned on the promise of a new constitution it was implemented the next year and contained new rights for indigenous groups the poor and women among others he was re elected in 2000 but in 2002 a coup by the combined sectors of the venezuelan elite with help from the us government deposed him however chavez was saved from the same fate as many latin american leaders by an uprising among the poor dark skinned majority of venezuelans who demanded his return as a result of the coup the chavista government moved to the left and instituted a series of wide scale social programmes designed to redistribute wealth and power downwards under chavez venezuela s human development rose sharply poverty fell by half and the working class s share of national income rose by 22 per cent 3 chavez was re elected again in 2006 and subsequently in 2012 in a political landslide led by an energised grassroots campaign from below that sought to challenge the social cultural political and racial hegemony of the light skinned elite that had ruled the country since independence rather than simple economic benefits it was the newfound sense of self worth and the sense of inclusion among the darker skinned working class majority that was crucial to understanding the sustained popularity of chavez he ruled until his death in 2013 his vice president nicolas maduro was elected on the promise of continuing his bolivarian revolution however venezuela had entered a profound economic crisis with the price of oil falling dramatically disastrous government policies and us sanctions the opposition largely the same elite that had ruled before chavez used this to attempt to oust the increasingly unpopular maduro such as in the 2014 campaign of guarimbas street protests and barricades detailed below today venezuela is racked by inflation and shortages of certain food products yet those who have been hit the worst the working classes have protested the least and continue to disproportionately support the government while the least affected upper classes have mobilised around the issue generating considerable international attention this situation is complicated by the fact that both food production and distribution continue to be largely privately controlled and are in the hands of members of the elite like lorenzo mendoza of empresas polar the country s largest company which has near monopoly control over many key foodstuffs that are in short supply as ana felicien and her co authors state without polar there is no food noting that the company has withheld food during key political periods before 4 mendoza considered running as the opposition s presidential candidate against maduro in 2018 nevertheless despite the country s enormous economic problems the opposition has at the time of writing not yet achieved its goal of retaking political power many commentators have strongly criticised the chavista project kurt weyland claims that it slowly but surely smothered democracy by removing checks and balances and crushing civil society 5 similar criticism has been levelled by human rights organisations human rights watch hrw notes the government s adversarial approach to civil society seeking to harass those groups and exclude and marginalise dissent in the country 6 a 2018 organization of american states oas report condemned the government accusing it of crimes against humanity as it represses civil society groups 7 others have rebutted these criticisms two nobel laureates and over a hundred latin american studies specialists claimed hrw s report does not even meet the most minimal standards of scholarship and drew attention to the revolving door between human rights organisations and the us government directly implicated in regime change 8 critics of the oas position note that the organisation is dominated by the us and was expressly created as an anti socialist pro capitalist organisation they draw attention to its leader uruguayan diplomat luis almagro s strong anti socialist bias and his close relationship with the controversial venezuelan opposition leader leopoldo lopez lopez convicted of terrorism in 2014 is termed a dear friend and a political prisoner indeed one of the oas report s writers is lopez s lawyer furthermore in justifying congress 2018 funding of the oas usaid argued that the organisation is crucial for promoting us interests in the western hemisphere by countering the influence of anti us countries such as venezuela 9 one reason for the differences in opinion according to ernesto abalo is diverging positions on what constitutes democracy noting that by the standard of participatory or radical democracy with its emphasis on people power and inclusion venezuela has done well however if judged by the standards of liberal democracy with its emphasis on procedure and institutions there are clear shortcomings 10 furthermore the relationship between civil society and the state is crucial but often fractious across latin america civil society groups were important in bringing about the end of the pinochet regime in chile in ecuador and bolivia indigenous organisations that were key to presidents correa and morales success now find themselves in conflict with their governments over questions of extraction and the environment on the right too civil society groups played a key role in the impeachment of brazil s president rousseff in 2016 and the election of jair bolsonaro in 2018 the media and venezuela the media in venezuela is highly concentrated in very few hands and linked with the old elite who controlled the country until 1998 during the punto fijo period 1958 1998 only the government had the power to award new licences for media in order to embark on a new media enterprise one had to have close connections to high ranking government officials scholars have highlighted numerous cases where government ministers or advisers have been awarded licences 11 this has led to a symbiotic relationship between the media and political elites where the media dependent on the government for licensing in turn legitimises and validates the government through positive coverage after the collapse of the traditional political parties after 1998 the media became the primary political vehicle of the elite even after the controversial chavista media reforms private media still dominate with the state television s audience share low a large majority of radio stations and newspapers are critical of the government studies of the private venezuelan media have been highly critical lupien notes its extremely high level of concentration and alignment with local opposition political parties what results is a narrow set of perspectives according to which movements challenging the hegemony of the dominant social race and class are attacked as dangerous and feckless unable to discredit the results of the elections claims lupien the media has sought to undermine the standing of the chavista government by presenting its supporters as unthinking followers or as dangerous irrational mobs 12 and duno gottberg argues that the local media has attempted to construct two distinct groupings of political actors rational respectable civil society groups who oppose the government and the dangerous mob of dark skinned lower class degenerates who support it 13 for hernandez while the chavista project may be read as an attempt to lift and energise the lower classes into a people through national popular interpellation the discourse of the white elite has been to present itself as civil society and the multitude as a barbaric permanent threat to society hence he argues the term civil society has become an empty signifier used only to describe groups belonging to the privileged white elite that are in opposition to the government and their vulgar supporters an imaginary source of terror for the elite thus the local media obsessively represent chavista civil society organisations as intrinsically violent paramilitary like groups designed to intimidate and eliminate the opposition thus he accuses the elite of waging a campaign of media terrorism in which influential newspapers like el nacional and el universal demonstrate a coherent and systematic line of argument intended to cause fear horror and hatred towards chavismo 14 lupien claims that chavez supporters are never bestowed with agency or viewed as being guided by rational self interest by the local media which instead use words like lowlifes thugs or taliban and depict them as linked to the president by emotional manipulation or literally by magical or religious control 15 for instance el nacional 14 october 2001 described chavista civil society as an underclass brought in from the interior of the country that did not understand what they were voting for but were willing to sell themselves for a lump of bread and a bottle of rum this trope of poor unintelligent venezuelans being easily bribed continues to the present day in the may 2018 elections reuters claimed the poor were voting for maduro because they thought they were winning a prize or because they would receive a box of food 16 during the 2002 coup where the elite s push to force chavez out of office by violence was beaten back by mass protests from the country s popular classes the local media insisted the mob did not know what it was doing and was being manipulated by a deceitful leader 17el universal 19 july 2002 characterised those opposing the government as civil society and the counter coup as 21 april 2002 looting as a product of resentment virtually the entire local media was heavily involved in fomenting orchestrating and promoting the coup which was headquartered at the mansion home of gustavo cisneros the owner of the largest tv channel on 12 april his channel venevisión ran a tickertape on its screen stating venezuela recovered its liberty while coup leaders were invited on air and thanked the media for their cooperation one stated we had a deadly weapon the media and now that i have the opportunity let me congratulate you 18 other networks did the same one rctv director was told to put zero chavismo on screen 19 on the same day one of venezuela s most influential tv hosts napoleon bravo invited the coup leaders on air who thanked him for assisting them in their rebellion the country s national newspapers were similarly involved el nacional s 11 april 2002 front page on the day before the coup read take to the streets not one step backwards and the final battle will be at the miraflores el universal 13 april 2002 was triumphant in the aftermath of what seemed a successful endeavour its headline declaring a step forward most private tv networks suspended regular broadcasts to beseech viewers to come onto the streets to overthrow the government they played doctored footage of chavez supporters under attack that made it seem as if they were the aggressors and allowed coup leaders airtime to denounce chavez but they refused to report on the counter coup while it was ongoing instead airing documentaries and julia roberts movies as the counter coup succeeded all national newspapers except últimas noticias suspended printing indeed el universal 13 january 2002 described the bolivarian circles neighbourhood associations that played a crucial role in beating back the coup as dangerous riffraff who lacking the stylish elegance of the italian blackshirts or the discipline of german nazi groups to be truly considered fascist were deemed closest to haitian president duvalier s death squads the tontons macoutes both groups brutish thugs who practised magic 20 this underlying racism will be discussed below race and venezuela after the arrival of columbus in 1498 venezuela was set up as a plantation economy in which small groups of european landgrabbers enslaved large groups of indigenous americans in order to produce primary products they decimated by the invasion and conquest were succeeded by captured africans brought into the territory whose lives were similarly held of little account after the long independence struggle and the final abolition of slavery in the mid nineteenth century the structure of the economy changed very little a white creole landowning elite replaced direct spanish rule while indigenous and afro venezuelans were effectively barred from well paying jobs in the oil industry meaning that today the poor are mostly black and the black are mostly poor attempts were made to whiten the make up of the population in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with government programmes giving european immigrants much of the most productive land cannon has cogently argued that white in venezuela is shorthand for beautiful pure and sophisticated with black the symbol of ugly poor and unintelligent black people are practically invisible on venezuelan television presented only as feckless lowlifes and black is highly undervalued if not despised in the country before chavez s advent there were almost no non white tv show hosts in this majority non white country the intersection of race and class can be seen in advertising where products aimed at the elite use white models while those aimed at a working class audience often feature darker models despite the fact that 64 per cent of venezuelans are non white only 4 per cent identify as black 21 thus there is a strong correlation between race class and political affiliation in venezuela where 67 per cent of socioeconomic sectors a and b voted for chavez s opponent in 2000 while only 24 per cent of socioeconomic category e did so as opposed to 50 5 per cent voting for chavez half of those voting for him in 1998 had never voted before chavez drew his support from the poor who felt he was one of them since he grew up in poverty in a mud hut in barinas state in contrast cannon argues that his rejection by the middle classes was precisely a rejection of the poor and dark skinned and was based on a deeply rooted historical notion of black as inferior to white 22 this unstated position of the elite today salas contends is being challenged openly by a multi ethnic coalition of subaltern peoples and is a painful psychological shock to the hegemonic white supremacist culture 23 black and chavista are understood to be virtually synonymous in venezuela a supplement of el nacional printed a story of three opposition journalists blacked up to look like golliwogs so as to pass unnoticed at a chavista rally by the mob violently opposed to them one problem the supplement pointed out was that permanent use of this disguise would mean they would begin to smell like monkeys taken for granted was that chavistas were black and civil society white 24 during the 2017 protests against the government a black man orlando jose figueroa was accosted by a group of white protesters who assumed because of his skin colour he was both a chavista and a criminal he was beaten stabbed six times and burned to death other afro venezuelans were lynched by white groups during these protests thus salas claims the political economy of racism among the venezuelan elite is nothing more than the historical continuation of the process of conquest and slavery that began 500 years ago 25 and yet racism is a taboo subject in venezuela one of the core national ideologies is that the country is a coffee with milk society where everyone is a mix of coffee african and milk european effectively meaning they are all the same race as a consequence openly racial language and terminology in the media coexists alongside the denial that racism is a problem inside the country it is not a situation that is challenged by local analyses of the venezuelan media or of the ways that civil society is represented most of which focus solely on the 2002 coup attempt and do not challenge the inherent biases of coverage more generally this article however takes into account the entire chavista period 1998 and focuses on british and american media it shows how the western media closely mirror the racist and classist coverage of venezuelan media one reason for this is that western journalists going to venezuela typically live and work in the exclusive east side of an intensely racially and socially segregated caracas most such journalists live in exclusive gated communities with armed guards and rarely travel outside the rich cosmopolitan east side therefore they rarely come into contact with the poor dark skinned majority of the country many do not speak spanish and so cannot in any case communicate with the bottom 95 per cent of the population who do not speak english this further limits them to communicating almost exclusively with elite sources they also work closely alongside established local journalists who are overwhelmingly from privileged backgrounds and from highly partisan opposition media organisations journalists have admitted to me simply copying and pasting stories from partisan local news sources like el universal and el nacional furthermore due to pressures of globalisation and of cuts many western news organisations employ or have outsourced their venezuelan coverage to local journalists from oppositional backgrounds this creates an antagonistic newsroom atmosphere where even western journalists in caracas call themselves the resistance to the chavistas while those more sympathetic to the chavistas admit to self censorship adding to the groupthink as one journalist said i just never even pitched stories that i knew would never get in and i knew that and i wasn t stupid enough to even pitch i knew it wouldn t even be considered after that i just stopped 26 no wonder then that local media attitudes seep into western reporting as well findings from western coverage the frequency with which the seven newspapers in my sample presented chavista and opposition groups disparagingly as intrinsically violent mobs or gangs was counted overall there were 158 references in sixty five articles to government sympathetic groups as violent hordes gangs or criminals but the newspapers did not use words like hordes mobs or gangs to describe opposition groups at all chavez was the country s first non white president having run against a string of opposition candidates including a former miss universe the local media christened the election beauty vs the beast 27 the western media picked up on this tone framing his supporters as ignorant and beastly the washington post 7 december 1998 quoted one observer noting chavez goes down to people very low in culture he offers a series of things that are dreams and the miami herald 7 december 1998 claimed that the chavistas would embrace an authoritarian dictatorship citing one source who said chavez s history of violence worries me his followers worry me his followers generally are not very educated the dehumanisation of working class dark skinned venezuelans was ramped up in 2002 during the coup attempt on 11 april large demonstrations overwhelmed caracas opposition civil society groups claimed that chavez s actions as president including his verbal attacks on the church and business groups were eroding democracy it was the renationalisation of pdvsa petróleos de venezuela s a which they saw to be neutral and independent that was for many in this group the final straw as anti government protests met pro government marches shots were fired nineteen people were killed and sixty nine wounded opposition leaders blamed chavez for the violence and with the help of military units arrested him and installed in his place pedro carmona the chief of the chamber of commerce representatives from all sectors of the elite the catholic church military business media and trade unions signed the carmona decree which abolished the new constitution suspended the supreme court liquidated congress and gave carmona the power to rule alone by decree the racial and class composition of the new government was evident even to the coup makers themselves with carmona s advisers beseeching him to find at least one non white person to put in front of the cameras broadcasting the events but carmona did not find one 28 according to the final report of the venezuelan human rights defender seven of the dead were chavistas seven were opposition supporters and five were unaffiliated of those wounded thirty eight were chavistas seventeen opposition and fourteen unaffiliated there is no consensus on who was responsible for the murders those sympathetic to the opposition stress a lack of certainty over who was guilty while those on the other side take it as a virtual fact that the opposition was however even the strongest critics of the chavistas accept that what took place was indeed a coup 29 the coup leaders appeared on tv and announced lists of hundreds of political figures to be detained while a purge of over 500 journalists deemed enemies of the new regime took place 30 in less than a day over 100 were imprisoned state tv was forced off the air and many local independent media were invaded and destroyed with journalists being tortured and others publicly flogged 31 however the new government lasted only two days as large numbers of dark skinned working class venezuelans came down from the hills around caracas to protest these mass peaceful demonstrations encouraged loyal army units to retake the presidential palace and rescue chavez released documents show that the coup and the violence had been planned from the start and that the us government was intimately aware that the opposition was planning to provoke and exploit violence in early april in order to push through a coup 32 the us initially supported these actions the white house calling them peaceful demonstrations that chavez had ordered suppressed and it pressured the oas to recognise carmona 33 however the oas immediately denounced what it saw as a violent coup d état and expressed solidarity with the venezuelan people 34 by 15 april the us government had backtracked and itself condemned the coup this is the context in which the western media portrayed the groups responsible for the coup as civil society while the lower class groups defending the constitution were dangerous mobs and threats to democracy for example the daily telegraph 13 april 2002 reported that the president of venezuela was forced to resign by his military high command yesterday after his supporters opened fire on an opposition rally calling for his departure killing 13 people moves alienated all of the important sectors in venezuelan society business landowners the unions and the catholic church mr chavez has a fanatical following among some sectors of the poor emphasis added thus the newspaper reported false information that chavez had resigned and that his supporters had killed opposition supporters yet chavez was demonstrably kidnapped and the balance of evidence particularly that twice as many chavistas were wounded as opposition supporters and that cnn correspondent otto neustadt filmed the coup leaders denunciations of the shootings before any took place indicates their responsibility it also delegitimised the working class claiming all important sectors of society opposed chavez and only fanatical murderers supported him those fanatical murderers made up the majority of the country the new york times 13 april 2002 strongly supported the events framing them as a democratic uprising rather than a coup noting that chavez had alienated virtually every constituency from middle class professionals academics and business leaders to union members and the roman catholic church one encouraging development has been the strong participation of middle class citizens in organizing opposition groups and street protests continued civic participation could help revitalize venezuela it described the coup as a week of peaceful marches by protesters while the counter protest was characterised as furious mobs of chavez supporters marching violently through the capital looting stores in poor areas not surprisingly the death toll mounted 16 april 2002 this was very similar to el universal s coverage documented previously less than two years before chavez had won both the largest share of the vote and the largest total number of votes in venezuelan history winning twenty two out of twenty three states he went on to best those numbers in 2006 with his re election landslide chavez had evidently not alienated most of the population showing clearly who and who does not constitute society according to the media those who do are the white elite professional groups and those who do not are the violent unpeople who exist but evidently do not form part of society instead the new york times disparaged the hundreds of thousands of working class peaceful protesters who rose up as armed thugs 15 april 2002 and dobermans 12 april 2002 the other newspapers portrayed the groups similarly for example according to the washington post 21 april 2002 the opposition was inspired and energetic democratic civil society and the working class groups opposing the coup were hard core bullies even while the inspired democrats were gunning down the hard core bullies across the sample there were thirty five references to opposition groups as representing a respectable civil society but chavista groups were not once described in the same manner this across the spectrum uniformity adds weight to hernandez s theory that the term civil society is an empty signifier a technical term used only to describe elite groups the miami herald 16 april 2002 mirrored the coverage of el universal 13 january 2002 that compared the bolivarian circles to nazis and tontons macoutes noting they resembled nothing so much as the neighbourhood watch committees of so many dictatorships whether fascist or communist the presentation of chavez supporters as violent uneducated hordes continued throughout his presidency and after his death in 2013 while covering chavez s funeral and the subsequent presidential election the newspapers bestowed a lack of agency on chavez supporters presenting them as merely unthinking followers incapable of making rational decisions thus mirroring lupien s findings on the venezuelan media for example the times 6 march 2013 claimed that chavez was a larger than life figure who commanded an almost cultlike adoration from devotees of his selfstyled revolution his domination of power left little room for other political personalities to shine therefore according to the media working class venezuelans did not support the government rationally but were part of a brainwashed cult there was also a marked tendency to portray groups of chavistas as whipped up into a neurotic rage as the following two quotes demonstrate his frenzied followers just don t want to say goodbye and hugo chavez s heirs say maybe they won t have to the washington post 16 march 2013 and el comandante was brought back from the dead appearing on giant video screens working frenzied crowds the daily telegraph 12 april 2013 frenzy connotes uncontrollable irrational or wild behaviour indicating that groups supporting the government are hysterical manic or insane rather than rational actors the word is often used for irrational animals or even vermin a feeding frenzy and serves to dehumanise the dark skinned lower class majority of the country the word was never used to describe opposition movements the consequence of chavez s rule according to one newspaper was to have unleashed a beast on venezuela the miami herald 5 march 2013 claiming that as a result venezuela today is a polarised society divided between the intolerant supporters of mr chávez s bolivarian revolution and a democratic opposition that against all odds has waged a courageous fight for a democratic alternative this simultaneously demonises the chavistas and lionises the opposition the subsequent presidential election pitted chavez s vice president nicolas maduro against opposition leader henrique capriles while the chavistas viewed the election as free and fair the opposition claimed that though the vote was secure the government used state media and resources in its favour and that it pressured its employees to vote for maduro skewing the playing field the international reaction to the election was overwhelmingly positive the union of south american nations fully endorsed the proceedings as did many other important states such as canada mexico russia and spain in fact the only country in the world that did not quickly recognise the results was the us this was despite the fact that the carter center a nobel prize winning election monitoring organisation that the us government paid to observe the elections endorsed them it found that in fact capriles received almost three times as much coverage as maduro on tv most of it positive while maduro s coverage was mostly negative furthermore it found that less than one per cent of people reported being pressured to vote either way but twice as many were pressured to vote for capriles as for maduro 35 indeed in 2012 former president jimmy carter noted that the election system in venezuela was the best in the world nevertheless the western media presented it as an unfair fight between a plucky commendable democratic opposition and an authoritarian government that whipped its poverty stricken supporters into a frenzy the daily telegraph 6 march 2013 and could count on the blind support of a million client citizens and their families who were compelled to vote for their government due to working in the state sector the daily telegraph 7 march 2013 it also presented as a strong possibility that if the chavistas lost they might not accept the result for example the guardian 5 march 2013 noted that questions abound if capriles wins will chavista civilian militias and factions in the armed forces accept it emphasis added quotes such as these highlight the media s disdain for chavista groups they are also demonstrative of the same tendency to paramilitarise chavista groups that hernandez found in the venezuelan media in reality the chavistas have always accepted defeats immediately even in close referendum losses as in in 2007 whereas it is the opposition that has continually refused to accept election results and resorted to violence in a number of instances indeed it refused to accept any chavista victories until 2006 capriles himself had a history of violence including kidnapping the minister of the interior during the 2002 coup and leading a crowd that attacked the cuban embassy yet the question continually asked was not if the opposition will accept the results which they did not militias refers to the bolivarian circles which chavistas call civil society organisations but which are frequently described as armed paramilitaries by the venezuelan opposition throughout this research no opposition organisation was referred to as a militia even armed ones that conducted night attacks on the venezuelan army and police in this vein the daily telegraph 14 april 2013 reported many questioned whether mr maduro and his chavista supporters would accept an opposition victory if it happened and predicted violence if it did i trust the machines it s the humans i worry about added mr marrero if capriles wins we can expect violence the chavistas don t know how to lose the miami herald 5 march 2013 was also worried about violence quoting one observer armando 29 said his joy was tempered with concern about reaction among pro chávez supporters known as chavistas back home this is the first step to big change he said i hope nothing bad happens and that ignorant people don t resort to violence fortunately no ignorant people resorted to violence the mob stayed home peacefully unfortunately capriles told his civil society supporters to vent their anger on the streets the subsequent riots led to seven people all chavistas being killed 36 with no prospect of quickly coming to power electorally after losing the 2013 election the opposition split into two factions the more moderate of the two was led by henrique capriles which favoured continuing to pursue the electoral route the other led by leopoldo lopez favoured a return to the violent putsch tactics lopez argued in october 2013 we have to hurry the exit of the government nicolas maduro must go sooner rather than later from my point of view the method is secondary what is important is the determination to reach our goals at any cost 37 lopez pursued his tactic and in the spring and summer of 2014 anti government demonstrations engulfed caracas they came to be referred to as la salida the exit or the guarimbas forty three people died in high profile clashes between the opposition and government forces with fourteen deaths directly attributed to government security forces and twenty three due to opposition violence 38 the prolonged demonstrations caused massive damage and disruption to the country calculated at us 15 billion by the government chavistas accept that the police and national guard were guilty of some killings but claim the government showed amazing restraint in the face of a violent coup attempt oppositionists concede that the protesters caused many deaths but charge that the government repression was worse resulting in a widespread tropical pogrom against largely peaceful civil society groups 39 the local media generally favoured the second interpretation el universal 19 march 2014 for example condemned the violence of chavista armed groups against students and families who have peacefully demonstrated it was this interpretation that was dominant in the west ciccariello maher notes how the protesters expertly presented themselves as akin to the arab spring or the occupy movement on social media circulating pictures showing alleged government repression despite the fact that many images were not even from venezuela at all 40 the events made front page news around the world going viral on social media as celebrities like cher madonna and kevin spacey shared their full support for the opposition the class and racial aspect to the protests was noticed immediately by venezuelans the media and academics alike 41 light skinned private university students led the guarimbas which occurred in eighteen of the country s 335 municipalities primarily affluent white opposition controlled areas and did not spread to working class areas the guarimbas were highly unpopular with opposition aligned polling firms finding that by april two thirds of venezuelans were against them although a majority of rich venezuelans supported them with others putting their unpopularity as high as 87 per cent this was primarily due to their violence which included attacking government food shops bombing the caracas metro attacking ambulances and over 160 doctors some of whom the protesters attempted to burn to death destroying free universities aimed at poor students and attacking the housing ministry bombing kindergartens poisoning cities drinking water and even garrotting innocent passers by as part of their campaign 42 the list of targets represented a clear political message the institutions attacked were the representatives of the flagship social democratic programmes in health education transport and housing supported by the dark skinned subaltern classes yet the media presented the guarimbas not as a coup attempt by the same group as in 2002 but as the actions of virtuous peaceful protesters who were subjected to a sustained violent onslaught by a dictatorship and its goons emphasis added throughout the independent 18 february 2014 noted that the white house had voiced concern that the government was using security forces and armed gangs to break up peaceful protests while the times 15 april 2014 claimed that the hated colectivos armed gangs of government loyalists on motorbikes have been showing up at the houses of student demonstrators and threatening to kill them and not to be outdone the daily telegraph 21 february 2014 presented venezuela as falling into an ochlocracy mob rule stating that maduro has let the worst people take over surrendering authority to radical mobs and corrupt officials in a bid to keep them all on side furthermore beneath the surface civil society has been allowed to stagnate now that chavez is dead and the magic gone there is anarchy the worst people were not those garrotting innocent passers by or bombing kindergartens that was civil society peacefully protesting the worst people were the groups of working class venezuelans who did not support the guarimbas thus the british newspapers used the same framing as the local opposition presenting opposition groups as respectable civil society protesters employing their right to demonstrate while simultaneously disparaging chavista groups as violent unthinking gangs or mobs at no point was any opposition group referred to as a horde or a mob while a working class or chavista group was never referred to as civil society throughout the entire sample of 501 articles however the us newspapers presented the situation more emphatically still presenting as fact highly dubious claims about who was responsible for the violence and demanding international action and sometimes regime change the washington post 30 march 2014 claimed that venezuelans despair at the lack of international interest in the political crisis that is rocking their country since anti government protests began early last month at least 34 people have been killed most of them opposition supporters gunned down by security forces or government backed gangs this begs the question of who exactly is a venezuelan to the washington post evidently not the large majority of mostly dark skinned mostly working class venezuelans who opposed the guarimbas if we imagine a similar situation in the us it is doubtful that if black lives matter had bombed us government buildings in an express attempt to overthrow the president while killing police national guard and army units they would be described as peaceful protesters by the media the miami herald 17 february 2014 described the events as protests led by a responsible leader in lopez who wanted a peaceful march to end persecution and freedom for detained demonstrators but that instead of responding to the concerns of demonstrators by changing course or talking to his adversaries mr maduro unleashed government backed thugs who promptly escalated the violence on the streets emphasis added the miami herald 26 february 2014 also chastised president obama for inaction claiming that many latin american experts in washington agree that the obama administration cannot look the other way as peaceful protesters are massacred by government supported armed thugs emphasis added however the 2014 guarimbas petered out under the weight of their own unpopularity and the lack of international will to help them indeed the union of south american nations strongly backed maduro and condemned the opposition s violence with many nations labelling the guarimbas as a us government designed coup attempt the use of the word thug was particularly prevalent and notable in the sample the examples cited above were written by westerners for a us audience those writing or reading the articles understand what thug means in a north american context it has a highly racialised usage in the western english language press with blackness and criminality treated as synonymous in media and culture 43 today the word is aimed at demonising and criminalising black men argues coleman having supplanted nigger in common parlance 44 in total twenty of the 501 articles 4 per cent used the loudest racial dog whistle to refer to working class groups it should be noted that this was not 4 per cent of articles on chavez supporters but 4 per cent of all relevant articles including the word venezuela anywhere in the text this included everything from articles about oil to baseball teams to obituaries to miami residents problems to the actions of the us government the usage of the word was much more common in the later sample periods 2013 2014 long after its significance had been well documented and understood the study also tracked the use of thug to refer to opposition or middle class groups there were none the use of the word to describe chavistas was also common in the uk press the guardian 7 march 2013 claimed that thuggish armed civilian groups also swore to defend the revolution against enemies within and without these included opponents in the media the universities and the church while the telegraph 7 march 2013 in its story recounted how at chavez s funeral for a moment there is a tense stand off as the guard a hired thug not much more than 18 years old demands to know who is taking the photograph the use of the word thug to refer only to lower class dark skinned groups and never to opposition groups even when they were engaging in violence serves only to bolster the notion that it is dog whistle racism conclusion since 1998 the western media has shown an overwhelming tendency to represent chavista civil society groups as dangerous gangs hordes or mobs while simultaneously depicting opposition groups as respectable members of civil society mirroring the local media s positions whenever words such as mob gangs or hordes were used it was solely in reference to the largely working class largely dark skinned government sympathetic organisations and never once used to describe the largely white upper class opposition groups likewise the dog whistle term thug was used only to describe chavistas inside a context where chavista and black are understood to be virtually synonymous what makes this particularly notable is that the sample periods coincided with the height of the opposition s offensives to force the chavistas out of office through violence in 2002 it launched a deadly coup against the democratically elected government bringing in a short lived dictatorship in 2013 the opposition refused to accept the result of internationally recognised elections leading to deadly riots and in 2014 it launched a campaign aimed at forcefully removing the president once again yet across all the seven newspapers sampled those opposition groups were framed as civil society while those opposing their actions were mobs thugs and paramilitary hordes the western media presented the chavistas as intrinsically violent paramilitaries in the same fashion that hernandez found the venezuelan media did they were portrayed as the mindless irrational followers of a master illusionist demagogue who whipped them into a frenzy in the same way that the local press did as lupien demonstrated 45 the seven newspapers in this sample overwhelmingly followed the two group distinction of opposition civil society and the chavista mob catalogued by duno gottberg 46 the term civil society in this context is an empty signifier used exclusively to refer to higher class opposition groups in the same manner as in the venezuelan media western mass media appear to uniformly fall back upon the same broad tropes as venezuelan media that the coverage of chavez and his supporters is negative and of the opposition positive is perhaps unsurprising given the geopolitical positions of the united states and united kingdom with regards to venezuela but the closeness with which the international media mirrors the local opposition s lead highlights how interconnected are the two groups
by james petras not since the us pronounced the monroe doctrine proclaiming its imperial supremacy over latin america nearly 200 years ago has a white house regime so openly affirmed its mission to recolonize latin america the second decade of the 21st century has witnessed in word and deed the most thorough and successful us recolonization of latin america and its active and overt role as colonial sepoys of an imperial power in this paper we will examine the process of recolonization and the strategy tactics and goals which are the driving forces of colony building we will conclude by discussing the durability stability and washington s capacity to retain ownership of the hemisphere a brief history of 20th century colonization and decolonization us colonization of latin america was based on direct us military economic cultural and political interventions with special emphasis on central america north america mexico and the caribbean washington resorted to military invasions to impose favorite trade and investment advantages and appointed and trained local military forces to uphold colonial rule and to ensure submission to us regional and global supremacy the us challenged rival european colonial powers in particular england and germany and eventually reduced them to marginal status through military and economic pressure and threats the recolonization process suffered severe setbacks in some regions and nations with the onset of the great depression which undermined the us military and economic presence and facilitated the rise of powerful nationalist regimes and movements in particular in argentina brazil chile nicaragua and cuba the process of decolonization led to and included the nationalization of us oil fields sugar and mining sectors a shift in foreign policy toward relatively greater independence and labor laws which increased workers rights and leftwing unionization the us victory in world war ii and its economic supremacy led washington to re assert its colonial rule in the western hemisphere the latin american regimes lined up with washington in the cold and hot wars backing the us wars against china korea vietnam and the confrontation against the ussr and eastern europe for washington working through its colonized dictatorial regimes invaded every sector of the economy especially agro minerals it proceeded to dominate markets and sought to impose colonized trade unions run by the imperial centered afl cio by the early 1960 s a wave of popular nationalist and socialist social movements challenged the colonial order led by the cuban revolution and accompanied by nationalist governments throughout the continent including argentina bolivia venezuela peru ecuador and the dominican republic us multi national manufacturing firms were forced to engage in joint ventures or were nationalized as were oil mineral and energy sectors nationalists proceeded to substitute local products for imports as a development strategy a process of decolonization was underway the us reacted by launching a war to recolonize latin america by through military coups invasions and rigged elections latin america once more lined up with the us in support of its economic boycott of cuba and the repression of nationalist governments the us reversed nationalist policies and denationalized their economies under the direction of us controlled so called international financial organizations like the international monetary fund imf world bank wb inter american development bank the recolonization process advanced throughout the 1970 s and 1980 s under the auspices of newly imposed military regimes and the new neo liberal free market doctrine once again recolonization led to highly polarized societies in which the domestic colonized elites were a distinct minority moreover the colonial economic doctrine allowed the us banks and investors to plunder the latin countries impose out of control debt burdens de industrialization of the economies severe increases in unemployment and a precipitous decline in living standards by the early years of the 21st century deepening colonization led to an economic crisis and the resurgence of mass movements and new waves of nationalist popular movements which sought to reverse at least in part the colonial relationship and structures colonial debts were renegotiated or written off a few foreign firms were nationalized taxes were increased on agro exporters increases in public welfare spending reduced poverty public investment increased salaries and wages a process of de colonization advanced aided by a boom in commodity pieces twenty first century decolonization was partial and affected only a limited sector of the economy it mainly increased popular consumption rather than structural changes in property and financial power de colonization co existed with colonial power elites the major significant changes took place with regard to regional policies decolonizing elites established regional alliance which excluded or minimized the us presence regional power shifted to argentina and brazil in mercosur venezuela in central america and the caribbean ecuador and bolivia in the andean region but as history has demonstrated imperial power can suffer reverses and lose collaborators but while the us retains its military and economic levers of power it can and will use all the instruments of power to recolonize the region in a step by step approach incorporating regions in its quest for hemisphere supremacy the recolonization of latin america brazil argentina and the lima pact against venezuela as the first decade of the 21st century unfolded numerous latin american governments and movements began the process of decolonization displacing us client regimes taking the lead in regional organizations diversifying their markets and trading partners nevertheless the leaders and parties were incapable and unwilling to break with local elites tied to the us colonization project vulnerable to downward movements in commodity prices composed of heterogeneous political alliances and unable to create or deepen anti colonial culture the us moved to reconstruct its colonial project the us struck first at the weakest link of the decolonization process the us backed coups in honduras and paraguay then washington turned to converting the judiciary and congress as stepping stones for launching a political attack on the strategic regimes in argentina and brazil and turning secondary regimes in ecuador chile peru and el salvador into the us orbit as the recolonization process advanced the us regained its dominance in regional and international organizations the colonized regimes privatized their economies and washington secured regimes willing to assume onerous debts previously repudiated the us advances in recolonization looked toward targeting the oil rich dynamic and formidable anti colonial government in venezuela venezuela was targeted for several strategic reasons first venezuela under president chavez opposed us regional and global colonial ambitions secondly caracas provided financial resources to bolster and promote anti colonial regimes throughout latin america especially in the caribbean and central america thirdly venezuela invested in and implemented a profound and comprehensive state social agenda building schools and hospitals with free education and health care subsidized food and housing socialist democratic venezuela contrasted with the us abysmal dismantling of the welfare state among the reconstructed colonial states fourthly venezuela s national control over natural resources especially oil was a strategic target in washington imperial agenda while the us successfully reduced or eliminated venezuela s allies in the rest of latin america its repeated efforts to subdue venezuela failed an abortive coup was defeated as was a referendum to impeach president chavez us boycotts and the bankrolling of elections failed to oust the venezuelan government washington was unable to pressure and secure the backing of the mass of the population or the military coup techniques successful in imposing colonial regimes elsewhere failed the us turned to a multi prong continent wide covert and overt military political economic and cultural war the white house appointed juan guaido a virtual unknown as interim president guaido was elected to congress with 25 of the vote in his home district washington spent millions of dollars in promoting guaido and funding ngos and self styled human rights organization to slander the venezuelan government and launch violent attacks on the security forces the white house rounded up its recolonized regimes in the region to recognize guaido as the legitimate president washington recruited several leading european union countries especially the uk france and germany to isolate venezuela the us sought to penetrate and subvert the venezuelan populace via so called humanitarian aid refusing to work through the red cross and other independent organizations the white house fixed the weekend of feb 23 24 as the moment to oust president maduro it was a total unmitigated failure putting the lie to all of washington s fabrications the us claimed the armed forces would defect and join with the us funded opposition only a hundred or so out of 260 000 did so the military remained loyal to the venezuelan people the government and the constitution despite bribes and promises washington claimed the people in venezuela would launch an insurrection and hundreds of thousands would cross the border apart from a few dozen street thugs tossing molotov cocktails there was no uprising and less than a few hundred tried to cross the border tons of us aid remained in the colombian warehouses the brazilian border patrol sent the us funded protestors packing for blocking free passage across the frontier even us provocateurs who incinerated two trucks carrying aid were exposed the vehicles in flames remained on the colombian side of the border us sponsored boycotts of venezuelan oil exports partially succeed because washington illegaly seized venezuela export revenues the recolonized lima group passed hostile resolutions and re anointed trump s president guaido but few voters in the region took their pronouncements serious conclusion what are the colonized states expected to serve why has the white house failed to recolonize venezuela as it did in the rest of latin america the recolonized states in latin america serve to open their markets to us investors on easy terms with low taxes and social and labor costs and political and economic stability based on repression of popular class and national struggles colonized regimes are expected to support us boycotts coups and invasions and to supply military troops as ordered colonized regimes take the us side in international conflicts and negotiations in regional organizations they vote with the us and meet debt payments on time and in full the recolonized nations ensure favorable results for washington by manipulating elections and judicial decisions and by excluding anti colonial candidates and officials and arresting political activists the colonized regimes anticipate the needs and demands of washington and introduce resolutions on their behalf in regional organizations in the case of venezuela they promote and organize regional bloc like the lima group to promote us led intervention as washington proceeds to destabilize venezuela the colonized allies recycle us mass media propaganda and offer sanctuaries for opposition defectors and refugees in sum the recolonized elites facilitate domestic plunder and overseas conquests venezuela success in resisting and defeating the us drive for reconquest is the result of nationalist and socialist leaders who re allocate private wealth and re distribute public expenditures to the workers peasants and the unemployed under president chavez venezuela recruited and promoted military and security forces loyal to the constitutional order and in line with a popular socio economic and anti colonial agenda venezuela ensured that elections and judicial appointments were free and in line with the politics of the majority the venezuelans ensured that military advisers were independent of us military missions and aid agencies which plot coups and are disloyal to the nationalist state venezuelan social democracy its social advances and the massive reduction of poverty and inequality contributed to reinforcing commitments to endogenous cultural values and national sovereignty despite the us accumulation of colonial vassals throughout latin america and europe venezuela has consolidated mass support despite washington s capture of the global mass media it has not influenced popular opinion on a world scale despite us threats of a military option it lacks global support in the face of prolonged and large scale resistance washington hesitates in addition the latin americans colonized states face domestic social and economic crises and political resistance europe confronts a regional break up washington is riven by partisan divisions and a constitutional crisis the failure of the imperialist ultra s in washington to defeat venezuela can set in motion a new wave of decolonization struggles which can force the us to look inward and downward in order to decolonize its own electorate

how private sector debt bubble could trigger the next financial crisis the 22 trillion official national debt is a much discussed problem even as politicians exhibit zero motivation to do anything about it but as big an economic overhang as it is government debt isn t likely to trigger the next financial crisis yes servicing the growing federal debt bubble will depress gdp growth cause the value of the dollar to drop and raise inflation risks but the bubble itself won t necessarily burst not anytime soon as long as politicians face no political consequences for deficit spending and as long as the federal reserve keeps the treasury bond market propped up then many more trillions can be added to the national debt pending home sales have fallen on a year over year basis for 13 consecutive months farm loan delinquencies recently hit their highest level in 9 years more than 7 million americans are delinquent on their auto loan payments an all time record some 5 1 million people are in default on their student loans meanwhile more fragile debt bubbles exist in the private sector unlike government debt which carries the implicit backing of the fed s unlimited printing press debts incurred by corporations investors consumers and students can default globally there exists 250 trillion in debt against economic assets of around 100 trillion the notional value of all derivatives now approaches a quadrillion dollars it s been called the everything bubble and it could soon lead to the everything bust u s household debt rose to a record 13 5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2018 mortgages student loans car loans and credit cards represent enormous burdens even during a good economy these burdens will prove unbearable for millions of americans in the years ahead for many the financial crisis is already here student loans now rank as the second largest biggest category of american consumer debt just behind mortgages the cruel reality is that many of these gender studies and art history type degrees will never be worth as much in the job market as they cost to obtain the main consequence of the government subsidized student loan bubble is to enable college tuitions and fees to rise at a much higher rate than salaries it s not that universities have had to raise costs to pay for top notch professors instead the biggest growth in university hiring has been for administrators and diversity indoctrinators who get fancy titles and plush salaries while providing little to no useful instruction it s just one example of how easy money and distorted government incentives lead to malinvestment another example of course is the stock market investors in search of returns have bid up stocks to bubble heights following years of artificially depressed interest rates big corporations have tried to manipulate their own share prices higher by engaging in leveraged stock buybacks even at lofty recent valuations warren buffett defended stock buybacks of berkshire hathaway in his latest letter to shareholders while noting such practices can be destructive if done regardless of value assuming that we buy at a discount to berkshire s intrinsic value which certainly will be our intention repurchases will benefit both those shareholders leaving the company and those who stay obviously repurchases should be price sensitive blindly buying an overpriced stock is value destructive a fact lost on many promotional or ever optimistic ceos a composite of equity leverage including margin accounts and leveraged exchange traded products shows total leverage at an all time high last december a deleveraging event started to take hold into christmas until the u s treasury secretary convened the plunge protection team and federal reserve chairman jerome powell turned dovish the fed faces another potential deleveraging event just around the corner in the corporate bond market the u s investment grade corporate bond market has swelled to about 5 2 trillion according to bloomberg that represents an increase of more than 3 trillion over the last 10 years even more alarming around half of these investment grade bonds are just one tier away from being rated as junk between now and 2021 an unprecedented spike in outstanding commercial debt comes due that could be a disaster especially if credit spreads widen and or interest rates go up across the board investment grade debt maturing billions source wells fargo securities bloomberg another potential bubble unwinding to come is in stock market index funds passively managed index funds have grown from 4 5 of total u s stock market assets in 2002 to 17 in 2018 the late john bogle founder of vanguard and index investing pioneer turned skeptical on the outsized growth of index funds prior to his death perhaps these vehicles had become too successful for its own good he said the fundamental problem is that index funds assume an underlying efficient market where securities analysis and market discovery takes place when the largest shareholders of all the blue chip stocks are index funds valuations can get distorted the share prices of bad companies can get artificially propped up during bull markets and during bear markets when scared investors are selling index funds solid companies can be unfairly marked down high frequency program trading has come to dominate stock picking and when the algorithms turn bearish on market trends they can all follow each other in triggering cascading sell orders the next stock market crash could initially bring down all markets including commodities but any threat of deflation will trigger a massive inflationary response from the federal reserve inflationary assets such as precious metals stand to benefit gold in

the lower montney turbidite is the most pervasive zone on leucrotta s land base and characterized as being predominantly in the volatile light oil window leucrotta has internally estimated that there are potentially over 5 billion barrels of light oil originally in place in addition to potentially over 5 tcf of original gas in place on its lands in the lower montney turbidite to date leucrotta

oil and ngls and deep cut plant could increase this to as much as an estimated 36 increasing recoveries and improving economics through extended length wells and further frac design enhancements the remaining 80 sections are in the appraisal phase leucrotta intends to drill a horizontal multi frac well on the block in late 2019 or early 2020 to assess productivity upper montney the upper montney is also pervasive on leucrotta s land base but less delineated than the lower montney turbidite the upper montney lands straddle the volatile light oil window and the condensate rich gas window however lack of delineation to this point leaves the line between the two somewhat interpretative leucrotta has internally estimated that there are potentially over 1 5 billion barrels of light oil originally in place in addition to potentially over 2 5 tcf of original gas in place on its lands in the upper montney to date approximately 8 net sections of leucrotta s lands that are located at doe are considered development ready while the remaining lands are either in delineation or appraisal phases the successful a10 08 well at two rivers previously announced test rate june 18 2018 of 1 842 boepd including 685 boepd of light oil will move a significant area surrounding this well to the delineation phase based on the success of the a10 08 well leucrotta intends to drill additional appraisal wells on the land base the current reserve base reflects the development ready phase of the upper montney at doe with only 4 5 of the total approximately 220 net sections booked given the complementary effect of stacked zones the upper montney would benefit in a similar nature from the commercial development of the lower montney turbidite as described above below lower montney blm the blm is the lowest portion of the montney and has been successfully tested by other operators from pouce coupe to kakwa leucrotta has gathered various geological information through drilling other wells on its lands and believes the lands are primarily located within the volatile light oil window leucrotta has internally estimated that there are potentially over 4 billion barrels of light oil originally in place in addition to potentially over 4 tcf of original gas in place on its lands in the below lower montney no reserves have been booked in this zone for 2019 leucrotta intends to drill one horizontal multi frac appraisal well to test the productivity of this zone outlook for 2019 leucrotta estimates as at march 31 2019 it will have approximately 5 million net working capital and no debt in addition to an undrawn bank line of 25 million leucrotta intends to remain conservative and debt free during 2019 while executing on its most impactful capital projects from a value and future growth perspective projects would include building infrastructure to tie in existing wells to increase production and cash flow drilling an appraisal well in the blm and delineation wells in the upper montney to prove stacked zones for future development expansion of infrastructure and moving to pad development is expected to start in mid 2020 overview of 2018 reserve bookings leucrotta had several positives in the 2018 glj report which include positive technical revisions of 2 024 mboe proved plus probable increase of 84 million in overall value of reserves proved plus probable 10 npv despite an estimated 20 million reduction due to change in pricing from 2017 to 2018 leucrotta has maintained a conservative philosophy to booking reserves and has only booked locations immediately offsetting previously drilled wells that cover a large geographic area a total of 4 new wells and 21 new locations were booked positive reserve revisions were material at 2 0 million boe due primarily to well performance and higher liquid recoveries new locations booked within the lower montney turbidite oil window averaged 872 mboe per well on a proved plus probable basis which is consistent with the 2017 average booking of 855 mboe on a cumulative basis leucrotta has booked 17 horizontal montney wells and 53 horizontal montney locations of which 13 wells and 39 locations are in the lower montney turbidite leucrotta has estimated based on mapping and other technical data that it has over 1 000 potential montney drilling locations predominantly in the lower montney turbidite leucrotta has initially estimated locations based on 3 to 4 wells per section per zone leucrotta estimates that it has the current financial capability assuming pricing and performance are comparable to the glj report to execute on the 330 million of fdc first five year average of 60 million included in the glj report and therefore realize on the values presented should leucrotta be able to obtain similar drilling results on future wells there is a large potential value to be booked and subsequently realized given leucrotta s large unbooked drilling inventory for additional information on reserves assigned to these drilling locations please see forward looking information potential drilling locations at the end of this news release capital expenditures leucrotta s capital expenditures were

required information will be contained in the company s annual information form for the year ended december 31 2018 to be filed on sedar at www sedar com on or before april 30 2019 reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substance anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations as of a given date based on the analysis of drilling geological geophysical and engineering data the use of established technology and specified economic conditions which are generally accepted as being reasonable reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates as follows proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves potential drilling locations this news release discloses drilling locations in four categories i proved undeveloped locations ii probable undeveloped locations iii unbooked locations and iv an aggregate total of i ii and iii of the 1 000 total potential possible montney locations referenced in page 2 of this news release only the following have been assigned reserves at december 31 2018 as independently evaluated by glj in accordance with ni 51 101 19 proved undeveloped 34 probable undeveloped the remaining 947 potential possible locations are unbooked unbooked locations are based on the company s prospective acreage and internal estimates as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources including contingent and prospective unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of the company s multi year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic seismic engineering production and reserves information and performed by a qualified reserves evaluator qre there is no certainty that the company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves resources or production the drilling locations on which the company will actually drill wells including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding regulatory approvals seasonal restrictions oil and natural gas prices costs actual drilling results additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors while certain of the unbooked drilling locations have been de risked by drilling existing wells in relative close proximity to such unbooked drilling locations the majority of other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves resources or production original oil in place ooip and original gas in place ogip ogip original gas in place and ooip original oil in place are equivalent to total petroleum initially in place tpiip tpiip as defined in the canadian oil and gas evaluations handbook cogeh is that quantity of petroleum

these metrics is determined by the company as set out below or elsewhere in this news release these metrics are reserve replacement f d costs fd a costs net asset value and reserve life index these metrics do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies as such they should not be used to make comparisons management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare the company s performance over time however such measures are not reliable indicators of the company s future performance and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods f d costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year in dollars by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category in boe f d costs including fdc includes all capital expenditures in the year as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production fd a costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year inclusive of the net acquisition costs and disposition proceeds in dollars by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category inclusive of changes due to acquisitions and dispositions in boe fd a costs including fdc includes all capital expenditures in the year inclusive of the net acquisition costs and disposition proceeds as well as the change in fdc required to bring the reserves within the specified reserves category on production the company uses f d and fd a as a measure of the efficiency of its overall capital program including the effect of acquisitions and dispositions the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year net asset value or nav is calculated based on leucrotta s estimated future net revenues before taxes associated with leucrotta s reserves plus the value of undeveloped land and working capital divided by the number of common shares outstanding the term nav does not have any standardized meaning according to ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management believes that nav can provide information useful to its shareholders in understanding its performance and may assist in the evaluation of its business relative to its peers reserve replacement is calculated by dividing the annual proved plus probable reserve adds in boe by the company s annual production in boe the company uses this measure to determine the relative change of its reserves base over a period of time by measuring the amount of proved reserves and proved plus probable reserves added to a company s reserve base during the year relative to the amount of oil and gas produced reserve life index or rli is calculated by dividing the reserves in boe in the referenced category by the latest quarter of production in boe annualized the company uses this measure to determine how long the booked reserves will last at current production rates if no further reserves were added abbreviations bbl barrel mbbl thousands of

for further information the company believes that these measures in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying

volverá a la ideología de bolívar translate los revolucionarios no toman caca cola no se trata solamente de un capricho sino de una sana actitud en todos los sentidos desde la solidaridad con el pueblo colombiano donde la empresa caca cola ha cometido los más grandes abusos contra sus trabajadores incluyendo el presunto secuestro y asesinato de los dirigentes del sindicato hasta la proteccion de la salud de nuestros hijos enviciados por ese jarabe de cola y azucar que les produce obesidad prematura pensemos tambien los revolucionarios que ese dinero que gastamos en los refrescos es utilizado por esas empresas para financiar el terrorismo en nuestro país es cierto no se trata solo de la caca cola sino tambien de la cerveza de los cigarrillos y todos esos articulos innecesarios y mas que eso dañinos para nuestra salud podriamos incluso pensar en un dia de parada para cada uno de ellos es cuestion de irnos organizando pero para empezar que tal si dejamos de comprar caca cola y sus similares cuando lo extraordinario se vuelve cotidiano discurso del acto de grado en barinas en 12 de febrero del 2005 queridos graduandos más que un discurso quiero dirigirles algunas palabras que escribí anoche después de visitar en las clínicas a los estudiantes heridos a consecuencia de los enfrentamientos con la policía de hace apenas dos días me ha tocado por razones del destino ser la persona que les otorgue el titulo que bien merecieron con sus estudios y me siento sumamente orgulloso de serlo me consta que la universidad de los llanos occidentales ezequiel zamora a pesar de lo dicho por los enemigos de esta universidad es una universidad de primera no tendremos la mejor planta física en los salones hace calor en el comedor hace calor pero no es en lo material que las cosas deben valorarse el mayor capital es el ser humano y en eso nuestra unellez lo digo con conocimiento de causa esta sobrada los llaneros venezolanos son nobles valientes de coraje en la unellez hacen vida en este momento aproximadamente 67000 personas el 97 de ellas son estudiantes jóvenes que como ustedes hasta el día de hoy buscan ese titulo que constata los años de dedicación y de estudio los jóvenes son el río de la vida ustedes graduados deben ser los capitanes de esos barcos que naveguen por el río de la vida nuestra patria atraviesa momentos muy difíciles porque decidió dejar de ser esa matrona de edad vetusta y complaciente para ser joven rebelde y altanera nuestra imagen ya no es la de una acaudalada ricachona mayamera en nuestro rostro brilla ahora la sonrisa del che guevara con su diente delantero torcido su pelo largo y su boina con la estrella entender esto a mí me ha tomado prácticamente toda la vida tengo 53 años y ya perdí mi oportunidad de derramar sangre joven a causa de un ideal ustedes son jóvenes están en la flor de la vida no cometan por favor el error de renunciar a su instinto de rebelión el che guevara fue ministro de a economía en cuba los billetes y las monedas se adornaban con su rostro nada de eso le importó primero fue a angola donde pasó un penoso año de combate después se fue a bolivia donde encontró la muerte el che era el último que comía el que cargaba la mochila mas pesada siempre se sacrificaba por los demás en un estoicismo que mas parecía fervor religioso que ideología marxista si quieren un modelo de vida ahí lo tienen dije hace unos momentos que el 97 de la población de la unellez es estudiante se imaginan ustedes la universidad que podríamos tener si todos los estudiantes tuvieran la abnegación la combatividad del che los momentos que se avecinan van a requerir de una gran unidad del pueblo venezolano la alternativa de continuar siendo libres o regresar a la pobreza se nos planteará en los próximos días de forma enmascarada o quizás peor desenmascarada vestida con uniforme de soldado del imperio por nuestra parte podemos esperar lo mejor la macroeconomía no podría ir mejor la justicia social ha mejorado notablemente las misiones ocupan un papel muy importante en el pago de dicha justicia social aquí en barinas ya hemos cumplido con dos de las misiones la misión robinsón y la misión sucre no hay analfabetismo y no hay exclusión en la educación superior en estas tierras de zamora pero ay malhaya son precisamente estos éxitos los que nos hacen más antipáticos al imperio para ellos somos inclusive un mal ejemplo que se esta contagiando al resto del continente y cuidado sino al resto del mundo nunca venceremos al imperio estará siempre ahí acechando por lo menos hasta que el mismo no se autodestruya porque sépanlo señores el neoliberalismo es caníbal cuando le ataque el hambre se devorará a si mismo ustedes queridos graduandos a partir de hoy pasan a conformar la elite profesional que debe sostener este país en los próximos cuarenta o cincuenta años años decisivos para el logro de nuestra libertad y del rescate de nuestra soberanía no se dejen comprar no se dejen corromper no se dejen gritar no se dejen pisar que nadie les diga qué comer o qué vestirse o qué leer sean siempre auténticos rebeldes contestatarios pero eso si profundamente patriotas dignos de ser hijos de

que dañen los tubos de pvc los productos endulzantes ligth tienen una vida media muy corta por ejemplo el aspartamo después de tres semanas mojado pasa a tener gusto de trapo viejo sucio para evitar eso se agregan una infinidad de otros productos químicos uno para alargar la vida del aspartamo otro para neutralizar el color otro para mantener el tercer químico en suspensión porque sino el fondo de la gaseosa quedaría oscuro otro para evitar la cristalización del aspartamo otro para realzar el sabor dar mas intensidad al acido cítrico o fosforito que perdería su sabor por el efecto de los cuatro productos químicos iniciales y así sucesivamente un consejo final después de toda mi experiencia con la producción de bebidas embasadas puedo afirmar sin dudar un segundo la mejor bebida es el agua como también los jugos exprimidos de naranja o limón nada más cero azúcar y cero sal publicado por loretahur margarina o mantequilla la margarina fue producida originalmente para engordar a los pavos cuandolo que hizo en realidad fue matarlos las personas que habían puesto el dinero para la investigación quisieronrecobrarlo así que empezaron a pensar en una forma de hacerlo tenían una sustancia blanca que no tenía ningún atractivo como comestible así que le añadieron el color amarillo para vendérselo a lagente en lugar de la mantequilla qué tal ésa ahora han sacado algunos nuevos sabores para vender más alos incautos como usted y yo conoce usted la diferencia entre la margarina y la mantequilla siga leyendo hasta el final porque se pone bastante interesante comparación entre mantequilla y margarina 1 ambas tienen la misma cantidad de calorías 2 la mantequilla es ligeramente más alta en grasas saturadas 8 gramos comparada con los 5 gramos que tiene la margarina 3 comer margarina en vez de mantequilla puede aumentar en 53 el riesgo deenfermedades coronarias en las mujeres de acuerdo con un estudiomédico reciente de la universidad de harvard 4 comer mantequilla aumenta la absorción de gran cantidad de nutrientesque se encuentran en otros alimentos 5 la mantequilla provee beneficios nutricionales propios mientras lamargarina tiene sólo los que le hayan sido añadidos al fabricarla 6 la mantequilla sabe mucho mejor que la margarina y mejora el sabor deotros alimentos 7 la mantequilla ha existido durante siglos mientras que la margarinatiene menos de 100 años ahora sobre la margarina 1 es muy alta en ácidos grasos trans sí ésos que recién ahora loscientíficos descubrieron que son malísimos y los gobiernoscomenzaron a prohibirlos 2 triple riesgo de enfermedades coronarias 3 aumenta el colesterol total y el ldl el colesterol malo y disminuye elhdl el colesterol bueno 4 aumenta en cinco veces el riesgo de cáncer 5 disminuye la calidad de la leche materna 6 disminuye la reacción inmunológica del organismo 7 disminuye la reacción a la insulina y he aquí el factor más inquietante aquí está la parte más interesante a la margarina le falta una molécula para ser plástico sólo este hecho es suficiente para evitar el uso de la margarina de porvida y de cualquier otra cosa que sea hidrogenada esto significaque se le añade hidrógeno lo cual cambia la estructura molecular de lassubstancias usted puede ensayar lo siguiente compre un poco de margarina y déjela en el garaje o en un sitio sombreado dentro de unos días notará dos cosas no habrá moscas ni siquiera esos molestos bichos se le acercarán esto yale debe decir a usted algo no se pudre ni huele mal o diferente porque no tiene valor nutritivo nadacrece en ella ni siquiera los diminutos microorganismos puedencrecer en ella por qué porque es casi plástico no a la guerra si a la paz misterios de la ciencia los costos de la guerra medicos y capitalismo capitalismo medicos 2

representative image the us dollar will slip over the coming year according to a reuters poll of strategists who also said a positive outcome to us china trade negotiations was already priced in to their outlook and will not likely give the greenback a lift last year the us currency was propped up by sweeping tax cuts championed by president donald trump with the economy expanding above its long term trend for most of the year but falling short of 3 percent for 2018 as a whole story continues below advertisement remove ad now a slowing us economy a widening fiscal deficit and a dovish federal reserve are limiting the dollar s strength against other major currencies compared with 2018 with all those factors in play the dollar is now forecast to give back some gains over the coming year as we pointed out at the start of this year we see the relative cyclical support for the dollar being less favourable this year than last and that suggests to us some dollar depreciation ahead the end of balance sheet shrinkage will reinforce a much less active fed on raising the fed funds rate said lee hardman currency strategist at mufg in addition there is already evidence of foreign investors being more reluctant to invest in us portfolio securities and we view this reduced appetite as partly a consequence of the level of the us dollar and partly on concerns over the deteriorating budget deficit outlook the dollar was still highly in favour among speculators according to the latest data from the commodity future trading commission showing traders have taken their largest position favouring the greenback since mid january but with global economic growth slowing and central banks expected to lean towards extending their easy monetary policy any gains for other major currencies against the dollar will be limited the dollar is expected to weaken with the euro forecast at 1 19 in a year over a 5 percent rise from 1 13 on march 6 according to the poll of over 70 currency strategists taken february 28 march 6 story continues below advertisement remove ad but that outlook for 12 months ahead was a downgrade for the single currency against the dollar compared with last month that is driven by a widely held view the european central bank will need to do more to help a euro zone economy that is struggling and generating very little inflation the ecb is expected to slash growth forecasts later on march 7 and give its strongest signal yet that fresh stimulus is coming in the form of targeted long term refinancing operations tltros to banks hoping to stop an unexpected slowdown from becoming a downturn we are not anticipating there will be lot of wind in the dollar s sails said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank the top fx forecaster for 2018 but if you get to an environment where the market really is anticipating more tltros from the ecb i don t think the euro is going to be on a firm footing and in that environment there is just perhaps more incentive for the dollar to remain well supported â no huge gains but supported any resolution to an ongoing trade dispute between the united states and china is also unlikely to change the fortunes of the dollar according to analysts who provided an answer to a separate question if the two countries do achieve a trade deal within the next month or so the dollar is expected to make no significant move while in a no deal scenario the greenback was forecast to rise by 1 percent the dollar should correct if there is an agreement between china and the us due to the reduction of safe haven flows nevertheless the market is already pricing in a high probability of an agreement thus the depreciation should be limited said roberto cobo garcia fx strategist at bbva if there is no agreement the dollar could at least trade back towards the recent highs the negative impact of this scenario on global risk appetite and the chinese economy would definitely favour flows into safe haven assets
by andy xie the markets are celebrating the pending agreement between china and the united states to end the trade war this follows the us federal reserve signalling a pause in raising interest rates the euphoria is bringing the bulls out of hiding unfortunately this is likely to be a dead cat bounce a global slowdown is in full swing and with it an earnings recession even if another major financial crisis could be averted the debt binge of the past decade would take a long time to digest the change in the fed s policy posture is probably more important than a resolution to the trade war trump was raging that increased interest rates had crashed the market and the falling market threatened to trigger another debt crisis the fed backed down on plans to continue raising rates and unwinding quantitative easing its stated rationale for its changed stance is the slowdown overseas which sounds like an excuse in truth its policy is self contradictory if the bubble continues another financial crisis though delayed is inevitable if the aim is to achieve a soft landing an orderly unwinding it means having to resume raising interest rates when the market is stable in the second half of the year and the market might crash again in china there are domestic causes for the bear market the trade war had an impact on sentiment and might have accelerated the market adjustment the stock market bubble popped in 2015 and the market has not fully adjusted a new bull market could only start through significant structural reforms which are quite unlikely an earnings recession is on the way and will last a long time driven by declining debt growth china s corporate earnings are dependent on debt financed spending when debt is growing at a slower pace overcapacity will push down profitability and increase non performing loans in the financial system why beijing should be wary of us demands for yuan stability debt binges in china and the us have led the global economy since 2008 us government debt has increased by us 11 trillion in this time about twice the rise in its nominal gross domestic product however unless bond market vigilantes come back the us is going to keep its government debt led growth model even though the us depends on foreign financing for its debt growth the dollar s unique status is allowing the us to get away with vast deficits in its national budget and current account at least for now even though the us private sector debt triggered the 2008 global financial crisis its deleveraging has been moderate we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us from 2008 to last year non financial sector debt declined from 168 per cent of gdp to 152 per cent papering over new pressure points in the debt world nearly half of student loan borrowers are expected to default some 80 per cent of new car sales are financed through loans if one or more of these debt bubbles burst the federal government will have to increase its deficit from the present 5 per cent of gdp the us economy will become increasingly dependent on federal debt china s debt bubble is in more immediate trouble in the first place the country s debt data is not accurate a vast shadow banking system has developed since 2008 if we use the conservative debt numbers from 150 per cent of gdp in 2008 to 250 per cent in 2018 chinese debt has grown by 177 trillion yuan us 26 trillion some international institutions put china s debt at 300 per cent of gdp however obviously china has picked up the debt baton from the us the immediate pressure on china s debt bubble is from the household sector in the formal financial system its debt has gone from nowhere to 48 trillion yuan or 122 per cent of disposable income but a more likely number after accounting for shadow banking activities is above 130 per cent closer to the household debt level in the us in 2008 furthermore household leverage is concentrated in urban china where it could be as high as 200 per cent like in australia extremely high indebtedness is slowing new demand for debt this is why the property market is in trouble when property sales decline there is a liquidity crunch and developers cannot invest close to 6 billion square metres of residential properties are under construction with a market value of two thirds of gdp when completed when this sector declines it puts a drag on the economy that the government s push for more infrastructure cannot offset chinese household debt is weighing on consumption at a time when consumption is most needed 1 4 billion free spending chinese consumers are still a distant dream for so many businesses disposable income at 43 per cent of gdp is already unusually low enough for essentials and not much left for splurging the debt burden is pressing it down further consumption downgrading is apparent in all sectors corporate earnings in the consumer sector will be under pressure for a long time to come so no the bull market isn t coming back the market s bounce is driven by short term relief but declining economic growth and earnings are here to stay this is truly a dead cat bounce and no matter how hard the market throws it this cat isn t coming back to life andy xie is an independent economist

p ower stuns the intelligent and drives fools mad andrés manuel lópez obrador mexico s president repeats this adage often as a rebuke to politicians who promise much and accomplish little on march 4th the 94th day of his presidential term he tweeted the phrase again to show that power has neither stunned nor maddened him and that he will keep his promise to transform mexico listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element mr lópez obrador or amlo as he is known has already brought considerable change he cancelled construction of a part built international airport stopped new private investment in the oil industry and shut down fuel pipelines to prevent theft a measure that caused shortages in much of the country he has revived mexico s policy of non interference in other countries affairs by recognising venezuela s left wing dictator nicolás maduro rather than the head of its legislature juan guaidó as the country s president most big democracies recognise mr guaidó amlo has cut the salaries of senior officials and bureaucrats including his own and put their cars up for auction he travels about by commercial airliner more than three quarters of mexicans like what they see nearing 100 days in office amlo is more popular than any president at that stage bar vicente fox the first president of the democratic era in 2001 although amlo is restricted to one six year term he hopes that his left wing movement for national regeneration morena will be in power for much longer his plan to achieve this involves restoring the state to its earlier position as the main underwriter of mexicans well being most recent presidents thought that one of its main roles was to create conditions for firms and civil society groups to provide prosperity and welfare enrique peña nieto amlo s predecessor invited foreigners to invest in oil and introduced competition in telecoms which lowered prices but crime and corruption during his presidency overshadowed those achievements he left office as mexico s least popular president under amlo the state will take the lead and the credit however he must reconcile that ambition with the need to contain spending and avoid budget deficits amlo s statism does not preclude co operation with the private sector as mexico city s mayor in the early 2000s he worked closely with firms for example to rebuild the city s centre many of the infrastructure projects he plans such as the maya train through the south will need private or foreign finance but no one will doubt that the train comes from him amlo has begun by giving more money directly to individuals his government has doubled pension benefits and made more people eligible for them it set a minimum price for beans grown in the state of zacatecas eventually most major crops across mexico will have support prices the government will give scholarships and grants to 2 3m young adults to maintain a budget surplus amlo has slowed the introduction of these programmes for example by raising pensions for city dwellers over 68 not 65 as he had hoped where non state groups spend the government s money to promote its goals amlo wants to cut out the middleman ministers are forbidden to channel money through intermediaries such as contractors trade unions or ngo s under mr peña some 10 000 civil society groups got 30bn pesos 1 6bn over six years more went to contractors child care providers and other parallel structures as amlo calls them much of their money has ended up in the pockets of politicians cronies he contends now all government support will be delivered directly to the beneficiaries this has a political pay off voters will say amlo gave me this money notes luis de la calle an economist change is coming to child care the children s room programme created by felipe calderón president from 2006 to 2012 pays 950 pesos a month per child to women who provide day care in their neighbourhoods often their homes some 300 000 mothers use the programme many do not realise that the state is subsidising the bill amlo plans to correct this and save some money by paying mothers 800 pesos a month directly the pesos for the people approach may not always help its intended beneficiaries amlo said he would end subsidies for women s shelters but failed to explain how he would give money to victims of domestic abuse after an outcry he retreated seeming generous will sustain his popularity only if he keeps other promises especially to reduce crime and corruption and keep the economy strong his dirigisme and his suspicion of independent institutions may make that harder there is no sign yet that the murder rate which last year was higher than in colombia and brazil for the first time is on its way down amlo s big idea for reducing it is setting up a national guard which is to have 150 000 members by 2024 this may help but it will not compensate for failures of state and local police amlo has resisted the appointment of an independent anti corruption prosecutor any scandal would undermine his claim that his honesty alone will inspire probity in others the biggest threat to his popularity is the economy the central bank has revised its projection of gdp growth for this year down from 2 2 to 1 6 foreign direct investment in the last quarter of 2018 was 15 below its level a year before partly because investors distrust amlo and because american tax cuts make investing at home more attractive for american firms amlo has failed to convince investors that he will solve the problems of pemex the state owned oil giant which provides a fifth of government revenue but has an alarmingly high debt that puts mexico s investment grade credit rating at risk on march 2nd s p global a rating agency downgraded the outlook for mexico s sovereign debt from stable to negative a recession in the united states next year which some analysts deem likely could cause one in mexico that would spell trouble for a president who needs growth to pay for his social programmes

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

for years president trump has been obsessed with trade deficits incorrectly viewing them as a good measure of which countries are winning and which are losing the united states has run a trade deficit for decades thereby designating us a perennial loser in trump s worldview he promised to turn things around by picking a few easy to win trade wars instead by trump s own measure we re bigger losers than ever before the trade deficit just jumped to its largest size in a decade even worse our deficit in goods which trump for some reason emphasizes most just hit its largest level ever there are a few takeaways from this news including that trade was probably a bigger drag on growth last year than previously forecast but the bigger question is this why exactly is the trade deficit expanding when trump promised it would shrink the answer largely though not exclusively has to do with trump s own economic policies advertisement to be clear trade deficits whether bilateral or otherwise are not necessarily bad nor are they a sign that we re being somehow cheated by other countries they reflect broader trends in the economy including savings and investment rates small or shrinking trade deficits are also not necessarily a measure of a healthy economy in fact as bloomberg news shawn donnan points out the year the u s trade deficit shrank the most was 2009 which was not exactly a blockbuster year for the economy we were at the tail end of the great recession then and because the economy was bad americans bought less stuff from abroad today the u s economy is healthy with economic growth relatively robust this is partly because of the fiscal stimulus trump has been pumping into the economy through both his tax cuts and federal spending hikes consumers have more money to spend which means they demand more stuff and companies have ramped up their imports to satisfy that demand simultaneously other countries including china and members of the european union have not been doing so hot with the u s economy doing well while other economies are faltering and the federal reserve raising rates the dollar has strengthened making foreign products look cheaper and making our exports more expensive i e less competitive in other countries that too leads to higher trade deficits and it s one of many reasons team trump might want to cool it with the schadenfreude about other countries economic woes so in some ways then trump s preferred metric of winning is a victim of his own fiscally driven economic success but it s also a victim of his trade policy failures he has picked trade wars the world over with friends and foes alike he has also threatened even more tariffs including an additional hike in tariffs on chinese goods a new national security driven duty on auto imports etc these actions and threats have led to some predictable consequences one is that u s companies have stocked up on some imported goods to beat the tariffs which increases imports in the short run higher imports equal bigger trade deficit another is that other countries have levied their own retaliatory tariffs on our own products most famously red state goods such as soybeans and bourbon so there has been less demand for u s exports lower exports also equal bigger trade deficit trump has pledged that once his brilliantly negotiated deals go through the new north american free trade agreement gets ratified by congress china fully capitulates to all his wildest demands the european union and japan suddenly decide to buy more of our cars etc our balance of trade will turn around there s reason to be skeptical however and not only because some of these objectives seem like fantasies even the ones that look more plausible such as the implementation of the new nafta seem unlikely to move the needle after all the new nafta looks an awful lot like the old nafta plus some language cribbed from the pacific trade pact trump pulled us out of in fact the most significant change in the new nafta deal involves new content rules for autos which are intended to lead to more manufacturing and manufacturing jobs in the united states but as trade experts have pointed out these new rules may be so costly to comply with that they could have the opposite of their intended effect leading manufacturers to source less rather than more content from north america which could mean a boost to auto and auto parts imports which would contribute to you guessed it a wider trade deficit rampell can be reached at crampell washpost com or on twitter crampell letters and commentary policy the u t welcomes and encourages community dialogue on important public matters please visit this page for more details on our letters and commentaries policy you can email letters sduniontribune com or leave a comment below follow utletters on twitter and utopinion on facebook

there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual crude oil reserves may eventually prove to be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves the term boe means a barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 barrel of oil bbl boe s may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 mcf 1bbl utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 mcf 1 bbl may be misleading as an indication of value this press release contains a number of oil and gas metrics including finding development and acquisition costs fd a reserves replacement reserves

additionally this conference call will present both gaap and non gaap financial measures a reconciliation of these measures is included in today s earnings release which you can find on our investor relations website i would now like to turn the call over to don duda president and ceo please go ahead sir donald w duda president chief executive officer thank you stacy and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today for our fiscal 2019 third quarter financial results conference call i m joined today by ron tsoumas our chief financial officer both ron and i have comments and afterwards we will take your questions to start i will ask you to turn to slide 4 the first nine months of fiscal 2019 have been challenging due to the weak automotive market exacerbated by europe s implementation of wltp or the worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure while the near term automotive market is projected to remain soft the long term fundamentals of our business remain intact due mainly to the strong cash flow generating businesses we have been building and acquiring our free cash flow generation allowed us to reduce debt by 55 million in the third quarter and with a reasonable responsible debt to trailing 12 month ebitda ratio of 1 7 at the end of the third quarter our balance sheet is also fiscally conservative additionally free cash flow is anticipated to be 92 million for the fiscal year this free cash flow will allow us to continue to invest in technologies businesses and end markets such as magneto elastic sensing vertical integration of onboard vehicle cameras dabir surfaces and led lighting technologies which will provide methode the ability to continue to grow and increase long term value despite the significant automotive headwinds it is also interesting to note that almost 80 of our fiscal 2018 revenues are attributable to businesses or companies we acquired the acquisitions we have made over the past decade or so have not only facilitated our growth but through our manufacturing powers and vertical integration strategy have generated significant cash flows moreover our industrial segment sales grew 84 year over year in the first nine months due mainly to the addition of grakon which is anticipated to have strong results for the year because of higher revenue and margin improvement not only as grakon opening up additional customers and additional end markets it is reducing our concentration in automotive and expanding our product line offering while leveraging our past technology investments grakon also increases the scale of some of our core vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities from an operations perspective there are several ongoing integration activities within grakon including the implementation of the methode business planning system methode production system and quality management system as in every acquisition there is a learning from both sides and best practices are being shared one of the key initiatives at grakon is the implementation of lean tools which will ultimately drive improvements in efficiency and inventory reductions leading to further margin and cash flow improvement along with operational improvements our global purchasing teams have been working on consolidating our purchasing power also we now expect our tariff expense will be lower for the year than we originally projected which assumes a 10 rate this combined with the anticipated improved results at grakon resulted in our increasing fiscal 2019 guidance for income from operations additionally as i will discuss more in a few moments we have made significant progress in both the number of dabir services sold and the number of clinical evaluations completed looking at the financials on slide 5 consolidated sales improved 8 3 year over year in the third quarter and 11 4 in the first nine months in the third quarter non gaap adjusted income from operations increased from 29 6 million last year to 32 4 million this year and in the nine months from 91 5 million last year to 102 3 million this year these figures exclude expenses for initiatives to reduce costs and improve profitability acquisition related costs as well as long term incentive plan accrual adjustments in the applicable periods non gaap adjusted eps improved from 0 74 of third quarter last year to 0 83 this year and the nine months from 2 07 last year to 2 34 this year this excludes the items i just mentioned as well as the impact of the us tax reform ron will discuss this tax impact in his comments next i will be referring to slide 6 to look at the key drivers for our sales performance this year versus last year our acquisitions and new launches have added 150 million in revenues through the first nine months more than offsetting the impact of reduced vehicle production volume and our customers besides the sharp drop in vehicle sales and production in asia our customers in north america were impacted by the shift away from passenger cars while our customers in europe were also impacted by lower market demand for diesels as well as the wltp additionally pricing reductions and the adoption of the new accounting standard regarding revenue recognition which affected the accounting of tooling sales in our european operations reduced overall automotive sales consolidated sales were also negatively impacted by the delayed start of a major appliance program as well as reduced data program volumes in the interface segment in the automotive segment pricing reductions on lead frames and touch screens negatively impacted both sales and margins in both periods margins were also affected negatively by sales mix initiatives to reduce cost through profitability and tariff expense partially offset by a favorable currency impact from the mexican peso as i mentioned a moment ago our industrial segment sales grew year over year 84 in the first nine months and 136 in the third quarter industrial segment sales improved the nine months due to the addition of grakon but also due to increase of hetronic and power products sales year over year gross margins improved 840 basis points in the third quarter and 630 basis points in the nine months gross margins in the fiscal 2019 periods were negatively impacted by purchase accounting adjustments attributable to the grakon inventory and tariff expense now let s move on with an update on dabir on slide 7 during the third quarter we started to manage or completed nine clinical evaluations across united states we also had the first clinical evaluation in the med surg arena with 10 systems placed in an oncology unit in line with our plan to expand in the acute care space beyond the surgical suite finally one of the key internal measures we judged to be as progressed on is the number of surfaces sold which has increased year over year nearly five fold from 79 in the full year of fiscal 2018 to 384 thus far in fiscal 2019 excluding controller sales and leases revenue was attributed to surface alone has grown from 64 000 in fiscal 2018 to over 396 000 thus far this fiscal year our number of clinical evaluations has also grown from 18 in fiscal 2018 to 28 to date in this fiscal year at this point i ll turn the call over to ron who will provide more detail on the financial results and review guidance ron ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer thank you don and good morning everyone on a gaap basis third quarter net income increased 55 million to 30 7 million or 0 82 per share in fiscal 19 from a loss of 24 3 million or a loss of 0 65 per share in fiscal 18 for the nine months gaap net income increased 48 6 million to 69 million or 1 83 per share in fiscal 19 from 20 4 million or 0 54 per share in fiscal 2018 in both periods gaap net income benefited mainly from lower income tax expense higher sales in the industrial segment and increased international government grants this was partially offset mainly by reduced passenger car demand and production in both europe and asia higher stock award amortization expense increased acquisition related costs increased intangible amortization expense related to the grakon acquisition higher net interest expense initiatives taken to reduce costs and improve profitability and tariff expenses consolidated gaap income from operations was 26 million in the fiscal 19 third quarter versus 35 6 million last year and 73 8 million in the nine months of fiscal 2019 versus 90 7 million in the same period of last year in both periods income from operations was negatively impacted by reduced passenger car demand and production in both europe and asia higher stock award amortization expense increased acquisition related costs increased intangible asset amortization expense related to the grakon acquisition initiatives to reduce costs and improve profitability and tariff expense moving to margins on slide 8 non gaap adjusted gross margins improved 70 basis points year over year in the nine month period and exclude initiatives to reduce cost and improve profitability and purchase accounting adjustments related to the step up in inventory gross margins were negatively impacted by an unfavorable sales mix and customer pricing reductions in the automotive segment as well as significantly reduced sales in the interface segment partially offset by a favorable sales mix in the industrial segment and a favorable currency impact non gaap selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 30 basis points in the nine month period and exclude acquisition related costs initiatives to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability and the long term incentive plan accrual adjustments in the applicable periods shifting to ebitda the company generated 109 1 million in the nine months of fiscal 19 or 14 9 of sales versus a 113 3 million or 17 2 of the sales in the same period last year however adjusting for initiatives to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability acquisition related costs and long term incentive plan accrual adjustments in the applicable periods adjusted ebitda improved year over year from 114 1 million or 17 3 of sales in the nine months last year to 137 6 million or 18 7 of sales in the nine months of fiscal 2019 for the full year of fiscal 2019 we expect ebitda to between 155 million and 160 million or in the 15 5 to 16 of sales range for the full year we anticipate adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 180 million to 190 million or 18 to 19 sales range a few other financial items to review year over year intangible asset amortization expense in the third quarter of fiscal 19 increased 3 5 million or 175 to 5 5 million primarily due to the amortization expense related to the grakon acquisition and increased 7 4 million or 200 to 11 1 million due to the pacific insight procoplast and grakon acquisitions the company s effective tax rate was 6 1 through nine months or an expense of 4 5 million for the third quarter the company reported an effective tax rate benefit of 10 4 the lower tax rate was due to a few significant events that occurred during the third quarter first the company finalized its provisional estimate for us tax reform and recorded a tax benefit of 4 8 million as allowed under accounting standards sab 118 this adjustment was due to additional regulatory guidance which became final during calendar fourth quarter or our fiscal third quarter in addition the company s tax rate also benefited from other discrete items which totaled 2 7 million in the quarter these adjustments combined for a 7 5 million benefit during the quarter the company s effective tax rate excluding the impact of these adjustments would have been 16 7 for the third quarter and between 16 and 17 for the full year which is consistent with our previous guidance we estimate that our effective tax rate will normalize for the remainder of our fiscal 2019 and we expect the full year effective tax rate to be in the 9 to 11 range the company continues to enjoy a favorable overall effective tax rate which drives higher earnings and cash flow on a long term basis we will continue to pursue prudent and reasonable actions that will allow us to maintain this enviable rates in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 we invested 37 million in capex mainly to support programs and launches in north america and europe we estimate our capital investment for fiscal 2019 to be in the 45 million to 47 million range expense for depreciation and amortization for the first nine months was 30 6 million for fiscal 2019 we expect depreciation and amortization to be between 42 million and 44 million let s move to slide 9 free cash flow through the first nine months was 62 6 million we expect our fiscal 2019 free cash flow to be between 90 million and 95 million our debt to trailing 12 month ebitda ratio which is used for our bank covenants is approximately 1 7 this ratio was lowered in 3q due to our significant deleveraging during the quarter moving to slide 10 i ll finish up my remarks with guidance as a reminder the guidance ranges for fiscal 2019 are based upon management s expectations regarding a variety of factors and involve a number of risks and uncertainties which have been detailed in this morning s release the 10 q and the form 10 k we announced this morning we anticipate fiscal 2019 sales to be at the lower end of our previous guidance range of 1 billion to 1 04 billion the company has updated guidance for pre tax income to a range of 104 5 million to 111 5 million and earnings per share in the range of 2 50 to 2 67 these changes are from pre tax income in the range of 91 5 million to 105 5 million and earnings per share in the range of 2 02 to 2 33 looking at the midpoint of the pre tax guidance range issued at the end of the second quarter which would be 98 5 million and adding to that the improved anticipated operational results like grakon and lower than anticipated impact from tariffs on imported chinese goods the new midpoint of the pre tax income guidance range is 108 million from an eps perspective adding the transition tax due to us tax reform and the other discrete items that i just mentioned to the two quarter eps guidance midpoint next to the current eps guidance midpoint in conclusion please move to slide 11 to look at our key drivers for our anticipated ebitda performance this fiscal year versus next as we get closer to the performance measurement period at the end of our fiscal 2020 looking at ebitda based on the midpoint of our fiscal 2019 guidance range issued today which would be 159 million and adding the ebitda from new automotive and laundry program launches of approximately 20 million adding ebitda from a full year of grakon which is estimated to be an additional 24 million subtracting the impact of the loss of ebitda from reduced passenger car production which we estimate to be about 19 million adding the benefit of initiatives to reduce costs and improved profitability of about 10 million and adding the one time costs we incurred in fiscal 2019 for acquisitions and restructuring of about 27 million brings you to the target level of methode s long term incentive plan which is 221 million of ebitda for the accounting regulations of asc 718 management must attach quarterly to the probability of meeting the 2020 ebitda projections with a 70 confidence level as noted in footnote 7 in the 10 q don that concludes my comments donald w duda president chief executive officer ron thank you very much stacy we are ready to take questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from chris van horn with b riley please go ahead christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst good morning thank you for taking my call donald w duda president chief executive officer good morning chris christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst i was hoping that you could give us a little more detail on the guidance what you re kind of thinking about for maybe if even on some of your end market level using ihs as a baseline for auto and kind of adding in what you see from a program launch perspective and then just kind of some commentary in your other markets if you don t mind thanks donald w duda president chief executive officer okay from an auto standpoint we of course use our releases from the automakers and our discussions with the automakers overlaid with some ihs l t and we do sometimes double check with ihs so that s those are the main drivers of auto grakon were still familiarizing yourself with it but there we use act and also the releases that grakon see so all that put together is driving of automotive and transportation and then the smaller businesses it s customer discussions and releases christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst okay got it and then you know the grakon acquisition i think a big part of it from our viewpoint was the heavy duty trucking customer was going to be a big a bigger end market for you all could you comment on the pipeline that you re seeing with now that you have grakon and maybe some other methode technologies that you can add into that what you re hearing from the customers and any sort of commentary in the pipeline over the next couple of years donald w duda president chief executive officer sure i want to be first of all i want to speak for our customers but our backlog remains strong we anticipate that we will remain strong for the duration of this calendar year i think that s in line with what act has said we ll see what calendar year 20 brings from our standpoint we continue to take cost out of grakon and we re actively managing the factory our vp in asia has controlled the factory and that will take costs out there which will help us not this year but it will help us next year and then we re going to continue to talk to the customers about what other areas that our products that we can provide and then very important and i think i said in the script is our global procurement we ve already seen reductions in our led by for global methode including grakon by a negotiation so there s a number of things that we re doing as we look into calendar year claim to and improved grakon s performance and that potentially might offset any downturn we will see in the business christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst okay got it and then when we look at the capital deployment i know you ve made a number of successful acquisitions and i imagine there s probably not anything in the near term but as we think further out is there any sort of areas regions or end markets that you identified that might be interesting for you from that perspective and then as you look at the portfolio how are you thinking about the companies that you re holding now donald w duda president chief executive officer well let me the answer that first we continue to evaluate what our portfolio is and what the where does that fit with the methode and then if something doesn t we would take action there but there is nothing eminent in that respect in terms of future acquisitions we are focusing on industrial i won t roll out automotive but that space we know how to operate in we ve got technology that we can bring it we certainly know how to manufacture the product so that s a focus for us medical i think we ll focus on dabir and unless there is some of this great acquisition and that gives dabir a very strong path to market i think for the most part focused on our industrial and build that up in line with i guess our technologies and what we re comfortable with we wouldn t do an industrial acquisition that we didn t understand and that would take us too far afield from what we know christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst okay donald w duda president chief executive officer and then christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst go ahead donald w duda president chief executive officer the other thing we would add is that we ve done well in sensors our magneto elastic sensors have dome well our eddy current sensors do well so the sensor acquisition which would actually help all of methode is also something we d be looking at christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst okay thank you so much for the commentary i ll hop back in queue operator our next question comes from david leiker with baird please go ahead erin welcenbach robert w baird analyst hi this is erin welcenbach on for david donald w duda president chief executive officer hello erin erin welcenbach robert w baird analyst good morning my first question is again a follow up on the grakon acquisitions i m wondering if you can frame for us how much of the upside in the quarter was from better fundamental business performance maybe given some of the stronger commercial vehicle end markets versus synergies either cost or kind of cross selling synergies tracking above your expectations donald w duda president chief executive officer well as i think both ron and i said tariffs came in better than we anticipated i think the team has done a very good job of moving us quickly as they could to mitigate a certain portion of them and that was really us grakon brought all product into seattle and then they would ship to mexico or ship to canada and of course united states as well our teams are successful and quickly changing the ship point which reduce the tariffs so that helped and grakon did in the quarter the sales were higher than forecast in q3 so that s the advantage of the class 8 and then well it s in our automotive technical difficulty tesla also had an impact ron is there anything you would ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer i ll add to that maybe we were able to very quickly gain some procurement synergies that definitely drop to the bottom line in 3q and going out in the 4q and then into 20 fiscal 2020 as well erin welcenbach robert w baird analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then on the cost actions you announced i believe it was last quarter where do you stand in those in terms of when we ll start seeing the benefits of those flow through the p l and more substantially donald w duda president chief executive officer we ll see some benefit in our q4 we will see the full benefit in our fiscal 2020 erin welcenbach robert w baird analyst okay that s helpful and that s it from me thank you donald w duda president chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from steve dyer with craig hallum please go ahead steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst thank you good morning donald w duda president chief executive officer good morning steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst couple of questions from me i guess i ll start briefly on dabir looks like it s at long last starting to get some traction after a lot of testing and probably a little bit slower out of the gate but how do you think about sort of deployment from here it seems like it s checked all the boxes in terms of efficacy and safety and so on and so forth and what sort of the ramp to this becoming sort of the product that you envision several years ago donald w duda president chief executive officer good question the next step is to expand from single point hospitals into hospital systems and we re starting to see some of that now again slower than we would like but it is moving in that direction and your first half of demonstrate efficacy at the operating level with the nurses to get credibility and then you can talk to the c suite in the systems and that s where we re at now with the teams are i think doing a very good job now of expanding dabir in particular hospitals are at now and then going forward and i judge that by as i said the number of surfaces that we re selling and the number of clinicals that are going on you have to do that first before you can talk about any sales we still maintain that the hospital surgical suites are the area we want to focus on although we have as i said in my prepared remarks in the other areas and that remains a very large and robust market for us now in terms of when we see that we ll make progress next year we re not planning on dabir turning the corner next year from a profitability we think that s more of a 21 event and i realize that we ve been talking about it a long time but i have to say from my standpoint i feel reinvigorated with the progress in dabir that s been made so i still think we have sometime it s not going to swing q4 but i think we re in the right direction and i agree it s taken a long time but i think we re getting there steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst and that s very helpful i guess just following up on that at one point i think we all had expected that was going to be a very major product for the company in the future have you assumed anything in the last year or two or three that has sort of changed your mind on that in terms of the tam that it could be for you guys donald w duda president chief executive officer no i actually i would go the other way that the market is larger than we thought it was that we still have to land some systems and get it to be a standard of care but once it becomes a standard of care that market the total billed market is quite large and i have said a number of times we are focusing on the surgical suites because it s essentially no competition but the bigger market is when you get outside of the surgical area into acute excuse me non acute we did a study on a respiratory patients ventilator that turn out very favorable i think we commented on the last call so no ways it formed dabir we think the market has diminished at all i think it s grown steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst got it thank you for that and then i guess just jumping over to auto your largest auto program is i think in the middle of a change over model years technical difficulty to the t1 just kind of given the disruption i guess that you re seeing here at fiscal 20 around that changeover would you expect that the absolute dollars from that program can kind of grow in fiscal 2020 is that part of the assumption donald w duda president chief executive officer you would have to tell me what s the expected inaudible is going to be and where gm forecast their year we re obviously going to be dependent upon that in our planning l think we re holding our own but we re not expecting a huge upside from that i don t think there s anything in the marketplace that would suggest that ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer well the reason i say that as i thank you on most of fiscal 19 or at least half of it is going to be sort of not at full production for the k2 just given that changeover so i guess the assumption would be is most of fiscal 2020 should be back sort of full production for the t1 both trucks and suvs donald w duda president chief executive officer let me answer this way from our just looking at l t looking at ihs that s really what we do our planning on and we re not seeing that now that doesn t mean that three months from now that doesn t change i mean i really feel that we have a three to six months window where we can have some degree of certainty going to get a pay past that is it i think it becomes difficult to forecast steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst okay fair enough and let me just can you just remind us around content on the t1 versus k2 kind of apples to apples per vehicle donald w duda president chief executive officer it s just directionally if nothing else similar more or less et cetera ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer and it would be less and the end result prices has reduced us because the screens are down the screens are directed by so they have the sell prices has dropped and in general they have sell price of center consoles has reduced from when we originally launched k2 that directionally the content the content dropped the values are dropped and we ve talked in past calls about the dramatic reduction in screen prices steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst but that s largely pass through revenue as i recall right i guess i ll just jump ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer but it is pass through it s the pass through revenue but it s in the price steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst yes okay fair enough last question from me and then i ll jump back in line on the walk from ebitda from fiscal 19 to fiscal 20 it s great very helpful thank you it looks like you increased sort of your expectation of cost initiatives and so forth or i m sorry that the additional grakon revenue and contribution there by about 7 million but you kept sort of your overall 2020 target at 221 million should is that just conservatism on your part that that can now be upside or have you seen something sort of compression in other parts of your business donald w duda president chief executive officer we ve seen european auto drop what do we have in the chart 19 million into the passenger car reductions that s significant and we may have more headwinds and tailwinds from that standpoint so will europe stabilize or will europe drop so are we being conservative i guess we are being impractical and there can always be some upside but there s going to be downside as well and when we do these numbers we have to certify that the auditors that were 70 confident in our forecast and we are still when do we give that 4 months from now or we have to wait we have ways to go on or given any comment on here ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer so i might say that steve is that you know the plan is in the q and all the filings 221 million is the target and that s where we re at and we can t really say much more about that otherwise we really be giving fiscal 20 guidance as well so the plan is that s the plan steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst all right fair enough thank you guys donald w duda president chief executive officer thank you operator next question comes from skip tague with rbi capital please go ahead skip tague rbi capital analyst hi i just wanted to confirm i think i heard that acquisitions added 150 million of revenues in the nine months that ended january 2019 is that correct ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer yes skip tague rbi capital analyst so then that implies that in the nine months ended 2017 the organic revenues have been 584 million which would compare to 659 million for the previous nine month period is that also correct ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer just a second 150 million of acquisitions and new launches so 115 million for acquisitions and 35 million for program launches skip tague rbi capital analyst okay great okay thank you very much ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer you re welcome operator operator instructions our next question comes from christopher hillary with roubaix capital please go ahead christopher hillary roubaix capital analyst hi good morning donald w duda president chief executive officer good morning christopher hillary roubaix capital analyst i just wanted to ask you ve done an excellent job in managing your margins both in the current period and through your planning period what do you see in the medium term as tailwinds to your margin whether it be cost improvements or the mix of business that you anticipate to be growing when we head beyond the 2020 period donald w duda president chief executive officer sure the two big drivers for us are new programs using our technology and higher margins and i ve pointed in the past to our magneto elastic margins in general our sensing business we put a slide out i think in the needham conference where we had i guess last quarter we had what was about 80 million of book business through 22 and that s a very very good margin and actually we anticipate probably by 22 it will be 100 million that the product carries one of our highest margins in the company so new business at higher margins or higher profit drive our overall margins and also we can generally take costs out of the product it s harder in auto today because we re fighting reduced volumes and reduced overhead coverage our north american business was down 23 million year over year but from a gross margin dollars the team s kept it flat and that s not easy to do in the auto business when there s a downturn they have done a good job europe has struggled a little bit more some of it s because their margins are higher than in the us but in general if i look at grakon we ve got great opportunity and we ve built into our plans to take costs out there they run a good factory but it s not up to the methode standards to our production system we ve got a good team we will get them there and we ll see the benefit of that some in 20 but also in 21 so it s a combination of new business and higher margins and then what we do well is take costs out of the product christopher hillary roubaix capital analyst great thank you very much gentlemen donald w duda president chief executive officer you are welcome operator thank you i would like to turn the call over to don for closing comments donald w duda president chief executive officer stacy thank you very much and we thank everybody for listening and their questions have a good day operator this concludes today s conference thank you for your participation duration 45 minutes call participants donald w duda

and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today for our fiscal 2019 third quarter financial results conference call i m joined today by ron tsoumas our chief financial officer both ron and i have comments and afterwards we will take your questions to start i will ask you to turn to slide 4 the first nine months of fiscal 2019 have been challenging due to the weak automotive market exacerbated by europe s implementation of wltp or the worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure while the near term automotive market is projected to remain soft the long term fundamentals of our business remain intact due mainly to the strong cash flow generating businesses we have been building and acquiring our free cash flow generation allowed us to reduce debt by 55 million in the third quarter and with a reasonable responsible debt to trailing 12 month ebitda ratio of 1 7 at the end of the third quarter our balance sheet is also fiscally conservative additionally free cash flow is anticipated to be 92 million for the fiscal year this free cash flow will allow us to continue to invest in technologies businesses and end markets such as magneto elastic sensing vertical integration of onboard vehicle cameras dabir surfaces and led lighting technologies which will provide methode the ability to continue to grow and increase long term value despite the significant automotive headwinds it is also interesting to note that almost 80 of our fiscal 2018 revenues are attributable to businesses or companies we acquired the acquisitions we have made over the past decade or so have not only facilitated our growth but through our manufacturing powers and vertical integration strategy have generated significant cash flows moreover our industrial segment sales grew 84 year over year in the first nine months due mainly to the addition of grakon which is anticipated to have strong results for the year because of higher revenue and margin improvement not only as grakon opening up additional customers and additional end markets it is reducing our concentration in automotive and expanding our product line offering while leveraging our past technology investments grakon also increases the scale of some of our core vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities from an operations perspective there are several ongoing integration activities within grakon including the implementation of the methode business planning system methode production system and quality management system as in every acquisition there is a learning from both sides and best practices are being shared one of the key initiatives at grakon is the implementation of lean tools which will ultimately drive improvements in efficiency and inventory reductions leading to further margin and cash flow improvement along with operational improvements our global purchasing teams have been working on consolidating our purchasing power also we now expect our tariff expense will be lower for the year than we originally projected which assumes a 10 rate this combined with the anticipated improved results at grakon resulted in our increasing fiscal 2019 guidance for income from operations additionally as i will discuss more in a few moments we have made significant progress in both the number of dabir services sold and the number of clinical evaluations completed looking at the financials on slide 5 consolidated sales improved 8 3 year over year in the third quarter and 11 4 in the first nine months in the third quarter non gaap adjusted income from operations increased from 29 6 million last year to 32 4 million this year and in the nine months from 91 5 million last year to 102 3 million this year these figures exclude expenses for initiatives to reduce costs and improve profitability acquisition related costs as well as long term incentive plan accrual adjustments in the applicable periods non gaap adjusted eps improved from 0 74 of third quarter last year to 0 83 this year and the nine months from 2 07 last year to 2 34 this year this excludes the items i just mentioned as well as the impact of the us tax reform ron will discuss this tax impact in his comments next i will be referring to slide 6 to look at the key drivers for our sales performance this year versus last year our acquisitions and new launches have added 150 million in revenues through the first nine months more than offsetting the impact of reduced vehicle production volume and our customers besides the sharp drop in vehicle sales and production in asia our customers in north america were impacted by the shift away from passenger cars while our customers in europe were also impacted by lower market demand for diesels as well as the wltp additionally pricing reductions and the adoption of the new accounting standard regarding revenue recognition which affected the accounting of tooling sales in our european operations reduced overall automotive sales consolidated sales were also negatively impacted by the delayed start of a major appliance program as well as reduced data program volumes in the interface segment in the automotive segment pricing reductions on lead frames and touch screens negatively impacted both sales and margins in both periods margins were also affected negatively by sales mix initiatives to reduce cost through profitability and tariff expense partially offset by a favorable currency impact from the mexican peso as i mentioned a moment ago our industrial segment sales grew year over year 84 in the first nine months and 136 in the third quarter industrial segment sales improved the nine months due to the addition of grakon but also due to increase of hetronic and power products sales year over year gross margins improved 840 basis points in the third quarter and 630 basis points in the nine months gross margins in the fiscal 2019 periods were negatively impacted by purchase accounting adjustments attributable to the grakon inventory and tariff expense now let s move on with an update on dabir on slide 7 during the third quarter we started to manage or completed nine clinical evaluations across united states we also had the first clinical evaluation in the med surg arena with 10 systems placed in an oncology unit in line with our plan to expand in the acute care space beyond the surgical suite finally one of the key internal measures we judged to be as progressed on is the number of surfaces sold which has increased year over year nearly five fold from 79 in the full year of fiscal 2018 to 384 thus far in fiscal 2019 excluding controller sales and leases revenue was attributed to surface alone has grown from 64 000 in fiscal 2018 to over 396 000 thus far this fiscal year our number of clinical evaluations has also grown from 18 in fiscal 2018 to 28 to date in this fiscal year at this point i ll turn the call over to ron who will provide more detail on the financial results and review guidance ron ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer thank you don and good morning everyone on a gaap basis third quarter net income increased 55 million to 30 7 million or 0 82 per share in fiscal 19 from a loss of 24 3 million or a loss of 0 65 per share in fiscal 18 for the nine months gaap net income increased 48 6 million to 69 million or 1 83 per share in fiscal 19 from 20 4 million or 0 54 per share in fiscal 2018 in both periods gaap net income benefited mainly from lower income tax expense higher sales in the industrial segment and increased international government grants this was partially offset mainly by reduced passenger car demand and production in both europe and asia higher stock award amortization expense increased acquisition related costs increased intangible amortization expense related to the grakon acquisition higher net interest expense initiatives taken to reduce costs and improve profitability and tariff expenses consolidated gaap income from operations was 26 million in the fiscal 19 third quarter versus 35 6 million last year and 73 8 million in the nine months of fiscal 2019 versus 90 7 million in the same period of last year in both periods income from operations was negatively impacted by reduced passenger car demand and production in both europe and asia higher stock award amortization expense increased acquisition related costs increased intangible asset amortization expense related to the grakon acquisition initiatives to reduce costs and improve profitability and tariff expense moving to margins on slide 8 non gaap adjusted gross margins improved 70 basis points year over year in the nine month period and exclude initiatives to reduce cost and improve profitability and purchase accounting adjustments related to the step up in inventory gross margins were negatively impacted by an unfavorable sales mix and customer pricing reductions in the automotive segment as well as significantly reduced sales in the interface segment partially offset by a favorable sales mix in the industrial segment and a favorable currency impact non gaap selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 30 basis points in the nine month period and exclude acquisition related costs initiatives to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability and the long term incentive plan accrual adjustments in the applicable periods shifting to ebitda the company generated 109 1 million in the nine months of fiscal 19 or 14 9 of sales versus a 113 3 million or 17 2 of the sales in the same period last year however adjusting for initiatives to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability acquisition related costs and long term incentive plan accrual adjustments in the applicable periods adjusted ebitda improved year over year from 114 1 million or 17 3 of sales in the nine months last year to 137 6 million or 18 7 of sales in the nine months of fiscal 2019 for the full year of fiscal 2019 we expect ebitda to between 155 million and 160 million or in the 15 5 to 16 of sales range for the full year we anticipate adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 180 million to 190 million or 18 to 19 sales range a few other financial items to review year over year intangible asset amortization expense in the third quarter of fiscal 19 increased 3 5 million or 175 to 5 5 million primarily due to the amortization expense related to the grakon acquisition and increased 7 4 million or 200 to 11 1 million due to the pacific insight procoplast and grakon acquisitions the company s effective tax rate was 6 1 through nine months or an expense of 4 5 million for the third quarter the company reported an effective tax rate benefit of 10 4 the lower tax rate was due to a few significant events that occurred during the third quarter first the company finalized its provisional estimate for us tax reform and recorded a tax benefit of 4 8 million as allowed under accounting standards sab 118 this adjustment was due to additional regulatory guidance which became final during calendar fourth quarter or our fiscal third quarter in addition the company s tax rate also benefited from other discrete items which totaled 2 7 million in the quarter these adjustments combined for a 7 5 million benefit during the quarter the company s effective tax rate excluding the impact of these adjustments would have been 16 7 for the third quarter and between 16 and 17 for the full year which is consistent with our previous guidance we estimate that our effective tax rate will normalize for the remainder of our fiscal 2019 and we expect the full year effective tax rate to be in the 9 to 11 range the company continues to enjoy a favorable overall effective tax rate which drives higher earnings and cash flow on a long term basis we will continue to pursue prudent and reasonable actions that will allow us to maintain this enviable rates in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 we invested 37 million in capex mainly to support programs and launches in north america and europe we estimate our capital investment for fiscal 2019 to be in the 45 million to 47 million range expense for depreciation and amortization for the first nine months was 30 6 million for fiscal 2019 we expect depreciation and amortization to be between 42 million and 44 million let s move to slide 9 free cash flow through the first nine months was 62 6 million we expect our fiscal 2019 free cash flow to be between 90 million and 95 million our debt to trailing 12 month ebitda ratio which is used for our bank covenants is approximately 1 7 this ratio was lowered in 3q due to our significant deleveraging during the quarter moving to slide 10 i ll finish up my remarks with guidance as a reminder the guidance ranges for fiscal 2019 are based upon management s expectations regarding a variety of factors and involve a number of risks and uncertainties which have been detailed in this morning s release the 10 q and the form 10 k we announced this morning we anticipate fiscal 2019 sales to be at the lower end of our previous guidance range of 1 billion to 1 04 billion the company has updated guidance for pre tax income to a range of 104 5 million to 111 5 million and earnings per share in the range of 2 50 to 2 67 these changes are from pre tax income in the range of 91 5 million to 105 5 million and earnings per share in the range of 2 02 to 2 33 looking at the midpoint of the pre tax guidance range issued at the end of the second quarter which would be 98 5 million and adding to that the improved anticipated operational results like grakon and lower than anticipated impact from tariffs on imported chinese goods the new midpoint of the pre tax income guidance range is 108 million from an eps perspective adding the transition tax due to us tax reform and the other discrete items that i just mentioned to the two quarter eps guidance midpoint next to the current eps guidance midpoint in conclusion please move to slide 11 to look at our key drivers for our anticipated ebitda performance this fiscal year versus next as we get closer to the performance measurement period at the end of our fiscal 2020 looking at ebitda based on the midpoint of our fiscal 2019 guidance range issued today which would be 159 million and adding the ebitda from new automotive and laundry program launches of approximately 20 million adding ebitda from a full year of grakon which is estimated to be an additional 24 million subtracting the impact of the loss of ebitda from reduced passenger car production which we estimate to be about 19 million adding the benefit of initiatives to reduce costs and improved profitability of about 10 million and adding the one time costs we incurred in fiscal 2019 for acquisitions and restructuring of about 27 million brings you to the target level of methode s long term incentive plan which is 221 million of ebitda for the accounting regulations of asc 718 management must attach quarterly to the probability of meeting the 2020 ebitda projections with a 70 confidence level as noted in footnote 7 in the 10 q don that concludes my comments donald w duda president chief executive officer ron thank you very much stacy we are ready to take questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from chris van horn with b riley please go ahead christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst good morning thank you for taking my call donald w duda president chief executive officer good morning chris christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst i was hoping that you could give us a little more detail on the guidance what you re kind of thinking about for maybe if even on some of your end market level using ihs as a baseline for auto and kind of adding in what you see from a program launch perspective and then just kind of some commentary in your other markets if you don t mind thanks donald w duda president chief executive officer okay from an auto standpoint we of course use our releases from the automakers and our discussions with the automakers overlaid with some ihs l t and we do sometimes double check with ihs so that s those are the main drivers of auto grakon were still familiarizing yourself with it but there we use act and also the releases that grakon see so all that put together is driving of automotive and transportation and then the smaller businesses it s customer discussions and releases christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst okay got it and then you know the grakon acquisition i think a big part of it from our viewpoint was the heavy duty trucking customer was going to be a big a bigger end market for you all could you comment on the pipeline that you re seeing with now that you have grakon and maybe some other methode technologies that you can add into that what you re hearing from the customers and any sort of commentary in the pipeline over the next couple of years donald w duda president chief executive officer sure i want to be first of all i want to speak for our customers but our backlog remains strong we anticipate that we will remain strong for the duration of this calendar year i think that s in line with what act has said we ll see what calendar year 20 brings from our standpoint we continue to take cost out of grakon and we re actively managing the factory our vp in asia has controlled the factory and that will take costs out there which will help us not this year but it will help us next year and then we re going to continue to talk to the customers about what other areas that our products that we can provide and then very important and i think i said in the script is our global procurement we ve already seen reductions in our led by for global methode including grakon by a negotiation so there s a number of things that we re doing as we look into calendar year claim to and improved grakon s performance and that potentially might offset any downturn we will see in the business christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst okay got it and then when we look at the capital deployment i know you ve made a number of successful acquisitions and i imagine there s probably not anything in the near term but as we think further out is there any sort of areas regions or end markets that you identified that might be interesting for you from that perspective and then as you look at the portfolio how are you thinking about the companies that you re holding now donald w duda president chief executive officer well let me the answer that first we continue to evaluate what our portfolio is and what the where does that fit with the methode and then if something doesn t we would take action there but there is nothing eminent in that respect in terms of future acquisitions we are focusing on industrial i won t roll out automotive but that space we know how to operate in we ve got technology that we can bring it we certainly know how to manufacture the product so that s a focus for us medical i think we ll focus on dabir and unless there is some of this great acquisition and that gives dabir a very strong path to market i think for the most part focused on our industrial and build that up in line with i guess our technologies and what we re comfortable with we wouldn t do an industrial acquisition that we didn t understand and that would take us too far afield from what we know christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst okay donald w duda president chief executive officer and then christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst go ahead donald w duda president chief executive officer the other thing we would add is that we ve done well in sensors our magneto elastic sensors have dome well our eddy current sensors do well so the sensor acquisition which would actually help all of methode is also something we d be looking at christopher van horn b riley fbr inc analyst okay thank you so much for the commentary i ll hop back in queue operator our next question comes from david leiker with baird please go ahead erin welcenbach robert w baird analyst hi this is erin welcenbach on for david donald w duda president chief executive officer hello erin erin welcenbach robert w baird analyst good morning my first question is again a follow up on the grakon acquisitions i m wondering if you can frame for us how much of the upside in the quarter was from better fundamental business performance maybe given some of the stronger commercial vehicle end markets versus synergies either cost or kind of cross selling synergies tracking above your expectations donald w duda president chief executive officer well as i think both ron and i said tariffs came in better than we anticipated i think the team has done a very good job of moving us quickly as they could to mitigate a certain portion of them and that was really us grakon brought all product into seattle and then they would ship to mexico or ship to canada and of course united states as well our teams are successful and quickly changing the ship point which reduce the tariffs so that helped and grakon did in the quarter the sales were higher than forecast in q3 so that s the advantage of the class 8 and then well it s in our automotive technical difficulty tesla also had an impact ron is there anything you would ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer i ll add to that maybe we were able to very quickly gain some procurement synergies that definitely drop to the bottom line in 3q and going out in the 4q and then into 20 fiscal 2020 as well erin welcenbach robert w baird analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then on the cost actions you announced i believe it was last quarter where do you stand in those in terms of when we ll start seeing the benefits of those flow through the p l and more substantially donald w duda president chief executive officer we ll see some benefit in our q4 we will see the full benefit in our fiscal 2020 erin welcenbach robert w baird analyst okay that s helpful and that s it from me thank you donald w duda president chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from steve dyer with craig hallum please go ahead steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst thank you good morning donald w duda president chief executive officer good morning steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst couple of questions from me i guess i ll start briefly on dabir looks like it s at long last starting to get some traction after a lot of testing and probably a little bit slower out of the gate but how do you think about sort of deployment from here it seems like it s checked all the boxes in terms of efficacy and safety and so on and so forth and what sort of the ramp to this becoming sort of the product that you envision several years ago donald w duda president chief executive officer good question the next step is to expand from single point hospitals into hospital systems and we re starting to see some of that now again slower than we would like but it is moving in that direction and your first half of demonstrate efficacy at the operating level with the nurses to get credibility and then you can talk to the c suite in the systems and that s where we re at now with the teams are i think doing a very good job now of expanding dabir in particular hospitals are at now and then going forward and i judge that by as i said the number of surfaces that we re selling and the number of clinicals that are going on you have to do that first before you can talk about any sales we still maintain that the hospital surgical suites are the area we want to focus on although we have as i said in my prepared remarks in the other areas and that remains a very large and robust market for us now in terms of when we see that we ll make progress next year we re not planning on dabir turning the corner next year from a profitability we think that s more of a 21 event and i realize that we ve been talking about it a long time but i have to say from my standpoint i feel reinvigorated with the progress in dabir that s been made so i still think we have sometime it s not going to swing q4 but i think we re in the right direction and i agree it s taken a long time but i think we re getting there steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst and that s very helpful i guess just following up on that at one point i think we all had expected that was going to be a very major product for the company in the future have you assumed anything in the last year or two or three that has sort of changed your mind on that in terms of the tam that it could be for you guys donald w duda president chief executive officer no i actually i would go the other way that the market is larger than we thought it was that we still have to land some systems and get it to be a standard of care but once it becomes a standard of care that market the total billed market is quite large and i have said a number of times we are focusing on the surgical suites because it s essentially no competition but the bigger market is when you get outside of the surgical area into acute excuse me non acute we did a study on a respiratory patients ventilator that turn out very favorable i think we commented on the last call so no ways it formed dabir we think the market has diminished at all i think it s grown steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst got it thank you for that and then i guess just jumping over to auto your largest auto program is i think in the middle of a change over model years technical difficulty to the t1 just kind of given the disruption i guess that you re seeing here at fiscal 20 around that changeover would you expect that the absolute dollars from that program can kind of grow in fiscal 2020 is that part of the assumption donald w duda president chief executive officer you would have to tell me what s the expected inaudible is going to be and where gm forecast their year we re obviously going to be dependent upon that in our planning l think we re holding our own but we re not expecting a huge upside from that i don t think there s anything in the marketplace that would suggest that ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer well the reason i say that as i thank you on most of fiscal 19 or at least half of it is going to be sort of not at full production for the k2 just given that changeover so i guess the assumption would be is most of fiscal 2020 should be back sort of full production for the t1 both trucks and suvs donald w duda president chief executive officer let me answer this way from our just looking at l t looking at ihs that s really what we do our planning on and we re not seeing that now that doesn t mean that three months from now that doesn t change i mean i really feel that we have a three to six months window where we can have some degree of certainty going to get a pay past that is it i think it becomes difficult to forecast steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst okay fair enough and let me just can you just remind us around content on the t1 versus k2 kind of apples to apples per vehicle donald w duda president chief executive officer it s just directionally if nothing else similar more or less et cetera ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer and it would be less and the end result prices has reduced us because the screens are down the screens are directed by so they have the sell prices has dropped and in general they have sell price of center consoles has reduced from when we originally launched k2 that directionally the content the content dropped the values are dropped and we ve talked in past calls about the dramatic reduction in screen prices steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst but that s largely pass through revenue as i recall right i guess i ll just jump ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer but it is pass through it s the pass through revenue but it s in the price steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst yes okay fair enough last question from me and then i ll jump back in line on the walk from ebitda from fiscal 19 to fiscal 20 it s great very helpful thank you it looks like you increased sort of your expectation of cost initiatives and so forth or i m sorry that the additional grakon revenue and contribution there by about 7 million but you kept sort of your overall 2020 target at 221 million should is that just conservatism on your part that that can now be upside or have you seen something sort of compression in other parts of your business donald w duda president chief executive officer we ve seen european auto drop what do we have in the chart 19 million into the passenger car reductions that s significant and we may have more headwinds and tailwinds from that standpoint so will europe stabilize or will europe drop so are we being conservative i guess we are being impractical and there can always be some upside but there s going to be downside as well and when we do these numbers we have to certify that the auditors that were 70 confident in our forecast and we are still when do we give that 4 months from now or we have to wait we have ways to go on or given any comment on here ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer so i might say that steve is that you know the plan is in the q and all the filings 221 million is the target and that s where we re at and we can t really say much more about that otherwise we really be giving fiscal 20 guidance as well so the plan is that s the plan steve dyer craig hallum capital group analyst all right fair enough thank you guys donald w duda president chief executive officer thank you operator next question comes from skip tague with rbi capital please go ahead skip tague rbi capital analyst hi i just wanted to confirm i think i heard that acquisitions added 150 million of revenues in the nine months that ended january 2019 is that correct ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer yes skip tague rbi capital analyst so then that implies that in the nine months ended 2017 the organic revenues have been 584 million which would compare to 659 million for the previous nine month period is that also correct ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer just a second 150 million of acquisitions and new launches so 115 million for acquisitions and 35 million for program launches skip tague rbi capital analyst okay great okay thank you very much ronald l g tsoumas vice president of corporate finance chief financial officer you re welcome operator operator instructions our next question comes from christopher hillary with roubaix capital please go ahead christopher hillary roubaix capital analyst hi good morning donald w duda president chief executive officer good morning christopher hillary roubaix capital analyst i just wanted to ask you ve done an excellent job in managing your margins both in the current period and through your planning period what do you see in the medium term as tailwinds to your margin whether it be cost improvements or the mix of business that you anticipate to be growing when we head beyond the 2020 period donald w duda president chief executive officer sure the two big drivers for us are new programs using our technology and higher margins and i ve pointed in the past to our magneto elastic margins in general our sensing business we put a slide out i think in the needham conference where we had i guess last quarter we had what was about 80 million of book business through 22 and that s a very very good margin and actually we anticipate probably by 22 it will be 100 million that the product carries one of our highest margins in the company so new business at higher margins or higher profit drive our overall margins and also we can generally take costs out of the product it s harder in auto today because we re fighting reduced volumes and reduced overhead coverage our north american business was down 23 million year over year but from a gross margin dollars the team s kept it flat and that s not easy to do in the auto business when there s a downturn they have done a good job europe has struggled a little bit more some of it s because their margins are higher than in the us but in general if i look at grakon we ve got great opportunity and we ve built into our plans to take costs out there they run a good factory but it s not up to the methode standards to our production system we ve got a good team we will get them there and we ll see the benefit of that some in 20 but also in 21 so it s a combination of new business and higher margins and then what we do well is take costs out of the product christopher hillary roubaix capital analyst great thank you very much gentlemen donald w duda president chief executive officer you are welcome operator thank you i would like to turn the call over to don for closing comments donald w duda president chief executive officer stacy thank you very much and we

and the cim definition standards the cim definition standards differ from the definitions in the united states securities and exchange commission sec guide 7 sec guide 7 under the united states securities act of 1933 as amended under sec guide 7 a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report mineral reserves the three year historical average price is used in any mineral reserve

recognized under u s securities laws u s investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be upgraded to mineral reserves inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever by upgraded to a higher category under canadian securities laws estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases u s investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable accordingly these mineral reserve and mineral

for further information the company believes that these measures in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company the non ifrs measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs these measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers all in sustaining costs the company believes this measure more fully defines the total costs associated with producing gold the company calculates all in sustaining costs as the sum of total cash costs as described below share based compensation corporate general and administrative expense exploration and evaluation expenses that are sustaining in nature reclamation cost accretion sustaining capital including deferred stripping realized gains and losses on hedges due to operating and capital costs but excluding proxy contest costs all divided by the total gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure total cash costs detour gold reports

costs and current inventory write downs production costs are exclusive of depreciation and depletion production costs include the costs associated with providing the royalty in kind ounces all in sustaining costs and total cash costs do not have any standardized meaning whether under ifrs or otherwise and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers accordingly other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in underlying principles and policies applied differences may also arise to a different definition of sustaining versus non sustaining
