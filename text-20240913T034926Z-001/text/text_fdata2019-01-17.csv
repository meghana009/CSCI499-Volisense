thiam was sentenced to seven years in prison he appealed his conviction to the u s court of appeals for the second circuit arguing that the u s supreme court s decision in mcdonnell v united states a

official act as defined in mcdonnell in october 2018 a three judge panel of the second circuit heard arguments in thiam s appeal the panel questioned whether the mcdonnell ruling extends to statutes

guinean law because he was being prosecuted in a u s court judge john m walker jr noted that the second circuit has not held that mcdonnell is limited to cases involving the federal bribery statute

circuit curtails use of conspiracy and complicity statutes in fcpa actions in a decision with implications for the extraterritorial reach of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the u s court of appeals for the second circuit held in united states v hoskins that a person may not be guilty as an accomplice or a co conspirator for an fcpa crime that he or she is incapable of committing as principal in doing so the court rejected co conspirator liability as a basis for the department of justice doj to assert jurisdiction over foreign nationals with no other connection to the united states however the government may still base jurisdiction on the fact that a defendant acted as an agent of a u s domestic concern and such a person can be liable of conspiring with foreign nationals who conducted relevant acts while in the united states background in general the anti bribery provisions of the fcpa prohibit u s persons and businesses u s domestic concerns issuers of u s securities issuers or any other person while in the territory of the u s from making corrupt payments to obtain or retain business the fcpa also applies to any officer director employee or agent thereof a non u s national who is not an agent of a u s domestic concern or issuer and who never takes actions in furtherance of the alleged corrupt scheme within the territory of the u s falls outside of the substantive provisions of the statute the doj has long used conspiracy and aiding and abetting charges to extend the jurisdictional reach of the fcpa to such persons its position was clearly espoused in the 2012 resource guide to the fcpa jointly issued with the securities and exchange commission individuals and companies including foreign nationals and companies may also be liable for conspiring to violate the fcpa i e for agreeing to commit an fcpa violation even if they are not or could not be independently charged with a substantive fcpa violation in doing so the government asserted it was following the well established rule in federal criminal law that person may be liable for conspiracy even though he was incapable of committing the substantive offense in hoskins the government charged lawrence hoskins a non u s citizen who worked for a u k subsidiary of the french company alstom s a alstom with conspiracy to violate the fcpa and aiding and abetting others in doing so alstom s u s subsidiary allegedly retained two consultants to bribe indonesian officials who could help secure a 118 million power contract the government alleged that although hoskins never traveled to the u s during the scheme he was one of the persons responsible for approving the selection of the consultants and authorizing payments to them with knowledge that portions of the payments were intended as bribes the district court dismissed portions of the indictment in relevant part finding that hoskins could not be liable for conspiracy if he could not be liable for a direct violation of the statute second circuit analysis assuming for the purposes of its analysis that hoskins was neither an employee nor agent of alstom s u s subsidiary the court examined whether he could nonetheless be liable under a conspiracy or complicity theory for violating the fcpa in finding he could not the court applied an exception derived from gebardi v united states providing that conspiracy and accomplice liability will not lie when congress demonstrates an affirmative legislative policy to leave some type of participant in a criminal transaction unpunished in gebardi the u s supreme court concluded that a woman could not be charged with conspiracy to transport a woman herself across state lines for the purpose of prostitution because the text of the statute showed that congress intended to leave unpunished women who merely consented to their transport hoskins argued that similarly congress did not intend for the fcpa to apply to non u s natural persons who 1 do not act within the territory of the u s and 2 are not officers directors employees or agents of a u s domestic concern or u s issuer the second circuit agreed noting the obvious omission in the text for jurisdiction over a foreign national who acts outside the united states but not on behalf of an american person or company as an officer director employee agent or stockholder after reviewing the fcpa s text structure and legislative history the court held the carefully tailored text of the statute read against the backdrop of a well established principle that u s law does not apply extraterritorially without express congressional authorization and a legislative history reflecting that congress drew lines in the fcpa out of specific concern about the scope of extraterritorial application of the statute persuades us that congress did not intend for persons outside of the statute s carefully delimited categories to be subject to conspiracy or complicity liability other potential theories of liability despite concluding that the government was barred from using conspiracy or complicity statutes to charge hoskins with any offense not punishable under the fcpa itself the court found that the government could potentially charge him as an agent of alstom s u s subsidiary because there was no indication of a legislative policy against punishing that class of persons nor would doing so involve an extraterritorial application of the fcpa therefore the court ruled the government is free to argue at the trial court that as an agent of a u s domestic concern hoskins conspir with employees and other agents of however it remains to be seen how useful this theory will be for the government against hoskins and other similarly situated defendants given that the doj will pursue at trial the theory that hoskins was an agent of a u s domestic concern that participated in the bribery scheme as hoskins was not an employee of the entity that allegedly paid the bribe the fcpa s jurisdictional reach may be further clarified an earlier version of this article was published as a skadden client alert on september 4 2018 revisions to yates memorandum policy announced on november 29 2018 in a speech at the 35th international conference on the foreign corrupt practices act u s deputy attorney general rod rosenstein announced the department of justice s doj or the department revised policy concerning individual accountability the revised policy maintains much of the guidance in its predecessor policy the doj memorandum on individual accountability for corporate wrongdoing referred to as the yates memorandum but departs from the prior policy by no longer requiring companies to provide all evidence to obtain cooperation credit in criminal matters and by similarly reducing companies self disclosure burdens in civil matters the revised policy consistent with the prior policy continues to prioritize individual accountability for wrongdoing as rosenstein explained in the speech and on a number of other occasions the most effective deterrent to corporate criminal misconduct is identifying and punishing the people who committed the crimes accordingly the revised policy requires that absent extraordinary circumstances corporate resolutions not seek to protect individuals from criminal liability relatedly the revised policy continues to require that corporations identify individuals who are responsible for the subject conduct to receive credit for cooperation but the new approach departs from the yates memorandum by reducing the burden companies bear when seeking credit for cooperation in criminal cases specifically the yates memorandum required corporations to provide to the department all relevant facts about the individuals involved in corporate misconduct if they wished to receive any cooperation credit the revised policy no longer requires identification of all individuals involved to receive cooperation credit and instead allows companies and the doj to focus resources on identifying those who were substantially involved in or responsible for the potential criminal misconduct rosenstein explained that as a practical matter to require a corporation to locate and report every person involved in alleged misconduct particularly in cases where the alleged violations took place throughout the company over a long period of time would be a waste of resources and unnecessarily delay resolutions indeed he noted that the prior policy was not strictly enforced in this respect for this and other reasons it thus would appear that the revised policy formalizes existing practice furthermore the revised policy allows for cooperation credit in criminal cases even where a company is unable to identify all relevant individuals or provide complete factual information despite its good faith efforts to cooperate fully if it can explain the restrictions it is facing to the prosecutor on the other hand where a company declines to learn such facts or to provide the department with complete factual information it will receive no credit and as rosenstein s speech emphasized concealment of misconduct or a lack of good faith representations to the department also will preclude any credit the revised policy also differs from the yates memorandum in its approach to civil investigations the yates memorandum essentially required the same level of cooperation from companies in civil investigations as in criminal investigations the revised policy by contrast provides credit for at least some cooperation in a civil case where a company identif all wrongdoing by senior officials including members of senior management or the board of directors if a company wants maximum credit in a civil case it must identify every individual person who was substantially involved in or responsible for the misconduct but the policy restores the department s ability to grant at least some credit in circumstances where it would previously have been unavailable as in criminal matters when a company conceals misconduct by senior officials cooperation credit is precluded as rosenstein explained in his speech the revised policy allows flexibility that does not exist on the criminal side he noted that the goal of affirmative civil enforcement cases is to recover money and therefore the government must use its resources efficiently in pursuing them according to rosenstein prior all or nothing policy was not productive in civil cases and was not strictly enforced the revised policy in contrast to the yates memorandum also returns discretion to civil department of justice lawyers to negotiate civil releases for individuals who do not warrant additional investigation as part of corporate civil settlement agreements with appropriate supervisory approval and to consider an individual s ability to pay in deciding whether to seek a civil judgment these measures similarly recognize the practical need for the responsible government agencies to have discretion to cease pursuit of litigation unlikely to yield a benefit or to resolve litigation efficiently without requiring further investigation of individual wrongdoing taken together these policy revisions signal that the doj intends to use its resources to focus its attention on senior corporate personnel and or individuals who were substantially involved in misconduct and to continue to require companies to disclose the facts regarding their complicity the department does not appear to be backing away from its prior focus on individual prosecutions indeed rosenstein made clear in his november speech that the pursuit of responsible individuals will be a top priority and that individual cases may be more effective than corporate prosecutions where the deterrent impact is attenuated and where innocent employees and shareholders may be unfairly penalized it remains to be seen whether that shift described largely as making the policy consistent with practice will truly impact the size or burden of investigations that companies must undertake to cooperate effectively in civil and criminal cases but the revisions are consistent with a number of this department s recent policies such as the piling on policy and last year s november 29 2017 fcpa policy release that are intended to facilitate cooperation and remediation and to ensure that cooperation even if somewhat more limited is rewarded this article was originally published as a skadden client alert on december 10 2018 doj memo suggests diminishing use of corporate monitors in criminal matters on october 11 2018 assistant attorney general brian a benczkowski issued a guidance memorandum regarding the selection and use of corporate monitors in criminal matters the benczkowski memo the memo supplements a 2008 memorandum issued by then acting deputy attorney general craig s morford the morford memo that set out a framework for the selection and use of monitors in deferred prosecution agreements dpas and nonprosecution agreements npas and supersedes a 2009 memorandum issued by then assistant attorney general lanny a breuer the benczkowski memo clarifies existing principles for determining whether a monitor is needed in individual cases and provides additional guidance the benczkowski memo instructs prosecutors to favor the imposition of a monitor where there is a demonstrated need for and clear benefit to be derived from a monitorship relative to the projected costs and burdens to the company the benczkowski memo differs from prior guidance on the selection and use of corporate monitors in several notable respects first unlike the morford memo which applied only to dpas and npas and specifically excluded plea agreements the benczkowski memo instructs that the same principles should apply to plea agreements provided that the presiding court approves the agreement the memo describes the cost benefit considerations prosecutors must weigh when assessing the need for and propriety of a monitor the morford memo instructed prosecutors to consider in monitorship selection the potential benefits that employing a monitor may have for the corporation and the public and the cost of a monitor and its impact on the operations of a corporation but it was silent on the specific factors to consider in assessing these two considerations the benczkowski memo clarifies that prosecutors should consider the following potential benefits whether changes in corporate culture and leadership following misconduct are enough to safeguard against future misconduct whether adequate remediation termination occurred to address problematic behavior of certain employees management or third party agents and any unique risks and compliance challenges the company faces region industry clientele the memo further notes that the potential costs prosecutors should consider include not only the projected monetary costs to a business but also whether the proposed scope of a monitor s role is appropriately tailored to avoid unnecessary burdens on the business operations the benczkowski memo suggests that the scope of monitorships will be more closely regulated as will the transparency of the monitor selection process a significant departure from past practice this increased focus on scope coupled with heightened emphasis on cost benefit analyses suggests that the new guidance will likely lead to a reduction in the imposition of corporate monitorships reinforcing monitorships as the exception not the rule china initiative promises to investigate and prosecute chinese companies on november 1 2018 then attorney general jeff sessions announced the u s department of justice s doj china initiative with the objective of countering perceived national security threats to the united states from china the initiative promises to investigate and prosecute chinese companies aggressively for alleged trade secret theft economic espionage foreign corrupt practices act fcpa offenses and other violations of u s law in his speech announcing the initiative and an accompanying fact sheet then attorney general sessions cited a number of recent prosecutions for economic espionage and referenced several reports by the trump administration on china s allegedly unfair trade practices and theft of u s intellectual property alleged threats to the united states critical infrastructure from foreign direct investment supply chain threats and foreign agents seeking to influence the american public and policymakers without proper registration also will be vigorously investigated and prosecuted the china initiative is being led by the doj s national security division and includes senior fbi and doj officials and u s attorneys from five different federal judicial districts among other things the initiative seeks to identify priority trade secret theft cases and bring them to fruition in a timely manner apply the foreign agents registration act to unregistered agents who seek to advance china s political agenda and bring enforcement actions where appropriate implement the foreign investment risk review modernization act for the doj identify fcpa cases involving chinese companies that compete with american businesses and increase efforts to improve chinese responses to requests under the mutual legal assistance agreement with the u s the china initiative reflects growing tensions between china and the u s in areas of trade and intellectual property protections as well as the trump administration s enforcement focus on chinese companies the doj s china initiative comes on the heels of recent efforts by chinese authorities to assert sovereignty over cross border data transfer under the chinese cybersecurity law and to restrict companies ability to provide information even on a voluntary basis to foreign authorities under the international criminal judicial assistance law these developments promise to make the international enforcement landscape even more challenging and complex for multinational companies and they underscore the importance of continued vigilance proactive assessment of relevant legal risks and contingency planning this article was originally published as a skadden client alert on november 29 2018 multijurisdictional anti corruption enforcement developments a number of countries including argentina brazil france mexico south korea and vietnam have expanded their anti corruption enforcement laws in recent years and are working both with the united states and independently to investigate and prosecute bribery and corruption in a recently released volume of the journal of federal law and practice daniel kahn chief of the u s department of justice s doj foreign corrupt practices act fcpa unit acknowledged this trend over the past several years there has been a significant uptick in activity by foreign authorities in the investigation and prosecution of white collar crime this upward trend has been particularly conspicuous in the context of transnational corruption over the past several years a number of countries successfully resolved their first corporate foreign bribery case and a number of countries have coordinated resolutions with the department of justice criminal division fraud section s fcpa unit kahn highlighted that in 2017 alone the doj received significant cooperation from approximately 20 different countries in fcpa cases kahn s observations echo public comments by other u s enforcement regulators about increased coordination of anti corruption investigations with other countries in 2014 then assistant attorney general for the doj s criminal division leslie caldwell commented e increasingly find ourselves shoulder to shoulder with law enforcement and regulatory authorities in other countries every day more countries join in the battle against transnational bribery and this includes not just our long time partners but countries in all corners of the globe in a november 2017 speech steven peikin co director of the securities and exchange commission s division of enforcement also drew attention to the trend and the need for cross border cooperation n my view in an increasingly international enforcement environment the u s authorities cannot and should not go it alone in fighting corruption as global markets become more interconnected and complex no one country or agency can effectively fight bribery and corruption by itself anti corruption enforcement is a team effort the enforcement division s fight against corruption is much more effective when our international colleagues join us in a shared commitment to eradicating corruption and bribery and leveling the playing field for businesses everywhere fortunately i have observed that the level of cooperation and coordination among regulators and law enforcement worldwide is on a sharply upward trajectory particularly in matters involving corruption in fact in the past fiscal year alone the commission has publicly acknowledged assistance from 19 different jurisdictions in fcpa matters i fully expect the trend of the enforcement division working closely with foreign law enforcement and regulators in anti bribery actions to continue its upward trajectory in the coming years in addition to these types of remarks fcpa settlements in recent years have also highlighted the results of enforcement agencies cross border cooperation efforts indeed the doj has worked with other jurisdictions authorities on twice as many resolutions since 2016 as it had in all previous years combined recent examples of significant resolutions include a deal with u s and brazilian authorities under which petr√≥leo brasileiro s a petrobras agreed to pay 853 2 million in penalties to resolve the u s government s fcpa investigation and a related brazilian investigation a global settlement that swedish telecommunications company telia company ab and its subsidiary in uzbekistan reached in september 2017 with the sec the doj and authorities in sweden and the netherlands for more than 965 million in combined penalties a global settlement that keppel offshore marine ltd a shipyard operator in singapore and its u s based subsidiary reached in december 2017 with authorities in the united states brazil and singapore agreeing to pay more than 422 million in combined penalties to those authorities in the first coordinated fcpa resolution with singapore and a settlement that french financial services institution soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale s a and its subsidiary reached in june 2018 with the doj and french authorities with approximately 585 million being paid in penalties for fcpa violations in the first coordinated resolution with french authorities in a foreign bribery case as a result of this cross border cooperation and coordination focus on the fcpa alone is inadequate for companies that may be subject to anti corruption laws in multiple jurisdictions because legal requirements differ from country to country for example both the fcpa and the u k s bribery act 2010 prohibit offering or paying bribes to foreign officials but only the latter prohibits commercial or private sector bribery and agreeing to receive bribes in december 2016 france enacted a new anti corruption law sapin ii under which a new french anti corruption agency l agence fran√ßaise anticorruption published guidance for companies on implementing and maintaining effective compliance programs to detect and prevent corruption significantly unlike the fcpa and the bribery act companies that are subject to sapin ii can be held liable under that law for failure to map corruption risks and implement an effective compliance program even when there is no evidence of corrupt activity argentina s new anti corruption laws also require certain companies to implement policies and procedures to mitigate corruption risks cooperation and coordination among regulatory authorities across borders is likely to continue and expand given these developments and the global expansion of anti corruption laws companies should endeavor to determine which measures apply to their operations understand applicable legal obligations re examine their compliance programs and controls and develop policies procedures and training programs that enable company personnel to meet compliance requirements an earlier version of this article was published in the october 10 2018 issue of the review of securities

financial strains in lebanon have been brought into focus by turbulence on markets where its dollar denominated sovereign bonds suffered a heavy sell off last week following comments by the finance minister about the public debt the bonds recovered this week on assurances the government is absolutely not planning to restructure the debt and is committed to paying its maturing debt and interest payments at predetermined dates but the episode has added to debate about lebanon s debt sustainability after warnings from politicians the imf and world bank over economic and financial conditions in a country that has suffered years of low economic growth lebanon s factional politics has led to years of policy paralysis and obstructed reforms needed to boost investor confidence more than eight months after an election politicians have been unable to agree a new government what are the problems lebanon has one of the world s biggest public debts compared to the size of its economy largely generated through servicing existing debt and high state spending it amounts to roughly 150 percent of gdp the world bank has estimated that financial transfers to the state owned power producer alone averaged 3 8 percent of gdp from 2008 to 2017 a public sector wage increase in 2017 and higher interest rates have added to pressures on the budget deficit lebanon also has a current account deficit because it imports far more than it exports financing these two deficits has depended on critical financial transfers from its diaspora but questions over this model have grown at the heart of concerns is the recent slowdown in remittance deposit inflows which have traditionally funded a large part if not all of lebanon s financing requirement goldman sachs said in a dec 3 analysis the world bank in an october report said lebanon was exposed to significant refinancing risks attracting sufficient capital and in particular deposits to finance significantly larger budgetary and current account deficits is proving challenging in light of slower deposit growth lower oil prices have been seen by economists as a major cause of the slowdown with many lebanese working in oil producing gulf arab states political instability and lower growth in lebanon have also been cited as factors economic growth rates have fallen to between 1 and 2 percent from between 8 and 10 percent in the four years before syria s civil war began in 2011 how urgent is the situation central bank governor riad salameh said last month the banking sector was capable of financing the state s foreign and domestic debt in 2019 the central bank s net foreign assets stand at around 40 billion the financial system has proven resilient through political crises assassinations and war the lebanese pound peg against the us dollar has been stable for over two decades often in the absence of effective government the central bank has maintained stability using stimulus packages and unorthodox financial operations made possible by large diaspora deposits into the banks but since 2016 the slowdown in non resident inflows prompted the central bank to embark on financial engineering to draw more dollars to its reserves the world bank and imf have praised the central bank for a critical role but the world bank s october report noted some central bank tools were becoming less effective and that lebanon s risk profile was rising sharply confidence is critical to encouraging the inflows upon which the system rests this would be boosted if a new government was agreed and moved quickly towards making reforms of the power sector this could unlock some 11 billion in funding pledged by foreign states and institutions last year for a capital investment program where does hezbollah figure in this the power wielded by the iran backed lebanese shi ite group hezbollah is at the heart of tension between lebanon and gulf states such as saudi arabia that once supported beirut but have turned their attention elsewhere in recent years goldman sachs noted that one cause of the slowdown in remittance and deposit growth was the perceived reduced likelihood of external support in light of heightened tensions between lebanon and the oil rich gulf countries the heavily armed group is listed as a terrorist group by the united states and fought a war with israel in 2006 we have warned for some time that if there was a fresh escalation of tensions with gulf countries or israel that could lead to another period of capital flight that puts the dollar peg under pressure jason tuvey of capital economics said the united states has tightened financial sanctions against hezbollah part of its wider effort to counter iran the lebanese banking sector has been applying these measures and anti money laundering legislation lebanon lobbied washington in 2017 to balance its tough anti hezbollah stance with the need to preserve the country s financial stability consequently sanctions were altered enough to allay fears of major economic damage the application of such measures may have weighed on some inflows to lebanon though it is difficult to know to what extent tuvey said can the next government fix the problem once prime minister designate saad al hariri manages to form a government investors will be looking for follow through on promises of reducing the budget deficit but there are concerns that politics could get in the way of reforms once again lebanese and international stakeholders agree that the budget deficit needs to narrow but a credible actionable plan for achieving this is still lacking and it remains unclear if political dynamics will allow for a concerted fiscal adjustment fitch ratings said
by macdonald dzirutwe harare jan 16 reuters protests against fuel price hikes in zimbabwe have entered their third day posing a major challenge for president emmerson mnangagwa who replaced long time leader robert mugabe and promised to repair the creaking economy the crisis will not be easy to fix there is a severe shortage of dollars fuel and medicines while inflation hit 31 percent in november the highest in a decade foreign investors are by and large staying away what sparked the latest clashes everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals in the past two months the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods including medicines food and fuel motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line on saturday mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to 3 31 per litre from 1 32 from midnight but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash u s dollars it was the final straw for some zimbabweans and violent protests broke out on monday three people including a police officer died in those clashes and since then much of the country has been at a standstill as people stay at home many people blame mnangagwa for failing to fulfil his pre election promises to kick start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong arm rule of his predecessor genesis of cash shortages the country abandoned the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before in its place the government adopted the u s dollar and other currencies including sterling and the south african rand people hoped the move would spell the end of spiralling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless but over time supply of the u s and south african currencies dried up so in november 2016 authorities in harare launched a surrogate currency paper bond notes designed to ease acute hard currency shortages story continues the notes which now have a total face value of 400 million are backed by a 500 million loan from the african export and import bank the central bank has said they are used like cash officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1 1 on the street 1 fetches up to 3 bond notes reflecting the ongoing shortage of u s dollars and people s desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency a dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as 30 in bond notes companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits zollars when the bond note was introduced dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value government borrowing via treasury bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold it is these electronic dollars theoretically worth 10 billion and nicknamed zollars by economists that are raising fears that zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments zollars remain officially pegged at 1 1 to the u s dollar but on the black market 1 is now worth 4 zollars that has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments zimbabwe s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks cover for imports central bank data show the government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves but on friday the finance minister said zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months how are businesses affected companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment forcing them to buy dollars on the black market the government on monday postponed wage negotiations with civil service unions who are planning a nationwide strike from jan 22 to press for u s dollar pay civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies charities or large international corporations are paid in u s dollars last october the central bank ordered banks to create separate u s dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar the confederation of zimbabwe industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch the group said its members had a backlog of 480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers cooking oil and soap maker olivine industries said on saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers 11 million zimbabwe s largest brewing company delta beverages part owned by anheuser busch inbev said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened what s next despite the unrest at home mnangagwa still plans a visit later this month to the world economic forum in davos switzerland where he is expected to hold meetings aimed at luring back foreign investment the former spy chief installed after mugabe s removal in a coup in november 2017 was elected in july amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for zimbabwe and has said his nation is open for business but critics say the man nicknamed the crocodile is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms including repealing mugabe era laws that restrict the media mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of u s sanctions against officials from the zanu pf ruling party top military figures and some government owned firms which were imposed during mugabe s rule for what washington called violations of human rights and democracy the imf has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country s reform programme unless its 2 billion arrears with the world bank african development bank and european investment bank are paid harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a programme allowing the imf to monitor its economic reforms although it does not entail funding from the lender analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now but more clashes were expected unless mnangagwa s administration could find a solution to the cash woes additional reporting and writing by

watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments zollars

beirut reuters financial strains in lebanon have been brought into focus by turbulence on markets where its dollar denominated sovereign bonds suffered a heavy sell off last week following comments by the finance minister about the public debt the bonds recovered this week on assurances the government is absolutely not planning to restructure the debt and is committed to paying its maturing debt and interest payments at predetermined dates but the episode has added to debate about lebanon s debt sustainability after warnings from politicians the imf and world bank over economic and financial conditions in a country that has suffered years of low economic growth lebanon s factional politics has led to years of policy paralysis and obstructed reforms needed to boost investor confidence more than eight months after an election politicians have been unable to agree a new government what are the problems lebanon has one of the world s biggest public debts compared to the size of its economy largely generated through servicing existing debt and high state spending it amounts to roughly 150 percent of gdp the world bank has estimated that financial transfers to the state owned power producer alone averaged 3 8 percent of gdp from 2008 to 2017 a public sector wage increase in 2017 and higher interest rates have added to pressures on the budget deficit lebanon also has a current account deficit because it imports far more than it exports financing these two deficits has depended on critical financial transfers from its diaspora but questions over this model have grown at the heart of concerns is the recent slowdown in remittance deposit inflows which have traditionally funded a large part if not all of lebanon s financing requirement goldman sachs said in a dec 3 analysis the world bank in an october report said lebanon was exposed to significant refinancing risks attracting sufficient capital and in particular deposits to finance significantly larger budgetary and current account deficits is proving challenging in light of slower deposit growth lower oil prices have been seen by economists as a major cause of the slowdown with many lebanese working in oil producing gulf arab states political instability and lower growth in lebanon have also been cited as factors economic growth rates have fallen to between 1 and 2 percent from between 8 and 10 percent in the four years before syria s civil war began in 2011 how urgent is the situation central bank governor riad salameh said last month the banking sector was capable of financing the state s foreign and domestic debt in 2019 the central bank s net foreign assets stand at around 40 billion the financial system has proven resilient through political crises assassinations and war the lebanese pound peg against the u s dollar has been stable for over two decades often in the absence of effective government the central bank has maintained stability using stimulus packages and unorthodox financial operations made possible by large diaspora deposits into the banks but since 2016 the slowdown in non resident inflows prompted the central bank to embark on financial engineering to draw more dollars to its reserves the world bank and imf have praised the central bank for a critical role but the world bank s october report noted some central bank tools were becoming less effective and that lebanon s risk profile was rising sharply confidence is critical to encouraging the inflows upon which the system rests this would be boosted if a new government was agreed and moved quickly towards making reforms of the power sector this could unlock some 11 billion in funding pledged by foreign states and institutions last year for a capital investment programme where does hezbollah figure in this the power wielded by the iran backed lebanese shi ite group hezbollah is at the heart of tension between lebanon and gulf states such as saudi arabia that once supported beirut but have turned their attention elsewhere in recent years goldman sachs noted that one cause of the slowdown in remittance and deposit growth was the perceived reduced likelihood of external support in light of heightened tensions between lebanon and the oil rich gulf countries the heavily armed group is listed as a terrorist group by the united states and fought a war with israel in 2006 we have warned for some time that if there was a fresh escalation of tensions with gulf countries or israel that could lead to another period of capital flight that puts the dollar peg under pressure jason tuvey of capital economics said the united states has tightened financial sanctions against hezbollah part of its wider effort to counter iran the lebanese banking sector has been applying these measures and anti money laundering legislation lebanon lobbied washington in 2017 to balance its tough anti hezbollah stance with the need to preserve the country s financial stability consequently sanctions were altered enough to allay fears of major economic damage the application of such measures may have weighed on some inflows to lebanon though it is difficult to know to what extent tuvey said can the next government fix the problem once prime minister designate saad al hariri manages to form a government investors will be looking for follow through on promises of reducing the budget deficit but there are concerns that politics could get in the way of reforms once again lebanese and international stakeholders agree that the budget deficit needs to narrow but a credible actionable plan for achieving this is still lacking and it remains unclear if political dynamics will allow for a concerted fiscal adjustment fitch ratings said writing by tom perry editing by pravin char
targeted news service washington jan 16 rep maxine waters d california chairman of the house financial services committee issued the following statement today congresswoman maxine waters d ca chairwoman of the house committee on financial services delivered the following remarks during her first policy speech in the 116th congress thank you for the very warm welcome and to the center for american progress for holding this event cap s research and policy work are highly respected and a valued resource for members of congress and our staffs i am very pleased to be here with you today to discuss the new congress and my priorities as chairwoman of the house financial services committee i am deeply honored to have been selected by my colleagues to become the first woman and the first african american to serve as chair of the financial services committee i have served on the committee since 1991 and since 1995 i have served as ranking member or chairwoman of every subcommittee under the committee s jurisdiction and have taken on important issues on behalf of consumers investors and vulnerable families so i consider it a privilege to hold the gavel and i am looking forward to working with my colleagues on the committee on the many critical issues we are responsible for trump shutdown now given the current circumstances in washington i would first like to address the shutdown and its impact on the important programs under the financial services committee s jurisdiction we are now in the midst of the longest government shutdown in history all because this president is throwing a tantrum about a senseless border wall the trump shutdown is harming hardworking americans and our financial markets the shutdown has all but closed the doors of the securities and exchange commission sec which is wall street s cop on the block as a result of the shutdown the sec is unable to carry out most enforcement actions against bad actors businesses planning to enter the stock market for the first time through an initial public offering ipo may also be delayed because the sec cannot approve their documents harming american entrepreneurs and job creation the shutdown also has a serious impact on critical housing programs 95 of the department of housing and urban development s staff has been furloughed millions of families that rely on hud rental assistance programs are perilously close to losing their homes due to projected lapses in funding what s more it was recently reported that hud under secretary carson s leadership has failed to follow its own contingency plan and as a result 1 150 project based rental assistance contracts have expired with hundreds more hanging in the balance if this shutdown does not end families aspiring to the american dream of homeownership may have their federal housing administration fha or rural housing loans delayed or be unable to close on their loans during the shutdown and in rural communities very low income elderly homeowners who rely on hud grants and loans to address health and safety hazards may not receive disbursements and as a result may be forced to live in dangerous conditions these are just a few examples of the serious ways that this shutdown is harming american families and businesses this shutdown must end immediately i call on republicans in congress to join with us and put a stop to it and open the government so that we can put an end to all of the harm that this shutdown is causing the consumer financial protection bureau and financial regulation an ongoing priority for me is ensuring that we have a strong consumer financial protection bureau and strong financial regulation that protects consumers investors and our economy let s talk about why the consumer bureau is so important we all remember how devastating the financial crisis was 11 million americans lost their homes 13 trillion in wealth was lost nearly 9 million americans lost their jobs and the unemployment rate hit 10 percent it was catastrophic for communities across the country the crisis was a result of wall street running amok with abusive institutions peddling toxic products like no doc loans interest only mortgages and other predatory products with no agency responsible for prioritizing consumer protection ultimately the economy was sent tumbling into the abyss in response democrats crafted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act to improve accountability in the financial system and protect consumers investors and the economy from abusive wall street practices as the centerpiece of that law we created the consumer financial protection bureau which is the only federal agency solely dedicated to protecting consumers from being ripped off by financial firms under former director richard cordray the consumer bureau returned 12 billion to more than 30 million harmed consumers handled over 1 3 million consumer complaints about financial institutions implemented much needed rules on mortgages prepaid cards payday loans and auto title loans required clear disclosures from financial institutions and provided consumers with easy to understand materials to empower them to make the best decisions but congressional republicans and the trump administration have been determined to undermine and destroy the consumer bureau trump installed mick mulvaney his budget director to serve as acting director of the consumer bureau and during his tenure mulvaney made it a priority to dismantle the consumer bureau from within to name just a few of his actions mulvaney fired all members of the consumer advisory board and requested zero dollars in operating funds for the consumer bureau from the federal reserve he also created an office of cost benefit analysis as a way to internally block important regulations under the guise of cost benefit analysis he also moved to strip the consumer bureau s office of fair lending and equal opportunity of its enforcement and supervisory authority but that s not all mulvaney closed the office of students and young consumers at a time when 44 million student borrowers collectively carry over 1 5 trillion in student loan debt he also helped out payday lenders for example he withdrew a lawsuit against a group of deceptive payday lenders who allegedly failed to disclose the true cost of loans which carried interest rates as high as 950 percent a year now kathy kraninger was confirmed as the new director in december and we will see what she does mulvaney has since moved on to become this president s acting chief of staff but i ve written to mr mulvaney to inform him that while his time running the consumer bureau may be over the time for accountability for his actions is about to begin this congress i am going to be working diligently to undo the damage that mulvaney has wrought during his time at the consumer bureau i have a bill the consumers first act that reverses many of his known harmful actions which i will soon be reintroducing but it s not just mick mulvaney who i will be paying attention to i will be keeping a watchful eye on all of the financial regulators to make sure that they are carrying out their statutory duties including holding bad actors accountable and promoting financial stability as we saw during the 2008 financial crisis large wall street banks that aren t subject to strong oversight and safeguards to protect our economy can do a lot of damage and so in dodd frank we put in place robust reforms for our largest and most complex financial institutions including increased capital reduced leverage improved liquidity vigorous stress testing and thorough living wills all designed to improve financial stability dodd frank established the financial stability oversight council to eliminate regulatory gaps and improve oversight of the entire financial system including shadow banking dodd frank also established the volcker rule to ensure that big banks don t gamble away their customers deposits all of these reforms were designed to help prevent a future financial crisis the committee will be paying close attention to whether financial regulators try to weaken these important reforms and keeping an eye on the big banks and their activities including by holding many hearings regulators also need to address the evolving financial marketplace appropriately one emerging area the financial services committee will be paying very close attention to is the growth of financial technology or so called fintech firms as americans are banking and accessing credit in new ways it is important that we encourage responsible innovation with the appropriate safeguards in place to protect consumers and without displacing community banks and credit unions i have great hopes that fintech firms can open up opportunities for those who have been excluded from access to responsible credit but i strongly believe that there must be strong protections for consumers of these financial products and that abusive payday lending practices must not be allowed as the fintech sector grows there are opportunities for unmet credit needs to be addressed as well as risks that minority communities may be preyed upon or discriminated against by some of these companies so we will be closely examining these issues in committee to make sure that our regulators eliminate the risks and meet the opportunities credit reporting is another issue i will be scrutinizing in the wake of the equifax data breach it s absolutely critical for congress to reform the nation s credit reporting system we need to shift the burden of removing mistakes from credit reports onto the credit bureaus and furnishers and away from consumers we also need to place limits on credit checks for employment purposes reduce the time period that negative items stay on credit reports and make other reforms to fix the serious problems with the credit reporting sector for the sake of consumers across the country credit reporting needs a comprehensive overhaul housing a very important issue we will be bringing renewed attention to in the financial services committee is housing this country is experiencing a housing affordability and homelessness crisis today there are over half a million people experiencing homelessness here in the richest country in the world over one fifth of whom are children this includes veterans who we failed to support when they returned home after serving our country women fleeing domestic violence people who have left prison after serving their debt to society and people who have simply fallen on hard times it is simply shameful and congress has a responsibility to act to tackle the homelessness crisis congress needs to provide a surge of funding and resources just as congress puts billions of dollars into defense spending we must provide the funding necessary to ensure that all americans have access to safe decent and affordable housing so i will soon be reintroducing my bill the ending homelessness act which would help to ensure that every american has a safe decent and affordable place to call home the bill provides 13 27 billion in new funding over five years to federal programs and initiatives to prevent homelessness in addition we will be holding committee hearings on homelessness and important housing issues that have gone ignored during the last congress in order to elevate housing issues into a national discussion and present proactive solutions and remedies the committee also has a responsibility to look at our housing finance system and address the fates of fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored enterprises the gses have been in government conservatorship for more than a decade contrary to republican claims fannie mae and freddie mac did not cause the financial crisis the financial crisis inquiry commission and others have made that clear the financial crisis was driven by predatory lending the private market packaging those toxic risky loans into securities and then selling those securities to unsuspecting investors fannie and freddie did not drive those actions but the events that transpired during the crisis made clear the need for their reform when it comes to housing finance reform i have advocated for core principles that i believe should be part of legislative efforts to address the future of housing finance reform the principles include maintaining access to the 30 year fixed rate mortgage ensuring sufficient private capital is in place to protect taxpayers providing stability and liquidity so that we can withstand any future financial crisis ensuring a smooth transition to a new finance system requiring transparency and standardization in a way that ensures a level playing field for all financial institutions especially credit unions and community banks maintaining access for all qualified borrowers that can sustain homeownership and serving homeowners of the future and ensuring access to affordable rental housing it is particularly important to ensure that underserved borrowers and communities are not overlooked this means housing finance reform will need to include a comprehensive strategy around access to affordable mortgage credit as well as access to affordable rental housing also important for housing access is the rigorous enforcement of our fair housing laws unfortunately our fight to make progress on fair housing has become much more challenging under the trump administration let s not forget that president trump himself was sued by the government for serious violations of the fair housing act under trump s leadership the affirmatively furthering fair housing mandate under the fair housing act was badly undercut when secretary carson halted implementation of the obama administration s affirmatively furthering fair housing rule in fact secretary carson once likened the rule to a failed social experiment secretary carson has also reportedly proposed taking the words free from discrimination out of hud s mission statement he also reportedly halted several fair housing investigations and sidelined top advisors in hud s office of fair housing enforcement these are unprecedented attacks on fair housing that we will not stand for to that end in addition to conducting robust oversight of the trump administration s activities at hud i will be reintroducing the restoring fair housing protections act my bill to reverse the harmful steps taken by secretary carson and the trump administration to undermine fair housing i promise to continue to stand up for fair housing opportunities for all people diversity and inclusion another very important issue that i am going to continue to work on as chairwoman is diversity and inclusion as a nation we are becoming increasingly diverse racially and ethnically the u s census bureau estimates that more than half of all americans will belong to a minority group by the year 2044 at the same time there is a growing body of research showing a connection between the level of diversity at a company and the strength of its financial performance despite these facts the government accountability office gao has found a continued trend of low representation of minorities and women in the financial services industry minorities and women have particularly low representation at the senior management levels within the financial services industry this needs to change diverse representation in these institutions and particularly at the management level is essential to ensure that all consumers have fair access to credit capital and banking and financial services now as many of you know i believe that it is essential to promote better workforce and supplier diversity i am one of the proud authors of section 1116 of the housing and economic recovery act and section 342 of the dodd frank act together these provisions direct most of the federal financial services agencies to create offices of minority and women inclusion which we refer to as omwis omwis have the important responsibility of overseeing all diversity matters in management employment and business activities at their agencies the creation of these offices was a major step forward but we all know that laws that promote racial ethnic and gender equality are only as strong as the implementation and enforcement of those laws and congressional oversight is essential to ensure that implementation and enforcement are strong so i am very pleased and very proud to announce that i will be creating a subcommittee on diversity and inclusion the subcommittee will be the first in its kind in congress dedicated to looking at diversity and inclusion issues under the committee s jurisdiction international affairs turning to the international jurisdiction of the committee i plan to focus on the important work of the world bank and the regional development banks in ending global poverty we have in the past worked in a bipartisan fashion to support the international monetary fund or imf in times of crisis at the same time that we pressed the fund to pay more attention to the social dimension of problems when decisions about economic assistance are made while the spirit of cooperation on issues related to global economic governance in congress has been lacking i am optimistic that this congress will see renewed bipartisan attention under my leadership the financial services committee will ensure that accountability and effectiveness at the international financial institutions remain strong that broad public debate about the imf s and the multilateral development banks policies remains active and that the international interests of poverty alleviation growth and economic stability continue to be advanced sanctions another area that i hope will be bipartisan is the issue of protecting american interests and democratic institutions from assault both internally and from abroad this brings me to the issue of u s sanctions against russia for its hostile actions and its efforts to undermine the u s presidential election i believe the administration s approach to russia sanctions has been haphazard and weak as well as inconsistent with its approach to sanctions imposed on other countries such as iran i am very concerned about the treasury department s recent actions to lift sanctions on businesses connected to oleg deripaska deripaska is a russian oligarch with close ties to vladimir putin who also has a history with paul manafort former trump campaign chairman who has been convicted of serious financial crimes uncovered as a result of special counsel mueller s investigation into russian interference in the last presidential election what s more deripaska has faced numerous allegations of criminal activity and was cited by the treasury department in april as saying he does not separate himself from the russian state i believe the delisting agreement for deripaska s companies is too favorable to deripaska including by allowing him to benefit from potentially tens of millions of dollars in debt forgiveness by transferring some of his shares to a russian bank to satisfy debts that deripaska owes that bank i also don t believe deripaska should be allowed to retain any influence or level of control over these companies i look forward to working with my colleagues in both chambers and across the aisle to closely monitor all further developments on russia sanctions to hold the administration accountable for its actions in this area and to ensure that the strongest possible sanctions against russia are implemented and remain in place bipartisanship i would like to take a few minutes to address how i will approach working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as chairwoman throughout my career i have looked for opportunities to build consensus and work across the aisle on commonsense solutions to benefit hardworking americans as chairwoman i will continue to find areas where we can all work together ranking member mchenry and i have a relationship and just last congress we worked together on several bills the fix crowdfunding act to boost crowdfunding and enhance investor protections and the supporting america s innovators act to make it easier for more angel investors to finance startup companies and small businesses the supporting america s innovators act became law previously we also worked together on the promoting transparent standards for corporate insiders act a bill to limit the ability of corporate insiders to illegally trade on non public information i am very pleased to announce that ranking member mchenry and i are reintroducing the promoting transparent standards for corporate insiders act together so i am very hopeful that we will be able to get some good bipartisan work done in committee some of the big issues we are going to try to work on a bipartisan basis include long term reauthorization and reform of the national flood insurance program nfip terrorism risk insurance tria and the reauthorization of the job creating export import bank and so it is a new day in congress and for the financial services committee as chairwoman i will continue to work every day to create opportunities for hardworking americans ensure fairness and protect the economic wellbeing of all americans i will also continue to hold this administration and its appointees accountable thank you again to the center for american progress for having me today
by eliana raszewski buenos aires reuters like many argentine businessmen marco meloni is doing everything he can to avoid laying off staff at his textile factory despite a slump in sales more than 70 percent interest rates and soaring utility bills the reason he doesn t have the money to fire anyone a little reported and unusual feature of the economic crisis gripping latin america s third largest economy is the absence of many workers losing their jobs small businesses the biggest employer in argentina have been hardest hit by inflation that is nearly 48 percent a tumbling peso and major cuts to subsidies for public utilities that have sharply increased companies operating costs but the unemployment rate has barely budged from 9 percent reuters interviews with business owners in textile plastic clothing and paint industries government officials and union leaders show that many firms are adopting different strategies to try to survive until the economy begins to recover which the international monetary fund expects to begin in the second quarter firms are reducing working hours halting production on some days cutting shifts and making workers take their vacations now in anticipation of more customer demand once the economy lifts the workforce contracted by just 120 000 registered workers between october 2017 and october 2018 the latest government data reviewed by reuters shows that represents about 1 percent of the 12 million strong labor force in contrast the united states lost about 6 percent or some 8 7 million people of its workforce during the two years of the 2007 08 great recession as companies laid off workers to stay afloat argentina has some of the world s most generous labor laws and they are making it more difficult for small business owners like meloni to adapt to an economy now in recession typically in a tough economic climate a company might be expected to reduce its workforce to cut costs but in argentina taking that step could dramatically increase costs and potentially push a company into bankruptcy introduced by successive populist peronist governments since the 1940s the labor laws make the country one of the most expensive in latin america to employ or fire a worker argentine companies are required to pay workers laid off a month for every year of service plus at least one additional month simply for informing them they are being fired and crucially there is no cap on how much a company needs to pay in contrast neighboring chile has a cap on severance pay layoff costs in argentina are among the highest in the world according to the world bank s doing business project which measures business regulations in 190 economies giving notice the argentine labor laws have helped to contain what could have been a big increase in the unemployment rate in addition president mauricio macri a free marketer who wants to reform the country s rigid labor system to encourage foreign investment is taking steps to dissuade companies from firing workers he announced on nov 13 that companies must give 10 days notice of any plans to lay off workers so that the government can help find ways to keep them employed macri wants to expand an existing program that helps to subsidize salaries of workers at companies that can show they are in financial straits the government has not yet issued any regulations to enforce its announcement so it is not clear whether companies are informing them of pending dismissals like many small businessmen meloni has found himself caught in a vice sales from his plant in the town of quilmes 30 km 19 miles outside the capital buenos aires shrank by just over one third last year as argentina s economy sank deep into recession it was not a storm said meloni a reference to how the country s president has described the economic crisis it was a tsunami the tsunami kills meloni said the plant which makes fabrics used to operate 24 hours a day from monday to saturday but now just operates 16 hours a day five days a week like many other businesses meloni advanced the holidays to his roughly 100 employees with the hope that once summer ends in march demand will pick up daniel funes de rioja the head of one of argentina s biggest labor law firms said a major issue for companies was the seniority of many workers many especially in low skilled industries stay in the same job for years so paying them severance becomes very expensive there s a cultural custom for argentines to remain in their jobs but also as it has been always very expensive to fire people that has extended the length of service of the workers in the companies explained economist camilo tiscornia from buenos aires based c t consultancy production minister dante sica said companies were also reluctant to fire workers because of forecasts showing an economic recovery around the corner they prefer to suspend and not fire because of the cost of layoffs plus the cost of hiring is costly sica said in an interview the unemployment rate in argentina fell to 9 percent in the third quarter from 9 6 percent in the second quarter year on year it increased only 0 7 basis points from the third quarter of 2017 when the economy was growing at an annual rate of 3 8 percent while workers are staying in their jobs they are earning less because of the shorter hours and fewer shifts some have resorted to taking second jobs working for uber the ride hailing app for example according to anecdotal reports we are not happy with these measures at all fewer shifts shorter hours but the last thing we want is layoffs said jose minaberrigaray head of setia a textile workers union that represents 25 000 workers but we have to choose what is bad and what is worse he told reuters forced vacations macri has pushed for labor reforms to make it easier for companies to hire and fire but his government has delayed implementing them after protests in december 2017 sica the production minister has said they will try again in 2019 but it will be difficult to get political support for the reforms in an election year tiscornia the economist said the difficulty in firing workers ultimately hurt the competitiveness of argentine companies making it easier to fire people or to reduce salaries improves the economy efficiency and the companies capacity to adjust to different situations he said in the u s it s tremendously easy to fire but at the same time they are at the lowest historic jobless rate because that market has very strong flexibility that favors the creation of new companies here if you start a business and it doesn t work you are stuck with the employees so you don t even try at the metallurgical company where pablo mansur 31 works production has fallen 30 percent over the last 12 months to keep busy workers are painting cleaning and doing repairs mansur said workers were also told to take their vacations in december a period when production would be low any way because of public holidays he said workers agreed to this because we are aware of the reality it is not a whim he said jorge g√∂ttert president of g√∂ttert a 75 year old company that makes production line systems for the wood and auto sectors says he has tried not to lay off workers because of his memories of what happened during the country s worst financial crisis in 2001 then the company laid off half of its staff to try to survive when the economy rebounded however it became very difficult for us as it took time to rebuild its workforce training new workers to operate the specialized machinery we think this crisis will be shorter this time 1 37 0730 argentine pesos reporting by eliana raszewski in buenos airesadditional reporting by jason lange and howard schneider in

as a long time proponent of basic income and as someone who has been involved in pilots in four continents the past year has been a roller coaster perhaps summarised as two steps forward one step back with marks for progress as six out of 10 it will take acts of courage to move forward decisively in 2019 but more doors are opening there has been a ferment of activity perhaps what has happened in canada and the united states captures the contrasting fortunes best though events in europe and elsewhere are encouraging too a highlight was the 18th international congress of bien basic income earth network in tampere finland which brought hundreds of academics and activists from around the world to discuss developments there were also several significant books and the world bank endorsed basic income as a development tool in its world development report north america the debate in canada and the usa has gone in two directions the introduction of basic income as an alternative to existing social policies paid from direct taxation and the development of capital funds with dividends the first have been implicit in pilots and demonstration projects at the outset of the year basic income pilots were underway in three communities of ontario hamilton lindsay and thunder bay covering 4 000 individuals though like most other experiments these were not tests of a full basic income they had many features of a proper basic income early reports were uniformly favourable and polls showed it was popular so much so that the conservatives contesting the provincial election said the pilots would be continued if they were elected however on taking office doug ford terminated the pilots and ordered that data collected for the evaluation be surrendered undaunted videos circulated on social media reporting on how participants had been responding there was also an unexpected postscript in december the canadian prime minister justin trudeau and the social development minister jean yves duclos said in interviews that a guaranteed national minimum income could be an option as they sought ways to support canadians to adapt to an unsteady shifting labour market duclos predicted it would come in the usa barack obama in a reflective speech in south africa mused that basic income would figure prominently in the years ahead and prominent corporate folk endorsed it again including mark zuckerberg and elon musk but mainly it was a year of positioning by potential democrat presidential candidates with contenders offering proposals with elements of basic income one andrew yang has made it his core policy proposal there was an encouraging buzz around the pronouncements of the young mayor of stockton in california who has taken a different route launching a demonstration project whereby thanks to a grant of 1 million from facebook co founder chris hughes 100 individuals from low income areas will be provided with a monthly basic income of 500 for 18 months the project was held up by the process of sending invitations to 1 000 randomly chosen individuals from which the 100 are to be selected but it should go ahead in february 2019 in chicago a large group of legislators has proposed a pilot and at the end of the year the proposal was awaiting the approval of the mayor if it takes off it will be the largest such pilot in the usa also encouraging is the pilot launched in four american cities in which 1 000 low income mothers will receive an unconditional 333 a month for 40 months from their child s birth in a project named baby s first years because the focus is on the link between basic income security and brain development in another pilot also best described as a demonstration project the magnolia mother s trust started to provide 15 low income african american women in mississippi with 1 000 a month unconditionally in december 2018 although it took place in 2017 another development that crystallised in 2018 that could become a harbinger of responses to natural and social disasters was the response by dolly parton the country music star to the wildfire devastation of her hometown of gatlinburg tennessee she put millions of dollars into my people s fund from which 1 000 per month was to be paid to about 900 families for six months so many other donations were made that this was increased to 5 000 in the final month an analysis showed that the money not only enabled people to acquire housing but led to increased work not less meanwhile leading democrats were tumbling out proposals senator cory booker introduced a bill proposing that lower income children receive 1 000 each year paid into special savings accounts with the amount rising to 2 000 if their families are poor paid by higher capital gains and estate taxes the accounts would be blocked until they reached age 18 when they would be permitted to use the money for asset building purchases this deviates from a basic income being paternalistic not trusting people with the ability to decide what was best for themselves would require costly bureaucratic monitoring and would raise the problem of weakness of will as is the case with all capital grant schemes but it reflects the realisation that the distribution system has broken down senator kamala harris put forward a bill to subsidise rent through a refundable tax credit on federal income taxes which was quickly seen as more likely to enrich landlords than give basic income security to low income tenants critics pointing out that a basic income would do more to help those tenants harris proposed the lift livable incomes for families today the middle class act offering 250 a month for singles 500 for couples phasing that out as earnings rose a drawback is that somebody earning nothing would receive nothing while somebody would need to earn at least 3 000 to receive the full benefit representative bonnie watson coleman proposed a bill designed to overcome one regressive failing of the earned income tax credit scheme that currently eats up 65 billion a year it would extend eitc benefits to family caregivers and students like tax credits elsewhere the eitc has rested on an arbitrary conceptualisation of what is work and what is not recognising that is at least a step in the direction of a basic income tax credits are regressive depressing wages and subsidising low wage employers meanwhile there have been developments around the second route to basic income around social or common dividends again there has been one setback the starting idea is that natural resources are part of the commons they belong to everybody the commoners if anybody or a corporation exploits them for commercial gain they owe a rent to the commoners this view goes back through the centuries epitomised by the thinking of philosophers such as john locke and the founding fathers of the united states such as thomas jefferson and thomas paine and through the writings of henry george and later economists this has led to renewed interest in land value tax eco taxes or levies and digital levies but the main examples in practice have been based on royalties on oil the leading scheme where royalties are channelled into a permanent capital fund from which equal dividends are paid is the alaska permanent fund set up in 1976 and paying annual dividends to every alaskan resident since 1982 this has proved remarkably popular until 2011 the value of the dividends rose steadily but successive republican governors had imprudently cut income tax to zero so when oil prices fell government debt rose leading to the most recent governor raiding the fund to pay government operating costs leading to a collapse in the annual dividends this was rightly seen as a tax hitting low income people and led to a dive in the governor s popularity and withdrawal from his re election campaign in october 2018 the revival of alaska dividends will depend on who succeeds him but the idea of capital funds is gaining ground the major development in 2018 was rising support for taxes on greenhouse gas emissions the global scientific community is unanimous that climate change is a giant threatening humanity and nature and that radical action is required to tackle it among other measures that requires big taxes or levies on c02 there are two problems taxes are unpopular and carbon tax is regressive in 2018 canada moved to confront both problems by combining a carbon tax with the promise of dividends to be paid to all under the greenhouse gas pollution pricing act starting in 2019 the carbon tax is too modest to bring down emissions substantially but the act has established a principle although the oil industry is contesting it and predictably the right wing ontario premier doug ford has called it the worst tax ever the new tax will increase gasoline prices by 42 cents a gallon 11 cents a litre or by 8 but cleverly the act is intended to be revenue neutral with all revenue returned to the provinces from which it is generated and with 90 given back to individuals as rebates the remaining 10 going to organisations affected by the tax such as schools and hospitals the rebates will mean that about 70 of canadian households will receive more back than they pay in tax this is in all but name and certainty of amount a basic income and it is progressive in november 2018 a bipartisan group in the us house of representatives introduced a bill similar to the canadian reform proposing to tax emissions and redistribute the proceeds as dividends it will be doomed as long as donald trump s fellow climate change deniers control the senate but it too offers a promising route into funding a basic income system a similar plan has been promoted by former government officials backed by major corporations such as at t p g johnson johnson gm and pepsico and financially backed by exxonmobil so in north america the idea is taking hold that revenue can be raised from commercial uses of the commons or natural resources and from commercial deductions from the commons in the form of pollution observers should note related proposals in chicago the innovative alderman ameya pawar floated a plan to public tize chicago s water system giving shares to all city residents and paying them dividends that would be a sort of basic income according to him as chicago has a lot of fresh water it should be seen as a public resource just as oil is treated in alaska finally the us debate has been accentuated by the proposal by newly elected new york representative alexandria ocasio cortez backed by at least 40 members of congress for a green new deal which includes a monthly basic income no doubt the deal will prove controversial in its original form but it surely points in the necessary direction image european social survey europe while proposals were bubbling in north america european debates became more prominent and more politicians and political parties came out in favour while us economist joseph stiglitz has dismissed basic income in the uk saying it is a cop out i do not believe it is what people want there is evidence to the contrary a populus survey in britain found that 41 supported basic income and only 17 were against the remainder saying they did not know a european wide survey covering 23 countries found strong public support across the continent the most striking development came in italy leaving basic income proponents with mixed feelings the populist party movimento cinque stelle campaigned in the general election on a platform that included what it called a basic income which proved remarkably attractive in southern italy and has been described by most analysts as the main reason for their success in becoming the largest party in parliament and now part of the government what m5s is offering is actually not a basic income but the fact that it proved so popular was further evidence that some of its critics are out of touch pilots have been spreading in 2017 there was worldwide publicity around what was purported to be a government basic income pilot in finland in mid 2018 the bbc and the guardian newspaper almost gleefully reported that it was being ended prematurely this was reported in media around the world and repeated in blogs on social media the story was wrong the original intention announced before the pilot begin in 2017 was that it would last for two years up to the end of december 2018 this is precisely what happened journalists had misinterpreted a statement by a new right wing finance minister that the pilot would not be extended because he was opposed to it the government moved towards a workfare regime requiring all unemployed to attend trimonthly interviews and increased the waiting period for receipt of unemployment benefits and the period of eligibility a utilitarian approach was in ascendancy in which a more punitive regime closer to the uk s universal credit system was being implemented which led to thousands losing entitlement to social assistance but this had nothing to do with what was happening in the basic income pilot the finnish pilot is not testing proper basic income but is a test of characteristics consistent with it it provided 560 a month to 2 000 randomly selected registered unemployed from across the country relaxing the rule that they must prove they are searching for jobs and allowing them to retain the benefit if they found one early reports from the evaluation by kela the official social insurance organisation are encouraging a report will be published in 2019 in november 2018 the opposition party left alliance announced that its manifesto for the general election scheduled for 2019 would include a commitment to a basic income of 800 a month phasing out means tested social assistance while leaving housing allowance unchanged the basic income would be taxed away from high income earners and it would be phased in by consolidating various social security benefits in the netherlands partial basic income pilots were under way in groningen tilburg utrecht and wageningen the experiments follow from legislation in 2015 that allowed local authorities to experiment with social policies initially the pilots seemed closer to workfare but local authorities have found ways to make them closer to a basic income although they suffer from being limited to welfare claimants and being provided only to randomly selected individuals not whole communities as in finland they are best described as trust experiments to see how people respond when not subject to behavioural conditionality another experiment is underway in barcelona under the name b mincome which has been running since october 2017 and is scheduled to last until late 2019 again its proponents see it as a basic income but the money is being provided on a family basis not individual it is being provided to 1 000 participant families with 500 others as a control group when launched it was stated that the main intention was to analyse the most effective way of reducing inequality and breaking the poverty cycle in switzerland much attention was stimulated by an initiative by a swiss film maker to launch a pilot in rheinau a village in the canton of zurich the idea was to induce 650 residents to volunteer to be recipients from a village population of about double that and to crowdfund a rather large basic income for one year varying the amount by age group those earning more than chf2 500 would have to repay it as their income rose as with the earlier swiss referendum the initiative suffered from putting the basic income at a high level reaching as much as chf2 500 for those aged over 25 at the end of the year the crowdfunding was short however observers seem agreed that the initiative attracted much public support in the area in germany a basic income pilot provocatively named hartzplus is set to start in may 2019 in berlin with a random sample of 250 recipients of state benefits and with another 250 as a control group with a focus on evaluating the impact on labor market behaviour health and social relations it is set to last for three years and follows crowdfunded schemes that have proven popular in germany notably mein grundeinkommen my basic income that has been running a lottery with winners obtaining a monthly basic income of 1 000 for one year meanwhile the chief executive of germany s association of towns and municipalities dstgb lamenting the over burdened bureaucratic welfare state and rising poverty came out in favour of basic income in the uk an initiative was launched in scotland where four areas fife edinburgh glasgow and north ayrshire began preparing feasibility and design plans aided by a grant of 250 000 from the scottish government and backed by a cross party group of members of the scottish parliament the green party has also come out strongly in favour of a basic income and in mid 2018 the shadow chancellor of the exchequer committed labour to proposing pilots in its next manifesto and commissioned a report by this author on why and how those should be done in sum the debate on basic income has moved into the mainstream in european policymaking probably propelled by concern over the eight giants discussed in the companion piece to this progress report among the findings of relevance to crystallise in the past year on both sides of the atlantic is that a large and growing proportion of those in income poverty are in households in which at least one person is in a job 80 in the case of the usa 60 in the uk for example but high private debt insecurity inequality precarity concern over the advancing robots and worries about populism are surely behind the growing interest basic income elsewhere towards the end of the year there was a buzz in the indian media around stories that prime minister modi might include commitment to a basic income in the bjp manifesto for the general election in april 2019 some mps have come out in favour and in several states local plans have been developed these initiatives derive in part from the successful pilots conducted in west delhi and madhya pradesh and a much cited chapter in the minister of finance s annual report in january 2017 it is widely accepted now that some sort of basic income for india is financially feasible there have been political moves in several other asian countries thus the head of the malaysian prime minister s council of eminent persons proposed that the hugely expensive subsidy system br1m should be replaced by a national fund from which dividends would be paid as monthly basic incomes in china a national network was established to promote basic income which has highlighted the success of a basic income scheme in huaidi in shijiazhuang and in south korea the youth dividend scheme launched by the mayor of seongnam city gained considerable popularity and political interest across the country the biggest pilot took off in kenya where givedirectly launched its flagship scheme this is set to last for 12 years covering 21 000 adults with monthly payments coming to about half the average income of low income households this obviously ambitious pilot is generating much interest however it will be years before evaluations of its impact will be available and one should be concerned with research fatigue what it has done is boost interest in basic income among policymakers everywhere besides the world bank s sudden conversion revealed in its world development report 2018 various imf papers have recommended basic income again reversing previous imf positions and world bank reviews of the evidence from across developing countries have refuted again arguments that cash transfers lead to more spending on private bads more dependency and less work and negative community effects while being fiscally unsustainable if only those financial bodies had not opposed those of us pushing for basic income for so many years we might be further ahead today than we are but it would be churlish not to wish them success in their advocacy in the year ahead selling basic income during 2018 discussion of the likely cost of a basic income became more informed for instance one study estimated that a 2 financial wealth tax would be sufficient to fund a 12 000 annual basic income for every us household studies in the uk suggested that by replacing many existing benefits and raising the income tax rate by 3 a decent basic income could be afforded others estimated that it could be paid from levies on wealth land value and incursions into the commons during the year it became more widely appreciated that generous personal tax exemptions in the usa and increasingly generous personal tax allowance in the uk are a perverse form of basic income an upside down income support program the rich get more than the middle class and the middle class get more than the poor as one american commentator put it this is in so much as they cost as much in public revenue as would a modest basic income but are regressive since the gain in tax free income is greater for higher income taxpayers and greater for those who have enough income to pay taxes than for those who have none what must be researched more in the year ahead are the feedback and multiplier effects basic incomes have been shown to boost work productivity and incomes which foster taxable income and lower social costs but how great are those effects all simulation models and cost estimates so far have ignored feedback effects for instance there is ample evidence that basic income security improves mental and physical health which reduces spending on health services improves productivity and reduces poverty so the net cost of a basic income would be less than the simple budgetary cost but we do not have good estimates of how much savings would result

during the december quarter as to the impact of china s economic and market conditions as the quarter progressed it became apparent that china s market softness was beginning to impact the greater lithium market highlighted by a pronounced shift in trade flows steady growth in chinese lithium product exports in the earlier months of cy18 accelerated throughout the december quarter as large chinese converters targeted the markets of japan and south korea china chile customs data japan and south korea also experienced an increased volume of imports from chile while the volume exported from chile to china decreased increased competition in the seaborne market from well established chinese suppliers began to pressure carbonate prices in the december quarter meanwhile china s spot carbonate prices remained subdued finding a floor during the quarter but failing to deliver the anticipated seasonal lift asian metals the change to china s electric vehicle ev policy early in cy18 continued to impact demand from the chinese market as the battery chain has taken longer than expected to adjust operations and build technical capabilities required to produce cathodes and batteries that qualified for higher subsidy levels additionally the lack of transparency and guidance from chinese regulators regarding future ev policy direction has contributed to cautious buying behaviour amongst customers further weighing on these market related factors are china s broader macro economic issues having a range of direct and indirect impacts on the market including lower car manufacturing industrial production and limited access to debt further upstream domestic suppliers in china were not immune to the country s economic issues as additional chinese brine supply from the qinghai region continued to be offered at reduced prices to stimulate subdued domestic demand and alleviate financial pressure on these producers the chinese government s tighter regulation on access to debt was reported to have impacted at least one conversion plants expansion plans and contributed to project delays amongst smaller new conversion plants nevertheless larger incumbent conversion plants have progressed expansion projects while growing output from existing operations supported by improved volume and quality of feedstock supply from australian hard rock orocobre views current conditions as a short term correction following three to four years of high growth that resulted in market prices reaching levels two to three times or more greater than the historical average long

visit and support the entrepreneurs and community members to evaluate the effectiveness of the program at this stage 100 of the funds have been repaid of the 24 proposed projects 18 are operational and we continue to support those that are not yet underway the first stage of training has been carried out by external consultant in group with business strategy and implementation to follow production and natural resources programs to strengthen local artisanal production were progressed during the quarter the problems of physical space for the fibre spinning project in huancar were resolved and we were able to define a location for the installation of equipment two workshops were held during november theoretical training in the spinning process emphasising the classification system of artisanal yarns taking into account thickness torsion and regularity factors monitoring the methodology of classification of artisanal threads activities for the manufacture of the equipment for the spinning plant began two spinning wheels were delivered courtesy of sdj and the commercial name and logo were also defined the first meeting with a thread buyer was conducted in december with initial delivery of merchandise agreed for late january the eco bricks pilot projects were completed during the quarter with two greenhouses completed and fruit and vegetables planted in a temperature controlled environment there is great interest from the participating communities to continue this project on a much larger scale we are now evaluating and defining the scope for future construction with all data and findings from the pilot projects being used to inform future developments health ascent of mount tuzgle during december sdj employees together with contractors and local community members undertook an ascent of the tuzgle volcano a dormant stratovolcano with an elevation of 5 486m above sea level located near the puesto sey community susques jujuy province mount tuzgle was selected as the ideal site given its cultural significance a sacred mountain with archaeological ruins at the summit and a multitude of historical tales that could be shared by residents of puesto sey as part of the day s activities in preparation for the ascent participants based at the olaroz lithium facility were encouraged to make use of the onsite gym facilities and or go for extended walks in the area to build physical fitness at altitude participants from the san salvador de jujuy office were encouraged to exercise locally and make regular trips to site and to the puna to become acclimatised to the higher altitudes the climb was a success with most participants reaching the summit all the more rewarding was the employee donation campaign which accompanied the ascent and saw school supplies donated by sdj employees presented to the local primary school in the indigenous community of puesto sey advantage lithium advantage lithium corp tsv aal manages a portfolio of high

move into the feasibility study and project execution phases phase 3 drill program the phase 3 drilling program is now completed culminating in 30 day pumping tests on main production targets in the nw sector and the se sector deep sand units the results from this will feed into an updated resource estimate which is targeted in q3 fy19 and expected to bring cauchari s resources into the measured and indicated categories on 28 november the joint venture partners released a phase 3 drilling program update regarding the completion of brine sampling of diamond core holes cau28 cau29 in the nw sector and cau19 cau22 cau25 and cau27 in the se sector of the cauchari jv property subsequent to the end of the quarter a further market updated was provided detailing the completion of the phase 3 drilling program drill sampling results at cau28 and cau29 extend the june 2018 resource area some 5 km further to the south and increase the area for the update of the nw sector resource by approximately 20 drilling at cau25 and cau27 was completed along the eastern edge of the se sector at depths of 427 and 473 m respectively and intersected a sequence with some sandy material interbedded with halite and clay units cau19 was completed in the southwest of the se sector to a depth of 519 5 m this hole intersected the deep sand unit from 434 m to 519 5 m a thickness of 85 m with sandy units continuing at the end of the hole cau19 is close to the southern boundary of the property and confirms the extension of the deep sand unit into this area pumping tests during the quarter the 30 day constant rate pumping test to simulate long term production was completed on test production well cau11 in the se sector this followed completion of a variable rate test to confirm the pumping rate for the constant rate test brine concentrations were monitored throughout the test in addition to water levels in the pumping well and a network of surrounding observation wells the 30 day constant rate pumping test has commenced on well cau07 in the nw sector brine samples are being collected at regular intervals during the test and complete analyses are expected by the end of january 2019 the tests will provide additional information on aquifer characteristics as an input to the three dimensional groundwater model that is being developed to estimate lithium reserves and to

by patrick werr khartoum reuters sudan must implement radical reforms or seek a bailout from friendly nations to pull its economy out of the downward spiral that helped trigger the nationwide protests now rocking the country economists and bankers say the government has run up enormous budget deficits by subsidising the cost of fuel bread and other products to cover this deficit it has expanded the money supply but that has served to debase the currency causing inflation to soar and the value of the sudanese pound against other currencies to plummet in turn pushing up the cost of subsidies and widening the deficit even further attempts to raise bread and fuel prices to reduce the cost of subsidies sparked protests that will soon enter their second month marking the most prolonged challenge to president omar al bashir s nearly 30 years in office the riots right now all that s going on it s just a reflection of the accumulation of the poverty and salaries being where they are and prices that keep going up said one sudanese banker who asked not to be named no one no government can sustain that the banker added bashir has blamed the unrest on external forces saying last week that sudan had been economically besieged protesters who gathered again in central khartoum on thursday say economic mismanagement and corruption in the ruling party are at fault they want a change of government the government announced an emergency 15 month austerity programme in october but it still offers deep subsidies on basic goods petrol is cheaper in sudan than almost anywhere else in the world the government sets the price at 6 17 sudanese pounds per litre just under 13 u s cents at the official exchange rate or about 10 6 cents at the black market rate diesel sells for 4 25 sudanese pounds per litre for bread the government pays private traders a 680 sudanese pound subsidy for each 150 kg 330 lb sack of flour they import one sack normally costs about 1 230 pounds one banker said the government then sets the retail price of bread at one pound per 40 grammes the last time it raised the price was in january 2018 increasing a loaf from only half a pound bankers said a move that triggered a more limited round of protests the effect of subsidies on the deficit is hard to assess clearly however since the finance ministry has yet to post the 2018 or 2019 budgets on its website much of the cost has been hidden or borne by the central bank according to imf reports central bank statistics show that m1 money supply growth rose from as low as an annual 14 3 percent in april 2016 to 88 3 percent in april 2018 before slipping back to 76 percent in august with a shortage of cash banknotes much of the increased money supply was electronic or via cheques printing press bust this is partly because the country s sole banknote printing press broke down in early 2018 leaving the central bank scrambling to order new banknotes from abroad three khartoum bankers said customers queue for hours at banks and cash machines public scandals at two separate banks compounded the problem causing a small run on banks in the second half of 2018 one banker said high inflation has led customers to empty their accounts and invest elsewhere another banker said inflation soared to nearly 70 percent in november official figures show steve hanke an expert in distressed currencies at johns hopkins university estimated the actual annual inflation rate as of jan 15 at 91 percent based on the black market exchange rate and purchasing power parity that works out at a month on month rate far below the 50 percent that defines hyperinflation but it is still worryingly high with only venezuela zimbabwe iran and argentina suffering steeper price rises said hanke they re having trouble reducing the subsidies and they can t go to the international bond market to get money hanke told reuters so they basically turn on the printing presses sudanese banks are required to follow the laws of islamic finance which bans interest limiting how much the state can raise domestically through conventional treasury bills and bonds normally countries in such dire straits would turn to the imf for support as they implement the painful steps it demands to straighten out their finances but washington lists sudan as a supporter of terrorism and has promised to veto any request for imf assistance until it complies with a series of political humanitarian and security demands over the years sudan has also built up a crippling foreign debt burden of more than 50 billion most of it in arrears including 1 3 billion owed to the imf according to a november 2017 imf report since oil prices fell from 2014 khartoum s traditional gulf arab backers have fewer resources to bail it out unless they have some sort of outside finance it would be near suicide for the government to remove subsidies said a third banker they need a radical reform programme editing by aidan lewis and hugh lawson

chen fengying r former director of the world economy institute at the china institutes of contemporary international relations speaks at a press salon held by the all china journalists association on jan 15 2019 the world economy muddled through 2018 amid harrowing uncertainties caused by rising protectionism a gradual tightening of global financial conditions and mounting trade tensions among major economies where is it heading in 2019 despite persistent complexities the global economy is expected to continue its expansion with certainty but at a slower pace said chen fengying former director of the world economy institute at the china institutes of contemporary international relations speaking at a press salon held by the all china journalists association on tuesday continued but slower growth chen said that although the world bank warned of darkening skies for the world economy in its newly released global economic prospects report its forecast of expansion at 2 9 percent is still above the average annual growth rate of about 2 5 percent in the past 40 to 60 years the chinese researcher said she was sure of continued global growth but also a slowdown which will be mainly attributable to the united states and china the possibility of weaker economic circumstances in the world s two largest economies spell increasing downward pressure for global growth chen said chen also said that the waning impact of u s tax cuts promises the country s economic slowdown after a strong performance in 2018 with its gross domestic product gdp growth hitting 3 percent according to federal reserve statistics in december the central bank s policy setting board lowered its estimate for u s gdp in 2019 to 2 3 percent growth down from a september projection of 2 5 percent the deceleration of china s economic growth is also unavoidable due to the country s determined efforts to deleverage cut overcapacity and reduce excess inventory chen said adding that the quality and sustainability of its development are being improved greater certainty and stability chen forecast that the global economic situation will be more stable and predictable this year than in 2018 thanks to the temporary trade truce between the u s and china as well as fewer rate hikes by the fed she further said that the restart of sino u s trade negotiations plus a return to rationality and sincerity on the part of the resolve of the two leaders is expected to raise global economic certainty after its latest monetary policy meeting in december the fed raised the federal funds rate to the 2 25 to 2 5 percent range adding that this was much closer to a neutral interest rate that will neither boost nor cool the economy the fed raised the federal funds rate four times in 2018 and lowered its projections on the number of rate hikes in 2019 from 3 to 2 during the latest rate hike announcement chen said that a steady u s dollar index will help calm the turmoil in emerging markets whose currencies took a hit in 2018 due to a robust greenback new round of globalization chen said that despite new forms of backlash globalization continued to gather momentum during the past year the deal to upgrade the north american free trade agreement nafta the success of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp and the acceleration of the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep negotiation all heralded a new round of globalization she said according to chen the reforms of the world trade organization wto should be put at the top of the world s economic agenda for 2019 she noted that globalization is irreversible and the wto dispute settlement regime which is at risk of paralysis needs immediate amendment to uphold the rules based multilateral trading system

lithium market while 2018 marked another year of healthy growth for the lithium market averaging 20 growth year on year concerns grew during the december quarter as to the impact of china s economic and market conditions as the quarter progressed it became apparent that china s market softness was beginning to impact the greater lithium market highlighted by a pronounced shift in trade flows steady growth in chinese lithium product exports in the earlier months of cy18 accelerated throughout the december quarter as large chinese converters targeted the markets of japan and south korea china chile customs data japan and south korea also experienced an increased volume of imports from chile while the volume exported from chile to china decreased increased competition in the seaborne market from well established chinese suppliers began to pressure carbonate prices in the december quarter meanwhile china s spot carbonate prices remained subdued finding a floor during the quarter but failing to deliver the anticipated seasonal lift asian metals the change to china s electric vehicle ev policy early in cy18 continued to impact demand from the chinese market as the battery chain has taken longer than expected to adjust operations and build technical capabilities required to produce cathodes and batteries that qualified for higher subsidy levels additionally the lack of transparency and guidance from chinese regulators regarding future ev policy direction has contributed to cautious buying behaviour amongst customers further weighing on these market related factors are china s broader macro economic issues having a range of direct and indirect impacts on the market including lower car manufacturing industrial production and limited access to debt further upstream domestic suppliers in china were not immune to the country s economic issues as additional chinese brine supply from the qinghai region continued to be offered at reduced prices to stimulate subdued domestic demand and alleviate financial pressure on these producers the chinese government s tighter regulation on access to debt was reported to have impacted at least one conversion plants expansion plans and contributed to project delays amongst smaller new conversion plants nevertheless larger incumbent conversion plants have progressed expansion projects while growing output from existing operations supported by improved volume and quality of feedstock supply from australian hard rock orocobre views current conditions as a short term correction following three to four years of high growth that resulted in market prices reaching levels two to three times or more greater than the historical average long term fundamentals remain strong and are underpinned by battery manufacturer s plans with 68 lithium ion mega factories currently in the pipeline delivering 1 450 gwh capacity and a potential 22 million ev s by 2028 benchmark minerals furthermore strong growth potential was exhibited by the energy storage sector with total global energy storage additions more than doubling during 2018 to 9 gwh and is forecast to grow 80 in 2019 bloomberg new energy finance

the peso and the pre and post presidential election in brazil following the renegotiation of the agreement with the international monetary fund imf the ar us exchange rate has stabilised interest rates in argentina are currently high which is a deterrent for business to borrow to fund expansion therefore market growth in argentina has slowed brazil recently october 28 2018 elected a new

underway the first stage of training has been carried out by external consultant in group with business strategy and implementation to follow production and natural resources programs to strengthen local artisanal production were progressed during the quarter the problems of physical space for the fibre spinning project in huancar were resolved and we were able to define a location for the installation of equipment two workshops were held during november the eco bricks pilot projects were completed during the quarter with two greenhouses completed and fruit and vegetables planted in a temperature controlled environment there is great interest from the participating communities to continue this project on a much larger scale we are now evaluating and defining the scope for future construction with all data and findings from the pilot projects being used to inform future developments health ascent of mount tuzgleduring december sdj employees together with contractors and local community members undertook an ascent of the tuzgle volcano a dormant stratovolcano with an elevation of 5 486m above sea level located near the puesto sey community susques jujuy province mount tuzgle was selected as the ideal site given its cultural significance a sacred mountain with archaeological ruins at the summit and a multitude of historical tales that could be shared by residents of puesto sey as part of the day s activities in preparation for the ascent participants based at the olaroz lithium facility were encouraged to make use of the onsite gym facilities and or go for extended walks in the area to build physical fitness at altitude participants from the san salvador de jujuy office were encouraged to exercise locally and make regular trips to site and to the puna to become acclimatised to the higher altitudes the climb was a success with most participants reaching the summit all the more rewarding was the employee donation campaign which accompanied the ascent

evaporation rates inventory build in harvest ponds continued with the construction of more harvest and evaporation ponds which will support production through lower evaporation rate periods during winter salt harvesting from harvestable ponds the final eight ponds in the system continued during the december quarter five of the eight harvest ponds have now been cleared of harvestable salts two are being harvested and one will be completed next winter the construction of additional pond area negated any potential negative impact from the salt harvesting the harvesting process occurs approximately every three years and involves the removal of the majority of salt which has precipitated through the evaporation process carbon dioxide recovery carbon dioxide is used at the olaroz lithium facility in the production of battery grade lithium carbonate it is currently sourced from near buenos aires cordoba and mendoza transported up to 1 800 kilometres by truck making it a significant component of total reagent costs a carbon dioxide recovery circuit built by asco has now been installed and successfully commissioned total co 2 recovery is estimated at 55 above initial

plant remain at approximately us 1 500 tonne market and sales lithium market while 2018 marked another year of healthy growth for the lithium market averaging 20 growth year on year concerns grew during the december quarter as to the impact of china s economic and market conditions as the quarter progressed it became apparent that china s market softness was beginning to impact the greater lithium market highlighted by a pronounced shift in trade flows steady growth in chinese lithium product exports in the earlier months of cy18 accelerated throughout the december quarter as large chinese converters targeted the markets of japan and south korea china chile customs data japan and south korea also experienced an increased volume of imports from chile while the volume exported from chile to china decreased increased competition in the seaborne market from well established chinese suppliers began to pressure carbonate prices in the december quarter meanwhile china s spot carbonate prices remained subdued finding a floor during the quarter but failing to deliver the anticipated seasonal lift asian metals the change to china s electric vehicle ev policy early in cy18 continued to impact demand from the chinese market as the battery chain has taken longer than expected to adjust operations and build technical capabilities required to produce cathodes and batteries that qualified for higher subsidy levels additionally the lack of transparency and guidance from chinese regulators regarding future ev policy direction has contributed to cautious buying behaviour amongst customers further weighing on these market related factors are china s broader macro economic issues having a range of direct and indirect impacts on the market including lower car manufacturing industrial production and limited access to debt further upstream domestic suppliers in china were not immune to the country s economic issues as additional chinese brine supply from the qinghai region continued to be offered at reduced prices to stimulate subdued domestic demand and alleviate financial pressure on these producers the chinese government s tighter regulation on access to debt was reported to have impacted at least one conversion plants expansion plans and contributed to project delays amongst smaller new conversion plants nevertheless larger incumbent conversion plants have progressed expansion projects while growing output from existing operations supported by improved volume and quality of feedstock supply from australian hard rock orocobre views current conditions as a short term correction following three to four years of high growth that resulted in market prices reaching levels two to three times or more greater than the historical average long term fundamentals remain strong and are underpinned by battery manufacturer s plans with 68 lithium ion mega factories currently in the pipeline delivering 1 450 gwh capacity and a potential 22 million ev s by 2028 benchmark minerals furthermore strong growth potential was exhibited by the energy storage sector with total global energy storage additions more than doubling during 2018 to 9

engagement initiatives continued across the focus areas of the company s shared value program meetings have been held with the commissions of eight communities to collaboratively determine specific development projects to be carried out in the coming year such projects include improvements to educational facilities community halls and sporting facilities and the delivery of various manufacturing workshops education classes have continued with 27 students undertaking courses in technology ethics and citizenship language biology history and geography during the quarter we were proud to see five students complete their secondary studies and final exams in november during the december quarter specialist welders were recruited for specific work on the olaroz music hall by the end of the quarter the entire structure was 100 complete transparency initiatives through the december quarter largely focused on the biennial update of sdj s environmental impact assessment eia four workshops were held in october in which 40 residents and 20 students of the olaroz school participated the first workshop was held with members of the local commission for indigenous peoples the second and third engaged the general public with the fourth being open to community members residing in close proximity to our operations the official presentation for community consultation was conducted mid december in addition to the eia workshops meetings were held with the commission for olaroz to discuss topics of interest to olaroz contractor companies working in the expansion and to reach agreements and define commitments moving forward workshops were also held in the primary and secondary schools of the olaroz and coranzuli communities to demonstrate sdj s lithium production process via a 3d video presentation which is available on the orocobre website click to view the presentation empowerment programs continued through the quarter with our microcredit program nearing the end of its 12 month term we continued to visit and support the entrepreneurs and community members to evaluate the effectiveness of the program at this stage 100 of the funds have been repaid of the 24 proposed projects 18 are operational and we continue to support those that are not yet underway the first stage of training has been carried out by external consultant in group with business strategy and implementation to follow production and natural resources programs to strengthen local artisanal production were progressed during the quarter the problems of physical space for the fibre spinning project in huancar were resolved and we were able to define a location for the installation of equipment two workshops were held during november theoretical training in the spinning process emphasising the classification system of artisanal yarns taking into account thickness torsion and regularity factors monitoring the methodology of classification of artisanal threads activities for the manufacture of the equipment for the spinning plant began two spinning wheels were delivered courtesy of sdj and the commercial name and logo were also defined the first meeting with a thread buyer was conducted in december with initial delivery of merchandise agreed for late january the eco bricks pilot projects were completed during the quarter with two greenhouses completed and fruit and vegetables planted in a temperature controlled environment there is great interest from the participating communities to continue this project on a much larger scale we are now evaluating and defining the scope for future construction with all data and findings from the pilot projects being used to inform future developments health ascent of mount tuzgle during december sdj employees together with contractors and local community members undertook an ascent of the tuzgle volcano a dormant stratovolcano with an elevation of 5 486m above sea level located near the puesto sey community susques jujuy province mount tuzgle was selected as the ideal site given its cultural significance a sacred mountain with archaeological ruins at the summit and a multitude of historical tales that could be shared by residents of puesto sey as part of the day s activities in preparation for the ascent participants based at the olaroz lithium facility were encouraged to make use of the onsite gym facilities and or go for extended walks in the area to build physical fitness at altitude participants from the san salvador de jujuy office were encouraged to exercise locally and make regular trips to site and to the puna to become acclimatised to the higher altitudes the climb was a success with most participants reaching the summit all the more rewarding was the employee donation campaign which accompanied the ascent and saw school supplies donated by sdj employees presented to the local primary school in the indigenous community of puesto sey advantage lithium advantage lithium corp aal manages a portfolio

project milestones as they move into the feasibility study and project execution phases phase 3 drill program the phase 3 drilling program is now completed culminating in 30 day pumping tests on main production targets in the nw sector and the se sector deep sand units the results from this will feed into an updated resource estimate which is targeted in q3 fy19 and expected to bring cauchari s resources into the measured and indicated categories on 28 november the joint venture partners released a phase 3 drilling program update regarding the completion of brine sampling of diamond core holes cau28 cau29 in the nw sector and cau19 cau22 cau25 and cau27 in the se sector of the cauchari jv property subsequent to the end of the quarter a further market updated was provided detailing the completion of the phase 3 drilling program drill sampling results at cau28 and cau29 extend the june 2018 resource area some 5 km further to the south and increase the area for the update of the nw sector resource by approximately 20 drilling at cau25 and cau27 was completed along the eastern edge of the se sector at depths of 427 and 473 m respectively and intersected a sequence with some sandy material interbedded with halite and clay units cau19 was completed in the southwest of the se sector to a depth of 519 5 m this hole intersected the deep sand unit from 434 m to 519 5 m a thickness of 85 m with sandy units continuing at the end of the hole cau19 is close to the southern boundary of the property and confirms the extension of the deep sand unit into this area pumping tests during the quarter the 30 day constant rate pumping test to simulate long term production was completed on test production well cau11 in the se sector this followed completion of a variable rate test to confirm the pumping rate for the constant rate test brine concentrations were monitored throughout the test in addition to water levels in the pumping well and a network of surrounding observation wells the 30 day constant rate pumping test has commenced on well cau07 in the nw sector brine samples are being collected at regular intervals during the test and complete analyses are expected by the end of january 2019 the tests will provide additional information on aquifer characteristics as an input to the three dimensional groundwater model that is being developed to estimate lithium reserves and to develop a production schedule for the project corporate and administration finance vat vat refunds of approximately us 0 6 million were received during the quarter approximately us 2 1 million of returns were lodged and are expected to be received next quarter cash balance as at 31 december 2018 orocobre corporate had available cash of us 284 million the us 24 7 million cash

the quarter with government intervention on interest rates and other measures at 30 september 2018 the rate was ar 41 25 us and this strengthened to ar 37 70 at 31 december 2018 whilst inflation for the same period was 16 when looking at the accumulated 12 month period from 1 january 2018 to 31 december 2018 devaluation of the ar against the us was 102 versus inflation of approximately 49 this resulted in balancing us costs for ars peso denominated expenses for the period considering the delayed response in devaluation vs inflation over the preceding year as a result costs were lower for

by reuters by patrick werr khartoum reuters sudan must implement radical reforms or seek a bailout from friendly nations to pull its economy out of the downward spiral that helped trigger the nationwide protests now rocking the country economists and bankers say the government has run up enormous budget deficits by subsidising the cost of fuel bread and other products to cover this deficit it has expanded the money supply but that has served to debase the currency causing inflation to soar and the value of the sudanese pound against other currencies to plummet in turn pushing up the cost of subsidies and widening the deficit even further attempts to raise bread and fuel prices to reduce the cost of subsidies sparked protests that will soon enter their second month marking the most prolonged challenge to president omar al bashir s nearly 30 years in office the riots right now all that s going on it s just a reflection of the accumulation of the poverty and salaries being where they are and prices that keep going up said one sudanese banker who asked not to be named no one no government can sustain that the banker added bashir has blamed the unrest on external forces saying last week that sudan had been economically besieged protesters who gathered again in central khartoum on thursday say economic mismanagement and corruption in the ruling party are at fault they want a change of government the government announced an emergency 15 month austerity programme in october but it still offers deep subsidies on basic goods petrol is cheaper in sudan than almost anywhere else in the world the government sets the price at 6 17 sudanese pounds per litre just under 13 u s cents 10p at the official exchange rate or about 10 6 cents at the black market rate diesel sells for 4 25 sudanese pounds per litre for bread the government pays private traders a 680 sudanese pound subsidy for each 150 kg 330 lb sack of flour they import one sack normally costs about 1 230 pounds one banker said the government then sets the retail price of bread at one pound per 40 grammes the last time it raised the price was in january 2018 increasing a loaf from only half a pound bankers said a move that triggered a more limited round of protests the effect of subsidies on the deficit is hard to assess clearly however since the finance ministry has yet to post the 2018 or 2019 budgets on its website much of the cost has been hidden or borne by the central bank according to imf reports central bank statistics show that m1 money supply growth rose from as low as an annual 14 3 percent in april 2016 to 88 3 percent in april 2018 before slipping back to 76 percent in august graphic sudan money supply png advertisement with a shortage of cash banknotes much of the increased money supply was electronic or via cheques printing press bust this is partly because the country s sole banknote printing press broke down in early 2018 leaving the central bank scrambling to order new banknotes from abroad three khartoum bankers said customers queue for hours at banks and cash machines public scandals at two separate banks compounded the problem causing a small run on banks in the second half of 2018 one banker said advertisement high inflation has led customers to empty their accounts and invest elsewhere another banker said inflation soared to nearly 70 percent in november official figures show steve hanke an expert in distressed currencies at johns hopkins university estimated the actual annual inflation rate as of jan 15 at 91 percent based on the black market exchange rate and purchasing power parity that works out at a month on month rate far below the 50 percent that defines hyperinflation but it is still worryingly high with only venezuela zimbabwe iran and argentina suffering steeper price rises said hanke they re having trouble reducing the subsidies and they can t go to the international bond market to get money hanke told reuters so they basically turn on the printing presses advertisement sudanese banks are required to follow the laws of islamic finance which bans interest limiting how much the state can raise domestically through conventional treasury bills and bonds normally countries in such dire straits would turn to the imf for support as they implement the painful steps it demands to straighten out their finances but washington lists sudan as a supporter of terrorism and has promised to veto any request for imf assistance until it complies with a series of political humanitarian and security demands over the years sudan has also built up a crippling foreign debt burden of more than 50 billion most of it in arrears including 1 3 billion owed to the imf according to a november 2017 imf report since oil prices fell from 2014 khartoum s traditional gulf arab backers have fewer resources to bail it out advertisement unless they have some sort of outside finance it would be near suicide for the government to remove subsidies said a third banker they need a radical reform programme editing by aidan lewis and hugh lawson
by patrick werr khartoum reuters sudan must implement radical reforms or seek a bailout from friendly nations to pull its economy out of the downward spiral that helped trigger the nationwide protests now rocking the country economists and bankers say the government has run up enormous budget deficits by subsidising the cost of fuel bread and other products to cover this deficit it has expanded the money supply but that has served to debase the currency causing inflation to soar and the value of the sudanese pound against other currencies to plummet in turn pushing up the cost of subsidies and widening the deficit even further attempts to raise bread and fuel prices to reduce the cost of subsidies sparked protests that will soon enter their second month marking the most prolonged challenge to president omar al bashir s nearly 30 years in office the riots right now all that s going on it s just a reflection of the accumulation of the poverty and salaries being where they are and prices that keep going up said one sudanese banker who asked not to be named no one no government can sustain that the banker added bashir has blamed the unrest on external forces saying last week that sudan had been economically besieged protesters who gathered again in central khartoum on thursday say economic mismanagement and corruption in the ruling party are at fault they want a change of government the government announced an emergency 15 month austerity programme in october but it still offers deep subsidies on basic goods petrol is cheaper in sudan than almost anywhere else in the world the government sets the price at 6 17 sudanese pounds per litre just under 13 u s cents at the official exchange rate or about 10 6 cents at the black market rate diesel sells for 4 25 sudanese pounds per litre for bread the government pays private traders a 680 sudanese pound subsidy for each 150 kg 330 lb sack of flour they import one sack normally costs about 1 230 pounds one banker said the government then sets the retail price of bread at one pound per 40 grammes the last time it raised the price was in january 2018 increasing a loaf from only half a pound bankers said a move that triggered a more limited round of protests the effect of subsidies on the deficit is hard to assess clearly however since the finance ministry has yet to post the 2018 or 2019 budgets on its website much of the cost has been hidden or borne by the central bank according to imf reports central bank statistics show that m1 money supply growth rose from as low as an annual 14 3 percent in april 2016 to 88 3 percent in april 2018 before slipping back to 76 percent in august graphic sudan money supply with a shortage of cash banknotes much of the increased money supply was electronic or via cheques printing press bust this is partly because the country s sole banknote printing press broke down in early 2018 leaving the central bank scrambling to order new banknotes from abroad three khartoum bankers said customers queue for hours at banks and cash machines public scandals at two separate banks compounded the problem causing a small run on banks in the second half of 2018 one banker said high inflation has led customers to empty their accounts and invest elsewhere another banker said inflation soared to nearly 70 percent in november official figures show steve hanke an expert in distressed currencies at johns hopkins university estimated the actual annual inflation rate as of jan 15 at 91 percent based on the black market exchange rate and purchasing power parity that works out at a month on month rate far below the 50 percent that defines hyperinflation but it is still worryingly high with only venezuela zimbabwe iran and argentina suffering steeper price rises said hanke they re having trouble reducing the subsidies and they can t go to the international bond market to get money hanke told reuters so they basically turn on the printing presses sudanese banks are required to follow the laws of islamic finance which bans interest limiting how much the state can raise domestically through conventional treasury bills and bonds normally countries in such dire straits would turn to the imf for support as they implement the painful steps it demands to straighten out their finances but washington lists sudan as a supporter of terrorism and has promised to veto any request for imf assistance until it complies with a series of political humanitarian and security demands over the years sudan has also built up a crippling foreign debt burden of more than 50 billion most of it in arrears including 1 3 billion owed to the imf according to a november 2017 imf report since oil prices fell from 2014 khartoum s traditional gulf arab backers have fewer resources to bail it out unless they have some sort of outside finance it would be near suicide for the government to remove subsidies said a third banker they need a radical reform programme

exchange rate impacts constant currency revenue less repair payments in the fiscal third quarter grew 9 1 versus q3 of last year and 0 1 sequentially year over year fiscal q3 revenue improvement was driven by healthy organic growth across key verticals services and geographies which more than offset headwinds from currency movements and hedging losses sequentially organic revenue growth was largely offset by seasonality in our travel business operating margin in the third quarter was 16 7 as compared to 13 6 in q3 of last year and 14 5 in the previous quarter on a year over year basis margin improvement was the result of increased productivity favorable currency movements net of hedging and operating leverage on higher volumes these benefits more than offset the impact of our annual wage increases sequentially margins improved due to increased productivity and favorable currency movements net of hedging third quarter adjusted operating margin was 23 0 versus 19 9 in q3 of last year and 21 0 last quarter explanations for the adjusted operating margin movements on a year over year and sequential basis are largely the same as described for gaap operating margins above

million as compared to q3 of last year and up 4 3 million from the previous quarter in addition to the operating margin favorability noted previously year over year profit and ani were further

for tax adjustments associated with the 2017 us tax reform bill the amount was finalized in the third quarter of this fiscal year and resulted in an additional favorable tax adjustment of 0 4 million sequentially profit and ani improved as a result of operating margin favorability higher interest income and a lower effective tax rate resulting from the 0 4 million favorable tax adjustment

measures the financial information in this release includes certain non gaap financial measures that we believe more accurately reflect our core operating performance reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to our gaap operating results are included below a more detailed discussion of our gaap results is contained in part i item 5 operating and financial review and prospects in our annual report on form 20 f filed with the sec on may 16 2018 for financial statement reporting purposes wns has two reportable segments wns global bpm and wns auto claims bpm revenue less repair payments is a non gaap financial measure that is calculated as a revenue less b in the auto claims business payments to repair centers for fault repair cases where wns acts as the principal in its dealings with the third party repair centers and its clients wns believes that revenue less repair payments for fault repairs reflects more accurately the value addition of the business process management services that it directly provides to its clients for more details please see the discussion in part i item 5 operating and financial review and prospects overview in our annual report on form 20 f filed with the sec on may 16 2018 constant currency revenue less repair payments is a non gaap financial measure we present constant currency revenue less repair payments so that revenue less repair payments may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of business performance constant currency revenue less repair payments is presented by recalculating prior period s revenue less repair payments denominated in currencies other than in us dollars using the foreign exchange rate used for the latest period without taking into account the impact of hedging gains losses our non us dollar denominated revenues include but are not limited to revenues denominated in pound sterling south african rand australian dollar and euro wns also presents 1 adjusted operating margin which refers to adjusted operating profit calculated as operating profit loss excluding share based expense and amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenue less repair payments and 2 ani which is calculated as profit excluding share based expense and amortization of intangible assets and including the tax effect thereon and other non gaap financial measures included in this release as supplemental measures of its performance wns presents these non gaap financial measures because it believes they assist investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are non recurring in nature and those it believes are not indicative of its core operating performance in addition it uses these non gaap financial measures i as a factor in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation and ii to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies these non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for wns s financial results prepared in accordance with ifrs the company is not able to provide our forward looking gaap revenue profit and earnings per ads without unreasonable efforts for a number of reasons including our inability to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the payments to repair centers our future share based compensation expense under ifrs 2 share based payments amortization of intangibles associated with future acquisitions and currency fluctuations as a result any attempt to provide a reconciliation of the forward looking gaap financial measures revenue profit earnings per ads to our forward looking non gaap financial measures revenue less repair payments ani and adjusted diluted earnings per ads respectively would imply a degree of likelihood that we do not believe is reasonable reconciliation of revenue gaap to revenue

are orocobre 66 5 ttc 25 0 and jemse 8 5 production sales and operational update production and sales production for the december quarter was the second highest achieved to date at 3 782 tonnes up 65 from 2 293 tonnes in the september quarter when compared to the same period in 2017 production is down 4 however this is principally due to restraining production to build up brine depths in the last three ponds in the system that provide feedstock to the plant this will reduce exposure to rain events during the summer period sales were 3 019 tonnes of lithium carbonate with a realised average price of us 10 587 tonne on a fob basis and total sales revenue of us 32 million operating costs on a cost of goods sold basis excluding export tax were us 3 974 tonne down 14 qoq and marginally higher than the december 2017 quarter costs were positively impacted with lower consumption rates of reagents and increased production rates which more than offset an increase in ars denominated costs as the peso strengthened during the quarter december quarter product pricing was below that of the september quarter due to soft market conditions in china having a direct impact on shorter term contracts in china including lithium hydroxide manufacturers there was also an indirect impact due to a number of customers outside china with downstream exposure to the chinese market experiencing market commercial pressure under new joint marketing arrangements between ttc and orocobre it is intended to increase the proportion of long term contract arrangements market development activities in 2019 will focus on the supply to additional battery customers and high value industrial markets with the objective of minimising sales to lithium hydroxide manufacturers gross cash margins excluding

inventory build in harvest ponds continued with the construction of more harvest and evaporation ponds which will support production through lower evaporation rate periods during winter salt harvesting from harvestable ponds the final eight ponds in the system continued during the december quarter five of the eight harvest ponds have now been cleared of harvestable salts two are being harvested and one will be completed next winter the construction of additional pond area negated any potential negative impact from the salt harvesting the harvesting process occurs approximately every three years and involves the removal of the majority of salt which has precipitated through the evaporation process carbon dioxide recovery carbon dioxide is used at the olaroz lithium facility in the production of battery grade lithium carbonate it is currently sourced from near buenos aires cordoba and mendoza transported up to 1 800 kilometres by truck making it a significant component of

plant remain at approximately us 1 500 tonne market and sales lithium market while 2018 marked another year of healthy growth for the lithium market averaging 20 growth year on year concerns grew during the december quarter as to the impact of china s economic and market conditions as the quarter progressed it became apparent that china s market softness was beginning to impact the greater lithium market highlighted by a pronounced shift in trade flows steady growth in chinese lithium product exports in the earlier months of cy18 accelerated throughout the december quarter as large chinese converters targeted the markets of japan and south korea china chile customs data japan and south korea also experienced an increased volume of imports from chile while the volume exported from chile to china decreased increased competition in the seaborne market from well established chinese suppliers began to pressure carbonate prices in the december quarter meanwhile china s spot carbonate prices remained subdued finding a floor during the quarter but failing to deliver the anticipated seasonal lift asian metals the change to china s electric vehicle ev policy early in cy18 continued to impact demand from the chinese market as the battery chain has taken longer than expected to adjust operations and build technical capabilities required to produce cathodes and batteries that qualified for higher subsidy levels additionally the lack of transparency and guidance from chinese regulators regarding future ev policy direction has contributed to cautious buying behaviour amongst customers further weighing on these market related factors are china s broader macro economic issues having a range of direct and indirect impacts on the market including lower car manufacturing industrial production and limited access to debt further upstream domestic suppliers in china were not immune to the country s economic issues as additional chinese brine supply from the qinghai region continued to be offered at reduced prices to stimulate subdued domestic demand and alleviate financial pressure on these producers the chinese government s tighter regulation on access to debt was reported to have impacted at least one conversion plants expansion plans and contributed to project delays amongst smaller new conversion plants nevertheless larger incumbent conversion plants have progressed expansion projects while growing output from existing operations supported by improved volume and quality of feedstock supply from australian hard rock orocobre views current conditions as a short term correction following three to four years of high growth that resulted in market prices reaching levels two to three times or more greater than the historical average long term fundamentals remain strong and are underpinned by battery manufacturer s plans with 68 lithium ion mega factories currently in the pipeline delivering 1 450 gwh capacity and a potential 22 million ev s by 2028 benchmark minerals furthermore strong growth potential was exhibited by the energy storage sector with total global energy storage additions more than doubling during 2018 to 9 gwh and is forecast to grow 80 in 2019 bloomberg new energy finance accordingly orocobre maintains long term demand forecasts in line with the consensus of incumbent producers in the range of 18 to 20 cagr between 2018 and 2025 borax argentina borax argentina s a borax argentina continues to demonstrate improved year on year sales performance business development projects are being progressed and will remain a key area of focus in 2019 the business has demonstrated continuous improvement on cost reduction and unit costs continue to be controlled at or near record lows despite recent strengthening of the peso unit costs have benefited from devaluation of the peso over 2018 operations during the december quarter the boric acid plant achieved record production levels while overall operations continue to improve with careful management of costs a number of sales scheduled for december were postponed to 2019 due to credit control restrictions requiring some customers to make advance payments combined product sales volume by quarter previous year quarters recent quarters march 2017 9 672 march 2018 9 079 june 2017 11 398 june 2018 10 590 september 2017 8 543 september 2018

have been received for a new gas pipeline to supply the expanded plant and initial cost estimates are under review market conditions during the december quarter market conditions remain unchanged with some volatility in argentina due to the devaluation of the peso and the pre and post presidential election in brazil following the renegotiation of the agreement with the international monetary fund imf the ar us exchange rate has stabilised interest rates in argentina are currently high which is a deterrent for business to borrow to fund expansion therefore market growth in argentina has slowed brazil recently october 28 2018 elected a new president jair bolsonaro for a four year term the outlook for the brazil economy is that growth will gain momentum in 2019 supported by improvements in the labour market recovering credit and greater policy certainty as the new administration takes office will buttress the recovery1 oecd figures for september quarter deliveries of fertilizer in brazil indicate a recovery from the problems caused by the truck drivers strike the uncertainty surrounding the impact on freight costs as a result of the strike had a negative impact on the market market prices continue to remain in the trough of the price cycle so the focus continues to be on optimising the product mix to improve profitability deliver new products develop markets and customers and further expansion of sound value propositions for customers 1 source organisation for economic co operation and development oecd safety and community safety milestones unfortunately an incident

continued across the focus areas of the company s shared value program meetings have been held with the commissions of eight communities to collaboratively determine specific development projects to be carried out in the coming year such projects include improvements to educational facilities community halls and sporting facilities and the delivery of various manufacturing workshops education classes have continued with 27 students undertaking courses in technology ethics and citizenship language biology history and geography during the quarter we were proud to see five students complete their secondary studies and final exams in november during the december quarter specialist welders were recruited for specific work on the olaroz music hall by the end of the quarter the entire structure was 100 complete transparency initiatives through the december quarter largely focused on the biennial update of sdj s environmental impact assessment eia four workshops were held in october in which 40 residents and 20 students of the olaroz school participated the first workshop was held with members of the local commission for indigenous peoples the second and third engaged the general public with the fourth being open to community members residing in close proximity to our operations the official presentation for community consultation was conducted mid december in addition to the eia workshops meetings were held with the commission for olaroz to discuss topics of interest to olaroz contractor companies working in the expansion and to reach agreements and define commitments moving forward workshops were also held in the primary and secondary schools of the olaroz and coranzuli communities to demonstrate sdj s lithium production process via a 3d video presentation which is available on the orocobre website click to view the presentation empowerment programs continued through the quarter with our microcredit program nearing the end of its 12 month term we continued to visit and support the entrepreneurs and community members to evaluate the effectiveness of the program at this stage 100 of the funds have been repaid of the 24 proposed projects 18 are operational and we continue to support those that are not yet underway the first stage of training has been carried out by external consultant in group with business strategy and implementation to follow production and natural resources programs to strengthen local artisanal production were progressed during the quarter the problems of physical space for the fibre spinning project in huancar were resolved and we were able to define a location for the installation of equipment two workshops were held during november theoretical training in the spinning process emphasising the classification system of artisanal yarns taking into account thickness torsion and regularity factors monitoring the methodology of classification of artisanal threads activities for the manufacture of the equipment for the spinning plant began two spinning wheels were delivered courtesy of sdj and the commercial name and logo were also defined the first meeting with a thread buyer was conducted in december with initial delivery of merchandise agreed for late january the eco bricks pilot projects were completed during the quarter with two greenhouses completed and fruit and vegetables planted in a temperature controlled environment there is great interest from the participating communities to continue this project on a much larger scale we are now evaluating and defining the scope for future construction with all data and findings from the pilot projects being used to inform future developments health ascent of mount tuzgle during december sdj employees together with contractors and local community members undertook an ascent of the tuzgle volcano a dormant stratovolcano with an elevation of 5 486m above sea level located near the puesto sey community susques jujuy province mount tuzgle was selected as the ideal site given its cultural significance a sacred mountain with archaeological ruins at the summit and a multitude of historical tales that could be shared by residents of puesto sey as part of the day s activities in preparation for the ascent participants based at the olaroz lithium facility were encouraged to make use of the onsite gym facilities and or go for extended walks in the area to build physical fitness at altitude participants from the san salvador de jujuy office were encouraged to exercise locally and make regular trips to site and to the puna to become acclimatised to the higher altitudes the climb was a success with most participants reaching the summit all the more rewarding was the employee donation campaign which accompanied the ascent and saw school supplies donated by sdj employees presented to the local primary school in the indigenous community of puesto sey advantage lithium advantage lithium corp tsv aal manages a portfolio of high

move into the feasibility study and project execution phases phase 3 drill program the phase 3 drilling program is now completed culminating in 30 day pumping tests on main production targets in the nw sector and the se sector deep sand units the results from this will feed into an updated resource estimate which is targeted in q3 fy19 and expected to bring cauchari s resources into the measured and indicated categories on 28 november the joint venture partners released a phase 3 drilling program update regarding the completion of brine sampling of diamond core holes cau28 cau29 in the nw sector and cau19 cau22 cau25 and cau27 in the se sector of the cauchari jv property subsequent to the end of the quarter a further market updated was provided detailing the completion of the phase 3 drilling program drill sampling results at cau28 and cau29 extend the june 2018 resource area some 5 km further to the south and increase the area for the update of the nw sector resource by approximately 20 drilling at cau25 and cau27 was completed along the eastern edge of the se sector at depths of 427 and 473 m respectively and intersected a sequence with some sandy material interbedded with halite and clay units cau19 was completed in the southwest of the se sector to a depth of 519 5 m this hole intersected the deep sand unit from 434 m to 519 5 m a thickness of 85 m with sandy units continuing at the end of the hole cau19 is close to the southern boundary of the property and confirms the extension of the deep sand unit into this area pumping tests during the quarter the 30 day constant rate pumping test to simulate long term production was completed on test production well cau11 in the se sector this followed completion of a variable rate test to confirm the pumping rate for the constant rate test brine concentrations were monitored throughout the test in addition to water levels in the pumping well and a network of surrounding observation wells the 30 day constant rate pumping test has commenced on well cau07 in the nw sector brine samples are being collected at regular intervals during the test and complete analyses are expected by the end of january 2019 the tests will provide additional information on aquifer characteristics as an input to the three dimensional groundwater model that is being developed to estimate lithium reserves and to develop a production schedule for the project corporate and administration finance vat vat refunds of approximately us 0 6 million were received during the quarter approximately us 2 1 million of returns were lodged and are expected to be received next quarter cash balance as at 31 december 2018 orocobre corporate had available cash of us 284 million the us 24 7 million cash reduction from the prior quarter was the result of a us 21 million shareholders loan made to the sdj joint venture to fund olaroz expansion activities us 3 million in corporate costs us 1 5 million in cauchari jv expenditure us 0 6 million funding to borax us 0 5 million strategic property purchases and us 0 1 million of forex losses this expenditure was partially offset by us 1 6 million interest income and

borax cash and project debt net group cash at 31 december 2018 is us 216 7 million down from us 221 7 million at 30 september 2018 the ar us exchange rate strengthened by 9 during the quarter with government intervention on interest rates and other measures at 30 september 2018 the rate was ar 41 25 us and this strengthened to ar 37 70 at 31 december 2018 whilst inflation for the same period was 16 when looking at the accumulated 12 month period from 1 january 2018 to 31 december 2018 devaluation of the ar against the us was 102 versus inflation of approximately 49 this resulted in balancing us costs for ars peso denominated expenses for the period considering the delayed response in devaluation vs inflation over the preceding year as a result costs were lower for borax argentina and to a lesser extent sdj over time inflation and devaluation generally cancel each other out other matters orocobre signs agreements with ttc orocobre has signed three pivotal agreements

annual report on form 20 f filed with the sec on may 16 2018 for financial statement reporting purposes wns has two reportable segments wns global bpm and wns auto claims bpm revenue less repair payments is a non gaap financial measure that is calculated as a revenue less b in the auto claims business payments to repair centers for fault repair cases where wns acts as the principal in its dealings with the third party repair centers and its clients wns believes that revenue less repair payments for fault repairs reflects more accurately the value addition of the business process management services that it directly provides to its clients for more details please see the discussion in part i item 5 operating and financial review and prospects overview in our annual report on form 20 f filed with the sec on may 16 2018 constant currency revenue less repair payments is a non gaap financial measure we present constant currency revenue less repair payments so that revenue less repair payments may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of business performance constant currency revenue less repair payments is presented by recalculating prior period s revenue less repair payments denominated in currencies other than in us dollars using the foreign exchange rate used for the latest period without taking into account the impact of hedging gains losses our non us dollar denominated revenues include but are not limited to revenues denominated in pound sterling south african rand australian dollar and euro wns also presents 1 adjusted operating margin which refers to adjusted operating profit calculated as operating profit loss excluding share based expense and amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenue less repair payments and 2 ani which is calculated as profit excluding share based expense and amortization of intangible assets and including the tax effect thereon and other non gaap financial measures included in this release as supplemental measures of its performance wns presents these non gaap financial measures because it believes they assist investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are non recurring in nature and those it believes are not indicative of its core operating performance in addition it uses these non gaap financial measures i as a factor in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation and ii to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies these non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for wns s financial results prepared in accordance with ifrs the company is not able to provide our forward looking gaap revenue profit and earnings per ads without unreasonable efforts for a number of reasons including our inability to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the payments to repair centers our future share based compensation expense under ifrs 2 share based payments amortization of intangibles associated with future acquisitions and currency fluctuations as a result any attempt to provide a reconciliation of the forward looking gaap financial measures revenue profit earnings per ads to our forward looking non gaap financial measures revenue less repair payments ani and adjusted diluted earnings per ads respectively would imply a degree of likelihood that we do not believe is reasonable the company applies gaap methodologies in computing the tax impact on its non gaap ani adjustments including amortization of intangible assets and share based compensation expense the company s non gaap tax expense is generally higher than its gaap tax expense if the income subject to taxes is higher considering the effect of the items excluded from gaap profit to arrive at non gaap profit
big silver move foreshadowed as industrial panic looms welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up we ll hear one of the more important interviews we ve ever done on the broken nature of the precious metals futures exchanges and what might be the driving force that ultimately destroys the confidence in these markets paving the way to true price discovery mining analyst and precious metals expert david jensen joins me to talk about how palladium might just be the straw that breaks the back of the paper market don t miss this must hear interview coming up after this week s market update as the government shutdown persists and a declaration of national emergency by president donald trump looms financial markets are unfazed the dow jones industrials have swung approximately 500 points higher so far this week however the u s dollar index did hit a 3 month low on wednesday that helped boost oil prices in a big way crude climbed 10 to 53 a barrel the price action in precious metal markets is more subdued gold shows a modest gain of 0 4 this week to bring spot prices to 1 291 per ounce the yellow metal flirted with the 1 300 level last friday more backing and filling may be needed before the market is ready to push through that resistance turning to silver the white metal currently trades at 15 68 per ounce down 0 4 on the week platinum is off 1 0 to come in at 820 and finally palladium is registering a slight weekly gain of 1 5 to trade at a lofty 1 328 an ounce as of this friday morning recording metals markets don t appear to be getting much of a boost due to investor fears over the government shutdown so far the standoff between trump and democrat leaders has been perceived by investors as more of a sideshow than a genuine threat to the economy but the longer the shutdown drags on without a resolution the more restless those furloughed government employees will become about the delays they face in being paid people who are dependent on government programs such as food stamps may also start getting nervous the government says funding could run out for some welfare programs after next month if congress and the white house fail to come to terms on a deal to reopen the federal bureaucracy it s unlikely the government will actually stop paying out benefits as a result of the present political stalemate but the risk of a default on government promises will grow in the years to come as the government s financial condition steadily worsens a deeply divided and polarized political system that cannot find the will or the way to compromise on a modest allocation to border fencing cannot be expected to get a handle on the rapidly growing 22 trillion national debt the masses have been placated in recent years by a strong stock market relatively tame inflation and a seemingly strong economy but the good times won t last forever they may even now be behind us the federal reserve is concerned enough about a potential bear market in stocks and slowdown in the economy that is likely to end its rate hiking campaign elsewhere in the world the natives are growing restless france is now on the brink of revolution its yellow vest protestors refuse to back down until unpopular french leader emmanuel macron steps down from power yellow vest leaders are now calling for organized bank runs here s a brief rundown of the situation from an independent geopolitical analyst known on the internet as black pigeon speaks black pigeon speaks the fortunes of president emmanuel macron have gone from dim to bleak we are now more than eight weeks into what could be called an anti government rebellion by what have been dubbed the yellow vest movement reports are now emerging that the yellow vest movement has the banks squarely in their sights and in what is perhaps the first ever planned and voluntary bank run the idea was first floated on social media as a legal and nonviolent way to rebel against the state the post in part read we all know that the powers of the country are not in the hands of the government but in those of the banks if the banks weaken the state weakens immediately the fractional reserve banking system is inherently vulnerable to an abnormally large scale of withdrawals at any given time banks are only able to pay out a fraction of what customers hold in their accounts as deposits in effect account balances represent nothing more than unsecured claims on banks that are technically insolvent in a financial crisis the banking system could become functionally insolvent meaning customers would be unable to withdraw funds they might even find themselves in the position of having to bail in failing banks by taking losses on their accounts this happened a few years ago during the financial panic that hit cyprus cypriot account holders learned a tough lesson in counterparty risk investors can mitigate that risk by holding assets outside of the banking system and not depending on promises from bankers brokers or politicians assets that entail zero counterparty risk include physical gold and silver bullion products that you can hold in your hand and own free and clear coming up now our discussion on another type of fractional reserve system that being the metals futures markets yes it s looking like the futures markets are losing some control over the pricing of the metals so let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in david jensen of jensen strategic a highly studied mining analyst in precious metals expert with close to two decades of experience in the mining industry and it s great to have him on david thanks so much for the time today and nice to finally talk to you david jensen my pleasure mike it s good to touch base with you mike gleason well david you ve been closely following the palladium market and that s where i wanted to focus much of our conversation today because that s obviously where most of the fireworks are happening in the metals these days now for the most part over the last few years gold and silver prices have been bouncing around and have been basically in trading ranges but palladium has been a different story however the metal has been climbing steadily for most of the past three years things got off to a rough start in 2018 but since the middle of august prices have rallied more than 30 and we re back to all time highs you have been watching the palladium market closely and you have some important insights so let s get started by talking a little bit about palladium supply you have some background in mining and metals can you first talk briefly about where palladium is produced and why supply could become a serious issue david jensen yeah sure the world palladium market globally is about in round numbers about ten million ounces a year and of that about eight and half million ounces comes from mine supply and recycling and then if you drill it down a little bit more it s about six and a half million that comes directly from mine supply versus the ten million ounce total consumption and of that six and a half million ounces about 40 comes from russia and about another 40 comes from south africa and then the other nations canada the united states and other places fill out the last 20 so it s a very concentrated supply from two primary sources mike gleason the market for palladium is relatively tiny compared to gold and silver as you just laid out but what s happening there could have major implications for precious metals markets generally the bullion banks have a bad habit of selling vast amounts of paper metal that will essentially create fresh new contracts for any buyer who shows up wanting one sopping almost any amount of demand without prices being forced higher as many would expect they never seem to get called on it but the bullion markets are essentially fractional reserve and the fraction of physical metal backing all of this paper seems to just keep diminishing however the palladium market may represent a serious problem for the bullion banks if you would explain what a palladium lease is what sorts of people or institutions lease metal and why david jensen okay well the leasing of metal is typically a stop gap measure to secure physical metal if you can t get it from a refinery or from a mining supply source so it s usually a stop gap measure and we ve seen that leasing cost and by the way the leasing rate is a percentage and has to be paid with metal not with fiat money or paper money at the end of the lease and because you have to store and insure precious metals typically when the market is flush you see a negative rate so that the holders of the metal are actually paying you to take the metal off their hands and what we ve seen now is over the last oh about 18 months is that the palladium has gone from a negative lease rate it spiked a couple of weeks ago to about 30 for a one month lease and it s around 21 today so what that signals to us it signals that you can t get adequate physical metal in the market right now and that there s a dearth of supply now that shortage has not been quick to arise the ceo of johnson matthey which is one of the world s largest refiners of platinum group metals he warned the market in 2017 he said that there had been a decade of ingrained or structural deficit where they had burnt down the above ground inventories through a supply deficit and he said that the stockpiles are not all gone now but if we continue along this path that they certainly will be and sure enough now we see these very very large lease rates signaling that there s a real problem with supply and the shortage mike it can t be addressed very quickly it takes a decade from expiration through development into production for a mine typically what we ve had is several decades of pricing metal in london which is the primary pricing market for precious metals for the miners they have been using these unallocated contracts which is really trading promissory notes between the bullion banks to set the price on a daily level so what happens is you don t have to have the metal to trade it and the trading has been dominated by these bullion banks who have been able to really just set the price where they wish but the problem is that they ve set the price too low which happens and this is really a form of central planning when these interventions take place and what you have then is you have a systematic over consumption and under production of the metal when the price is set too low so where we re at right now it s a situation which has developed over decades there s no quick solution and palladium with the smallest above ground inventories is the first to signal a problem but really we can see a very quick change in the market for platinum silver and gold as well because of the similar let s call it leveraged positions or leveraged trading which goes on in the market that you have unallocated contracts with no metal behind them and the holders of these contracts many of them are commercial users for silver and platinum as well especially and with palladium 80 of the consumption is for catalytic converters in automobiles you can t use the contracts in these catalytic converters so those who need the metal are saying we want metal give us metal now and that really takes away or binds the hands of these bullion banks who have been really trading just the paper promissory notes so i m expecting a contagion to happen into silver and into platinum initially and ultimately into gold gold has the largest above ground inventories relative to annual demand but it s still very tightly held mike gleason if you don t mind tell our listeners what the term backwardation means in the metals markets david jensen yeah backwardation structure is where the spot market has a higher price than the forward or the future price the opposite of that is called contango where the future price is a higher price and it reflects the cost if you buy a contract in the futures market it reflects partially the cost of storage and insuring the material for that period of time and when you have a backwardation structure what that means is that the demand is so high in the spot market for immediate delivery that it overwhelms those forward held costs and it really signals that there s so little metal in the market that those who have the metal are not able to meet the need with a guaranteed profit in fiat dollars if you sell spot and buy a future contract you re notionally guaranteed to get the metal back or have a high likelihood of getting the metal back and you should be able to net a very handy profit in a very short period of time so when you see these sustained backwardations as you re seeing in palladium it s really a further signal of the problem in the market that even offering a guaranteed profit that you can t source enough metal to drive that metal price structure back into the normal contango where the future price is higher than the spot or immediate delivery market mike gleason if we see defaults on delivery in palladium what do you think the ramifications will be for gold and silver will all of these apathetic traders make the connection between what s happening there and what could happen in gold and silver and will regulators wake up and take action how would you guess this will play out david jensen well i think mike the potential is there for a knock on or a contagion effect into the markets the lbma and i m still very skeptical of the lbma given that it was created by the bank of england in 1987 and that ever since for multiple decades during that period we ve seen from the work of dmitri speck that the price has been drilled down at the fixes that occur each day the a m and the p m fix so i mean in london they claim that there s about 1 7 billion ounces of silver positions in the various contract forms and the industrial users of silver also just like the catalytic converter manufacturers who buy physical palladium can t use these unallocated contracts in their industrial processes they actually need physical metal so what i see happening here is that palladium is drawing attention in the market to the problem really the mal structuring in the market after decades of price suppression using unallocated contracts and i see the potential here with that large number of positions in the silver market especially we don t know what it is in platinum they don t release the numbers but i certainly see the potential here for silver and have an outsized move as those who need the metal say we would like to have delivery now to ensure the supply given that we can see in the palladium market the signal of the problem of these unallocated contracts and leverage in silver gold and platinum is there as well you only need a small percentage of the holders to really cause an outsized move in the market mike gleason yeah as people need to remember palladium and silver as well there s a huge amount of industrial users for these metals that s really what those metals are for primarily especially palladium and as we saw i think it was back in 2000 where the automotive manufacturers were worried about getting that physical supply out of russia and they started hoarding the metal and the price of palladium spiked as a result you think that sort of thing could happen if some of these industrial users start to worry about what s going to happen if i can t get the physical metal for raw material then i can t make my products they re not going to be putting themselves in that position they re going to get that metal at whatever cost it takes right david jensen yeah it s usually a relatively small percentage of the cost of manufactured goods is represented by these precious metals and i think that as prudent supply chain managers look at these situations and say you know we re seeing problems with unallocated contracts the signal has been sent and we do not want to be in a position where we are unable to ship goods because of a cost component with representing a small percentage of the actual finished price where we can t secure these small elements and are thus bound i mean cell phone manufacturers come to mind and others solar panels and electronics and so i really see this starting to spread the awareness spreading in the market to the point where you get away from just in time delivery and holding of relatively large spot contracts and it gets reflected into more of a secure holding of several months of supply to ensure that you ve got continuity of material flows because of the leverage in the market as i alluded to earlier i really see that that can have an outside impact where you ve got many more claims in the market than you actually have metal so you need a small number of these claim holders to convert to physical metal to start to see a disorderly market or a disrupted market take effect mike gleason yeah shortages beget more shortages as they always say and it could be just a frenzy as people try to get their hands on it now we talked about broken markets here when it comes to these futures exchanges getting back to say a dozen years ago we had obviously the financial crisis of 2008 2009 and you sounded the alarm before all that began talk about that and then i want to kind of relate it to today and maybe get your thoughts on how maybe what we re seeing right now with a lot of uncertainty a lot of gyrations and volatility in the stock markets and how that could potentially set up for maybe the next financial collapse give us a little bit of your insights on that if you would david jensen sure in 2007 i reconnected with the governor of the bank of canada david dodge who had been a former lecturer at my university when i was doing my mba in 1998 and 99 and i had talked to him he had just given a speech here at the vancouver board of trade in vancouver and said that the disruptions that we saw in the asset backed commercial paper market was just a signal of an adjustment of risks and that things would be fine i had a totally different view i viewed the systematic suppression of precious metals and it might sound like an obscure concept to listeners but when you look at the fact that in 1980 they had to raise interest rates to 9 above the inflation rate to get people out of gold which had run from 45 in 1970 to 850 in 1980 they had to raise interest rates to 9 above the inflation rate which was running 10 so 19 at that time thereafter the central bank the bank of england created the lbma trading paper substitute for gold and i mentioned this to him afterwards and he said i don t have time to get into this in great detail but here s my card and please forward me the information so i sent him two letters that are now posted on safehaven com you can look at my letters to david dodge but the view was that we had entered into this market where we had basically shut off the warning system for inflationary monetary policy which is gold it warns people when they re printing too much money as we saw in 1980 and that we had really blown a succession of bubbles in the financial markets which would come unwound and what we ve seen since that crash ten years ago the great financial crisis as they call it has been more leveraged more than 70 trillion of more debt around the world and they solved what was a debt problem caused by the suppression of precious metals and the printing of money to more printing of money it really goes unabated now and i don t see a good end to this mike the fed is really choking off liquidity in the markets and we re heading to another crisis now and i think that this next crisis there s going to be really a hamstrung ability of the central banks to lower interest rates further and to run the zero interest rate policies when the markets see that kind of behavior i think it s going to spike a panic in the market or fear that they ve tried to solve a debt problem with more debt and here they go again and it s very visible this time i think to people that the green shoots as ben bernanke was really deceptively telling people about are nonexistent and that you can t solve a debt problem with a debt problem and i think at that point we re going to have a serious problem we re going to have to write down the debt and restructure i think our monetary system as well which really points its finger back at gold and silver which are historical monetary instruments with a four thousand year history as money mike gleason well finally david as we begin to wrap up what kind of year do you envision it will be for metals in 2019 might it finally be one where we see them truly act as a safe haven asset class that sees the masses flock toward it to protect themselves or is that day still a ways off basically how do you see 2019 shaping up for metals investors and metals prices david jensen well i think if you take a long view and look at metals they ve risen from 250 u s dollars an ounce gold in the year 2000 to the 1 300 level now and i know that is lower than the 1 900 dollars we saw seven years ago but i do think that they have performed somewhat even though the performance has been muted even with the trading of these unallocated contracts but i do see a year ahead of us here due to the leverage in the markets due to the really chronic underproduction over consumption of the precious metals due to the mal pricing by the bullion banks we re now at the point now where it s very difficult to hide these problems mike so i really see this year here as being a hinge point an inflection point for these markets and i think that we re going to see the physical market start to really assert itself i think we re already seeing it in palladium there are indications now that platinum the lease rate is starting to creep up and the knock on i think to silver is going to accelerate the process so i do think that we re in a position now where really i don t see these as investments i see them as insurance policies and i see them as monetary instruments and i think that really the deception of central banking and the concept that you can create wealth by creating more debt that you can create real organic wealth by printing money and creating debt is going to be shown the fallacy that it is so i feel very strongly about the physical metals having a positive turn here and i think it s really rooted or anchored in what we re seeing in the palladium market and that the limits are clearly being reached in this market we ve had more than 18 months now of increasingly high lease rates on the metal and i don t think this is a problem that s going to go away i think we re going to see an accelerated demand for palladium now as people realize the problems and then ultimately it ll terminate the paper pricing system that we have in london and new york mike gleason very well put and that s exactly why we wanted to have you on here today and talk more about this palladium story because it might seem like a little obscure metal to a lot of folks but it can have some major implications on these other markets the bigger markets gold and silver namely and i t was great to discuss that with you i hope we can talk to you again as this all unfolds i really enjoyed it all the best to you in 2019 thanks so much for your time david david jensen best to you mike and thank you for your time mike gleason well that will do it for this week thanks again to david jensen of jensen strategic you can follow

members of the monetary policy committee of the south african reserve bank meet from 15 to 17 january to decide a suitable interest rate stance that sees inflation settle in the middle of the 3 6 target range the 25 basis points bps increase in november last year brought the repo rate and prime lending rates to 6 75 and 10 25 respectively as the first increase since march 2016 the reserve bank signalled the beginning of an interest rate hiking cycle that could entail another three increases of 25 bps before end 2020 while the quarterly projection model which serves as a policy guideline for the monetary policy committee suggests three additional interest rate hikes by the end of 2020 pwc believes the reserve bank is unlikely to raise interest rates in january here are the top three reasons why the central bank may keep rates stable in its first monetary policy committee meeting of 2019 1 global economy fears dampen oil prices and offer petrol price reprieve on the back of fears about a global slowdown and continuing trade tensions between the united states and china oil prices retreated for much of the fourth quarter of 2018 additionally record us crude oil production and reports of a sharp increase in us product inventories contribute to a weak outlook for oil prices leading into 2019 lower oil prices offered south africans a welcome reprieve with the price of inland 95 ulp declining by over r3 litre from r17 08 to r14 01 between november 2018 and the start of 2019 similarly diesel prices are now almost 20 lower than their peak in november 2018 as a result the reserve bank may revise down its expectations of brent crude prices in 2019 and 2020 with the outlook for inflation benefitting from reduced supply side pressures 2 us equities jitters may slow down pace of us fed monetary policy tightening a 9 3 decline in the s p 500 stock market index in december 2018 triggered speculation that the us federal reserve may slow down the pace of additional monetary policy tightening in 2019 helping emerging markets currencies including the rand exchange rate after continuing on a trend of depreciation for most of 2018 the rand exchange rate is potentially undervalued according to the reserve bank s november monetary policy committee statement with the exchange rate breaking r14 to the dollar early this month the immediate risk of imported inflation is limited 3 economy remains at a crossroads in 2019 demand pressures weak last year s economic growth results were disappointing in spite of some recovery in consumer and business confidence while the reserve bank predicted annual growth of 1 4 at the start of 2018 by november this expectation was revised down to 0 6 south africa s economy is expected to bounce back somewhat in 2019 and 2020 facilitated by an anticipated cyclical upswing and improvements in economic sentiment likely helped by recent initiatives like the economic stimulus plan jobs summit and investment summit however the possibility of fiscal slippage and a lack of structural reforms can weigh on longer term economic prospects furthermore renewed concerns around electricity supply and eskom s going concern raise the risks to growth inflation fiscal outcomes and credit ratings in 2019 indications of only a tentative economic recovery in 2019 and 2020 are likely to prevent the reserve bank from raising interest rates in january especially in the absence of additional supply side pressures that could cause inflation to move closer to the upper end of the target range indeed the reserve bank may also announce a slight moderation this week in the anticipated pace of monetary policy tightening in 2019 and 2020 maura feddersen is a pwc strategy economist

has extended the length of service of the workers in the companies explained economist camilo tiscornia from buenos aires based c t consultancy production minister dante sica said companies were also reluctant to fire workers because of forecasts showing an economic recovery around the corner they prefer to suspend and not fire because of the cost of layoffs plus the cost of hiring is costly sica said in an interview the unemployment rate in argentina fell to 9 percent in the third quarter from 9 6 percent in the second quarter year on year it increased only 0 7 basis points from the third quarter of 2017 when the economy was growing at an annual rate of 3 8 percent while workers are staying in their jobs they are earning less because of the shorter hours and fewer shifts some have resorted to taking second jobs working for uber the ride hailing app for example according to anecdotal reports we are not happy with these measures at all fewer shifts shorter hours but the last

adjusted ebitda also a note on our financial statements consistent with our three previous 2018 earnings presentations all comparative prior periods have been updated in accordance with the financial accounting standard board s recent change to the presentation of non service pension and opeb costs this change resulted in alcoa moving such costs out of ebitda and into other income expense finally as previously announced the earnings release and slide presentation are available on our website with that i ll turn it over to roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you jim and thank you to everyone for joining today s earnings call our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results reflect our determination to accelerate the strengthening of alcoa despite sequentially weaker markets we had a strong fourth quarter with higher profits in our bauxite and alumina business units and with the help of higher market prices earlier in the year we increased annual profits addressed liabilities significantly strengthened our balance sheet and began to return cash to stockholders we ve built upon the progress we ve made since our launch and by executing our strategic priorities to reduce complexity drive returns and strengthen the balance sheet we re better positioned to thrive through market cycles but as we turn to 2019 markets have trended lower and there is increased uncertainty surrounding global trade this has created a dynamic environment for input pricing and product pricing our businesses however are ready for these challenges and we are determined to drive improved operations react smartly and with urgency to changing market conditions and to further strengthen our company s foundation with that let s get started with an overview of the fourth quarter we reported net income of 43 million or 0 23 a share on an adjusted basis excluding special items net income was 125 million or 0 66 a share on an adjusted ebitda basis excluding special items we generated 749 million and reported solid cash generation turning to our businesses and beginning with safety the fourth quarter was free of serious injuries we re very happy with this achievement and we look forward to building upon it as the year progresses operationally in alumina our pinjarra refinery in western australia one of the largest in the world attained a fourth quarter production record our alumina segment also reported a rise in quarterly profit in aluminum last month we curtailed half of the one operating potline at the becancour smelter in quebec canada this will enable our salaried employees to continue to run this portion of the line safely with a smaller workforce meanwhile we continue to work on reaching a new labor contract with the unionized workforce also this quarter we began to buy back shares under the stock repurchase program announced in the third quarter and we successfully amended our revolving credit agreement reflecting our improving financial profile lastly overnight in spain we reached a tentative agreement with the workers representatives at our aviles and la coruna aluminum plants related to the collective dismissal process that we announced in october the workforce is expected to vote on the tentative plan by the end of the month the plan calls for the curtailment of the smelters at both plants the casthouses at each plant will remain in operation and the paste plant at la coruna will continue to operate our social plan included in the tentative agreement preserves a portion of the jobs at the two facilities and includes retirement packages and potential relocation to our san ciprian facility taking a broader look at 2018 as i mentioned earlier we can see a strengthening alcoa and it s visible across safety our balance sheet and our financial performance compared to 2017 we grew revenue and net income and we increased adjusted ebitda excluding special items by 27 reaching 3 1 billion we reduced our pension and opeb net liabilities by a third enhancing our balance sheet all while maintaining a healthy cash balance in safety we experienced three serious injuries in 2018 but we were grateful to have no fatalities last year our focus across the year has been to revitalize our safety program and we look to improve safety further this year and beyond despite operational issues earlier in the year we saw annual production records at two of our aluminum plants and two of our bauxite mines we completed the partial restart of our warrick smelter to support profitably growing our can sheet business and we launched a joint venture to develop our carbon free aluminum smelting technology we re proud of what we ve accomplished in 2018 and how this work has positioned us for the coming years furthermore with two years of actual results now behind us and given industry practice and market volatility we are amending the way that we provide annual outlook information to more fully describe business drivers rather than point in time estimates bill will offer more details on this change with that i ll turn it over to bill for a detailed review of fourth quarter results william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks roy let s start with the income statement sequentially revenues are down 46 million on lower aluminum and alumina prices compared to last year revenues are up 170 million primarily on higher alumina prices in the quarter the net income attributable to alcoa corporation was 43 million or 0 23 per share on 188 2 million shares outstanding special items in the quarter totaled 82 million after tax and noncontrolling interests of the 138 million of restructuring before tax and noncontrolling interests 107 million was to establish an allowance on brazil state vat credits while the company retains the ability to utilize the credits in the future only the restart of our sao luis smelter provides the opportunity to monetize the credits amid unfavorable market conditions and with the current inability to obtain a favorable power contract we felt it necessary to stop recording additional vat credit and to establish an allowance on the current balances we still believe the sao luis smelter assets are valuable for the future and continue to maintain the smelter assets other restructuring charges of note include 12 million for pension and opeb actions and 8 million for take or pay contracts at idled facilities now let s look at the income statement excluding special items our fourth quarter 18 adjusted net income excluding special items was 125 million or 0 66 per share adjusted ebitda excluding special items was 749 million down 46 million sequentially primarily due to lower metal prices our fourth quarter ebitda margin was 22 a few other items of note on a sequential comparison basis other expenses increased 25 million due to losses in the aluminum side of our saudi joint venture and lower foreign currency benefits our operational tax rate in the quarter was 38 8 6 8 percentage points lower sequentially in the third quarter we had a higher tax rate to catch up our full year rate as rising alumina prices changed our mix of taxable earnings and nontaxable losses our share count decreased ph 0 5 million shares due to stock repurchases and a decrease in common share equivalents in the fourth quarter we repurchased 1 7 million shares for 50 million an average price of 29 01 commodity pricing changes had both positive and negative impacts this quarter and even with improved volume drove slightly lower sequential result negative drivers were lower metal prices unfavorable contract pricing true ups in our alumina segment compared to favorable true ups last quarter and lower energy prices in brazil major positives came from improved sales volume due to higher production in all three segments the other major benefit came from lower quarter end prices driving positive corporate inventory accounting impacts compared to negative impacts last quarter raw materials cost increases have moderated and even provided a slight benefit this quarter now let s shift our focus to the segments in the segments bauxite adjusted ebitda improved 4 million on increased production from the huntly and cbg mines alumina adjusted ebitda improved 23 million strong production recovery and higher api prices were offset by the favorable pricing true ups from last quarter turning negative this quarter the aluminum segment was down 126 million primarily on lower metal prices and lower earnings from our brazil hydro assets higher alumina costs continued to flow through the segment which offset the volume gains from the business outside of the segments for the quarter non segment impacts netted to positive 9 million corporate inventory accounting was a benefit as alumina and aluminum prices dropped at quarter end in the fourth quarter we ended the year with cash of 1 1 billion up 91 million sequentially and down 245 million year over year as noted earlier 50 million of share repurchases took place in the quarter with a matching amount used to reduce debt and make pension contributions a quick review of our major cash sources and uses for 2018 our total sources of 2 2 billion were comprised of 1 6 billion in operating cash flow and 600 million of debt issuances and other sources uses were in three major categories pension and opeb minority interest distributions and capital expenditures and other we funded 1 1 billion in the pension and post retirement benefits programs including 412 million of required funding 225 million related to annuitizations and discretionary contributions and 500 million building a pre funding balance with proceeds of may s 500 million bond offering separate from pension the largest outflows of cash were net distributions to our joint venture minority interest partner of 678 million and roughly 400 million of capital expenditures now let s take a look at the balance sheet this quarter we continued strengthening the balance sheet our net debt to adjusted ebitda is down to 0 2 times return on capital for fiscal year 2018 is 11 9 our fourth quarter days working capital was 22 days down 4 days from the third quarter and an 11 day increase year over year reflecting higher raw material prices lower buy resell activities and timing of vendor payments most importantly our pension and opeb net liability ended the year at 2 3 billion down 1 2 billion year over year sequentially it was up 200 million after a year end remeasurement as unfavorable asset returns due to the global market decline in the fourth quarter overshadowed slightly improved discount rates the year end remeasurement offset earlier favorable interim remeasurement we ve completed our 2018 capital allocation framework and as previously mentioned we started a stock repurchase program and repurchased 1 7 million shares these shares were retired and not held in treasury stock our future capital allocation framework follows a theme similar to 2018 we will continue balancing many factors in light of expected market conditions challenges and opportunities but foremost will be maintaining liquidity and managing investments to sustain the business and drive value we will also continue our drive toward obtaining an optimal capital structure returning cash to stockholders and when appropriate investing in value creating growth projects to measure attaining an optimal capital structure we re using an adjusted net debt metric on a proportional basis at year end 2018 it was 3 3 billion and our target over the next three to five years is to reduce it to 2 0 billion to 2 5 billion it s important to note that this range can be achieved by making our minimum required pension and opeb payments assuming we achieve our expected asset return and no change in discount rates we have 150 million remaining under our existing 200 million repurchase authorization as with our adjusted net debt target we will execute the repurchase program based on cash flows marker conditions and other relevant factors now let s review the full year outlook for 2019 as roy mentioned due to its limited utility to investors and unprecedented market volatility we re eliminating the quarterly point in time full year ebitda outlook instead adding more cash flow information on the outlook page and adding another page of business commentary in the appendix starting with the income statement in the segments compared to 2018 we expect that 2019 bauxite shipments will be flat to up 1 million tons and alumina shipments will be flat to up 100 000 tons alumina production gains will translate into fewer purchased tons in 2019 aluminum shipments will decline 500 000 tons to 600 000 tons year over year partially a result of the expiration of the tennessee tolling agreement outside the segments we expect transformation to be in the range of 10 million to 20 million primarily due to lower power revenues in suriname in 2019 we will stop using lifo inventory accounting and metal lag will be included in the aluminum segment leaving intercompany profit eliminations as the sole corporate inventory impact we plan to restate 2018 financial results in the first quarter but the impact will be insignificant for the year moving forward intercompany profit eliminations will vary based on ending period prices and inventory levels and we are including a sensitivity in the appendix other corporate expense will increase approximately 20 million due to higher resource unit and labor costs below the ebitda line there are anticipated improvements in depreciation depletion and amortization down 33 million to 700 million and net pension and opeb expense is improving roughly 20 down 24 million to 115 million interest expense is essentially flat year over year we expect our 2019 operational tax rate to range from 45 to 55 a result of losses in non tax paying jurisdictions and dependent upon and that s dependent upon market conditions based on today s spot prices we would be toward the top end of that range in our expanded cash flow section we have some key expectations minimum required pension opeb funding is down 27 from 412 million to 300 million additional liability optimization via debt reduction or pension funding as well as stock repurchases will be based on market conditions and cash availability sustaining and return seeking capital expenditures are set the same as last year s targets at 300 million and 150 million respectively because we saw higher earnings in 2018 in tax jurisdictions paid on a lag basis we expect previous period tax payments to increase by approximately 200 million to approximately 360 million in 2019 we have completed our payment schedule for the doj sec settlement environmental and aro spending is expected to be back to its previously targeted range of 110 million to 120 million and cash impacts of restructuring charges for example our wenatchee power payment were 103 million in 2018 as roy noted earlier we have reached tentative agreement with works councils at our aviles and la coruna smelters upon ratification by the workforce we would expect 2019 restructuring cash impacts to range from 90 million to 115 million in addition depending on the ultimate outcome of the process the company could incur further charges ranging from 125 million to 135 million of which 75 would be non cash the remaining 25 would result in cash outlays after 2019 in the appendix you ll continue to find the cost and ebitda sensitivities as well as a discussion of key business considerations those considerations include for example the expected sequential impacts of favorable alumina contractual pricing of approximately 30 million and lower alumina costs in the smelters of 40 million to 45 million as well as anticipated unfavorable impacts of increased maintenance activities in the aluminum segment of approximately 30 million and roughly 15 million lower earnings in the rolling business so with that i ll turn it back to you roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you bill turning to our market outlook first i d like to highlight why we re excited about the future of our aluminum market beginning on the left hand portion of the slide long term demand growth is expected to remain robust in the next five years when looking at expected consumption growth aluminum continues to outpace competing materials we expect that demand growth for primary aluminum will remain strong at a 3 4 compound annual growth rate to 2023 we re also fortunate to have a well diversified base of sectors that consume aluminum in fact no one sector makes up more than about 25 of aluminum demand the three largest sectors construction transportation and packaging are each expected to have significant growth worldwide in the next five years we expect transportation demand for aluminum for example to grow at a 3 9 compound annual growth rate supported by trends that include rising wealth in emerging economies and the light weighting and electrification of vehicle fleets the electrical sector is also expected to contribute significant demand growth by 2023 especially in india a country that is responsible for almost 1 million tons of growth during this period in the developed markets of north america and europe where most of our production is located aluminum consumption growth is expected to outpace positive overall gdp growth positive economic growth in both mature and emerging markets will therefore provide a steady source of demand growth for the many critical end products that rely on aluminum and their supply chain while new aluminum supply will come online over these five years in the near term particularly we expect that supply growth will not keep up with consumption given the more restrictive approach to operational permitting inside china and a clear capital cost disadvantage restricting new supply outside of china 2018 saw a primary aluminum deficit worldwide and we expect another deficit for 2019 now we ll look more closely at our balance estimates for each of our three markets starting with the bauxite market we see the 2018 bauxite surplus continuing into 2019 as exports from guinea australia and indonesia climb year over year chinese customers stockpile bauxite strategically due to uncertain sourcing both within and outside china and this surplus will likely enable them to grow that stockpile again this year in alumina as you know 2018 was an extraordinary year as third party supply disruptions in brazil and other factors pushed the market into a deficit for 2019 we re forecasting an alumina surplus in china driven by refinery expansions and lower than previously expected smelting production due to economic and environmental reasons in the world ex china we expect the market to be approximately balanced as refining expansions keep pace with rising demand lacking concrete information about if or when third party disruptions may be resolved our estimates assume that the status quo will continue finally we continue to see aluminum in a deficit as we did in 2018 lower margins have led to many economic curtailments of smelting plants during 2018 including several in china that curtailed all or part of their capacity during the fourth quarter as i mentioned on the previous slide demand growth for primary aluminum in 2019 is expected to be robust with global consumption growth in a range of 3 to 4 driven by continued strong growth in china as well as in developed and developing markets elsewhere while the global aluminum market is projected to be in deficit again this year prices today are creating unsustainable margins for the aluminum industry we estimate that between 30 and 45 of global smelters are cash negative at recent prices china exported 5 8 million tons of unwrought and semi finished aluminum products in 2018 that s a 21 increase over 2017 what s more those exports are enabled by outsized government support the weakening chinese yuan and an unlevel playing field 5 8 million tons is a very significant quantity equivalent to about 20 of ex china primary consumption in 2018 that large outflow of metal competes with ex china semi finished production lowering primary aluminum demand and contributes to depressed pricing the depressed margins we re currently seeing have also occurred in the past several years but only for short periods of time today s low margins cannot sustain our industry and are therefore not viable over the long term looking back since november of 2016 we ve made great progress in our first two full years as an independent publicly traded company as we prepared to separate from our parent company in early 2016 aluminum prices were at multi year lows and aluminum prices remained weak to improve our positioning to be a stand alone company we executed a comprehensive strategy to strengthen our portfolio as we continually strived to be a low cost industry leader across bauxite alumina and aluminum products in november of that year we began operating as an independent entity with excellent prospects for the future with the launch behind us in 2017 we introduced three strategic priorities reduce complexity drive returns and strengthen the balance sheet as the building blocks for a stronger alcoa we ve used these priorities to streamline our processes and procedures and drive returns from our assets with a benefit of favorable markets we were also able to address a significant portion of our legacy items most notably our pension and opeb liabilities but also other major items such as the long term power contract associated with our closed rockdale smelter that was an annual drag on earnings of approximately 60 million to 70 million we closed 2018 with 3 3 billion in adjusted net debt down from 3 8 billion in 2016 and we ve grown our adjusted ebitda excluding special items nearly 3 times that of our 2016 carve out financials due to our financial performance and as proof of our strategy s success we ve started to execute our announced stock repurchase program a key component of our 2018 capital allocation framework as we enter our third year as alcoa corporation and with a focus on strengthening our company for the long term we ll begin to use our solid foundation to judiciously creep and grow our assets where sustainable value drivers exist we ll also use innovation like our elysis technology to disrupt the aluminum industry of the future lastly we ll live with our reputation our values and our expertise which is what makes us uniquely alcoa to be the partner of choice on new projects all with the goal of providing consistent returns for our stockholders in closing as markets trend lower here at the start of 2019 we will continue to drive improvements so we can be competitive through all cycles and react smartly and with urgency to these dynamic conditions as 2019 progresses we ll continue to prioritize safety across the company we see a direct connection between an efficient and effective safety system and our operational and financial performance we ll also remain focused on our strategic priorities we plan to increase operational performance improve the stability of our alumina operations increase or creep volumes in all our businesses and resolve labor issues in a way that enhances the long term viability of our operations we plan to drive improvement in controllable areas within the business but be flexible and nimble enough to react to either favorable or unfavorable changes in market conditions throughout this year we ll evaluate and prioritize future growth options while we continue to optimize our capital structure bill and i are proud to be supported by our employees across the globe and what we ve accomplished as alcoa this past year we stand ready with an even stronger company than the prior year to address the challenges and seize the opportunities that 2019 may bring with that bill and i would be glad to take your questions william if you could please remind us of the protocol and we can get started questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and the first questioner today will be timna tanners of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey happy new year guys roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hey timna william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer hi timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks for all the great detail i guess i had to laugh when i saw that simplification is still a priority because i went to slide 31 and i got really confused so i was hoping you could help without getting too into the minutiae sort of through what those components are are those above and beyond kind of the discussion that bill gave us earlier or are those already in guidance for example when you talk about the mix and the pricing is that something that would already be reflected in your sensitivity charts or tables or is that something that s separate william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer timna it s probably a little bit of a combination so if we just briefly run through it the first of all it talks about the operational stability improvement that we expect to see out of alumina which we highlighted that we had some difficult times this year and we re expecting to recover from that picking up some of the we re picking up some of the overcoming some of the negativity we saw in the fourth quarter on the alumina price mix column so picking up 30 million there giving you an estimate of the flow through of alumina into smelting and that s the 45 million and then the next two are really outsider sensitivities right we don t give you a sensitivity on maintenance spend or what flat rolled products is going to look like in the first quarter so we ve provided that here for you and then the last the second to last one is about raw materials there s so much uncertainty around raw materials right now it s very very difficult to predict where raw materials are going to end the year so we re just trying to point out to you what they look like in the first quarter and then the last bullet point is really a substitution for some of the prior guidance that we ve given around intercompany profit elimination you know now that we re off of lifo i alluded to that in my comments so lifo is now gone so this is just something that will help you understand where the intercompany profit elimination will be based on different api prices so it s a mixture to answer your question timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s helpful and i ll go through that in more detail separately and then i was just wondering i know that it s really fresh talking about the advances in spain but just you know as you talk about the landscape over the past year it had me thinking about where the company s footprint wants to be going forward in current market conditions you ve talked on the potential to restart the refinery in brazil you re producing less in canada can you talk a little bit about how you see the footprint evolving or is this the ideal footprint for the company in the current circumstances and can you give us any color on the impact of the spanish shutdown for operations thanks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah timna so let me let me start at a high level and then i ll get a little bit more granular because i think it s it becomes a different a different question and a different answer for each of the facilities when we look at our portfolio right now i think we feel that in the world in which we ve been living for this past year it s the right portfolio and i d remove spain from that because we ve obviously been having the discussions around the spanish restructuring however that doesn t mean that we are very focused on both looking at our current facilities given this new set of price and conditions and also looking at our footprint and thinking about what is it that we re trying to do with the future and so very simply we see that the value isn t in the number of tons that we produce but in the fact that we have a low cost high quality portfolio that allows us to both weather the downturns but also do a smart job at strengthening ourselves and also improving our production capacity at our current locations when times are better and so and that is a constant process so when you then sort of zoom in and look at this on a case by case basis and so one example that you mentioned was in brazil where we have been idle smelter it s a relatively competitive smelter but that lacks a power contract that makes it competitive in today s world that s something that can shift relatively quickly it depends on the brazilian real it depends on market conditions both inside of brazil and outside of brazil and it also depends on our ability to negotiate with the government both the regional and national government of brazil to find a long term power contract we continue to look at each of our locations to see what can we do to make them stronger whether there is any justification for a restart and additionally and this becomes particularly important at times like today where we see relatively strength strong alumina prices and weaker aluminum prices we also look at our portfolio to do two things number one make sure that when we restart failed electrolytic parts whether we choose to bring them back online again which is very much a variable cost exercise or whether we actually choose to look at a longer term curtailment of a part or all of the facility so it s a rather long winded answer to your question however it really is a constant exercise and something that we ask each of our businesses bauxite alumina and aluminum to be constantly evaluating where they are and ensuring that that then matches up with what we see as the long term fundamentals of our business timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks for that operator and the next questioner today will be alex hacking with citi please go ahead alex hacking citi analyst yeah thank you for the thank you for the question i guess the first question would be around the adjusted net debt goal you mentioned that you can get to that target just based on the mandatory minimum opeb pension payments i guess what would trigger you or what would trigger you to pay above those levels in order to accelerate that target would it just be based on free cash flow levels thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah a good question alex so the as i said we ve got a target that is three to five years out there if we achieve our expected return on assets in the asset portfolio for the pensions of 6 75 and discount rates don t change then we would be able to achieve that target without making any discretionary contributions to the pension above and beyond the mandatory if we were to find ourselves in a position where we don t achieve the expected return on assets or discount rates were to decline from where they sit today we would have to make contributions to achieve that net debt target so that s why we basically are putting the net debt target out there saying hey we should be able to achieve it with the mandatory contributions but if we don t get the expected return on assets or if discount rates change on us considerably we would need to make contributions alex hacking citi analyst okay so just to clarify therefore you would anticipate making no voluntary contributions this year or in 2019 unless there s unexpectedly poor asset performance william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and i yes the only caveat that i would have on that is if we choose to do some level of further de risking you know we ve done de risking in the pension plan in 2018 we contributed the ph whatever 1 billion of cash into the pension plan to be able to take a considerable amount of the liability off the balance sheet but at this point i m not anticipating that we would make that we would make considerable contributions beyond the mandatory alex hacking citi analyst okay thanks and then i guess just my second question on flat rolled are you still comfortable with the guidance that you gave on the last call of around a 25 million run rate i noticed in the commentary that in the first quarter expect it to be quite a bit weaker than that but you did say last quarter that it would be weaker in the first half so is that previous guidance still good william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we gave previous guidance of about 100 million for the year we re still targeting for 100 million for the year and as we say the first quarter will be a little bit weaker than the fourth alex hacking citi analyst thanks a lot operator and the next questioner today will be chris terry with deutsche bank please go ahead christopher terry deutsche bank analyst hi roy and bill yeah i just wanted to feed off the question that alex was asking around around the cash flows just now on slide 15 and 16 in terms of the 150 million you still have remaining in the buyback program and just tying that to what you actually bought back in the latter part of the fourth quarter is the speed of the buyback program that you spend entirely dependent on the ebitda you re actually generating at the time and also the minimum required pension of the 300 million that you re going to spend during this year just trying to get an idea of how you prioritize the buybacks against the other buckets that are mentioned on slide 15 for the excess cash thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so it will be based on having excess cash so i think to answer your question you said hey will be based on ebitda yeah i mean ultimately as ebitda translates into cash flow it will be based on having excess cash and during the course of the year we will make the determination if we have that excess cash we ll weigh it versus the other options that we ve laid out in the capital allocation framework and that s the three things that we talked about there which is returning cash to shareholders potentially further de levering and looking at long term growth opportunities and make a determination so we if there is excess free cash flow we ll evaluate those three given the long term capital allocation program that we ve announced christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks so looks like slide 16 just going down the right hand side of the fy 19 outlook to 300 million sounds like it s pretty fixed and all the capital expenditures so just thinking about the buyback program it really would just come down to what you generate during the year you re not for example going to backpack capex or look at other items within that framework william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the 300 million if you look at us historically it s been pretty steady over the last few years 300 million of sustaining capital goes up or down a little bit over the last few years but 300 million is pretty good number and then 150 million of return seeking that s the we came out with 150 million return seeking target for 2018 we under spent that as you know as the return seeking projects came available we made decisions around how quickly to implement those but that would be the target for 2019 christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks and just the last one for me the slide 19 balances on each of the end markets what have you assumed for alunorte on the alumina balance thanks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so on the alumina balance we assume essentially status quo as of today so there is no assumed restart and not because we re taking a position on that but simply because we wanted to put a stake in the ground as what does the market look like prior to the return and it s the same impact on aluminum as well with albras which is connected over to alunorte christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thank you that s it for me operator and the next questioner today will be matthew korn with goldman sachs please go ahead matthew korn goldman sachs analyst hey good evening everybody thanks for taking my questions william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer good day matthew matthew korn goldman sachs analyst a question on the situation in spain could you explain a little bit more next steps on the worker negotiations there you say the release there s a vote at the end of the month does that need approval by the provincial government are there any other hurdles that you re going to need to clear before you can move forward there roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah matthew let me take a stab at that one so essentially the process is pretty well laid out from here going forward and i ll give you some caveats about what will happen so first of all we have an agreement with the workers representatives and so that is a very positive step the next step and this will happen in about a week is that the workers will then have their option to opine about that if so assuming that they agree that essentially means we go into the program as it s already defined and so we start curtailment and the workforce will participate in those activities and then we ll continue on to the rest of what you ve seen there we will continue to operate the casthouses we will keep those plants for six months until the end of june in a position where it can be restarted and we ll look to see if there is someone that wants to step into those operating positions if the workforce would choose not to agree with the program as laid out we then have 15 days in order to decide how we react to that choice again that s a very prescripted ph legal process inside of spain however that s i wouldn t want to try and foreshadow what the decision would be at that particular moment matthew korn goldman sachs analyst i appreciate it thanks for the clarity i also want to dig a little bit more on some of your market outlooks on the different commodities in alumina china is ever the linchpin there what how much additional refining capacity are you counting on in that in that base case for chinese alumina supply in 19 then because it s connected what s i guess what s your net view on chinese smelter production into next year roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah and it s hard to pin down what should the exact number be and i think you re touching on this matthew because the fact is the chinese if anything are very reactive to the way the pricing the way that the pricing happens to be pointing them and so we saw very quickly at the end of this year that when that gap between global pricing and chinese pricing was in their favor they were able to export and when that gap closed they very quickly stopped exporting and so as we build our balances we always take into account how we think how we think conditions should develop on the ground and so that s a bit of a caveat of how we try to build that and inside of that we then think about what new capacity has been announced how will the capacities then adapt to that particular to that particular situation that we find ourselves so for alumina i m trying to think back i don t have i don t have the number right in my mind and i don t have it i don t have it right in front of me either essentially what we ve done is we ve taken the announced the announced new facilities coming online and there have been a few of those we ve taken into consideration also the relatively short term winter curtailments and we did have one curtailment that was announced and has been acted upon and we then we then brought that into what we think that supply demand balance would be inside of china matthew korn goldman sachs analyst i appreciate it good job with everything guys in what s been a really challenging year william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah thanks matt operator and the next questioner today will be piyush sood with morgan stanley please go ahead piyush sood morgan stanley analyst roy bill congratulation on the quarter a couple of questions first one you were forecasting a deficit in aluminum in 2018 and now a bigger deficit in 2019 just want to understand how do you account for china s 5 million ton plus exports in this so without chinese exports would the world ex china be in a much bigger deficit just want to understand your how you account for those flows and also why do you think aluminum prices are where they are right now despite these large deficits roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so let me answer your deficit question first and then we can step in and talk a little bit more about the price question so remember when you look at that page it is specifically dealing with primary aluminum balances and so that has advantages and it has disadvantages it s a relatively simplified world view so inside of that let s take the china balance very specifically inside of that if they are producing semi fabricated products that are actually intended for export it still counts as chinese demand because it s consuming primary material either as that first very basic primary product or as molten metal that s included in chinese demand if that then is exported that then becomes an input into what is being consumed outside of china so when you look at the rest of world demand there is actually an impact of those 5 8 million tons that are falling out there is a negative impact because now you re not just demanding primary aluminum to go into those semi fabricated products you re actually consuming some of that some of that chinese material so essentially the impact on the global balances is negligible because it is embedded in the way that we re doing these primary aluminum balances however it does serve in two ways it serves as a connection between the two markets but then it also serves it allows this overcapacity in china to be turned into products and that then those products are then exported and sold outside of china and so it does very much have an impact on what s happening with global supply and demand balances but it also has an impact on what s happening in aluminum pricing so i ll use that to move right into your second question so first and foremost i think it s obvious that there is a lot of there s a lot of talk right now about global trade about what investors feel about future demand and economic activities et cetera so certainly there is an overarching overlay of what s happening in the general market inside of our market specifically i think it s very much the discussions that are happening right now about overcapacity that s having an impact on short term prices when you look at some of the most recent developments the oecd study that looked at subsidies inside of the aluminum industry that found that china was very much an outlier both on the size of the subsidies that are given to producers but also the availability of those subsidies to its own specific domestic producers and so as we see that overcapacity develop and as china essentially moves from being just a primary producer into a semi fabricated producer it tends to give a negative pall to the broader market and so as we saw that extra million tons being exported in the form of semi fabricated products we believe that it s had a negative impact on pricing as the market has seen that material that doesn t necessarily flow to the us for example but can flow into the global market whether it s in eastern asia or europe or other parts of the world and so when we look at both the broader economics but then also the dynamics of this over overcapacitization and overproduction inside of china we believe that those things are having an outsized impact on prices one more comment though and i ll link this back to my comments at the beginning the simple fact is in the pricing environment in which we live today and when you look at the economics of producing aluminum these prices cannot be sustainable they can t be sustainable because half of all capacity in china is now losing cash and again china tends to act pretty economically rationally when it comes to these types of decisions when you then look at the whole world it s somewhere between 35 and 40 of all smelters and weighted toward china that are currently losing money as well and so that means that the pricing as it is right now certainly doesn t sustain continued production at these levels much less ever incentivize new capacity to come online and so it s an unsustainable margin trend that we found has occurred in prior years but has been pretty quick to self correct simply because it is not something that can continue and therefore justify by continuing to produce piyush sood morgan stanley analyst that s helpful and a question on slide 16 the prior period taxes of 360 million just want to understand if what s attributable to you versus alumina limited should we assume a split around 60 40 or anything you could talk about that william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the it s a great question and it should be you should note that it s a line item that we haven t provided in the past and we re making sure that people understand that we do have trailing tax payments that have to be made largely and predominantly in australia right because our awac enterprise makes a lot of makes a lot of the money that it makes in australia so a big piece of that would be a 60 40 split because it s in the awac enterprise so good question piyush piyush sood morgan stanley analyst all right and thank you and last one slide 31 when we think of alumina operational stability should we think of it as a second half transition or can that happen in maybe 1q or 2q william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll let roy talk about it but i guess my view is we started to see some of that stability come back in the fourth quarter already if you look at the fourth quarter numbers we started to see that stability versus what we had seen in the second and the third quarter and in my view we ve largely regained much of the stability that we have around the system so i think we should start to see that in the first half already roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah i completely agree with bill our expectation is that we see a stable alumina business through the entire 12 months piyush sood morgan stanley analyst thanks guys and all the best roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks piyush operator and the next questioner today will be lucas pipes with b riley fbr please go ahead lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst hey good afternoon everyone wanted to ask a quick question on the buyback of 50 million during the fourth quarter could you share with us kind of at what price you were buying back stock and then also why not more and when do you intend to increase purchases again thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i think the average price was 29 01 in the 50 million that we spent and the question of why not more we had a capital allocation program that s at we wanted to target a minimum threshold of keeping 1 billion we were really looking at cash as it was coming in during the course of the quarter and then the other key aspect is that we had a fairly short window in which we could buy back you know we renegotiated our revolver in the fourth quarter also in renegotiating our revolver we were blacked out so we had only a short period of time in the fourth quarter in which we were able to be buying back before we then went into the blackout period associated with earnings at the end of the year so that s the reason why we did not do more lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst got it that s helpful hopefully you will not get another opportunity to buy at 25 but william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer i m sorry 29 01 29 01 lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst no i was being i was being facetious william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer i know i m with you i mean we don t get an opportunity to buy at 25 lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst but just another follow up i think it was page 16 where you gives the operational tax rate i m a little confused about why it s higher in 19 given the lower alumina price could you maybe share a little bit more color on what s driving that increase for the 2019 guidance versus 18 thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer it all comes down to where you make your profits and the jurisdictions in which you re making profits and so clearly we didn t provide you a full year ebitda guidance but given today s prices with the alumina and aluminum where it s at we would anticipate that tax rate right so we re essentially just basically taking the current market prices for aluminum and alumina trying to determine where we re going to make profits and also have losses and that s what generates that 45 to 55 i would point to you that i did make it clear in my comments that at today s prices we d probably be at the upper end of that so it s 50 to 55 range lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst got it okay well thank you very much and best of luck william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks lucas operator and the last questioner today will be justin bergner with gabelli and company please go ahead justin bergner gabelli and company analyst thank you for fitting me in roy and bill good afternoon roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hey justin justin bergner gabelli and company analyst just hi a couple of quick cleanup questions is the cash tax in the book tax is the cash tax rate also expected to be in that 45 to 55 range william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer you know i would have to look justin i think the really key thing for the modeling purposes is that you understand that cash tax catch up right so that s why we pointed out that it s an incremental 200 million of cash tax catch up that was associated with profits that we made in 18 that we have to pay in 19 justin bergner gabelli and company analyst okay great yeah i was asking ex the catch up but i assume i ll loop up for some more clarity later in the press release you mention a 70 million to 80 million benefit from the curtailment proposed in spain i assume some of that benefit on the net income line is related to the impairment and reduced depreciation so can you give a sense as to how much that should aid ebitda william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer you know i don t have it off the top of my head so you have to circle back with jim on how much is that i mean one thing to keep in mind that in spain pre tax and post tax are largely the same because we ve got a valuation allowance on the tax rate in spain so the 70 million to 80 million of net income the 70 million to 80 million of pre tax how much of that is the ebitda i m not certain of i m sorry how much of that is depreciation i m not certain of that off the top of my head justin bergner gabelli and company analyst okay thanks and then lastly the maintenance spend tick up is that just a first quarter phenomenon or is that going to continue throughout 2019 relative to what you spent in 2018 william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer that s a first quarter phenomenon and i guess to circle back to some extent where we started with timna s question the reason why we provided that extra page bullet point guidance is because given the fact that as roy said we re not providing the full year ebitda guidance we felt compelled to try to give you some much better insight into both the first quarter and the full year but to specifically answer your question that s as a first quarter guidance item roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and just to add one more piece of information justin just to give you a little bit more of an explanation the largest part of our facilities in refining happen to be in the southern hemisphere and so so we tend to see a reverse trend it s now the summer summer months when we tend to see more maintenance happening or some of the larger maintenance activities so it tends to be pretty cyclical that the beginning of the year tends to be one of the most important maintenance months for us justin bergner gabelli and company analyst okay great thank you for taking my questions roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you justin operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to roy harvey for any closing remarks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer great william thank you and once again thanks to everyone for joining our earnings call today today s results reflect the success of our strategic priorities and how much stronger alcoa is today than when we launched in late 2016 we have more opportunities to drive value for stockholders this year and we look forward to updating you again at the end of the first quarter so thank you and william back to you operator and the conference has now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation and you may now disconnect your lines duration 61 minutes call participants james dwyer vice president of investor relations roy c harvey

argentine businessmen marco meloni is doing everything he can to avoid laying off staff at his textile factory despite a slump in sales 70 per cent plus interest rates and soaring utility bills the reason he doesn t have the money to fire anyone a little reported and unusual feature of the economic crisis gripping latin america s third largest economy is the absence of many workers losing their jobs small businesses the biggest employer in argentina have been hardest hit by inflation that is nearly 48 per cent a tumbling peso and major cuts to subsidies for public utilities that have sharply increased companies operating costs but the unemployment rate has barely budged from 9 per cent reuters interviews with business owners in textile plastic clothing and paint industries government officials and union leaders show that many firms are adopting different strategies to try to survive until the economy begins to recover which the international monetary fund expects to begin in the second quarter firms are reducing working hours halting production on some days cutting shifts and making workers take their vacations now in anticipation of more customer demand once the economy lifts the work force contracted by just 120 000 registered workers between october 2017 and october 2018 the latest government data reviewed by reuters show that represents about 1 per cent of the 12 million strong labour force in contrast the united states lost about 6 per cent or some 8 7 million people of its work force during the two years of the 2007 08 great recession as companies laid off workers to stay afloat argentina has some of the world s most generous labour laws and they are making it more difficult for small business owners to adapt to an economy now in recession typically in a tough economic climate a company might be expected to reduce its work force to cut costs but in argentina taking that step could dramatically increase costs and potentially push a company into bankruptcy introduced by successive populist peronist governments since the 1940s the labour laws make the country one of the most expensive in latin america to employ or fire a worker argentine companies are required to pay workers laid off a month for every year of service plus at least one additional month simply for informing them they are being fired and crucially there is no cap on how much a company needs to pay in contrast neighbouring chile has a cap on severance pay layoff costs in argentina are among the highest in the world according to the world bank s doing business project which measures business regulations in 190 economies the argentine labour laws have helped to contain what could have been a big increase in the unemployment rate in addition president mauricio macri a free marketer who wants to reform the country s rigid labour system to encourage foreign investment is taking steps to dissuade companies from firing workers he announced on nov 13 that companies must give 10 days notice of any plans to lay off workers so that the government can help find ways to keep them employed mr macri wants to expand an existing program that helps to subsidize salaries of workers at companies that can show they are in financial straits the government has not yet issued any regulations to enforce its announcement so it is not clear whether companies are informing them of pending dismissals like many small businessmen mr meloni has found himself caught in a vise sales from his plant in the town of quilmes 30 kilometres from buenos aires shrank by slightly more than one third last year as argentina s economy sank deep into recession it was not a storm said mr meloni a reference to how the country s president has described the economic crisis it was a tsunami the tsunami kills mr meloni said his plant which makes fabrics used to operate 24 hours a day from monday to saturday but now just operates 16 hours a day five days a week like many other business owners mr meloni advanced the holidays to his roughly 100 employees with the hope that once summer ends in march demand will pick up daniel funes de rioja the head of one of argentina s biggest labour law firms said a major issue for companies was the seniority of many workers many especially in low skilled industries stay in the same job for years so paying them severance becomes very expensive there s a cultural custom for argentines to remain in their jobs but also as it has been always very expensive to fire people that has extended the length of service of the workers in the companies explained economist camilo tiscornia from buenos aires based c t consultancy argentine production minister dante sica said companies were also reluctant to fire workers because of forecasts showing an economic recovery around the corner they prefer to suspend and not fire because of the cost of layoffs plus the cost of hiring is costly mr sica said in an interview the unemployment rate in argentina fell to 9 per cent in the third quarter from 9 6 per cent in the second quarter year on year it increased only 0 7 basis points from the third quarter of 2017 when the economy was growing at an annual rate of 3 8 per cent while workers are staying in their jobs they are earning less because of the shorter hours and fewer shifts some have resorted to taking second jobs working for uber the ride hailing app for example according to anecdotal reports we are not happy with these measures at all but the last thing we want is layoffs said jose minaberrigaray head of setia a textile workers union that represents 25 000 workers but we have to choose what is bad and what is worse he said president macri has pushed for labour reforms to make it easier for companies to hire and fire but his government has delayed implementing them after protests in december 2017 mr sica has said the government will try again in 2019 but it will be difficult to get political support for the reforms in an election year mr tiscornia the economist said the difficulty in firing workers ultimately hurts the competitiveness of argentine companies making it easier to fire people or to reduce salaries improves the economy efficiency and the companies capacity to adjust to different situations he said in the u s it s tremendously easy to fire but at the same time they are at the lowest historic jobless rate because that market has very strong flexibility that favours the creation of new companies here if you start a business and it doesn t work you are stuck with the employees so you don t even try at the metallurgical company where pablo mansur 31 works production has fallen 30 per cent over the past 12 months to keep busy workers are painting cleaning and doing repairs mr mansur said workers were also told to take their vacations in december a period when production would be low any way because of public holidays he said workers agreed to this because we are aware of the reality it is not a whim he said jorge gottert president of gottert a 75 year old company that makes production line systems for the wood and auto sectors says he has tried not to lay off workers because of his memories of what happened during the country s worst financial crisis in 2001 then the company laid off half of its staff to try to survive when the economy rebounded however it became very difficult for us as it took time to rebuild its work force training new workers to operate the specialized machinery we think this crisis will be shorter this time

end of year 2018 was one of the worst that u s stock markets have experienced and traders had no trouble finding reasons for pessimism like maybe the end of democracy or at a minimum a slowing of its economic benefits is nigh beginning in december the u s government was closed indefinitely the shutdown was kicked down the road to the next congress and the new congress is as of this writing in a stalemate with the executive branch an economy shrinkingtrade war is in effect the ipcc told us we have 12 years to get our act together on climate disruption and a u s federal climate change report described the dangerous consequences for american farmers if changes aren t made soon it s enough to make you ask what s the point of being worried stewart brand wrote science is the only news human nature doesn t change much science does and the change accrues altering the world irreversibly in that light this period is likely to be remembered by history less for trump and more as the time when humanity took control of its own evolution artificial intelligence ai began to usher in a new world order and we either lost or regained control of our system level risks it is in these last three pieces of our only news as brand would have it that we see our present paradox risks and innovation are peaking together today it s not clear to which side of the knife s edge humanity will fall toward an unimaginably better future of abundance or to an unimaginably worse one of ruin and dystopia this double precipice is why we have to invest to manage the risks that matter in 2018 and particularly in q4 markets began exhibiting the volatility we predicted would occur within the context of unpredictable political leadership at the same time business results if not share prices have been improving steadily in many next economy areas one of our holdings first solar was a prime example of this so what did we observe about the ongoing transition to the next economy in 2018 for those who may want a refresher on our thesis of next economics a quick audio overview can be found here and a more thorough white paper treatment is here growing corporate commitments to 100 percent renewables based operations in 2018 we saw de politicization of renewable energy as an idea corporations and governments around the world made formal commitments to deriving 100 percent of their electricity production from renewable sources usually meaning wind and solar supported by battery storage a yale survey reported that 81 percent of americans including 64 percent of republicans now support renewable energy we ve always believed that renewables represent great economic development and wealth creation opportunities while countering climate disruption and reducing pollution therefore wind and solar should not be pawns in culture wars and more generally innovation shouldn t and ultimately can t be contained by ideology at the end of 2018 re 100 an informal group of global companies committed to running their operations on 100 percent renewable energies had 158 of the world s largest companies as signatories many companies are eager to adopt renewable energies for the same reasons we invest in them they de risk the global economy relative to fossil fuels and they are cheap meaning they increase the productivity of every dollar invested in a company it s not surprising that 2018 was a record year for corporate purchasing of renewable energies as deloitte said of energy in 2018 solar and wind move from mainstream to preferred electric vehicles are booming according to the u s department of energy 1 million plug in vehicles have been sold in the united states as of october 2018 up from zero in 2010 electric vehicles reached a per month sales crescendo until the next one of 45 000 vehicles per month this is occurring even though overall vehicle sales are down meaning evs are increasing their market share this has significant implications not only for climate change and pollution mitigation but also for industries all along the value chain of evs advanced materials battery storage microgrids ai including autonomy charging infrastructure and electricity demand versus liquid btu demand all these areas are likely to see more rapid growth audi mercedes benz bmw and bmw mini nissan porsche kia and volvo all have announced new all electric vehicles for 2019 and many more will follow in 2020 including vw we predict evs will continue to be responsible for any new growth in the personal vehicle space california is leading the world s fifth largest economy showed us how to accelerate the transition to sustainability the highlight was sb 100 a law that set a target of 100 percent clean energy by 2045 making california the largest political jurisdiction to make such a commitment the law confirmed new standards that require panels to be installed on any new home or low rise residential building of three stories or less about 80 000 new homes a year that could quadruple the amount of solar in california the state s 100 percent zero emission bus rule states that all state transit authorities must convert to 100 percent electric transit vehicles by 2040 by 2029 all government transit bus services have to be zero emissions vehicles and california is providing incentives for cities to get there in electricity transit and electrification of homes including heating the importance of california s efforts shouldn t be understated over and over we ve seen that centers of innovation lead to global changes even in the face of significant resistance the economic scale of the state alone means businesses around the world hoping to sell into or work in the state must adapt to their policies however the political economy of technology is now visibly ascendant the days of policy preceding change are ending and policy is increasingly reacting to tech and innovation based change thus for us investing on the basis of proactive policy will be of limited utility california s leadership is outstanding but it works because the underlying green tech is productive and economically efficient all that said intelligent policy will pay for research that is likely to improve green tech over the long term but does not have immediate return on investment here too california is going solo and in the lead see worth s interview with california governor gavin newsom here ai is rising my firm green alpha invests along the value chain that is enabling ai to emerge as a source of innovation e g google s quantum computing and perhaps more important a way to address problems insoluble by human minds ultimately is may even enable humanity to have good standards of living around the world without further crossing planetary boundaries taking the long view steven strogatz has put it down clearly we will recall with pride the golden era of human insight this glorious interlude a few thousand years long between our uncomprehending past and our incomprehensible future green alpha s 2019 outlook speaking of the future in the near term a lot will have to happen for markets to become less volatile markets thrive on political and economic stability free trade cheap capital and stimulative fiscal policies all of which are in question or even at bay in 2019 fred smith ceo of fedex explained the situation in his firm s most recent guidancecommentary saying issues we re dealing with today are induced by bad political decisions among these he listed unilateral tariffs by the u s brexit and state owned enterprise initiatives in china as things that have created a macroeconomic slowdown as stock prices have been declining bond prices have been going up which is what happens when equity markets begin to lose confidence and traders prefer the perceived security of debt instead that means lower yields but it also means cheaper borrowing for mortgages and for corporations looking to invest more in their businesses so the rotation to bonds is not an unmitigated negative for the economy in the u s one of the key economic developments of 2018 was tax reform policymakers inarguably gave the american economy a short term boost by lowering taxes this break was primarily given to corporations secondarily for wealthy individuals and families and lastly and not much for average people that boost takes many forms including capital spending increased consumption more market liquidity more corporate stock buybacks mergers and acquisitions and some dividend increases in the early part of 2018 markets responded accordingly rising in q1 and q2 even in the face of political uncertainties and trade wars what about the long term effects of tax reform we see two probable unfavorable areas of outcome one and the more serious is the effect it will have in increasing the scope and intensity of structural wealth inequality a dangerous systemic risk too much dynastic unearned concentrated wealth in the hands of too few does not tend to end well historically speaking the second negative outcome will be the effects of a growing national debt potentially more interest expense less capacity for expenditure where needed and downgraded faith in our currency and debt instruments are the usual long term effects of too much sovereign debt as long as the u s dollar remains the world reserve currency the debt and deficit risks can be managed fairly easily by money creation and productivity gains but if global confidence in america diminishes and as other currencies including sovereigns and cryptos become favored stores of value the u s could face a real debt crisis think of greece but with an economy 954 times larger in 2016 gdp terms this latter risk isn t likely to manifest in 2019 but the possibility is now visible not too long ago it would have been unthinkable a meaningful socioeconomic indicator to keep an eye on in 2019 will be improving inclusivity in business as our own portfolio results indicate more diverse teams are associated with better business outcomes they are more innovative solve problems better and have better risk profiles to look for progress we can look at metrics like increasing women and minorities in leadership teams and on boards of directors diversity economics also encompasses less formal observations such as proportions of women invited to speak at conferences women and minorities authoring papers and other influential content and entry level hiring statistics as mentioned above widening inequality is one of the primary risks the economy is facing and de fusing this risk is a clear way to both seek returns and lower the overall risk profile of the global economy while preserving wealth and purchasing power overall what is likely in 2019 for the transition to the next economy we expect that prices for wind and solar will continue to fall dramatically and record low contracts for power purchasing will continue to be announced this will put coal and natural gas in a less competitive position and 2019 won t be close to the last year of this general trend corporations from transportation to utilities will continue to announce work towards and reach 100 percent renewable energy and or zero emissions goals these two effects are locked in a virtuous cycle the more deployment of zero emissions tech the less expensive it becomes leading to more demand and still faster growth even in the event of slowing global economic growth overall zero emissions tech will continue to gain market share from dirtier more expensive riskier technologies like fossil fuels and internal combustion economic cultural and technological change will continue to accelerate as will the world s system level risks we developed our next economy investment framework because of this confluence we invest in the next economy and de risk our portfolios from risks like resource degradation and climate disruption in the end this will be the only way for investors to preserve their purchasing power in the face of change first principles require us to evaluate the world as it is and act accordingly

being recorded and now i would like to turn the conference over to james dwyer vice president of investor relations please go ahead james dwyer vice president of investor relations thank you william and good day everyone i m joined today by roy harvey alcoa corporation president and chief executive officer and william oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer we will take your questions after comments by roy and bill as a reminder today s discussion will contain forward looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today s presentation and in our sec filings in addition we have included some non gaap financial measures in this presentation reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures can be found in the appendix to today s presentation any reference in our discussion today to ebitda means adjusted ebitda also a note on our financial statements consistent with our three previous 2018 earnings presentations all comparative prior periods have been updated in accordance with the financial accounting standard board s recent change to the presentation of non service pension and opeb costs this change resulted in alcoa moving such costs out of ebitda and into other income expense finally as previously announced the earnings release and slide presentation are available on our website with that i ll turn it over to roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you jim and thank you to everyone for joining today s earnings call our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results reflect our determination to accelerate the strengthening of alcoa despite sequentially weaker markets we had a strong fourth quarter with higher profits in our bauxite and alumina business units and with the help of higher market prices earlier in the year we increased annual profits addressed liabilities significantly strengthened our balance sheet and began to return cash to stockholders we ve built upon the progress we ve made since our launch and by executing our strategic priorities to reduce complexity drive returns and strengthen the balance sheet we re better positioned to thrive through market cycles but as we turn to 2019 markets have trended lower and there is increased uncertainty surrounding global trade this has created a dynamic environment for input pricing and product pricing our businesses however are ready for these challenges and we are determined to drive improved operations react smartly and with urgency to changing market conditions and to further strengthen our company s foundation with that let s get started with an overview of the fourth quarter we reported net income of 43 million or 0 23 a share on an adjusted basis excluding special items net income was 125 million or 0 66 a share on an adjusted ebitda basis excluding special items we generated 749 million and reported solid cash generation turning to our businesses and beginning with safety the fourth quarter was free of serious injuries we re very happy with this achievement and we look forward to building upon it as the year progresses operationally in alumina our pinjarra refinery in western australia one of the largest in the world attained a fourth quarter production record our alumina segment also reported a rise in quarterly profit in aluminum last month we curtailed half of the one operating potline at the becancour smelter in quebec canada this will enable our salaried employees to continue to run this portion of the line safely with a smaller workforce meanwhile we continue to work on reaching a new labor contract with the unionized workforce also this quarter we began to buy back shares under the stock repurchase program announced in the third quarter and we successfully amended our revolving credit agreement reflecting our improving financial profile lastly overnight in spain we reached a tentative agreement with the workers representatives at our aviles and la coruna aluminum plants related to the collective dismissal process that we announced in october the workforce is expected to vote on the tentative plan by the end of the month the plan calls for the curtailment of the smelters at both plants the casthouses at each plant will remain in operation and the paste plant at la coruna will continue to operate our social plan included in the tentative agreement preserves a portion of the jobs at the two facilities and includes retirement packages and potential relocation to our san ciprian facility taking a broader look at 2018 as i mentioned earlier we can see a strengthening alcoa and it s visible across safety our balance sheet and our financial performance compared to 2017 we grew revenue and net income and we increased adjusted ebitda excluding special items by 27 reaching 3 1 billion we reduced our pension and opeb net liabilities by a third enhancing our balance sheet all while maintaining a healthy cash balance in safety we experienced three serious injuries in 2018 but we were grateful to have no fatalities last year our focus across the year has been to revitalize our safety program and we look to improve safety further this year and beyond despite operational issues earlier in the year we saw annual production records at two of our aluminum plants and two of our bauxite mines we completed the partial restart of our warrick smelter to support profitably growing our can sheet business and we launched a joint venture to develop our carbon free aluminum smelting technology we re proud of what we ve accomplished in 2018 and how this work has positioned us for the coming years furthermore with two years of actual results now behind us and given industry practice and market volatility we are amending the way that we provide annual outlook information to more fully describe business drivers rather than point in time estimates bill will offer more details on this change with that i ll turn it over to bill for a detailed review of fourth quarter results william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks roy let s start with the income statement sequentially revenues are down 46 million on lower aluminum and alumina prices compared to last year revenues are up 170 million primarily on higher alumina prices in the quarter the net income attributable to alcoa corporation was 43 million or 0 23 per share on 188 2 million shares outstanding special items in the quarter totaled 82 million after tax and noncontrolling interests of the 138 million of restructuring before tax and noncontrolling interests 107 million was to establish an allowance on brazil state vat credits while the company retains the ability to utilize the credits in the future only the restart of our sao luis smelter provides the opportunity to monetize the credits amid unfavorable market conditions and with the current inability to obtain a favorable power contract we felt it necessary to stop recording additional vat credit and to establish an allowance on the current balances we still believe the sao luis smelter assets are valuable for the future and continue to maintain the smelter assets other restructuring charges of note include 12 million for pension and opeb actions and 8 million for take or pay contracts at idled facilities now let s look at the income statement excluding special items our fourth quarter 18 adjusted net income excluding special items was 125 million or 0 66 per share adjusted ebitda excluding special items was 749 million down 46 million sequentially primarily due to lower metal prices our fourth quarter ebitda margin was 22 a few other items of note on a sequential comparison basis other expenses increased 25 million due to losses in the aluminum side of our saudi joint venture and lower foreign currency benefits our operational tax rate in the quarter was 38 8 6 8 percentage points lower sequentially in the third quarter we had a higher tax rate to catch up our full year rate as rising alumina prices changed our mix of taxable earnings and nontaxable losses our share count decreased ph 0 5 million shares due to stock repurchases and a decrease in common share equivalents in the fourth quarter we repurchased 1 7 million shares for 50 million an average price of 29 01 commodity pricing changes had both positive and negative impacts this quarter and even with improved volume drove slightly lower sequential result negative drivers were lower metal prices unfavorable contract pricing true ups in our alumina segment compared to favorable true ups last quarter and lower energy prices in brazil major positives came from improved sales volume due to higher production in all three segments the other major benefit came from lower quarter end prices driving positive corporate inventory accounting impacts compared to negative impacts last quarter raw materials cost increases have moderated and even provided a slight benefit this quarter now let s shift our focus to the segments in the segments bauxite adjusted ebitda improved 4 million on increased production from the huntly and cbg mines alumina adjusted ebitda improved 23 million strong production recovery and higher api prices were offset by the favorable pricing true ups from last quarter turning negative this quarter the aluminum segment was down 126 million primarily on lower metal prices and lower earnings from our brazil hydro assets higher alumina costs continued to flow through the segment which offset the volume gains from the business outside of the segments for the quarter non segment impacts netted to positive 9 million corporate inventory accounting was a benefit as alumina and aluminum prices dropped at quarter end in the fourth quarter we ended the year with cash of 1 1 billion up 91 million sequentially and down 245 million year over year as noted earlier 50 million of share repurchases took place in the quarter with a matching amount used to reduce debt and make pension contributions a quick review of our major cash sources and uses for 2018 our total sources of 2 2 billion were comprised of 1 6 billion in operating cash flow and 600 million of debt issuances and other sources uses were in three major categories pension and opeb minority interest distributions and capital expenditures and other we funded 1 1 billion in the pension and post retirement benefits programs including 412 million of required funding 225 million related to annuitizations and discretionary contributions and 500 million building a pre funding balance with proceeds of may s 500 million bond offering separate from pension the largest outflows of cash were net distributions to our joint venture minority interest partner of 678 million and roughly 400 million of capital expenditures now let s take a look at the balance sheet this quarter we continued strengthening the balance sheet our net debt to adjusted ebitda is down to 0 2 times return on capital for fiscal year 2018 is 11 9 our fourth quarter days working capital was 22 days down 4 days from the third quarter and an 11 day increase year over year reflecting higher raw material prices lower buy resell activities and timing of vendor payments most importantly our pension and opeb net liability ended the year at 2 3 billion down 1 2 billion year over year sequentially it was up 200 million after a year end remeasurement as unfavorable asset returns due to the global market decline in the fourth quarter overshadowed slightly improved discount rates the year end remeasurement offset earlier favorable interim remeasurement we ve completed our 2018 capital allocation framework and as previously mentioned we started a stock repurchase program and repurchased 1 7 million shares these shares were retired and not held in treasury stock our future capital allocation framework follows a theme similar to 2018 we will continue balancing many factors in light of expected market conditions challenges and opportunities but foremost will be maintaining liquidity and managing investments to sustain the business and drive value we will also continue our drive toward obtaining an optimal capital structure returning cash to stockholders and when appropriate investing in value creating growth projects to measure attaining an optimal capital structure we re using an adjusted net debt metric on a proportional basis at year end 2018 it was 3 3 billion and our target over the next three to five years is to reduce it to 2 0 billion to 2 5 billion it s important to note that this range can be achieved by making our minimum required pension and opeb payments assuming we achieve our expected asset return and no change in discount rates we have 150 million remaining under our existing 200 million repurchase authorization as with our adjusted net debt target we will execute the repurchase program based on cash flows marker conditions and other relevant factors now let s review the full year outlook for 2019 as roy mentioned due to its limited utility to investors and unprecedented market volatility we re eliminating the quarterly point in time full year ebitda outlook instead adding more cash flow information on the outlook page and adding another page of business commentary in the appendix starting with the income statement in the segments compared to 2018 we expect that 2019 bauxite shipments will be flat to up 1 million tons and alumina shipments will be flat to up 100 000 tons alumina production gains will translate into fewer purchased tons in 2019 aluminum shipments will decline 500 000 tons to 600 000 tons year over year partially a result of the expiration of the tennessee tolling agreement outside the segments we expect transformation to be in the range of 10 million to 20 million primarily due to lower power revenues in suriname in 2019 we will stop using lifo inventory accounting and metal lag will be included in the aluminum segment leaving intercompany profit eliminations as the sole corporate inventory impact we plan to restate 2018 financial results in the first quarter but the impact will be insignificant for the year moving forward intercompany profit eliminations will vary based on ending period prices and inventory levels and we are including a sensitivity in the appendix other corporate expense will increase approximately 20 million due to higher resource unit and labor costs below the ebitda line there are anticipated improvements in depreciation depletion and amortization down 33 million to 700 million and net pension and opeb expense is improving roughly 20 down 24 million to 115 million interest expense is essentially flat year over year we expect our 2019 operational tax rate to range from 45 to 55 a result of losses in non tax paying jurisdictions and dependent upon and that s dependent upon market conditions based on today s spot prices we would be toward the top end of that range in our expanded cash flow section we have some key expectations minimum required pension opeb funding is down 27 from 412 million to 300 million additional liability optimization via debt reduction or pension funding as well as stock repurchases will be based on market conditions and cash availability sustaining and return seeking capital expenditures are set the same as last year s targets at 300 million and 150 million respectively because we saw higher earnings in 2018 in tax jurisdictions paid on a lag basis we expect previous period tax payments to increase by approximately 200 million to approximately 360 million in 2019 we have completed our payment schedule for the doj sec settlement environmental and aro spending is expected to be back to its previously targeted range of 110 million to 120 million and cash impacts of restructuring charges for example our wenatchee power payment were 103 million in 2018 as roy noted earlier we have reached tentative agreement with works councils at our aviles and la coruna smelters upon ratification by the workforce we would expect 2019 restructuring cash impacts to range from 90 million to 115 million in addition depending on the ultimate outcome of the process the company could incur further charges ranging from 125 million to 135 million of which 75 would be non cash the remaining 25 would result in cash outlays after 2019 in the appendix you ll continue to find the cost and ebitda sensitivities as well as a discussion of key business considerations those considerations include for example the expected sequential impacts of favorable alumina contractual pricing of approximately 30 million and lower alumina costs in the smelters of 40 million to 45 million as well as anticipated unfavorable impacts of increased maintenance activities in the aluminum segment of approximately 30 million and roughly 15 million lower earnings in the rolling business so with that i ll turn it back to you roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you bill turning to our market outlook first i d like to highlight why we re excited about the future of our aluminum market beginning on the left hand portion of the slide long term demand growth is expected to remain robust in the next five years when looking at expected consumption growth aluminum continues to outpace competing materials we expect that demand growth for primary aluminum will remain strong at a 3 4 compound annual growth rate to 2023 we re also fortunate to have a well diversified base of sectors that consume aluminum in fact no one sector makes up more than about 25 of aluminum demand the three largest sectors construction transportation and packaging are each expected to have significant growth worldwide in the next five years we expect transportation demand for aluminum for example to grow at a 3 9 compound annual growth rate supported by trends that include rising wealth in emerging economies and the light weighting and electrification of vehicle fleets the electrical sector is also expected to contribute significant demand growth by 2023 especially in india a country that is responsible for almost 1 million tons of growth during this period in the developed markets of north america and europe where most of our production is located aluminum consumption growth is expected to outpace positive overall gdp growth positive economic growth in both mature and emerging markets will therefore provide a steady source of demand growth for the many critical end products that rely on aluminum and their supply chain while new aluminum supply will come online over these five years in the near term particularly we expect that supply growth will not keep up with consumption given the more restrictive approach to operational permitting inside china and a clear capital cost disadvantage restricting new supply outside of china 2018 saw a primary aluminum deficit worldwide and we expect another deficit for 2019 now we ll look more closely at our balance estimates for each of our three markets starting with the bauxite market we see the 2018 bauxite surplus continuing into 2019 as exports from guinea australia and indonesia climb year over year chinese customers stockpile bauxite strategically due to uncertain sourcing both within and outside china and this surplus will likely enable them to grow that stockpile again this year in alumina as you know 2018 was an extraordinary year as third party supply disruptions in brazil and other factors pushed the market into a deficit for 2019 we re forecasting an alumina surplus in china driven by refinery expansions and lower than previously expected smelting production due to economic and environmental reasons in the world ex china we expect the market to be approximately balanced as refining expansions keep pace with rising demand lacking concrete information about if or when third party disruptions may be resolved our estimates assume that the status quo will continue finally we continue to see aluminum in a deficit as we did in 2018 lower margins have led to many economic curtailments of smelting plants during 2018 including several in china that curtailed all or part of their capacity during the fourth quarter as i mentioned on the previous slide demand growth for primary aluminum in 2019 is expected to be robust with global consumption growth in a range of 3 to 4 driven by continued strong growth in china as well as in developed and developing markets elsewhere while the global aluminum market is projected to be in deficit again this year prices today are creating unsustainable margins for the aluminum industry we estimate that between 30 and 45 of global smelters are cash negative at recent prices china exported 5 8 million tons of unwrought and semi finished aluminum products in 2018 that s a 21 increase over 2017 what s more those exports are enabled by outsized government support the weakening chinese yuan and an unlevel playing field 5 8 million tons is a very significant quantity equivalent to about 20 of ex china primary consumption in 2018 that large outflow of metal competes with ex china semi finished production lowering primary aluminum demand and contributes to depressed pricing the depressed margins we re currently seeing have also occurred in the past several years but only for short periods of time today s low margins cannot sustain our industry and are therefore not viable over the long term looking back since november of 2016 we ve made great progress in our first two full years as an independent publicly traded company as we prepared to separate from our parent company in early 2016 aluminum prices were at multi year lows and aluminum prices remained weak to improve our positioning to be a stand alone company we executed a comprehensive strategy to strengthen our portfolio as we continually strived to be a low cost industry leader across bauxite alumina and aluminum products in november of that year we began operating as an independent entity with excellent prospects for the future with the launch behind us in 2017 we introduced three strategic priorities reduce complexity drive returns and strengthen the balance sheet as the building blocks for a stronger alcoa we ve used these priorities to streamline our processes and procedures and drive returns from our assets with a benefit of favorable markets we were also able to address a significant portion of our legacy items most notably our pension and opeb liabilities but also other major items such as the long term power contract associated with our closed rockdale smelter that was an annual drag on earnings of approximately 60 million to 70 million we closed 2018 with 3 3 billion in adjusted net debt down from 3 8 billion in 2016 and we ve grown our adjusted ebitda excluding special items nearly 3 times that of our 2016 carve out financials due to our financial performance and as proof of our strategy s success we ve started to execute our announced stock repurchase program a key component of our 2018 capital allocation framework as we enter our third year as alcoa corporation and with a focus on strengthening our company for the long term we ll begin to use our solid foundation to judiciously creep and grow our assets where sustainable value drivers exist we ll also use innovation like our elysis technology to disrupt the aluminum industry of the future lastly we ll live with our reputation our values and our expertise which is what makes us uniquely alcoa to be the partner of choice on new projects all with the goal of providing consistent returns for our stockholders in closing as markets trend lower here at the start of 2019 we will continue to drive improvements so we can be competitive through all cycles and react smartly and with urgency to these dynamic conditions as 2019 progresses we ll continue to prioritize safety across the company we see a direct connection between an efficient and effective safety system and our operational and financial performance we ll also remain focused on our strategic priorities we plan to increase operational performance improve the stability of our alumina operations increase or creep volumes in all our businesses and resolve labor issues in a way that enhances the long term viability of our operations we plan to drive improvement in controllable areas within the business but be flexible and nimble enough to react to either favorable or unfavorable changes in market conditions throughout this year we ll evaluate and prioritize future growth options while we continue to optimize our capital structure bill and i are proud to be supported by our employees across the globe and what we ve accomplished as alcoa this past year we stand ready with an even stronger company than the prior year to address the challenges and seize the opportunities that 2019 may bring with that bill and i would be glad to take your questions william if you could please remind us of the protocol and we can get started questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and the first questioner today will be timna tanners of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey happy new year guys roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hey timna william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer hi timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks for all the great detail i guess i had to laugh when i saw that simplification is still a priority because i went to slide 31 and i got really confused so i was hoping you could help without getting too into the minutiae sort of through what those components are are those above and beyond kind of the discussion that bill gave us earlier or are those already in guidance for example when you talk about the mix and the pricing is that something that would already be reflected in your sensitivity charts or tables or is that something that s separate william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer timna it s probably a little bit of a combination so if we just briefly run through it the first of all it talks about the operational stability improvement that we expect to see out of alumina which we highlighted that we had some difficult times this year and we re expecting to recover from that picking up some of the we re picking up some of the overcoming some of the negativity we saw in the fourth quarter on the alumina price mix column so picking up 30 million there giving you an estimate of the flow through of alumina into smelting and that s the 45 million and then the next two are really outsider sensitivities right we don t give you a sensitivity on maintenance spend or what flat rolled products is going to look like in the first quarter so we ve provided that here for you and then the last the second to last one is about raw materials there s so much uncertainty around raw materials right now it s very very difficult to predict where raw materials are going to end the year so we re just trying to point out to you what they look like in the first quarter and then the last bullet point is really a substitution for some of the prior guidance that we ve given around intercompany profit elimination you know now that we re off of lifo i alluded to that in my comments so lifo is now gone so this is just something that will help you understand where the intercompany profit elimination will be based on different api prices so it s a mixture to answer your question timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s helpful and i ll go through that in more detail separately and then i was just wondering i know that it s really fresh talking about the advances in spain but just you know as you talk about the landscape over the past year it had me thinking about where the company s footprint wants to be going forward in current market conditions you ve talked on the potential to restart the refinery in brazil you re producing less in canada can you talk a little bit about how you see the footprint evolving or is this the ideal footprint for the company in the current circumstances and can you give us any color on the impact of the spanish shutdown for operations thanks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah timna so let me let me start at a high level and then i ll get a little bit more granular because i think it s it becomes a different a different question and a different answer for each of the facilities when we look at our portfolio right now i think we feel that in the world in which we ve been living for this past year it s the right portfolio and i d remove spain from that because we ve obviously been having the discussions around the spanish restructuring however that doesn t mean that we are very focused on both looking at our current facilities given this new set of price and conditions and also looking at our footprint and thinking about what is it that we re trying to do with the future and so very simply we see that the value isn t in the number of tons that we produce but in the fact that we have a low cost high quality portfolio that allows us to both weather the downturns but also do a smart job at strengthening ourselves and also improving our production capacity at our current locations when times are better and so and that is a constant process so when you then sort of zoom in and look at this on a case by case basis and so one example that you mentioned was in brazil where we have been idle smelter it s a relatively competitive smelter but that lacks a power contract that makes it competitive in today s world that s something that can shift relatively quickly it depends on the brazilian real it depends on market conditions both inside of brazil and outside of brazil and it also depends on our ability to negotiate with the government both the regional and national government of brazil to find a long term power contract we continue to look at each of our locations to see what can we do to make them stronger whether there is any justification for a restart and additionally and this becomes particularly important at times like today where we see relatively strength strong alumina prices and weaker aluminum prices we also look at our portfolio to do two things number one make sure that when we restart failed electrolytic parts whether we choose to bring them back online again which is very much a variable cost exercise or whether we actually choose to look at a longer term curtailment of a part or all of the facility so it s a rather long winded answer to your question however it really is a constant exercise and something that we ask each of our businesses bauxite alumina and aluminum to be constantly evaluating where they are and ensuring that that then matches up with what we see as the long term fundamentals of our business timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks for that operator and the next questioner today will be alex hacking with citi please go ahead alex hacking citi analyst yeah thank you for the thank you for the question i guess the first question would be around the adjusted net debt goal you mentioned that you can get to that target just based on the mandatory minimum opeb pension payments i guess what would trigger you or what would trigger you to pay above those levels in order to accelerate that target would it just be based on free cash flow levels thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah a good question alex so the as i said we ve got a target that is three to five years out there if we achieve our expected return on assets in the asset portfolio for the pensions of 6 75 and discount rates don t change then we would be able to achieve that target without making any discretionary contributions to the pension above and beyond the mandatory if we were to find ourselves in a position where we don t achieve the expected return on assets or discount rates were to decline from where they sit today we would have to make contributions to achieve that net debt target so that s why we basically are putting the net debt target out there saying hey we should be able to achieve it with the mandatory contributions but if we don t get the expected return on assets or if discount rates change on us considerably we would need to make contributions alex hacking citi analyst okay so just to clarify therefore you would anticipate making no voluntary contributions this year or in 2019 unless there s unexpectedly poor asset performance william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and i yes the only caveat that i would have on that is if we choose to do some level of further de risking you know we ve done de risking in the pension plan in 2018 we contributed the ph whatever 1 billion of cash into the pension plan to be able to take a considerable amount of the liability off the balance sheet but at this point i m not anticipating that we would make that we would make considerable contributions beyond the mandatory alex hacking citi analyst okay thanks and then i guess just my second question on flat rolled are you still comfortable with the guidance that you gave on the last call of around a 25 million run rate i noticed in the commentary that in the first quarter expect it to be quite a bit weaker than that but you did say last quarter that it would be weaker in the first half so is that previous guidance still good william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we gave previous guidance of about 100 million for the year we re still targeting for 100 million for the year and as we say the first quarter will be a little bit weaker than the fourth alex hacking citi analyst thanks a lot operator and the next questioner today will be chris terry with deutsche bank please go ahead christopher terry deutsche bank analyst hi roy and bill yeah i just wanted to feed off the question that alex was asking around around the cash flows just now on slide 15 and 16 in terms of the 150 million you still have remaining in the buyback program and just tying that to what you actually bought back in the latter part of the fourth quarter is the speed of the buyback program that you spend entirely dependent on the ebitda you re actually generating at the time and also the minimum required pension of the 300 million that you re going to spend during this year just trying to get an idea of how you prioritize the buybacks against the other buckets that are mentioned on slide 15 for the excess cash thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so it will be based on having excess cash so i think to answer your question you said hey will be based on ebitda yeah i mean ultimately as ebitda translates into cash flow it will be based on having excess cash and during the course of the year we will make the determination if we have that excess cash we ll weigh it versus the other options that we ve laid out in the capital allocation framework and that s the three things that we talked about there which is returning cash to shareholders potentially further de levering and looking at long term growth opportunities and make a determination so we if there is excess free cash flow we ll evaluate those three given the long term capital allocation program that we ve announced christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks so looks like slide 16 just going down the right hand side of the fy 19 outlook to 300 million sounds like it s pretty fixed and all the capital expenditures so just thinking about the buyback program it really would just come down to what you generate during the year you re not for example going to backpack capex or look at other items within that framework william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the 300 million if you look at us historically it s been pretty steady over the last few years 300 million of sustaining capital goes up or down a little bit over the last few years but 300 million is pretty good number and then 150 million of return seeking that s the we came out with 150 million return seeking target for 2018 we under spent that as you know as the return seeking projects came available we made decisions around how quickly to implement those but that would be the target for 2019 christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks and just the last one for me the slide 19 balances on each of the end markets what have you assumed for alunorte on the alumina balance thanks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so on the alumina balance we assume essentially status quo as of today so there is no assumed restart and not because we re taking a position on that but simply because we wanted to put a stake in the ground as what does the market look like prior to the return and it s the same impact on aluminum as well with albras which is connected over to alunorte christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thank you that s it for me operator and the next questioner today will be matthew korn with goldman sachs please go ahead matthew korn goldman sachs analyst hey good evening everybody thanks for taking my questions william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer good day matthew matthew korn goldman sachs analyst a question on the situation in spain could you explain a little bit more next steps on the worker negotiations there you say the release there s a vote at the end of the month does that need approval by the provincial government are there any other hurdles that you re going to need to clear before you can move forward there roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah matthew let me take a stab at that one so essentially the process is pretty well laid out from here going forward and i ll give you some caveats about what will happen so first of all we have an agreement with the workers representatives and so that is a very positive step the next step and this will happen in about a week is that the workers will then have their option to opine about that if so assuming that they agree that essentially means we go into the program as it s already defined and so we start curtailment and the workforce will participate in those activities and then we ll continue on to the rest of what you ve seen there we will continue to operate the casthouses we will keep those plants for six months until the end of june in a position where it can be restarted and we ll look to see if there is someone that wants to step into those operating positions if the workforce would choose not to agree with the program as laid out we then have 15 days in order to decide how we react to that choice again that s a very prescripted ph legal process inside of spain however that s i wouldn t want to try and foreshadow what the decision would be at that particular moment matthew korn goldman sachs analyst i appreciate it thanks for the clarity i also want to dig a little bit more on some of your market outlooks on the different commodities in alumina china is ever the linchpin there what how much additional refining capacity are you counting on in that in that base case for chinese alumina supply in 19 then because it s connected what s i guess what s your net view on chinese smelter production into next year roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah and it s hard to pin down what should the exact number be and i think you re touching on this matthew because the fact is the chinese if anything are very reactive to the way the pricing the way that the pricing happens to be pointing them and so we saw very quickly at the end of this year that when that gap between global pricing and chinese pricing was in their favor they were able to export and when that gap closed they very quickly stopped exporting and so as we build our balances we always take into account how we think how we think conditions should develop on the ground and so that s a bit of a caveat of how we try to build that and inside of that we then think about what new capacity has been announced how will the capacities then adapt to that particular to that particular situation that we find ourselves so for alumina i m trying to think back i don t have i don t have the number right in my mind and i don t have it i don t have it right in front of me either essentially what we ve done is we ve taken the announced the announced new facilities coming online and there have been a few of those we ve taken into consideration also the relatively short term winter curtailments and we did have one curtailment that was announced and has been acted upon and we then we then brought that into what we think that supply demand balance would be inside of china matthew korn goldman sachs analyst i appreciate it good job with everything guys in what s been a really challenging year william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah thanks matt operator and the next questioner today will be piyush sood with morgan stanley please go ahead piyush sood morgan stanley analyst roy bill congratulation on the quarter a couple of questions first one you were forecasting a deficit in aluminum in 2018 and now a bigger deficit in 2019 just want to understand how do you account for china s 5 million ton plus exports in this so without chinese exports would the world ex china be in a much bigger deficit just want to understand your how you account for those flows and also why do you think aluminum prices are where they are right now despite these large deficits roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so let me answer your deficit question first and then we can step in and talk a little bit more about the price question so remember when you look at that page it is specifically dealing with primary aluminum balances and so that has advantages and it has disadvantages it s a relatively simplified world view so inside of that let s take the china balance very specifically inside of that if they are producing semi fabricated products that are actually intended for export it still counts as chinese demand because it s consuming primary material either as that first very basic primary product or as molten metal that s included in chinese demand if that then is exported that then becomes an input into what is being consumed outside of china so when you look at the rest of world demand there is actually an impact of those 5 8 million tons that are falling out there is a negative impact because now you re not just demanding primary aluminum to go into those semi fabricated products you re actually consuming some of that some of that chinese material so essentially the impact on the global balances is negligible because it is embedded in the way that we re doing these primary aluminum balances however it does serve in two ways it serves as a connection between the two markets but then it also serves it allows this overcapacity in china to be turned into products and that then those products are then exported and sold outside of china and so it does very much have an impact on what s happening with global supply and demand balances but it also has an impact on what s happening in aluminum pricing so i ll use that to move right into your second question so first and foremost i think it s obvious that there is a lot of there s a lot of talk right now about global trade about what investors feel about future demand and economic activities et cetera so certainly there is an overarching overlay of what s happening in the general market inside of our market specifically i think it s very much the discussions that are happening right now about overcapacity that s having an impact on short term prices when you look at some of the most recent developments the oecd study that looked at subsidies inside of the aluminum industry that found that china was very much an outlier both on the size of the subsidies that are given to producers but also the availability of those subsidies to its own specific domestic producers and so as we see that overcapacity develop and as china essentially moves from being just a primary producer into a semi fabricated producer it tends to give a negative pall to the broader market and so as we saw that extra million tons being exported in the form of semi fabricated products we believe that it s had a negative impact on pricing as the market has seen that material that doesn t necessarily flow to the us for example but can flow into the global market whether it s in eastern asia or europe or other parts of the world and so when we look at both the broader economics but then also the dynamics of this over overcapacitization and overproduction inside of china we believe that those things are having an outsized impact on prices one more comment though and i ll link this back to my comments at the beginning the simple fact is in the pricing environment in which we live today and when you look at the economics of producing aluminum these prices cannot be sustainable they can t be sustainable because half of all capacity in china is now losing cash and again china tends to act pretty economically rationally when it comes to these types of decisions when you then look at the whole world it s somewhere between 35 and 40 of all smelters and weighted toward china that are currently losing money as well and so that means that the pricing as it is right now certainly doesn t sustain continued production at these levels much less ever incentivize new capacity to come online and so it s an unsustainable margin trend that we found has occurred in prior years but has been pretty quick to self correct simply because it is not something that can continue and therefore justify by continuing to produce piyush sood morgan stanley analyst that s helpful and a question on slide 16 the prior period taxes of 360 million just want to understand if what s attributable to you versus alumina limited should we assume a split around 60 40 or anything you could talk about that william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the it s a great question and it should be you should note that it s a line item that we haven t provided in the past and we re making sure that people understand that we do have trailing tax payments that have to be made largely and predominantly in australia right because our awac enterprise makes a lot of makes a lot of the money that it makes in australia so a big piece of that would be a 60 40 split because it s in the awac enterprise so good question piyush piyush sood morgan stanley analyst all right and thank you and last one slide 31 when we think of alumina operational stability should we think of it as a second half transition or can that happen in maybe 1q or 2q william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll let roy talk about it but i guess my view is we started to see some of that stability come back in the fourth quarter already if you look at the fourth quarter numbers we started to see that stability versus what we had seen in the second and the third quarter and in my view we ve largely regained much of the stability that we have around the system so i think we should start to see that in the first half already roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah i completely agree with bill our expectation is that we see a stable alumina business through the entire 12 months piyush sood morgan stanley analyst thanks guys and all the best roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks piyush operator and the next questioner today will be lucas pipes with b riley fbr please go ahead lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst hey good afternoon everyone wanted to ask a quick question on the buyback of 50 million during the fourth quarter could you share with us kind of at what price you were buying back stock and then also why not more and when do you intend to increase purchases again thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i think the average price was 29 01 in the 50 million that we spent and the question of why not more we had a capital allocation program that s at we wanted to target a minimum threshold of keeping 1 billion we were really looking at cash as it was coming in during the course of the quarter and then the other key aspect is that we had a fairly short window in which we could buy back you know we renegotiated our revolver in the fourth quarter also in renegotiating our revolver we were blacked out so we had only a short period of time in the fourth quarter in which we were able to be buying back before we then went into the blackout period associated with earnings at the end of the year so that s the reason why we did not do more lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst got it that s helpful hopefully you will not get another opportunity to buy at 25 but william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer i m sorry 29 01 29 01 lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst no i was being i was being facetious william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer i know i m with you i mean we don t get an opportunity to buy at 25 lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst but just another follow up i think it was page 16 where you gives the operational tax rate i m a little confused about why it s higher in 19 given the lower alumina price could you maybe share a little bit more color on what s driving that increase for the 2019 guidance versus 18 thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer it all comes down to where you make your profits and the jurisdictions in which you re making profits and so clearly we didn t provide you a full year ebitda guidance but given today s prices with the alumina and aluminum where it s at we would anticipate that tax rate right so we re essentially just basically taking the current market prices for aluminum and alumina trying to determine where we re going to make profits and also have losses and that s what generates that 45 to 55 i would point to you that i did make it clear in my comments that at today s prices we d probably be at the upper end of that so it s 50 to 55 range lucas pipes b riley fbr analyst got it okay well thank you very much and best of luck william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks lucas operator and the last questioner today will be justin bergner with gabelli and company please go ahead justin bergner gabelli and company analyst thank you for fitting me in roy and bill good afternoon roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hey justin justin bergner gabelli and company analyst just hi a couple of quick cleanup questions is the cash tax in the book tax is the cash tax rate also expected to be in that 45 to 55 range william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer you know i would have to look justin i think the really key thing for the modeling purposes is that you understand that cash tax catch up right so that s why we pointed out that it s an incremental 200 million of cash tax catch up that was associated with profits that we made in 18 that we have to pay in 19 justin bergner gabelli and company analyst okay great yeah i was asking ex the catch up but i assume i ll loop up for some more clarity later in the press release you mention a 70 million to 80 million benefit from the curtailment proposed in spain i assume some of that benefit on the net income line is related to the impairment and reduced depreciation so can you give a sense as to how much that should aid ebitda william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer you know i don t have it off the top of my head so you have to circle back with jim on how much is that i mean one thing to keep in mind that in spain pre tax and post tax are largely the same because we ve got a valuation allowance on the tax rate in spain so the 70 million to 80 million of net income the 70 million to 80 million of pre tax how much of that is the ebitda i m not certain of i m sorry how much of that is depreciation i m not certain of that off the top of my head justin bergner gabelli and company analyst okay thanks and then lastly the maintenance spend tick up is that just a first quarter phenomenon or is that going to continue throughout 2019 relative to what you spent in 2018 william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer that s a first quarter phenomenon and i guess to circle back to some extent where we started with timna s question the reason why we provided that extra page bullet point guidance is because given the fact that as roy said we re not providing the full year ebitda guidance we felt compelled to try to give you some much better insight into both the first quarter and the full year but to specifically answer your question that s as a first quarter guidance item roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and just to add one more piece of information justin just to give you a little bit more of an explanation the largest part of our facilities in refining happen to be in the southern hemisphere and so so we tend to see a reverse trend it s now the summer summer months when we tend to see more maintenance happening or some of the larger maintenance activities so it tends to be pretty cyclical that the beginning of the year tends to be one of the most important maintenance months for us justin bergner gabelli and company analyst okay great thank you for taking my questions roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you justin operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to roy harvey for any closing remarks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer great william thank you and once again thanks to everyone for joining our earnings call today today s results reflect the success of our strategic priorities and how much stronger alcoa is today than when we launched in late 2016 we have more opportunities to drive value for stockholders this year and we look forward to updating you again at the

chief executive carrie lam since taking office in july 2017 i have been advocating new roles of the government in order to scale new heights and we have adopted a new tagline for branding our city and that is to connect and excel indeed you can say that we are reshaping our city for the economic promise that this 21st century will surely bring the countries and economies of asia hong kong very much included of course we remain the world s bridge between east and west as between mainland china and the rest of asia our role of connecting companies economies and cultures continues to grow and we continue to find fresh ways of helping businesses and people to excel whatever it is they are building or pursuing whatever their ambitions or their vision thanks to our deepening economic integration with the mainland we are also taking full advantage of two national strategies of mainland china to build on our world class strengths in financial and professional services and to develop as well our fast emerging innovation and technology sector i am talking about the belt road initiative and the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area i will be happy to tell you more about these opportunities in a few minutes global trade leader but let me first give you a brief update on hong kong our economy i am pleased to say expanded by 2 9 in real terms in the third quarter of 2018 marking hong kong s eighth consecutive quarter of above trend growth through the first three quarters of 2018 our economy grew by 3 7 year on year due to some external factors economic growth for 2018 as a whole is forecast at a moderated rate of 3 2 and our unemployment rate remains at 2 8 which is a 20 year low i would say that these figures are more than respectable given the ongoing uncertainties of the global economy thanks to our open and externally oriented economy we have been a global leader in trade in 2017 our exports and imports of goods and services amounted to better than 370 of our gdp that year hong kong was ranked the world s seventh leading trading economy our trade totalling us 1 14 trillion up 7 15 over the previous year we continue to be closely linked with the economies of asia indeed nine of hong kong s top 10 trading partners are from asia and they accounted for us 912 billion almost 80 of our total merchandise trade in 2017 those numbers and our focus on asia will surely expand down the road asia after all accounts for more than 60 of global growth according to the international monetary fund imf last year s full year results are not yet in but growth in asia in 2018 is expected to reach a laudable 5 6 this year the imf projects asian growth at about 5 4 still considerably higher than the projected global average of 3 7 in short the fast growing asian market presents huge potential and myriad business opportunities for all of us the hong kong government maintains 12 overseas economic and trade offices eto including tokyo singapore and jakarta in asia that is not nearly enough not if we are to take advantage of the expanding business opportunities in asia which is why we have announced that we are planning to add five new etos three of them in asian cities bangkok mumbai and seoul among them i am pleased to say that the bangkok eto which is the most recently announced one is going to open soon hopefully in february this year we also hope to set up the mumbai eto soon for this i look to the consul general for his support hong kong and india have strong long established ties both economically and culturally hong kong is home to a large indian community and many indian companies and we greatly value and treasure the manifold contributions that the indian community has made to hong kong over the decades in 2017 our bilateral trade reached us 34 billion up 27 over 2016 results i am confident that with the new mumbai eto in india up and running our bilateral ties will reach new heights in our business trade and cultural co operation unique advantages hong kong s working philosophy whether in enhancing ties with india the mainland the rest of asia or the world beyond focuses on the mutual rewards that open inclusive and sustainable growth can realise that considered approach is supported by our unique advantages under the one country two systems principle thanks to one country two systems hong kong maintains an open and free market a simple and low tax regime and a level playing field for companies for the past 24 years in a row the heritage foundation has named hong kong the world s freest economy last year we finished second worldwide in the swiss based international institute for management development s world competitiveness yearbook and in this year s world bank doing business report we placed number four our attractiveness to overseas business is visible in the increasing number of offices set up by international companies in hong kong at last count more than 8 700 businesses with parent companies overseas or in mainland china maintained an office here that ladies and gentlemen is up 6 4 year on year let me add that nearly 50 of them have parent companies based in asia further among the 8 700 businesses 1 530 are regional headquarters increased by 8 3 year on year hong kong has long been the business bridge for foreign investors seeking access to the mainland market our gateway position was appreciably strengthened by cepa the mainland and hong kong closer economic partnership arrangement as a free trade agreement cepa was first established in 2003 and enhanced in the years since then cepa provides preferential treatment to hong kong service suppliers as well as tariff free treatment for products of hong kong origin the beauty of cepa is that it is nationality neutral that means overseas companies need only partner with hong kong or set up an office here to realise cepa s wide ranging business advantages we are as well expanding our network of free trade agreements investment agreements and comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreements with foreign economies since i took office as chief executive in july 2017 my government has established free trade agreements with the association of southeast asian nations asean and with georgia we have as well recently concluded negotiations with australia and the maldives i am determined to realise more free trade agreements in the years to come in order to enhance prospects and opportunities for hong kong companies and service providers as well as our business partners hk s national role while upholding the principle of one country two systems and taking advantage of our unique strengths hong kong is geared up to integrating herself into the national development strategies and this includes president xi jinping s commitment to building open and inclusive relations among countries and peoples i was in shanghai last november for the inaugural china international import expo there president xi delivered a keynote address entitled work together for an open global economy that is innovative inclusive in his speech president xi emphasised and i quote china s consistent position of supporting the multilateral trading system and promoting free trade president xi added that openness and co operation will remain essential for continued human progress president xi s embrace of multilateral co operation and the shared benefits it can bring is powerfully reflected in the belt road initiative and the international connectivity it enables our strategic location and status as an international trading and financial services centre make hong kong the ideal springboard for overseas companies looking to tap the resources the markets and the opportunities that the belt road affords hong kong enjoys distinct economic legal and social systems they are backed by a deep pool of professionals their expertise ranges from infrastructure development and engineering to consultancy accounting law and more and their global networks and affiliations are extensive no less important they are well versed in cross border business transactions they can make all the difference for countries and companies taking part in the belt road initiative our strength in financial services is powered by capital formation thanks to our liquid capital flow hong kong is the natural centre for those looking to raise capital for infrastructure as well as production and investment projects in particular hong kong is well positioned to respond to green financing needs in the coming months we will launch a government green bond issuance programme it will come with a borrowing ceiling of about us 13 billion making it one of the world s largest sovereign green bond issuances we have also initiated a green bond grant scheme that subsidises the costs issuers incur in obtaining certification under our green finance certification scheme in short hong kong has what it takes to become a fund raising hub for green projects and i am confident our bond market will attract belt road investors alongside our financial acumen hong kong is a hub for risk management insurance and dispute resolution services our legal services sector is renowned its foundation is the rule of law underpinned by an independent judiciary and robust intellectual property rights protection arbitral awards made here are enforceable in more than 150 jurisdictions including the mainland hong kong boasts more than 13 000 lawyers and many more legal professionals they come from all over the world and their services range from risk assessment and the drafting of contracts to dispute resolution for investment and commercial deals the connectivity that drives the belt road extends well beyond infrastructure or the business and trade it enables building people to people bonds is also one of the key objectives such bonds must of course be inclusive if they are to be meaningful that unfortunately is not always the case despite the remarkable socio economic transformation of asia in recent decades the gains have not always benefited those in need the result is communities regions and economies experiencing more not less inequality more not less environmental degradation if economic development is to become more inclusive we must find ways of expanding essential needs ensuring that our societies have access to such basics as safety equity and justice in that regard ladies and gentlemen hong kong has much to offer and we are happy to share our experience and to help emerging economies build their capacity i see it as part of our contribution to expanding people to people bonds whether in the asian region or in the broader reaches of the belt road it begins with our city management expertise that ranges from town planning and railway operation to flood prevention slope stabilisation aviation safety and emergency services we have as well the institutions and the experience to promote equal opportunity deal with administrative complaints and fight corruption indeed some of our institutions from the independent commission against corruption to the fire ambulance services academy offer training and experience sharing with their counterparts in asia including belt road economies the independent commission against corruption for example has in place a dedicated unit providing training services for anti corruption agencies in belt road countries similarly our fire ambulance services academy has helped train firemen for example from vietnam and the academy welcomes opportunities to work with other asian and belt road economies it s much the same with the hong kong airport authority and its aviation academy as well as our mass transit railway corporation which has established a rail academy their doors ladies and gentlemen are always open such capacity building helps promote inclusive growth that in turn can only strengthen confidence in the belt road initiative and the welcome co operation it offers us all ladies and gentlemen you can learn more about the prospects and the promise of the belt road initiative in september when hong kong hosts its fourth belt road summit the summit is now the largest most important annual gathering among belt road project owners investors and service providers the third summit held in june last year attracted about 5 000 government and business leaders from some 50 countries and regions bay area development allow me now to briefly touch on the other important national strategy of mainland china which is the fast rising guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area the development plan of which will soon be promulgated the greater bay area covers hong kong macau and nine prosperous guangdong cities bringing together a collective population of about 70 million and a gdp of more than us 1 5 trillion while the greater bay area accounts for only 5 of the mainland s population it is responsible for fully 12 of the mainland s gdp that s equivalent to the gdp of australia or korea air passenger and cargo throughputs of the greater bay area rank first among the world s major bay areas while the new york san francisco and tokyo bay areas may pride themselves on their status as financial technology and industry hubs respectively the greater bay area encompasses all of that the greater bay area is built on complementarity instead of competition among the cities hong kong china s most international city will play the role as an international finance and trade hub as well as a global arbitration centre in addition we look to contribute to the greater bay area s development into an international innovation and technology hub hong kong has much to offer including world class universities and scientific research capabilities we have as well a government and a chief executive that places innovation technology at the heart of our policy agenda in this 21st century of endless change and boundless promises combined with the strengths of mainland cities such as their advanced manufacturing capability the greater bay area has all it takes to become asia s silicon valley we welcome talent technology enterprises and scientific institutions from asia and from all over the world to join us chief executive carrie lam gave these remarks at the economic times asian business leaders conclave 2019 on january 17
narendra modi the prime minister was a product of the mass exasperation against the misdeeds of the previous government the regular revelation of corruption scandals the frustrating policy paralysis the incessant price hikes and the widespread unemployment in a virtually stalled economy had made the average voter restless for change so when a figure emerged making expansive assurances to revive the moribund indian economy by eliminating corruption creating millions of jobs and extricating millions out of the depths of poverty the choice was hardly a complex conundrum for the voters advertisement the scale of the electoral victory for bjp bharatiya janata party in 2014 restored the power centre back in the national capital it gave the bjp government a mandate to follow through on its policies without restraint while in office one of the first acts that modi initiated was to dismantle the long standing relic of economic planning the planning commission and also eliminate the distinction between planned and non planned expenditure in the country s annual budgets these changes signalled the completion of india s ideological shift in economic thinking away from the state led planning of the nehruvian era towards a market oriented approach of development a major drawback of the planning commission had been that it created rigid national schemes which required states to implement them by setting aside a significant share of funds this left the states grossly disempowered with the dismantling of the institution the states were now left with more discretion over how to use their funds the government also accepted a proposal of the finance commission to give state governments 42 of central tax receipts up from 32 advertisement india has leaped to the 50th place on the world bank s ease of doing business rankings by the end of modi s five year term in a similar spirit of allowing market forces to define outcomes the government also managed to deregulate diesel and petroleum prices which formed a substantial part of the subsidy bill as a result india joined the club of select countries like usa and australia where fuel prices are revised on a daily basis deregulation was also partially achieved in case of natural gas but has yet to be taken up for fertilizer and kerosene the use of the latter two commodities by people at the bottom of the pyramid makes it more difficult to tick them off the subsidy bill advancing further on the reform process the private sector was given further leeway in sectors where the state was proving incompetent a cap on foreign investment in the defence sector was lifted from 26 to 49 similarly furthering vajpayee s initiative to allow private entry into the insurance sector the cap for foreign investment in it was raised to 49 as well advertisement these moves were a concerted attempt to signal to the world that india was becoming more welcoming of private capital but a more direct attempt at developing a business friendly image on a global stage was in modi s ambitious promise of advancing india to the 50th place on the world bank s ease of doing business rankings by the end of his five year term from a lowly 142 when he joined office the world bank noted in its 2018 doing business report that india had adopted thirty seven reforms since 2003 and nearly half of them had been introduced in the last four years a few of the key reforms that the world bank alludes to have been game changing in their expected long term impact on the economy the first arose from a strenuous legacy of rising non performing assets npa with public sector banks that the bjp government had inherited the insolvency and bankruptcy code 2016 was passed in parliament to address the issue the code allows either the creditor or the borrower to approach the national company law tribunal nclt to initiate insolvency proceedings it further lays down provisions for debt resolution within a span of three to five months advertisement the second major reform by the bjp government on the economic front came in the form of the biggest tax reform in indian history with the implementation of the goods and services tax gst after well over a decade in the making the tax which aims at simplifying the tax structure of the country by replacing the erstwhile multilayered complicated tax system was introduced in 2017 the new tax system eliminated the maze of check posts at state borders where lorries transporting goods typically used to languish for hours it is expected to transform into higher ease of doing business in the economy and translate into facilitation of a high growth trajectory the tax however has not been free of criticism first the tax was introduced with five tax slabs to have the minimum effect on the price of the goods compared to the previous tax regime but this was said to defeat the very purpose of simplification of taxes advertisement second the tax was expected to have deleterious effects on the unorganised sector which does not pay taxes by definition considering it employed over 90 of the indian workforce at the time of the implementation of the gst there were expected concerns on its impact on small informal businesses and on the overall economy itself too little time has passed since the implementation of the gst in 2017 to pass a definite verdict on this front finally the haste in which the tax was implemented without ironing out the complexities has often been criticised as well therefore the bjp government has been proactive in kickstarting india s stalled reform process in sharp contrast to the previous one there are at least three other cases where this is true for the economy as well one has been its take on fiscal deficit after a profligate regime of the upa government a sense of fiscal responsibility was imperative and as luck would have it global crude oil prices began to fall since 2014 this allowed the government to collect higher excise taxes on petroleum products the increase in tax revenue and a focus on achieving predefined fiscal targets allowed the deficit to narrow down to 3 5 of gdp in 2018 from 4 5 when the upa left office notably the frbm act target of a fiscal deficit of 3 which was to be achieved by 2008 has not been met since the act was implemented advertisement the other varied approach from the upa government came in tackling the problem of inflation which had been sharply impacting the purchasing power of consumers again the falling crude oil prices played a significant impact in bringing down inflation across indian markets but an institutional change was brought about when the rbi reserve bank of india began the process of inflation targeting through which it aimed at keeping inflation levels for the economy within a predefined band the third major contrast in the bjp government to the previous one has been in its approach towards combating corruption while the second term of the upa had been mired in corruption scandals right at the top the complete absence of any such cases since then has been refreshing the government has also been focused on addressing the problem of black money in the economy a successful effort has been made in managing to end the data secrecy of money stashed in swiss banks which has long been perceived as a haven for illicit wealth the missteps a more controversial step by the government against black money has been the move to demonetise 86 of india s currency overnight with the expectation that the illicit part of it will not be returned to banks for fear of being penalised as it turned out almost all of the demonetised currency returned to the central bank jobless growth has always been an uncomfortable reality for the country s masses and the situation has worsened of late advertisement the other motive of the move to shift the economy towards a less cash based society also come to naught as people began to prefer cash as their primary currency soon after the circulation was normalised the only long term impact it had was to create a cash crunch in the economy which slowed down india s growth to its lowest level since the bjp came into power and set the economy back by at least a few months despite such setbacks the economic record of the bjp government has been fairly satisfactory however since india missed its industrial boom phase jobless growth has been an uncomfortable reality for the country s masses the situation has worsened of late according to a recent study latest labour bureau estimates show that there was an absolute decline in employment between 2013 14 and 2015 16 probably for the first time since independence even though claims of job growth are always contestable in india since most of its workforce is employed in the informal sector where employment becomes difficult to track for a country in which 10 million people are expected to join the workforce annually for the near future dismal job prospects could prove disastrous advertisement excerpted with the permission of penguin random house india from age of awakening by amit kapoor with chirag yadav we welcome your comments at ideas

president trump has said the us will devastate turkey economically if ankara decides to attack kurdish groups in syria mr trump was referring to his plan to pull us forces out of syria where they have been fighting alongside a kurdish militia against the group calling itself islamic state is turkey regards the kurdish group as terrorists the us president s comments drew a sharp response from turkey which said mr trump would not get anywhere by threatening the country economically after mr trump s tweet the turkish lira dropped in value against the us dollar it then recovered its value suggesting that his remarks had limited impact so how could the us damage turkey economically if it wanted to close ties under strain the relationship between washington and ankara has historically been close politically economically and militarily turkey a nato member is a vital partner for the us but there have been significant strains in the partnership these came out into the open last august when the us slapped sanctions on turkey over the continued detention of american pastor andrew brunson it marked a new low in relations and was a further blow to an already fragile economy the us also doubled tariffs on turkish steel and aluminium that month leading to further falls in the value of the turkish lira some 40 since the beginning of 2018 turkey responded in kind raising tariffs on cars from the us to 120 on alcoholic drinks to 140 and on leaf tobacco to 60 who does turkey trade with in fact only 5 of turkish exports head to the us and turkey imports only slightly more from there turkey s trading relationships with china russia and germany are more important but even though overall trade with us is not as large there are key vulnerable sectors air transport iron and steel and machinery and this is where the us has chosen to target previous sanctions turkey has historically had a deficit in international trade in that it imports more from the rest of the world than it exports however the trade gap did narrow considerably in 2018 on the back of the weakness of the lira which made turkey s exports more competitive and imports more expensive economic vulnerabilities turkey may be vulnerable over its high levels of debt as of the end of september 2018 its external debt amounted to over 50 of its gross domestic product gdp the value of all the goods and services it produces in a year according to official figures this is turkey s achilles heel says york university economist gulcin ozkan it puts the country at the mercy of international investors and makes it vulnerable to exchange rate movements there are two features of turkey s foreign debt increase that are concerning it has a relatively high level of short term debt which is due for repayment in the near future that means having a greater reliance on external finance in addition most of its overall debt is in foreign currencies such as the us dollar and the euro so the debt becomes more expensive as the turkish currency loses value and other currencies such as the us dollar strengthen in fact the lira had been struggling for most of last year recording its worst decline since 2001 this currency weakness also aggravates turkey s persistent inflation problem which at one point in 2018 peaked at over 25 market sentiment is key it s important to point out that the turkish economy has been growing strongly for most of the period since 2001 but confidence in turkey was beginning to wane last year over concerns that the economy was overheating due to huge spending and borrowing in addition the turkish government has taken away some power from the central bank leading investors to worry about the direction of fiscal policy so any fallout with the us could further sour the financial markets view of the health of the turkish economy this could lead to a decline in capital inflows and impact the value of the turkish currency says economist gulcin ozkan weakening a strategic ally but given the importance of the political and strategic relationship with turkey which shares borders with syria iraq and iran the us may want to tread carefully turkey is the biggest recipient of us defence equipment after israel and the uae and the vast majority of its air force is us supplied it also hosts us and nato forces at its incirlik airbase in the south of the country so turkey may be economically vulnerable but politically and strategically it remains very important
china s growth set to slow to 6 3 percent in 2019 more stimulus seen china s economy is expected to cool further this year as domestic demand weakens and exports are hit by u s tariffs a reuters poll showed on thursday reinforcing views beijing will need to roll out more stimulus measures the world s second largest economy got off to a strong start in 2018 but pressure soon built as a crackdown on riskier lending pushed up borrowing costs and made it harder for smaller companies to get funding spurring record bond defaults at the same time the escalating dispute with the united states saw both sides slap tariffs on each other s goods disrupting china s trade sector and weighing on chinese business and consumer confidence slowing demand global is heightening those export pressures china s economic growth is expected to slow to 6 3 percent this year which would be the weakest in 29 years from an expected 6 6 percent in 2018 according to median forecast of 85 economists reuters polled the economy expanded 6 9 percent in 2017 both forecasts were unchanged from the october poll a significant chinese slowdown may already be unfolding harvard university economics professor kenneth rogoff said in a recent commentary a resumption of sino u s trade talks has increased optimism among some analysts that washington could agree to a further suspension of planned tariff hikes on chinese goods originally slated to take effect this month however a comprehensive agreement to end the dispute is seen as unlikely by the negotiating deadline of early march given the number of highly

to charlie charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott good morning everyone thanks for joining us as usual i ll make some comments and then turn it over to mike you can see that we reported earnings per share of 0 84 down 22 from last year s fourth quarter both this quarter and last year s fourth quarter included a number of notable items that make comparisons difficult but we will do our best to explain what s included so you can perform your own analysis of the quarter notable items in the fourth quarter of 2018 reduced earnings by 0 16 this includes costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters severance charges and litigation expenses those costs were partly offset by some tax adjustments as a reminder our fourth quarter results in 2017 included notable items that increased earnings by 0 17 per share these items were related to the estimated benefit of u s tax legislation partially offset by some actions we took on a gaap basis our revenues grew 7 expenses decreased 1 pre tax earnings grew 40 and after tax earnings decreased 26 if you were to exclude these notable items in both periods which you can see in the reconciliation table on the second page of the earnings release revenue declined 1 expenses were essentially flat pre tax earnings decreased 3 after tax earnings increased 4 and earnings per share increased 9 my comments will refer to our results excluding notable items in both periods let me mention a few things about the overall results first while we aren t happy with the revenue decline of 1 it s important to note that we saw growth in many of our investment services business in total investment services revenue grew 3 and investment management revenue declined by 8 due to the combination of outflows currency and the impact of lower equity markets and we continue to benefit from increasing interest rates albeit at a slower rate than prior quarters the second thing is that we remain extremely focused on controlling our expenses while we continue to significantly increase our technology and infrastructure investments excluding the notable items our expenses were set were essentially flat to the prior year our technology expenses increased about 100 million versus the prior year while all other expenses decreased a little more than the same amount i mentioned on last quarter s earnings call that we see meaningful opportunities to become more efficient across the company while we re looking to automate many of the manual tasks we perform we also see broader opportunities to continue to drive efficiency on last quarter s call i used the example of a significant opportunity to reduce management layers and increase spans of control this quarter s gaap results include a severance charge which includes these actions many of which we ve already completed we anticipate that the payback on this severance will be less than one year these savings and other efficiencies we continue to drive toward will allow us to continue to increase our investment in technology and infrastructure without significantly increasing our expense base but as i also said on last quarter s earnings call while these changes result in lower costs they help advance our culture by improving decision making allowing us to move more quickly and making sure we have our best people in roles which allow them to grow and contribute more significantly to our growth agenda and thirdly as we ve said consistently the road to increase our organic growth will take time but we do see some progress the impact of the markets and interest rates will ebb and flow but we must grow the franchise and we remain focused on methodically building our capabilities to increase our rate of organic growth as 2019 unfolds we hope to provide a clearer roadmap of how this is playing out let s go through our businesses starting with asset servicing asset servicing revenue was down 2 although we continue to have a healthy pipeline the impact from new business was minimal there were negative impacts from asset outflows from sync from existing clients these clients did not leave us but saw outflows from their accounts this can shift based on market conditions and investor behavior the decline combined with a little lower foreign exchange and securities lending volumes as well as the negative impact of a stronger u s dollar drove the lower revenue year over year the declines were offset by higher net interest revenue due to higher rates we are continuing to invest across this business to improve our core custody and accounting service extend our service and capabilities for alternative managers including credit managers middle office and data management we turn to pershing while revenue is down year over year due to the two previously disclosed client losses revenue was flat sequentially excluding the impact of the lost clients the revenues grew about 4 in addition the business has grown in a number of other fronts the impact of the lost clients has been fully in our run rate since the second quarter of this year and the impact on the year over year growth rate for pershing will abate after the first quarter of 2019 we continue to have a sizable pipeline of new business that we are onboarding now which will begin to go live in the second half of 2019 and have a more meaningful impact in 2020 so we expect pershing will return to revenue growth as the negative impact of the two client losses abate and we onboard the signed business we are as confident as ever in our ability to continue building pershing over the longer term in issuer services revenue growth of 25 was driven primarily by depository receipts corporate action activity and higher volumes although corporate trust also generated a little bit of revenue growth as we discussed previously depository receipts revenue is seasonal and volatility in the market drives cross border settlement activity the timing of corporate action events during the quarter drove significant the year over year growth and volatility levels were particularly high in latin america corporate trust also had some revenue growth this quarter albeit small our efforts to reposition our corporate trust sales and service teams has helped us to drive incremental growth in insurance linked securities and clos our pipeline remained healthy while market share and statistics in this business are imperfect as i ve mentioned before we re gaining share particularly in the structured finance space in treasury services we re continuing to see modest growth in this business payment volume which is the key driver of our fee revenue growth was up 5 year over year and sequentially driven by the volume growth from both new and existing clients our focus on growing liability balances from our treasury services clients has been paying off as we experience growth in attracting competitively priced interest bearing operational client deposits to support our climate clients payment activities in clearance and collateral management we reported 10 revenue growth we again saw strong revenue growth from our historical clients newly converted government clearing broker dealer clients higher clearance volumes related to record issuance levels and strong demand for u s government and treasury issuances and growth in collateral management activity from new business and increased client activity our clearance and collateral managing capabilities are among the best in the business and our collateral optimization and segregation services go beyond what others can provide as collateral management becomes increasingly important part of the investment process we are a major beneficiary we re seeing interest from new entrants to the collateral market such as alternative asset managers investing their cash in repo turning to investment management asset management had a difficult quarter with revenues down 11 a cumulative impact of outflows year to date particularly in our active equity strategies as well as lower equity markets the unfavorable impact of a stronger u s dollar and some small divestitures drove the results we saw strong flows into our liability driven investment strategies as that business has continued to consistently perform well over a number of years performance across some key strategies has been good evidenced by solid performance fees in the quarter and for the full year wealth management revenues were down 2 primarily driven by the impact of lower equity markets and lower net interest revenue we continue to believe that we should be able to drive more growth in this business over time shifting to talent we continue to attract terrific people during the quarter we announced that lester owens will be joining our executive committee next month as head of operations lester is an experienced operations executive who has occupied key roles in large complex financial services organizations he also has a reputation as a great leader with a passion for efficiency transformation controls and working with clients lester will join us next month and help us and our clients rethink how we process securities and cash with the goal of gaining material efficiencies and improved quality on the capital front we continue to be keenly focused on intelligently deploying our capital including returning excess capital to shareholders last month we announced that we received approval to increase our repurchase program a common stock by an additional 830 million and we completed it in the fourth quarter in the past our ability to return additional capital to shareholders have been constrained by our internal ccar models and we ve refined those models we are pleased to now be in a position to return additional capital to our shareholders and we are confident that we will continue to maintain strong capital ratios and be able to invest in our business going forward with this higher level of capital return in terms of 2019 while we cannot predict market levels and interest rates the environment is clearly more difficult today than one quarter ago and to state the obvious at these levels the markets will not be a significant contributor to our results in 2019 therefore we remain focused on building the underlying franchise to drive higher levels of organic growth and we ll continue to remain disciplined on expenses and even if the market constrains our short term growth our goal is to ensure we drive eps growth as we benefit from our strong spend disciplines and capital actions with that let me turn it over to mike mike santomassimo chief financial officer thanks charlie let me run through the details of our results for the quarter and the full year then provide some further thoughts on 2019 note that all comparisons will be on a year over year basis unless otherwise specified beginning on page 3 of the financial highlights document in the final quarter of 2018 we had earnings of 832 million and eps of 0 84 down 22 but as charlie mentioned both the current and prior year quarters included a number of notable items that make comparisons difficult as a reminder our fourth quarter 2017 results included 0 17 per share net benefit related to the new u s tax legislation and charges related to severance litigation and asset impairment and losses on sale of certain securities in our investment portfolio our results in the fourth quarter of 2018 included 0 16 cents per share related to severance charges expenses associated with the real estate consolidation and litigation charges partially offset by a positive adjustment to provisional estimates for u s tax legislation and other changes the severance expenses which are a little more than half of the charge are related to actions we are taking to drive more efficiency across the firm many of the actions are already completed and we expect to see the payback in 2019 as i have noted throughout the year the remaining 60 million of the costs associated with relocating our corporate headquarters was recorded in the fourth quarter and is included in the notable items excluding the notable items we had earnings of 987 million and eps of 0 99 up 9 in terms of shareholder capital return as charlie mentioned we received approval to buyback 830 million of additional common shares and completed it all in the fourth quarter in total for the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 29 million shares for 1 37 billion and paid 278 million in dividends for the full year of 2018 we returned 4 3 billion or just over 100 of earnings to common shareholders through 3 3 billion of share repurchases and approximately 1 1 billion in dividends now turning to our gaap financial highlights on page 4 total revenue in the fourth quarter was up 7 year over year pre tax income up 40 and net income applicable to common shareholders was down 26 page 5 shows the highlights after excluding the notable items in both quarters which may help better understand the underlying performance total revenue was down 1 fee revenue was also down 1 please note that the impact of notable items of revenue is all in the other segment so it does not impact the revenue disclosures in either investment services or investment management fourth quarter net interest revenue increased 4 to 885 million driven by the impact of higher interest rates on interest earning assets and a leasing adjustment recorded in q4 2017 this was partially offset by lower non interest bearing deposits net interest revenue declined 1 sequentially due to higher deposit rates and the impact of interest rate hedging this was partially offset by higher deposit balances sequentially the impact of higher interest rates on deposit pricing and other interest bearing liability rates was greater than the benefit to the securities portfolio yield and other interest earning assets on page 8 of our earnings release you can see that year over year our average interest bearing deposits increased 9 while our average non interest bearing deposits declined 15 sequentially average interest bearing parties increased 9 and non interest bearing deposits declined 3 as we have consistently said for our client base deposit pricing is continually becoming more competitive with betas increasing as rates rise the rates on our interest bearing deposits increased from 63 basis points in the third quarter to 86 basis points this quarter on the surface this would imply a deposit beta of approximately 82 across all currencies when you focus on core interest bearing u s dollar client deposits excluding wholesale funding betas have been in the mid 80 over the past few rate hikes and were closer to 100 in the fourth quarter the net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 1 24 sequentially the nim declined 3 basis points while we focus on nim we are seeking to maximize earnings and take advantage of opportunity to seize the capacity we have on our balance sheet for example we will take on temporary non operating deposits and reinvest them risk fee risk free at a central bank or a government security we had the opportunity to do that in the fourth quarter these riskless transactions are accretive to net interest income but they may have a modest spread that could negatively impact the nim also note that the effects of certain hedging activities are recorded in fee revenue and not reflected in net interest revenue or the nim this negatively impacted net interest revenue and the nim by approximately 1 5 to 2 basis points sequentially picking back up on the highlights after excluding the notable items on page 5 our expenses of 2 7 billion were essentially flat as our continued investments in technology were mostly offset by decreases in other expenses pretax income was down 3 net income applicable to common shareholders which benefited from a lower tax rate in the u s was up 4 and our earnings per share were up 9 when you include the impact of our share repurchases the full year results on a gaap basis are on page 6 we had earnings of 4 1 billion or 4 04 per share our earnings per share was up 9 and our return on tangible common equity was 22 5 on page 7 of the full year results excluding the notable items we had earnings of 4 3 billion or 4 21 per common share and our earnings per share was up 18 page 8 highlights our investment service businesses business results investment services revenue was 3 billion up 3 within investment services asset servicing revenue was down 2 to 1 4 billion primarily reflecting lower client assets and activity and the impact of a stronger dollar partially offset by higher net interest revenue this includes a modest decline in securities lending revenue due to lower u s equity and lower u s government balances and spreads pershing revenue with down 2 to 558 million due to the impact of previously disclosed lost business partially offset by higher clearance volumes and net interest income excluding the impact of the lost clients the underlying business grew closer to 4 issuer services revenue was up 25 to 441 million primarily reflecting higher depository receipts revenue driven by corporate actions and higher volumes in depository receipts and a smaller volume increase in corporate trust the sequential decrease reflects seasonality in depository receipts treasury services revenue increased 2 year year to 328 million primarily reflecting higher payment volumes and net interest revenue clearance and collateral management revenue was up 10 year over year and 5 sequentially to 278 million both increases reflect growth in clearance and collateral management in higher net interest revenue the new clients that we are onboarded and other increases in collateral activity drove a 22 increase in average tri party collateral management balances non interest expense within investment services increased 1 year over year to 2 1 billion driven by investments in technology partially offset by the impact of the notable items the sequential increase of 4 primarily reflects higher severance expense and investments in technology also on the metrics foreign exchange and other trading revenue was down 3 assets under custody and or administration declined 1 to 33 1 trillion and just a reminder that approximately 1 3 of our assets under custody and or administration are equities and the average long term mutual fund assets were down 4 primarily due to the impact of lost clients and lower equity markets the sequential decline is primarily driven by the decline in equity markets in the fourth quarter and other activity now turning to page 9 for the investment management business highlights asset management revenue was down 11 year over year and 6 sequentially to 660 million primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows in prior quarters lower equity markets and loss revenues associated with sale of center square and the unfavorable impact of a stronger u s dollar wealth management revenue was down 2 year over year and 3 sequentially to 303 million with both decreases driven by lower market values and lower net interest revenue assets under management decreased 9 and 6 sequentially to 1 7 trillion we had outflows in most asset classes with total net flows of 18 billion we had 14 billion of inflows into liability driven investments as charlie mentioned this business continues to perform well equity outflows were 8 billion with a little under half of that coming from lower fee mandates fixed income outflows were 1 billion and multi asset and alternative outflows were 2 billion index strategy outflows were 11 billion primarily from the equity index products and approximately half of that was from one institutional client rotating asset classes cash outflows were 10 billion approximately half of which occurred at year end some of which we have seen return within the first week of 2019 now turning to our other segment on page 10 fee revenue increased year over year and sequentially primarily reflecting the negative impact of the u s tax legislation on our investments in renewable energy in the fourth quarter of 2017 the benefit of which shows up in the tax line non interest expense increase your over year and sequentially primarily reflecting expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters and higher severance moving now to capital and liquidity on page 11 our capital liquidity ratios remain strong as of december 31st our key ratios declined since the end of q3 primarily due to share repurchases in the quarter common equity tier 1 capital totaled 17 6 billion at december 31st and our cet 1 ratio was 10 6 under the advanced approach the supplementary leverage ratio was 6 our average lcr or liquidity coverage ratio in the fourth quarter was 118 page 12 details our expenses on a consolidated gaap basis expenses of 3 billion were essentially flat reflecting investments in technology and the expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters offset by lower staff expense lower bank assessment charges and the favorable impact from a stronger dollar note that the technology expenses were included in staff professional deal and other purchase services as well as software equipment the 9 sequential increase primarily reflects higher severance expense expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters and investments in technology and partially offset by the lower bank assessment charges primarily fdic expenses now let me spend a few minutes on how we re thinking about 2019 the equity markets and higher interest rates have been key drivers of revenue growth for the last couple of years if these levels persist the markets would not be a significant contributor to our results in 2019 while our business model does benefit from economic growth and increasing markets over time we are focused on organic growth and our adding services products and technology entering new markets improving the client experience and working to be more solutions driven on behalf of our clients across our company we ve been making investments and shifting how we operate in support of organic growth but those actions will take time to show up in our numbers one note on fee revenue for the first quarter investment management fees will be impacted by the market levels and outflows in the fourth quarter i would factor that into your modeling with respect to net interest revenue there are a few variables to consider at this point in the quarter interest bearing deposits are trending in line with the fourth quarter we would also expect the non interest bearing deposits which continue to tick down but it s still really early in the quarter deposit betas are consistent with what i discussed earlier the yield on our securities portfolio should continue to grind up through 2019 the portfolio yields should benefit from factors including higher short term rates and reinvestment opportunities the sequential change in the yield in the first quarter should improve versus the change in the fourth quarter the change quarter to quarter for the remainder of the year will be dependent on rates just a reminder that the duration of the portfolio is approximately two years and approximately 30 of it reprices each quarter if all these assumptions play out for the first quarter we would expect an interest rate to be flat to up a little versus the fourth quarter of 2018 on the expense front we expect our technology spend to increase in 2019 reflecting the ramp up of spend this year in 2018 which was largely included in the fourth quarter run rate this spend continues to be focused on our operating platform and the expansion of development resources to extend and enhance our capabilities and to support new business onboarding in support of organic growth that we discussed here and back at our investor day even with these investments excluding the notable items we do not expect to significantly increase our expense base in 2019 with regard to expenses in the first quarter a reminder about the typical first quarter impact to staff expense from the acceleration of long term incentive compensation expense for retirement eligible employees the impact of which should be similar to last year despite that adjusted for the notable items discussed earlier we expect expenses to go up around 1 to 2 for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018 we should see the benefit of actions related to the severance that we booked in the fourth quarter to streamline our organization and boost productivity later in the year in terms of our tax rate there were a number of clarifications to new u s tax legislation that were published in late november and december based on our interpretation of those rules we currently expect the full year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 21 as i mentioned we completed the full 830 million of additional buybacks in the fourth quarter this coupled with the impact of further capital distributions should be incorporated into your modelling assuming the assumptions play out our goal would be to have reasonable growth in earnings per common share before opening the call i just want to mention one additional thing we have approximately 160 million of exposure to the california utility that s been in the press lately that has plans to potentially file bankruptcy we increased our provision on that credit in the quarter a bit but may have additional impact depending on how the facts and circumstances develop with that operator can you please open the lines for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer hey ken ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks good morning guys hey good morning just one clarification that i know will come up when you guys are talking about reasonable eps growth this year just can you just level set us on your starting point is that off of a gaap basis or is that off of your adjusted basis mike santomassimo chief financial officer it s off an adjusted basis ken usdin jefferies analyst so off of the 421 basis you d expect eps growth mike santomassimo chief financial officer well again i mean that is what we re shooting for obviously it depends on what the market is but that is absolutely true ken usdin jefferies analyst ok ok and secondly then to your point also about not increasing expenses by much is the thought that you have on 1 to 2 year over year in the first quarter the generic way we should be thinking about expenses over the course or does something change with the trajectory as the severance benefit the benefits from the severance you took starts to layer in against future investments charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes i think i don t think we want to give you a number for the full year otherwise we would have but i think the way you re thinking about it is right which is the benefits that we will get on the severance actions that we ve taken this quarter will really start second quarter and then in the second half of the year and so there ll be more benefits in that period of time so overall again i think the words are the words that we intended to use it s obviously early but i think the point we want to make sure you understand is no 1 is we re highly highly focused on driving efficiency inside the company we think that and i ve described this before that when we when you take actions the next set of actions become even clearer and so that is something that in our business we re going to continue to do and we re going to do it at the same time that we are going to increase the spend where we need to expend it so all in all we feel very good about our ability to really control expenses while investing where we think we need to next year ken usdin jefferies analyst ok and then just to clarify when you do you expect like the gaap between your gaap expenses and adjusted expenses to narrow like do you expect as many of these non core notable items as you go forward are we going to see like these big severance things every quarter i guess that s the question charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes no listen certainly we hope not i mean it s something these things at some point have to become a just part of what we do is we right size the employee base i mentioned on the last quarter call that we were taking a step back and really thinking about how the company was organized i talked about the spends and the layers and the managers that have very few direct reports that was a very specific initiative that we looked at across the entire company i think what we would hope is as we go forward it becomes more ordinary course as managers manage based upon attrition and things like that and hopefully these things do go away ken usdin jefferies analyst ok thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael carrier with bank of america michael carrier bank of america analyst thanks guys the first question some of the investments that you have been making and both your comments just on the focus on organic growth i just wanted to get an update on maybe where you re seeing some of the earlier traction and what we should be focused on as we move through 19 and 20 to see some of the kind of realizations charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes this is charlie thanks for the question why don t i start and then mike will comment along the way i guess as we said we ve talked about the fact that given the nature of what our business is it does take time having said that there are some businesses that are further along and we see a clear path toward increasing the rate of revenue growth others is still evolving let me start with pershing as an example in the world in which pershing operates we ve talked about the opportunity to expand our offerings and grow in the ria category historically we ve been very very strong in the broker dealer category so that s still a significant opportunity that we see and just more generically there are more banks and broker dealers that are looking at us for outsourcing and i just when you just think about the increasing technology needs the increasing complexity of what s required other priorities they have they re looking to us to figure out how to help them both wind up as with a better product but also allow them to focus on what they can actually create value in today we mentioned that in our remarks that pershing revenue declined 2 year over year even though it was flat year to year big portion of that is driven downward by these two clients that we have mentioned excluding that we were up 4 and i think the most important thing beyond that which we ve mentioned is we have a very significant pipeline of signed business in within pershing where we re actually spending the money today to onboard those clients as i mentioned in my remarks that will start to happen in the second quarter of 19 and into 2020 but the pipeline as we see it i asked the question and it s hard to get the exact answer because of the size of the pipeline but it s as big if not it s bigger than any pipeline we ve had in at least five years and probably more than that and the wins and the opportunities are in the u s and then there is europe as well and in europe specifically we see continued opportunities as the wealth management market here develops so it s a lot on pershing but we feel really good about it because of what we actually see in the pipeline even though we ve got to wait a little bit to see it in the revenue line but longer term pershing is a it s a hugely important platform for us to participate in the growth and wealth management in the u s and in europe in addition to that our own wealth management business i ve spoken about this one is early on catherine keating was just showing this in the third quarter she s working on developing exactly what the plans are and she s starting to move toward implementation of what those are its products its banking infrastructure its sales products its incentives and so that s not something we would expect to see in the next couple of quarters but just given what we know we ve done there we ve as i said we ve been a consistent performer but we have more and should be able to grow faster than we re growing mike maybe you want to talk a little about treasury services and clearance and collateral management mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes mike maybe i ll start with clearance and collateral first so when you look at that business obviously one of the big drivers of it is the business we re bringing in from the other competitor around the government clearing business and when you look at the tri party balance growth of 22 about two thirds of it is from those clients coming in from jpmorgan about 1 3 of it is actually other new activity happening both new clients and activity from our existing clients and you re seeing good traction in products like our margin segregation product where market participants now need to hold segregated margin balances with providers like us and that was a business that was zero just couple of years ago and we re seeing good traction and that s contributing to sort of the growth in the collateral balances you see there and there s a whole set of other initiatives that sort of underlie that business and as we sort of bring in these government clearing clients i think they re finding that our capabilities are a bit differentiated in the collateral space and then than what they saw and are the conversations are happening are getting better and better and sort of happening real time here and more people are interested in our collateral optimization service and a whole series of things that we ve been trying to do there on treasury services again this is another business where we brought in a new ceo just in the summer and what paul camp has been working on is helping reposition sort of the way people think about us historically we ve positioned ourselves as more of a receivables bank i e like we ll collect your payments a collections bank versus a payments bank and when you start focusing more on the payments piece that s what brings liquidity balances and a broader set of dialogue that we can have with these clients so we ve changed our we ve changed the leadership and focus of our sales team we ve changed the incentives we have underneath it you can t see it from the disclosures but underneath that the treasury services deposits are growing just over 10 just from the third quarter so when you look at third quarter to fourth quarter they re up about 10 and so you re seeing sort of the traction real time and if i just use sort of one example i m not going to give you a client name but when you look at there s an international development bank that we ve been working with for a number of years in a very small way with treasury services we have a strong relationship across the company with them and what and we ve been working to improve a couple of very minor changes to some products that we have that opens up a wallet of billions of dollars of deposit balances that we have or mandated on now and are sort of in the process of coming through so you re seeing good traction in really all of these businesses that i think builds up over time to show sort of that organic growth story i don t know charlie you want to talk about asset servicing charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes maybe i ll just i know this is a long answer but obviously this is extraordinarily important asset servicing hugely important part of the business we our belief is we have real differentiation here we have a data platform we are willing to work openly with front end providers and we re working toward more tight integration to the benefit of our clients and we re continuing to improve infrastructure and the quality of what we do which isn t a sexy thing to talk about but in what we do it really does matter and so this is more of a long term build because of the nature of what these relationships are how long the sales cycle is but there s progress in what we re doing this quarter we brought in a 100 billion of fund administration from just one client specifically 400 billion of new custody etfs and mutual funds from a provider so we have plenty of examples of places they re winning but this will be a slower build because of from where we re starting from from what we ve seen in pershing and some of these other businesses so why don t i stop there michael carrier bank of america analyst ok no thanks for all that and then mike just a quick one on capital just given the decline in the ratios with the buybacks and then what you mentioned on the balance sheet just how should we be thinking about managing that going forward just through the regulatory process and then just some of the opportunities that you re seeing mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes i mean obviously mike between now and the second quarter of 2019 our remaining buybacks are already sort of defined based on what got approved in ccar last year so that should be pretty easy to sort of think about for the first half of the year and as we look to ccar 2018 or 2019 sorry the a lot of the work that we put into getting the incremental 800 million 830 million approved sort of flows right into sort of the modeling that we ll do as part of that process that process kicks off sort of as we speak and so over the next couple of weeks i think we ll all have a better sense of sort of the inputs that go into that michael carrier bank of america analyst ok thanks a lot operator our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks very much maybe just to follow on on the organic growth thanks guys you covered a lot of that a couple of additional questions in terms of the market conditions obviously they re challenging right now but how would you expect volatility to help your overall revenue including on the organic growth side if we have a situation in 2019 where we have choppy markets maybe flat but much more volatile can you talk about the potential benefit for both the collateral management business that you referred to mike and fx and other trading and then also just quickly on the lag between expenses of the onboarding for pershing versus clocking that revenue in mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes i mean look the expenses as we i ll start with the last piece first so in pershing as we said most of the expenses that we re incurring to onboard that business are being spent as we speak and so the profile of the pershing expense base isn t unexpected to change substantially in 2019 and as charlie mentioned that revenue will start to kick in in the second half of 19 and more substantially in the first part of 2020 so you ll sort of see it come in that trajectory as you sort of think about volatility for us and sort of if i sort of tick through each of the businesses just to give you a sense of where we see it so in pershing we do see increased transaction volumes at times during periods of volatility having said that much of the accounts that sort of that are underpinned are our book of business our managed accounts so we re not in a we re not necessarily supporting sort of retail self directed retail brokerage type clients and so you won t necessarily see the peaks and valleys of transaction activity as sort of volatility spikes up and down but you will see that sort of positively impacted and as you look back over the last few months transaction volumes were up a little but they weren t outsized in sort of any way in that business and then in asset servicing is where you ll you may see some of it as well and so that we give you disclosures around our foreign exchange revenue so obviously if volatility picks up in foreign exchange you ll see that come through the revenue line and then the volumes that we see will be dependent upon underlying client activity and then in the core asset servicing business think of that revenue as probably about 1 3 of it is sort of transaction driven revenue and so that piece of it will move up and down based on what you see in the market but keep in mind that as i said in my remarks about 1 3 of our assets in our custody are equities so just because you see big spikes and valleys in sort of the equity markets and volatility there doesn t necessarily mean that s going to translate into huge upticks in sort of transaction related revenue charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer this is charlie i want to add one quick thing which is all that s very that s kind of what should drive some of the steps more mathematically but to state the obvious which is the reasons behind the volatility really matter to us there s good volatility and there s less good volatility what we ve seen this quarter is the bad kind of volatility which drives assets away from the businesses that we benefit from and so the why will really matter to us as we look out over the next year brian bedell deutsche bank analyst right great that makes sense maybe just a follow on on the expenses charlie if you can talk a little bit about a little bit more about the nature of some of the investments that are now in the run rate maybe just highlight of a couple two or three of the most major ones and then just from that your discussion of the expense rate not expense base not significantly going up is that an assumption on the markets remaining flat and say to set on hold or the markets improving and then maybe just which management layer areas were most restructured in terms of the businesses charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer so let me try and remember all three and i ll do them backwards on the third one it was across the entire company as i said before we really looked at spans layers and the series of things like that across the entire entity from the staff areas to investment services to our investment management businesses and so i think it s very consistent in addition ongoing efficiencies through our operations areas on top of that are things that we ve seen and then just tactically some spots in different places but overall i would say it was pretty consistent on the second question about expenses relative to the environment i would characterize it as we re thinking about what the right level for us to invest in and so i think with a cautious eye toward next year that s where we plan for to the extent that the environment gets even worse we always have levers we could pull if we thought things were going to really get bad and actually stay there for a period of time and maybe spend a little bit more if all of a sudden the world changed very dramatically but i don t want to overstate either of those two cases up or down i think where we re planning for is where we feel the right level of spend for us is within a reasonable range of outcomes for next year and i m sorry the first i what was the first one again brian bedell deutsche bank analyst the first one which is yeah i know thank you the first one was just the maybe a couple examples of the investments that you made most recently and in which areas i m sorry technology investments i m sorry charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer sure so first of all mike s referenced and i both referenced the work that s ongoing in pershing to onboard these clients a lot of the work to bring on these clients isn t just bringing i mean it takes a long time because you have to build a set of capabilities and you build a set of capabilities that you can then scale and provide to others so there s a significant amount of technology work that has to go into bringing on those pershing clients and that s embedded in the overall spend numbers that we talked about we ve talked about in the corporate trust business how we continue to build out our technology platform for things other than just pure traditional products that s embedded in the spend as we think about asset servicing we re highly focused on automation we re highly focused on figuring out how to continue to build our data infrastructure so i think those are just some examples brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thank you so much operator our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken ubs analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the question i m sorry charlie were you in the middle of saying something charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes no the only thing i just in my mind i m just thinking i think we one area that we haven t mentioned is our markets business and as we think about where we would make the investments we ve talked about this in the past we ve talked about the progress that we ve made you ve seen it in the numbers you see it we ve talked about some of the new products that we ve offered and a lot of what s happening there is really based upon technology spend brennan hawken ubs analyst ok bedell you owe me one i just gave you a little ot on your last question so there you go curious about deposit trends so i think mike you had commented that you guys see them as consistent quarter to date with what you saw in the fourth quarter but deposit trends were a little mixed under the surface and you excluded the wholesale or the cd prices from your deposit betas so i m curious when you comment on deposits are you talking about the total interest bearing deposit balance that on average was 161 7 or are you talking about the deposits excluding the cds and how should we think about that cd growth it s really picked up the growth in cds has picked up pretty substantially here the last few quarters how are you thinking about that into next year mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes my remarks were in total brennan thanks for the question and clarify that and the reason why i think you sort of need to look through the look through into sort of what s happening with your client deposits obviously wholesale funding is more index based pricing for the most part and so you really want to try to understand what s happening with your clients in those conversations so that s why we re trying to give you that color i think as you sort of think about the wholesale funding i don t see it moving in any substantial way from current levels brennan hawken ubs analyst ok all right great thanks for clarifying that and then so the second question on issuer services you guys provided some color in the commentary on the fact that there were some elevated activities depository receipts latam kind of curious about how sustainable you would see this activity level was this corporate action activity impacted by maybe the volatile markets that we saw in the quarter or it was also quite a quarter for m a closing activity did that come into play into that line as well thanks charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes so m a closing activity no volatility a little bit i guess i would say and i think relative to the question of sustainability i guess the way to think about it is and we ve talked about this which is within issuer services that s corporate trust and dr corporate trust we are seeing revenue growth it s not huge but it is growing and based on the actions that we ve taken hopefully that will continue that is deal by deal and we feel better about our calling efforts we feel better about the capabilities that we continue to build so hopefully that growth will continue within drs you know this and we ve said this is it s quarter by quarter can be very volatile be very very seasonable and if you look at our yearly performance from i think it s 17 to 18 while the quarters matter a lot overall when you look at the full year relatively i don t remember exactly but relatively flat when we look at 2017 to 2018 same thing is true albeit within the fourth quarter we had strong performance and part of that by the way is driven by in the fourth quarter of the prior year we actually had a very weak dr quarter so that s a long way of saying that as we look forward we would think that the full year performance is sustainable albeit it s going to be volatile quarter to quarter brennan hawken ubs analyst that s really fair thank you just i m sorry one follow up in your comment on corporate trust how much has clo the clo trustee business helped in some of that corporate trust growth recently and could you walk through a little bit about how sustainable you think that growth might be mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes look brennan underneath we don t disclose the components of corporate trust as you know but the clo business has been an area of strength for us this year where we have picked up market share and so it has been a contributor to that underlying growth and we ve been talking consistently now for the last year or so where we ve been making some investments in some of the underlying technology for to better support that business and we re seeing the benefits of that come through through some of the market share that we ve been picking up this year and so that has been a contributor brennan hawken ubs analyst great thanks for letting me sneak in one more charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer sure operator thank you we ll next go to the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst thanks hey good morning guys so the first question is just around the expense trends i think in the beginning of the year last year you guys talked about reinvesting the majority of the tax savings which i think was in kind of the 250 million to 300 million range charlie i think you mentioned 100 in tech spend this year so did the investment pace change or some of that is just kind of slipping into next year mike santomassimo chief financial officer alex maybe just to correct that so i think what charlie was referring to was the quarter so if you look at the spend on a full year basis for 18 then we spent probably just over 300 million alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it so that s all in the run rate mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it understood and then just digging into the issuer services again for a second if we look at just the fee components not so excluding the nir i think the growth was quite substantial this year i think 10 plus can you help me understand again kind of sustainability of that growth because to your point i mean it s a fairly mature business it s something we haven t seen that type of growth from there in quite some time mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes the as charlie mentioned if you sort of unpick both corporate trust and dr alex i think the corporate trust fee line is a pretty consistent sort of story right where you ve seen that sort of tick up sort of gradually over the last number of quarters and given the trend we re seeing on a full year basis we would still expect that to sort of tick up a little bit in 2019 i think in the dr revenue i think is the place where you ve seen a little bit more volatility sort of year to year so in 17 to 18 it was up a little and given some of the things that charlie talked about in terms of some timing of corporate actions that happened the volatility that we saw that drives transactional volume in some of the different quarters and so as we said as we sort of look to 2019 we think that the 2018 numbers plus or minus sort of a little look like a good way to think about the full year story for next year alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it great thanks operator thank you we ll next go to mike mayo with wells fargo rob rutschow wells fargo analyst hi it s rob rutschow for mike just a follow up on the expenses you ve mentioned i think previously that there are 11 layers of management between charlie in the bottom of the organization what s the right level and how long does that take to get there and then how should we think about that from an expense perspective charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer we have eliminated depending on where you are in the company call it two to three as part of this exercise and the actions as we said a bunch of them have already happened in the month of january and so over the next couple of months is when we ll actually see the impact get into our run rate rob rutschow wells fargo analyst and then i understand that i guess severance is kind of a recurring nonrecurring but how what was that in the quarter and how should we think about that going forward charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer i answered the question earlier about how to think about it going forward mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes and in my remarks rob i mentioned that the severance charge is little over half of notable items expense notable items in the quarter rob rutschow wells fargo analyst ok thank you charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja j p morgan analyst hi thanks sorry it s a day with overlapping calls so if i ve missed some of this sorry severance is over half just going into those noncore just so that we can have our numbers correct as we look forward charlie i missed your comment on how to think about it going forward but i will go back and talk to ir 16 million in real estate relocation so is the rest all from higher litigation mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes the three components of the notable items vivek this is mike obviously are the severance the real estate charges and litigation correct vivek juneja j p morgan analyst ok so ok ok and when you are saying little over half you re talking 50 60

a t a conference in singapore on january 15th indonesian officials were out in force four senior ministers the bosses of three state owned enterprises and a senior civil servant took to the stage to try to drum up private investment in roads and railways the audience mainly financiers nodded along not everyone was convinced though the risks don t match the returns complained one red tape is a headache changes in government policy could derail an investment if things go badly you get zero listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element such risks are particularly high in indonesia at the moment the country is gearing up for presidential and legislative elections in april the incumbent president joko widodo or jokowi will face prabowo subianto a former general in a rematch of the previous vote in 2014 the two were squaring off in the first of five debates as the economist went to press jokowi s biggest vulnerability is the economy where returns have not matched his promises during the 2014 campaign jokowi pledged to deliver gdp growth of 7 a year by the end of his first term that will not happen growth has instead hovered around 5 since he took office prospects for 2019 look no better especially since the central bank has raised interest rates six times in the past nine months to arrest a worrying slide in the currency was jokowi s promise realistic the country certainly has enormous potential about half of its 265m people are younger than 30 and its national saving rate is typically above 30 of gdp its economy routinely grew faster than 7 a year before the asian financial crisis of 1997 but that era offers little guidance to indonesia today the country s labour force is growing less quickly than it did in the 1990s its oil imports have long since surpassed its exports although it remains a net seller of commodities in general and now that its gdp per person exceeds 10 000 at purchasing power parity the scope for rapid catch up growth has diminished once an economy has reached indonesia s present level of development growth of 7 even for a single year is rare see chart in the years since 1997 china has also become a more decisive influence on indonesia s fortunes both as a consumer of its abundant resources and a competitor to its hard pressed factories china s rapid rise pumped up commodity prices from 2003 to 2011 and punctured rival manufacturers in a variety of emerging economies both trends have contributed to what economists call premature deindustrialisation in indonesia manufacturing peaked as a share of gdp over 15 years ago at a much lower level of income than in america say which acquired its rustbelt only after it grew rich rather than taking comfortable post industrial white collar jobs many factory workers moved into less productive employment such as informal trading explains zulfan tadjoeddin of western sydney university when jokowi took office the world bank calculated that indonesia s potential rate of growth was 5 5 the best way to improve that number would be to revive the manufacturing sector emulating other asian countries by becoming part of the global supply chain myriad problems stand in the way many of which the government is taking steps to fix but too often populist and nationalist tendencies are the main cause of obstruction take indonesia s neglected infrastructure expensive electricity and slow transport put off manufacturers jokowi came to power with a 323bn 32 of gdp plan to solve this reducing fuel subsidies to pay for it he aimed to build new airports seaports and power plants as well as 3 258km of railways and 3 650km of roads by 2022 to speed up progress the government also made compulsory land acquisition easier but in last year s budget jokowi changed course expenditure on vote winning energy subsidies jumped by 69 and the growth of infrastructure spending slowed how then will jokowi pay for his building plans so far the infrastructure boom has relied on state owned enterprises but the government wants 37 of funding to come from the private sector hence the mobs of ministers at conferences to woo investors the government has eased limits on foreign ownership but only half heartedly every time regulations are loosened nationalists howl so restrictions remain severe discouraging investors rules aimed at boosting small businesses have the same effect the oecd a club mostly of rich countries looked at foreign direct investment fdi rules in 68 rich and middle income countries it found that indonesia had the third most restrictive regime small wonder its fdi as a share of gdp is one of the lowest in the region high trade barriers have not come down since jokowi became president over half of all imports by value are subject to restrictions that adds to the price of imported capital goods like heavy machinery and thus to manufacturing costs exports have also been hampered in 2014 parliament banned the export of metal ores a clumsy attempt to boost local refineries though the rule was later relaxed foreign firms fled and mines closed hobbled by economic nationalism at home indonesia must also contend with growing economic nationalism abroad america s trade war with china and rising american interest rates unnerved emerging market investors last year contributing to the decline in the rupiah indonesia s currency over the longer run however the country hopes to provide a refuge to manufacturers who now deem china too risky or expensive a place for their next factory on the eve of the asian financial crisis china s income per person was only about 40 of indonesia s now it is about 140 that chinese success is also an indonesian opportunity it should be able to attract firms that can no longer afford higher paid chinese workers unfortunately indonesian labour is neither as well qualified nor as keenly priced as it should be business leaders complain about a lack of skilled workers education standards are low despite a law forcing the government to spend a fifth of its budget on schooling over half of those who finish school are practically illiterate local labour can also be pricey a survey of firms with ties to japan by the japan external trade organisation a government body shows that the wages of indonesian manufacturing workers are 45 higher than those of their vietnamese counterparts that is partly due to rocketing minimum wages which are set by local government politicians raise the floor to win votes as a result the average minimum wage as a share of the average wage grew from 60 in 2008 to around 90 in 2018 according to ross mcleod of australian national university in some districts it exceeds the average salary for the country as a whole by a fifth this discourages hiring pushing workers into the informal sector or drives firms to ignore the rules to stop this trend the central government capped increases in minimum wages in 2015 but stopped short of reversing previous rises if the government s attempts to open up the economy remain feeble 7 growth will remain out of reach but a hefty win in april s election could give jokowi the mandate to make the sweeping changes indonesia needs if he wins a second term he will have to take greater risks to reap the returns he has promised

as of today january 16 2019 and will not be updated now i will turn the call over to charlie charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott good morning everyone thanks for joining us as usual i ll make some comments and then turn it over to mike you can see that we reported earnings per share of 0 84 down 22 from last year s fourth quarter both this quarter and last year s fourth quarter included a number of notable items that make comparisons difficult but we will do our best to explain what s included so you can perform your own analysis of the quarter notable items in the fourth quarter of 2018 reduced earnings by 0 16 this includes costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters severance charges and litigation expenses those costs were partly offset by some tax adjustments as a reminder our fourth quarter results in 2017 included notable items that increased earnings by 0 17 per share these items were related to the estimated benefit of u s tax legislation partially offset by some actions we took on a gaap basis our revenues grew 7 expenses decreased 1 pre tax earnings grew 40 and after tax earnings decreased 26 if you were to exclude these notable items in both periods which you can see in the reconciliation table on the second page of the earnings release revenue declined 1 expenses were essentially flat pre tax earnings decreased 3 after tax earnings increased 4 and earnings per share increased 9 my comments will refer to our results excluding notable items in both periods let me mention a few things about the overall results first while we aren t happy with the revenue decline of 1 it s important to note that we saw growth in many of our investment services business in total investment services revenue grew 3 and investment management revenue declined by 8 due to the combination of outflows currency and the impact of lower equity markets and we continue to benefit from increasing interest rates albeit at a slower rate than prior quarters the second thing is that we remain extremely focused on controlling our expenses while we continue to significantly increase our technology and infrastructure investments excluding the notable items our expenses were set were essentially flat to the prior year our technology expenses increased about 100 million versus the prior year while all other expenses decreased a little more than the same amount i mentioned on last quarter s earnings call that we see meaningful opportunities to become more efficient across the company while we re looking to automate many of the manual tasks we perform we also see broader opportunities to continue to drive efficiency on last quarter s call i used the example of a significant opportunity to reduce management layers and increase spans of control this quarter s gaap results include a severance charge which includes these actions many of which we ve already completed we anticipate that the payback on this severance will be less than one year these savings and other efficiencies we continue to drive toward will allow us to continue to increase our investment in technology and infrastructure without significantly increasing our expense base but as i also said on last quarter s earnings call while these changes result in lower costs they help advance our culture by improving decision making allowing us to move more quickly and making sure we have our best people in roles which allow them to grow and contribute more significantly to our growth agenda and thirdly as we ve said consistently the road to increase our organic growth will take time but we do see some progress the impact of the markets and interest rates will ebb and flow but we must grow the franchise and we remain focused on methodically building our capabilities to increase our rate of organic growth as 2019 unfolds we hope to provide a clearer roadmap of how this is playing out let s go through our businesses starting with asset servicing asset servicing revenue was down 2 although we continue to have a healthy pipeline the impact from new business was minimal there were negative impacts from asset outflows from sync from existing clients these clients did not leave us but saw outflows from their accounts this can shift based on market conditions and investor behavior the decline combined with a little lower foreign exchange and securities lending volumes as well as the negative impact of a stronger u s dollar drove the lower revenue year over year the declines were offset by higher net interest revenue due to higher rates we are continuing to invest across this business to improve our core custody and accounting service extend our service and capabilities for alternative managers including credit managers middle office and data management we turn to pershing while revenue is down year over year due to the two previously disclosed client losses revenue was flat sequentially excluding the impact of the lost clients the revenues grew about 4 in addition the business has grown in a number of other fronts the impact of the lost clients has been fully in our run rate since the second quarter of this year and the impact on the year over year growth rate for pershing will abate after the first quarter of 2019 we continue to have a sizable pipeline of new business that we are onboarding now which will begin to go live in the second half of 2019 and have a more meaningful impact in 2020 so we expect pershing will return to revenue growth as the negative impact of the two client losses abate and we onboard the signed business we are as confident as ever in our ability to continue building pershing over the longer term in issuer services revenue growth of 25 was driven primarily by depository receipts corporate action activity and higher volumes although corporate trust also generated a little bit of revenue growth as we discussed previously depository receipts revenue is seasonal and volatility in the market drives cross border settlement activity the timing of corporate action events during the quarter drove significant the year over year growth and volatility levels were particularly high in latin america corporate trust also had some revenue growth this quarter albeit small our efforts to reposition our corporate trust sales and service teams has helped us to drive incremental growth in insurance linked securities and clos our pipeline remained healthy while market share and statistics in this business are imperfect as i ve mentioned before we re gaining share particularly in the structured finance space in treasury services we re continuing to see modest growth in this business payment volume which is the key driver of our fee revenue growth was up 5 year over year and sequentially driven by the volume growth from both new and existing clients our focus on growing liability balances from our treasury services clients has been paying off as we experience growth in attracting competitively priced interest bearing operational client deposits to support our climate clients payment activities in clearance and collateral management we reported 10 revenue growth we again saw strong revenue growth from our historical clients newly converted government clearing broker dealer clients higher clearance volumes related to record issuance levels and strong demand for u s government and treasury issuances and growth in collateral management activity from new business and increased client activity our clearance and collateral managing capabilities are among the best in the business and our collateral optimization and segregation services go beyond what others can provide as collateral management becomes increasingly important part of the investment process we are a major beneficiary we re seeing interest from new entrants to the collateral market such as alternative asset managers investing their cash in repo turning to investment management asset management had a difficult quarter with revenues down 11 a cumulative impact of outflows year to date particularly in our active equity strategies as well as lower equity markets the unfavorable impact of a stronger u s dollar and some small divestitures drove the results we saw strong flows into our liability driven investment strategies as that business has continued to consistently perform well over a number of years performance across some key strategies has been good evidenced by solid performance fees in the quarter and for the full year wealth management revenues were down 2 primarily driven by the impact of lower equity markets and lower net interest revenue we continue to believe that we should be able to drive more growth in this business over time shifting to talent we continue to attract terrific people during the quarter we announced that lester owens will be joining our executive committee next month as head of operations lester is an experienced operations executive who has occupied key roles in large complex financial services organizations he also has a reputation as a great leader with a passion for efficiency transformation controls and working with clients lester will join us next month and help us and our clients rethink how we process securities and cash with the goal of gaining material efficiencies and improved quality on the capital front we continue to be keenly focused on intelligently deploying our capital including returning excess capital to shareholders last month we announced that we received approval to increase our repurchase program a common stock by an additional 830 million and we completed it in the fourth quarter in the past our ability to return additional capital to shareholders have been constrained by our internal ccar models and we ve refined those models we are pleased to now be in a position to return additional capital to our shareholders and we are confident that we will continue to maintain strong capital ratios and be able to invest in our business going forward with this higher level of capital return in terms of 2019 while we cannot predict market levels and interest rates the environment is clearly more difficult today than one quarter ago and to state the obvious at these levels the markets will not be a significant contributor to our results in 2019 therefore we remain focused on building the underlying franchise to drive higher levels of organic growth and we ll continue to remain disciplined on expenses and even if the market constrains our short term growth our goal is to ensure we drive eps growth as we benefit from our strong spend disciplines and capital actions with that let me turn it over to mike mike santomassimo chief financial officer thanks charlie let me run through the details of our results for the quarter and the full year then provide some further thoughts on 2019 note that all comparisons will be on a year over year basis unless otherwise specified beginning on page 3 of the financial highlights document in the final quarter of 2018 we had earnings of 832 million and eps of 0 84 down 22 but as charlie mentioned both the current and prior year quarters included a number of notable items that make comparisons difficult as a reminder our fourth quarter 2017 results included 0 17 per share net benefit related to the new u s tax legislation and charges related to severance litigation and asset impairment and losses on sale of certain securities in our investment portfolio our results in the fourth quarter of 2018 included 0 16 cents per share related to severance charges expenses associated with the real estate consolidation and litigation charges partially offset by a positive adjustment to provisional estimates for u s tax legislation and other changes the severance expenses which are a little more than half of the charge are related to actions we are taking to drive more efficiency across the firm many of the actions are already completed and we expect to see the payback in 2019 as i have noted throughout the year the remaining 60 million of the costs associated with relocating our corporate headquarters was recorded in the fourth quarter and is included in the notable items excluding the notable items we had earnings of 987 million and eps of 0 99 up 9 in terms of shareholder capital return as charlie mentioned we received approval to buyback 830 million of additional common shares and completed it all in the fourth quarter in total for the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 29 million shares for 1 37 billion and paid 278 million in dividends for the full year of 2018 we returned 4 3 billion or just over 100 of earnings to common shareholders through 3 3 billion of share repurchases and approximately 1 1 billion in dividends now turning to our gaap financial highlights on page 4 total revenue in the fourth quarter was up 7 year over year pre tax income up 40 and net income applicable to common shareholders was down 26 page 5 shows the highlights after excluding the notable items in both quarters which may help better understand the underlying performance total revenue was down 1 fee revenue was also down 1 please note that the impact of notable items of revenue is all in the other segment so it does not impact the revenue disclosures in either investment services or investment management fourth quarter net interest revenue increased 4 to 885 million driven by the impact of higher interest rates on interest earning assets and a leasing adjustment recorded in q4 2017 this was partially offset by lower non interest bearing deposits net interest revenue declined 1 sequentially due to higher deposit rates and the impact of interest rate hedging this was partially offset by higher deposit balances sequentially the impact of higher interest rates on deposit pricing and other interest bearing liability rates was greater than the benefit to the securities portfolio yield and other interest earning assets on page 8 of our earnings release you can see that year over year our average interest bearing deposits increased 9 while our average non interest bearing deposits declined 15 sequentially average interest bearing parties increased 9 and non interest bearing deposits declined 3 as we have consistently said for our client base deposit pricing is continually becoming more competitive with betas increasing as rates rise the rates on our interest bearing deposits increased from 63 basis points in the third quarter to 86 basis points this quarter on the surface this would imply a deposit beta of approximately 82 across all currencies when you focus on core interest bearing u s dollar client deposits excluding wholesale funding betas have been in the mid 80 over the past few rate hikes and were closer to 100 in the fourth quarter the net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 1 24 sequentially the nim declined 3 basis points while we focus on nim we are seeking to maximize earnings and take advantage of opportunity to seize the capacity we have on our balance sheet for example we will take on temporary non operating deposits and reinvest them risk fee risk free at a central bank or a government security we had the opportunity to do that in the fourth quarter these riskless transactions are accretive to net interest income but they may have a modest spread that could negatively impact the nim also note that the effects of certain hedging activities are recorded in fee revenue and not reflected in net interest revenue or the nim this negatively impacted net interest revenue and the nim by approximately 1 5 to 2 basis points sequentially picking back up on the highlights after excluding the notable items on page 5 our expenses of 2 7 billion were essentially flat as our continued investments in technology were mostly offset by decreases in other expenses pretax income was down 3 net income applicable to common shareholders which benefited from a lower tax rate in the u s was up 4 and our earnings per share were up 9 when you include the impact of our share repurchases the full year results on a gaap basis are on page 6 we had earnings of 4 1 billion or 4 04 per share our earnings per share was up 9 and our return on tangible common equity was 22 5 on page 7 of the full year results excluding the notable items we had earnings of 4 3 billion or 4 21 per common share and our earnings per share was up 18 page 8 highlights our investment service businesses business results investment services revenue was 3 billion up 3 within investment services asset servicing revenue was down 2 to 1 4 billion primarily reflecting lower client assets and activity and the impact of a stronger dollar partially offset by higher net interest revenue this includes a modest decline in securities lending revenue due to lower u s equity and lower u s government balances and spreads pershing revenue with down 2 to 558 million due to the impact of previously disclosed lost business partially offset by higher clearance volumes and net interest income excluding the impact of the lost clients the underlying business grew closer to 4 issuer services revenue was up 25 to 441 million primarily reflecting higher depository receipts revenue driven by corporate actions and higher volumes in depository receipts and a smaller volume increase in corporate trust the sequential decrease reflects seasonality in depository receipts treasury services revenue increased 2 year year to 328 million primarily reflecting higher payment volumes and net interest revenue clearance and collateral management revenue was up 10 year over year and 5 sequentially to 278 million both increases reflect growth in clearance and collateral management in higher net interest revenue the new clients that we are onboarded and other increases in collateral activity drove a 22 increase in average tri party collateral management balances non interest expense within investment services increased 1 year over year to 2 1 billion driven by investments in technology partially offset by the impact of the notable items the sequential increase of 4 primarily reflects higher severance expense and investments in technology also on the metrics foreign exchange and other trading revenue was down 3 assets under custody and or administration declined 1 to 33 1 trillion and just a reminder that approximately 1 3 of our assets under custody and or administration are equities and the average long term mutual fund assets were down 4 primarily due to the impact of lost clients and lower equity markets the sequential decline is primarily driven by the decline in equity markets in the fourth quarter and other activity now turning to page 9 for the investment management business highlights asset management revenue was down 11 year over year and 6 sequentially to 660 million primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows in prior quarters lower equity markets and loss revenues associated with sale of center square and the unfavorable impact of a stronger u s dollar wealth management revenue was down 2 year over year and 3 sequentially to 303 million with both decreases driven by lower market values and lower net interest revenue assets under management decreased 9 and 6 sequentially to 1 7 trillion we had outflows in most asset classes with total net flows of 18 billion we had 14 billion of inflows into liability driven investments as charlie mentioned this business continues to perform well equity outflows were 8 billion with a little under half of that coming from lower fee mandates fixed income outflows were 1 billion and multi asset and alternative outflows were 2 billion index strategy outflows were 11 billion primarily from the equity index products and approximately half of that was from one institutional client rotating asset classes cash outflows were 10 billion approximately half of which occurred at year end some of which we have seen return within the first week of 2019 now turning to our other segment on page 10 fee revenue increased year over year and sequentially primarily reflecting the negative impact of the u s tax legislation on our investments in renewable energy in the fourth quarter of 2017 the benefit of which shows up in the tax line non interest expense increase your over year and sequentially primarily reflecting expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters and higher severance moving now to capital and liquidity on page 11 our capital liquidity ratios remain strong as of december 31st our key ratios declined since the end of q3 primarily due to share repurchases in the quarter common equity tier 1 capital totaled 17 6 billion at december 31st and our cet 1 ratio was 10 6 under the advanced approach the supplementary leverage ratio was 6 our average lcr or liquidity coverage ratio in the fourth quarter was 118 page 12 details our expenses on a consolidated gaap basis expenses of 3 billion were essentially flat reflecting investments in technology and the expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters offset by lower staff expense lower bank assessment charges and the favorable impact from a stronger dollar note that the technology expenses were included in staff professional deal and other purchase services as well as software equipment the 9 sequential increase primarily reflects higher severance expense expenses associated with relocating our corporate headquarters and investments in technology and partially offset by the lower bank assessment charges primarily fdic expenses now let me spend a few minutes on how we re thinking about 2019 the equity markets and higher interest rates have been key drivers of revenue growth for the last couple of years if these levels persist the markets would not be a significant contributor to our results in 2019 while our business model does benefit from economic growth and increasing markets over time we are focused on organic growth and our adding services products and technology entering new markets improving the client experience and working to be more solutions driven on behalf of our clients across our company we ve been making investments and shifting how we operate in support of organic growth but those actions will take time to show up in our numbers one note on fee revenue for the first quarter investment management fees will be impacted by the market levels and outflows in the fourth quarter i would factor that into your modeling with respect to net interest revenue there are a few variables to consider at this point in the quarter interest bearing deposits are trending in line with the fourth quarter we would also expect the non interest bearing deposits which continue to tick down but it s still really early in the quarter deposit betas are consistent with what i discussed earlier the yield on our securities portfolio should continue to grind up through 2019 the portfolio yields should benefit from factors including higher short term rates and reinvestment opportunities the sequential change in the yield in the first quarter should improve versus the change in the fourth quarter the change quarter to quarter for the remainder of the year will be dependent on rates just a reminder that the duration of the portfolio is approximately two years and approximately 30 of it reprices each quarter if all these assumptions play out for the first quarter we would expect an interest rate to be flat to up a little versus the fourth quarter of 2018 on the expense front we expect our technology spend to increase in 2019 reflecting the ramp up of spend this year in 2018 which was largely included in the fourth quarter run rate this spend continues to be focused on our operating platform and the expansion of development resources to extend and enhance our capabilities and to support new business onboarding in support of organic growth that we discussed here and back at our investor day even with these investments excluding the notable items we do not expect to significantly increase our expense base in 2019 with regard to expenses in the first quarter a reminder about the typical first quarter impact to staff expense from the acceleration of long term incentive compensation expense for retirement eligible employees the impact of which should be similar to last year despite that adjusted for the notable items discussed earlier we expect expenses to go up around 1 to 2 for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018 we should see the benefit of actions related to the severance that we booked in the fourth quarter to streamline our organization and boost productivity later in the year in terms of our tax rate there were a number of clarifications to new u s tax legislation that were published in late november and december based on our interpretation of those rules we currently expect the full year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 21 as i mentioned we completed the full 830 million of additional buybacks in the fourth quarter this coupled with the impact of further capital distributions should be incorporated into your modelling assuming the assumptions play out our goal would be to have reasonable growth in earnings per common share before opening the call i just want to mention one additional thing we have approximately 160 million of exposure to the california utility that s been in the press lately that has plans to potentially file bankruptcy we increased our provision on that credit in the quarter a bit but may have additional impact depending on how the facts and circumstances develop with that operator can you please open the lines for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer hey ken ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks good morning guys hey good morning just one clarification that i know will come up when you guys are talking about reasonable eps growth this year just can you just level set us on your starting point is that off of a gaap basis or is that off of your adjusted basis mike santomassimo chief financial officer it s off an adjusted basis ken usdin jefferies analyst so off of the 421 basis you d expect eps growth mike santomassimo chief financial officer well again i mean that is what we re shooting for obviously it depends on what the market is but that is absolutely true ken usdin jefferies analyst ok ok and secondly then to your point also about not increasing expenses by much is the thought that you have on 1 to 2 year over year in the first quarter the generic way we should be thinking about expenses over the course or does something change with the trajectory as the severance benefit the benefits from the severance you took starts to layer in against future investments charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes i think i don t think we want to give you a number for the full year otherwise we would have but i think the way you re thinking about it is right which is the benefits that we will get on the severance actions that we ve taken this quarter will really start second quarter and then in the second half of the year and so there ll be more benefits in that period of time so overall again i think the words are the words that we intended to use it s obviously early but i think the point we want to make sure you understand is no 1 is we re highly highly focused on driving efficiency inside the company we think that and i ve described this before that when we when you take actions the next set of actions become even clearer and so that is something that in our business we re going to continue to do and we re going to do it at the same time that we are going to increase the spend where we need to expend it so all in all we feel very good about our ability to really control expenses while investing where we think we need to next year ken usdin jefferies analyst ok and then just to clarify when you do you expect like the gaap between your gaap expenses and adjusted expenses to narrow like do you expect as many of these non core notable items as you go forward are we going to see like these big severance things every quarter i guess that s the question charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes no listen certainly we hope not i mean it s something these things at some point have to become a just part of what we do is we right size the employee base i mentioned on the last quarter call that we were taking a step back and really thinking about how the company was organized i talked about the spends and the layers and the managers that have very few direct reports that was a very specific initiative that we looked at across the entire company i think what we would hope is as we go forward it becomes more ordinary course as managers manage based upon attrition and things like that and hopefully these things do go away ken usdin jefferies analyst ok thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael carrier with bank of america michael carrier bank of america analyst thanks guys the first question some of the investments that you have been making and both your comments just on the focus on organic growth i just wanted to get an update on maybe where you re seeing some of the earlier traction and what we should be focused on as we move through 19 and 20 to see some of the kind of realizations charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes this is charlie thanks for the question why don t i start and then mike will comment along the way i guess as we said we ve talked about the fact that given the nature of what our business is it does take time having said that there are some businesses that are further along and we see a clear path toward increasing the rate of revenue growth others is still evolving let me start with pershing as an example in the world in which pershing operates we ve talked about the opportunity to expand our offerings and grow in the ria category historically we ve been very very strong in the broker dealer category so that s still a significant opportunity that we see and just more generically there are more banks and broker dealers that are looking at us for outsourcing and i just when you just think about the increasing technology needs the increasing complexity of what s required other priorities they have they re looking to us to figure out how to help them both wind up as with a better product but also allow them to focus on what they can actually create value in today we mentioned that in our remarks that pershing revenue declined 2 year over year even though it was flat year to year big portion of that is driven downward by these two clients that we have mentioned excluding that we were up 4 and i think the most important thing beyond that which we ve mentioned is we have a very significant pipeline of signed business in within pershing where we re actually spending the money today to onboard those clients as i mentioned in my remarks that will start to happen in the second quarter of 19 and into 2020 but the pipeline as we see it i asked the question and it s hard to get the exact answer because of the size of the pipeline but it s as big if not it s bigger than any pipeline we ve had in at least five years and probably more than that and the wins and the opportunities are in the u s and then there is europe as well and in europe specifically we see continued opportunities as the wealth management market here develops so it s a lot on pershing but we feel really good about it because of what we actually see in the pipeline even though we ve got to wait a little bit to see it in the revenue line but longer term pershing is a it s a hugely important platform for us to participate in the growth and wealth management in the u s and in europe in addition to that our own wealth management business i ve spoken about this one is early on catherine keating was just showing this in the third quarter she s working on developing exactly what the plans are and she s starting to move toward implementation of what those are its products its banking infrastructure its sales products its incentives and so that s not something we would expect to see in the next couple of quarters but just given what we know we ve done there we ve as i said we ve been a consistent performer but we have more and should be able to grow faster than we re growing mike maybe you want to talk a little about treasury services and clearance and collateral management mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes mike maybe i ll start with clearance and collateral first so when you look at that business obviously one of the big drivers of it is the business we re bringing in from the other competitor around the government clearing business and when you look at the tri party balance growth of 22 about two thirds of it is from those clients coming in from jpmorgan about 1 3 of it is actually other new activity happening both new clients and activity from our existing clients and you re seeing good traction in products like our margin segregation product where market participants now need to hold segregated margin balances with providers like us and that was a business that was zero just couple of years ago and we re seeing good traction and that s contributing to sort of the growth in the collateral balances you see there and there s a whole set of other initiatives that sort of underlie that business and as we sort of bring in these government clearing clients i think they re finding that our capabilities are a bit differentiated in the collateral space and then than what they saw and are the conversations are happening are getting better and better and sort of happening real time here and more people are interested in our collateral optimization service and a whole series of things that we ve been trying to do there on treasury services again this is another business where we brought in a new ceo just in the summer and what paul camp has been working on is helping reposition sort of the way people think about us historically we ve positioned ourselves as more of a receivables bank i e like we ll collect your payments a collections bank versus a payments bank and when you start focusing more on the payments piece that s what brings liquidity balances and a broader set of dialogue that we can have with these clients so we ve changed our we ve changed the leadership and focus of our sales team we ve changed the incentives we have underneath it you can t see it from the disclosures but underneath that the treasury services deposits are growing just over 10 just from the third quarter so when you look at third quarter to fourth quarter they re up about 10 and so you re seeing sort of the traction real time and if i just use sort of one example i m not going to give you a client name but when you look at there s an international development bank that we ve been working with for a number of years in a very small way with treasury services we have a strong relationship across the company with them and what and we ve been working to improve a couple of very minor changes to some products that we have that opens up a wallet of billions of dollars of deposit balances that we have or mandated on now and are sort of in the process of coming through so you re seeing good traction in really all of these businesses that i think builds up over time to show sort of that organic growth story i don t know charlie you want to talk about asset servicing charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes maybe i ll just i know this is a long answer but obviously this is extraordinarily important asset servicing hugely important part of the business we our belief is we have real differentiation here we have a data platform we are willing to work openly with front end providers and we re working toward more tight integration to the benefit of our clients and we re continuing to improve infrastructure and the quality of what we do which isn t a sexy thing to talk about but in what we do it really does matter and so this is more of a long term build because of the nature of what these relationships are how long the sales cycle is but there s progress in what we re doing this quarter we brought in a 100 billion of fund administration from just one client specifically 400 billion of new custody etfs and mutual funds from a provider so we have plenty of examples of places they re winning but this will be a slower build because of from where we re starting from from what we ve seen in pershing and some of these other businesses so why don t i stop there michael carrier bank of america analyst ok no thanks for all that and then mike just a quick one on capital just given the decline in the ratios with the buybacks and then what you mentioned on the balance sheet just how should we be thinking about managing that going forward just through the regulatory process and then just some of the opportunities that you re seeing mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes i mean obviously mike between now and the second quarter of 2019 our remaining buybacks are already sort of defined based on what got approved in ccar last year so that should be pretty easy to sort of think about for the first half of the year and as we look to ccar 2018 or 2019 sorry the a lot of the work that we put into getting the incremental 800 million 830 million approved sort of flows right into sort of the modeling that we ll do as part of that process that process kicks off sort of as we speak and so over the next couple of weeks i think we ll all have a better sense of sort of the inputs that go into that michael carrier bank of america analyst ok thanks a lot operator our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks very much maybe just to follow on on the organic growth thanks guys you covered a lot of that a couple of additional questions in terms of the market conditions obviously they re challenging right now but how would you expect volatility to help your overall revenue including on the organic growth side if we have a situation in 2019 where we have choppy markets maybe flat but much more volatile can you talk about the potential benefit for both the collateral management business that you referred to mike and fx and other trading and then also just quickly on the lag between expenses of the onboarding for pershing versus clocking that revenue in mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes i mean look the expenses as we i ll start with the last piece first so in pershing as we said most of the expenses that we re incurring to onboard that business are being spent as we speak and so the profile of the pershing expense base isn t unexpected to change substantially in 2019 and as charlie mentioned that revenue will start to kick in in the second half of 19 and more substantially in the first part of 2020 so you ll sort of see it come in that trajectory as you sort of think about volatility for us and sort of if i sort of tick through each of the businesses just to give you a sense of where we see it so in pershing we do see increased transaction volumes at times during periods of volatility having said that much of the accounts that sort of that are underpinned are our book of business our managed accounts so we re not in a we re not necessarily supporting sort of retail self directed retail brokerage type clients and so you won t necessarily see the peaks and valleys of transaction activity as sort of volatility spikes up and down but you will see that sort of positively impacted and as you look back over the last few months transaction volumes were up a little but they weren t outsized in sort of any way in that business and then in asset servicing is where you ll you may see some of it as well and so that we give you disclosures around our foreign exchange revenue so obviously if volatility picks up in foreign exchange you ll see that come through the revenue line and then the volumes that we see will be dependent upon underlying client activity and then in the core asset servicing business think of that revenue as probably about 1 3 of it is sort of transaction driven revenue and so that piece of it will move up and down based on what you see in the market but keep in mind that as i said in my remarks about 1 3 of our assets in our custody are equities so just because you see big spikes and valleys in sort of the equity markets and volatility there doesn t necessarily mean that s going to translate into huge upticks in sort of transaction related revenue charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer this is charlie i want to add one quick thing which is all that s very that s kind of what should drive some of the steps more mathematically but to state the obvious which is the reasons behind the volatility really matter to us there s good volatility and there s less good volatility what we ve seen this quarter is the bad kind of volatility which drives assets away from the businesses that we benefit from and so the why will really matter to us as we look out over the next year brian bedell deutsche bank analyst right great that makes sense maybe just a follow on on the expenses charlie if you can talk a little bit about a little bit more about the nature of some of the investments that are now in the run rate maybe just highlight of a couple two or three of the most major ones and then just from that your discussion of the expense rate not expense base not significantly going up is that an assumption on the markets remaining flat and say to set on hold or the markets improving and then maybe just which management layer areas were most restructured in terms of the businesses charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer so let me try and remember all three and i ll do them backwards on the third one it was across the entire company as i said before we really looked at spans layers and the series of things like that across the entire entity from the staff areas to investment services to our investment management businesses and so i think it s very consistent in addition ongoing efficiencies through our operations areas on top of that are things that we ve seen and then just tactically some spots in different places but overall i would say it was pretty consistent on the second question about expenses relative to the environment i would characterize it as we re thinking about what the right level for us to invest in and so i think with a cautious eye toward next year that s where we plan for to the extent that the environment gets even worse we always have levers we could pull if we thought things were going to really get bad and actually stay there for a period of time and maybe spend a little bit more if all of a sudden the world changed very dramatically but i don t want to overstate either of those two cases up or down i think where we re planning for is where we feel the right level of spend for us is within a reasonable range of outcomes for next year and i m sorry the first i what was the first one again brian bedell deutsche bank analyst the first one which is yeah i know thank you the first one was just the maybe a couple examples of the investments that you made most recently and in which areas i m sorry technology investments i m sorry charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer sure so first of all mike s referenced and i both referenced the work that s ongoing in pershing to onboard these clients a lot of the work to bring on these clients isn t just bringing i mean it takes a long time because you have to build a set of capabilities and you build a set of capabilities that you can then scale and provide to others so there s a significant amount of technology work that has to go into bringing on those pershing clients and that s embedded in the overall spend numbers that we talked about we ve talked about in the corporate trust business how we continue to build out our technology platform for things other than just pure traditional products that s embedded in the spend as we think about asset servicing we re highly focused on automation we re highly focused on figuring out how to continue to build our data infrastructure so i think those are just some examples brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thank you so much operator our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken ubs analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the question i m sorry charlie were you in the middle of saying something charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes no the only thing i just in my mind i m just thinking i think we one area that we haven t mentioned is our markets business and as we think about where we would make the investments we ve talked about this in the past we ve talked about the progress that we ve made you ve seen it in the numbers you see it we ve talked about some of the new products that we ve offered and a lot of what s happening there is really based upon technology spend brennan hawken ubs analyst ok bedell you owe me one i just gave you a little ot on your last question so there you go curious about deposit trends so i think mike you had commented that you guys see them as consistent quarter to date with what you saw in the fourth quarter but deposit trends were a little mixed under the surface and you excluded the wholesale or the cd prices from your deposit betas so i m curious when you comment on deposits are you talking about the total interest bearing deposit balance that on average was 161 7 or are you talking about the deposits excluding the cds and how should we think about that cd growth it s really picked up the growth in cds has picked up pretty substantially here the last few quarters how are you thinking about that into next year mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes my remarks were in total brennan thanks for the question and clarify that and the reason why i think you sort of need to look through the look through into sort of what s happening with your client deposits obviously wholesale funding is more index based pricing for the most part and so you really want to try to understand what s happening with your clients in those conversations so that s why we re trying to give you that color i think as you sort of think about the wholesale funding i don t see it moving in any substantial way from current levels brennan hawken ubs analyst ok all right great thanks for clarifying that and then so the second question on issuer services you guys provided some color in the commentary on the fact that there were some elevated activities depository receipts latam kind of curious about how sustainable you would see this activity level was this corporate action activity impacted by maybe the volatile markets that we saw in the quarter or it was also quite a quarter for m a closing activity did that come into play into that line as well thanks charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes so m a closing activity no volatility a little bit i guess i would say and i think relative to the question of sustainability i guess the way to think about it is and we ve talked about this which is within issuer services that s corporate trust and dr corporate trust we are seeing revenue growth it s not huge but it is growing and based on the actions that we ve taken hopefully that will continue that is deal by deal and we feel better about our calling efforts we feel better about the capabilities that we continue to build so hopefully that growth will continue within drs you know this and we ve said this is it s quarter by quarter can be very volatile be very very seasonable and if you look at our yearly performance from i think it s 17 to 18 while the quarters matter a lot overall when you look at the full year relatively i don t remember exactly but relatively flat when we look at 2017 to 2018 same thing is true albeit within the fourth quarter we had strong performance and part of that by the way is driven by in the fourth quarter of the prior year we actually had a very weak dr quarter so that s a long way of saying that as we look forward we would think that the full year performance is sustainable albeit it s going to be volatile quarter to quarter brennan hawken ubs analyst that s really fair thank you just i m sorry one follow up in your comment on corporate trust how much has clo the clo trustee business helped in some of that corporate trust growth recently and could you walk through a little bit about how sustainable you think that growth might be mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes look brennan underneath we don t disclose the components of corporate trust as you know but the clo business has been an area of strength for us this year where we have picked up market share and so it has been a contributor to that underlying growth and we ve been talking consistently now for the last year or so where we ve been making some investments in some of the underlying technology for to better support that business and we re seeing the benefits of that come through through some of the market share that we ve been picking up this year and so that has been a contributor brennan hawken ubs analyst great thanks for letting me sneak in one more charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer sure operator thank you we ll next go to the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst thanks hey good morning guys so the first question is just around the expense trends i think in the beginning of the year last year you guys talked about reinvesting the majority of the tax savings which i think was in kind of the 250 million to 300 million range charlie i think you mentioned 100 in tech spend this year so did the investment pace change or some of that is just kind of slipping into next year mike santomassimo chief financial officer alex maybe just to correct that so i think what charlie was referring to was the quarter so if you look at the spend on a full year basis for 18 then we spent probably just over 300 million alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it so that s all in the run rate mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer yes alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it understood and then just digging into the issuer services again for a second if we look at just the fee components not so excluding the nir i think the growth was quite substantial this year i think 10 plus can you help me understand again kind of sustainability of that growth because to your point i mean it s a fairly mature business it s something we haven t seen that type of growth from there in quite some time mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes the as charlie mentioned if you sort of unpick both corporate trust and dr alex i think the corporate trust fee line is a pretty consistent sort of story right where you ve seen that sort of tick up sort of gradually over the last number of quarters and given the trend we re seeing on a full year basis we would still expect that to sort of tick up a little bit in 2019 i think in the dr revenue i think is the place where you ve seen a little bit more volatility sort of year to year so in 17 to 18 it was up a little and given some of the things that charlie talked about in terms of some timing of corporate actions that happened the volatility that we saw that drives transactional volume in some of the different quarters and so as we said as we sort of look to 2019 we think that the 2018 numbers plus or minus sort of a little look like a good way to think about the full year story for next year alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it great thanks operator thank you we ll next go to mike mayo with wells fargo rob rutschow wells fargo analyst hi it s rob rutschow for mike just a follow up on the expenses you ve mentioned i think previously that there are 11 layers of management between charlie in the bottom of the organization what s the right level and how long does that take to get there and then how should we think about that from an expense perspective charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer we have eliminated depending on where you are in the company call it two to three as part of this exercise and the actions as we said a bunch of them have already happened in the month of january and so over the next couple of months is when we ll actually see the impact get into our run rate rob rutschow wells fargo analyst and then i understand that i guess severance is kind of a recurring nonrecurring but how what was that in the quarter and how should we think about that going forward charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer i answered the question earlier about how to think about it going forward mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes and in my remarks rob i mentioned that the severance charge is little over half of notable items expense notable items in the quarter rob rutschow wells fargo analyst ok thank you charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja j p morgan analyst hi thanks sorry it s a day with overlapping calls so if i ve missed some of this sorry severance is over half just going into those noncore just so that we can have our numbers correct as we look forward charlie i missed your comment on how to think about it going forward but i will go back and talk to ir 16 million in real estate relocation so is the rest all from higher litigation mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes the three components of the notable items vivek this is mike obviously are the severance the real estate charges and litigation correct vivek juneja j p morgan analyst ok so ok ok and when you are saying little over half you re talking 50 60 kind of a little over that in that range but not above that mike santomassimo chief financial officer that s a good way to think about it yes vivek juneja j p morgan analyst ok sorry we re just trying to mike santomassimo chief financial officer yes we know it s a busy morning no worries no worries vivek vivek juneja j p morgan analyst it s an unfortunate morning ok i ll just i ll let you go and thanks for the clarification we ll catch up with ir later charlie scharf chairman and chief executive officer thanks vivek mike santomassimo chief financial officer all right we re happy to talk later vivek if you want all right thanks everyone for i think that s the last one so thanks everyone for joining we appreciate it charlie scharf

record cash injection concerns about the chinese economy appeared to weigh on investor sentiment overnight on wednesday china s central bank injected a record 116 billion 560 billion yuan into the nation s banking system the highest ever amount recorded in a single day the people s bank of china pboc said the cash injection was aimed at ensuring there are ample funds in the financial system particularly as tax payments peak in mid january and demand for cash picks up ahead of the lunar new year holidays starting in early february the banking system s overall liquidity is falling rapidly

policy measures are needed to turn the world s second largest economy around the news is clear the economy needs help trinh nguyen senior economist at natixis said sizable injections are common this

secretary pompeo s reassurance tour through the middle east was largely a flop his address in cairo was striking in the low bar it set for earning america s friendship american foreign policy toward the middle east has two interests countering iran and terrorism specifically the islamic kind as far as a shared interest in regional growth economic liberalization and empowerment of a young population the us is not really that concerned while pompeo mentioned that egypt s recovery would require the state to relinquish some of its hold on the economy he devoted more time to praising president sisi for building a church the administration continues to press forward in its nebulous plan for a middle east security alliance or mesa touting a last minute conference in oman as evidence of its ability to pull together regional leaders in an american facilitated plan for regional cooperation on energy and economic growth confusion over mesa and if the meeting in oman constituted a first session or simply early efforts to organize the alliance are notable in the read outs from different attending governments bahrain called it a formal session of mesa the us called it ground work energy cooperation is even less of a group effort for president trump it entails tweeting desired increases in oil production to the saudis economic cooperation means getting someone else to foot the bill for post conflict reconstruction in syria iraq and yemen the lens through which most americans view the middle east is not complex oil and war there is a lost opportunity to advocate for identifying the root causes of instability where authoritarian governments strangle open economies where rule of law depends on personal status and resource dependency distorts fiscal governance and enables repression the truth is that the us is absent as a beacon or facilitator of a liberal economic vision for the region so without a champion of markets governed by rule of law or an advocate for increasing economic mobility for a young population markets will sort out the most favorable environments for capital in the region how will markets respond in the middle east as they are more cognizant of a diminished american role in regional peace and prosperity there is less optimism for bottom up economic growth particularly as state ownership and intervention continues to dominate even in the economies that are most successful at attracting foreign investment and the kinds of capital inflows to the region are less active less about start ups or new technology and more likely to be passive investments think more trading of government debt and passive inflows into regional stock markets which are often populated by partially state owned companies this translates to inflows in economies like kuwait qatar and egypt which are dependent on rents either from natural resources remittances or tourism these states are seeing a greater influx of foreign capital than their regional peers kuwait and qatar topped net foreign inflows to mena with saudi arabia the uae and egypt following in 2018 following research by efg hermes most of the new inflows are passive tied to the new status of emerging market in both global bond and equity indexes second information flows are increasing the economic reform movement that began across the gulf in 2015 included a realization that foreign investment would be essential to diversification aims but more importantly to sharing the burden of job creation for a young population with high expectations of economic mobility in saudi arabia a first step in attracting that investment included opening up to financial media in high profile interviews but also in welcoming media partnerships and near constant coverage of expected ipos and new investment opportunities the government began sharing more information about its fiscal budget plans while the process of bond offerings with road shows and investor prospectus increased transparency of previously unreported government data with that access also came exposure of the corruption purge the crackdown on civil society and peaceful activists and the murder of jamal khashoggi markets responded to this information capital flight ensued and foreign capital flows have gone elsewhere in the region saudi arabia still accesses debt markets with ease issuing a 7 5 billion bond in january attracting 27 5 billion in bids about half of the bids to the offering in april 2018 yet investing in sovereign debt is very different than foreign direct investment which saudi arabia continues to struggle to attract capital is flocking to the easy wins and this will further link the prosperity of the region to oil market volatility and do little to encourage more substantive liberalization supported by strong legal frameworks markets will reward and punish but they will also avoid risk we will see a deepening divide between gulf markets that classify as emerging markets and those in the region that remain frontier lebanon jordan morocco oman etc with higher premiums to borrow and more extreme fiscal pressure without resource wealth this also puts frontier governments in the region in the position of petitioning for gulf financial support further disincentivizing economic liberalization this is the job of effective foreign policy and development finance to mitigate risk encourage institutional reforms and give political support to difficult economic decisions right now the united states is out of the business and in the long term american investors citizens and soldiers might have to pay a price

the empire s european castle of vassals is crumbling right in front of our eyes but nobody seems to see it the european union eu the conglomerate of vassals trump calls them irrelevant and he doesn t care what they think about him they deserve to be collapsing they the vassalic eu a group of 28 countries some 500 million people with a combined economy of a projected 19 trillion us dollar equivalent about the same as the us have submitted themselves to the dictate of washington in just about every important aspect of life the eu has accepted on orders by washington to sanction russia venezuela iran and a myriad of countries that have never done any harm to any of the 28 eu member states the eu has accepted the humiliation of military impositions by nato threating russia and china with ever more and ever more advancing military basis towards moscow and beijing to the point that brussels foreign policy is basically led by nato it was clear from the very get go that the us sanctions regime imposed on russia and all the countries refusing to submit to the whims and rules of washington directly and via the eu was hurting the eu economically far more than russia this is specifically true for some of the southern european countries whose economy depended more on trading with russia and eurasia than it did for other eu countries the sanctions disaster really hit the fan when trump unilaterally decided to abrogate the nuclear deal with iran and reimpose heavy sanctions on iran and on everybody who would do business with iran european hydrocarbon giants started losing business that s when brussels led by germany started mumbling that they would not follow the us and even that they would back european corporations mainly hydrocarbon giants sticking to their contractual arrangements they had with iran too late european business had lost all confidence in brussels eu administration s feeble and generally untrustworthy words many breached their longstanding and after the nuclear deal renewed contracts with iran out of fear of punishment by washington and lack of trust in brussel s protection case in point is the french british petrol giant total which shifted its supply source from iran to russia no not to the us as was of course washington s intent the damage is done the vassals are committing slow suicide the people have had it more than half of the european population wants to get out of the fangs from brussels but nobody asks them nor listens to them and that in the so called heartland of democracy sic that s why people are now up in arms and protesting everywhere in one way or another in germany france the uk belgium the netherlands italy hungary poland the list is almost endless and it can be called generically the yellow vests after the new french revolution the latest in a series of the us attacking germany and german business and german integrity for that matter are the us ambassador s richard grenell recent threats to german corporations with sanctions if they work on nord stream 2 the 1 200 km pipeline bringing russian gas to europe to be completed by the end of 2019 it will virtually double the capacity of russian gas supply to europe instead washington wants europe to buy us shale gas and oil and especially keeping europe economically and financially in the us orbit avoiding in any way a detachment from washington and preventing the obvious and logical an alliance with russia this attempt will fail bitterly as various german ministers including foreign minister heiko maas have loudly and with determination protested against such us hegemonic advances well friends you have bent over backwards to please your washington masters for too long it s high time to step out of this lock step of obedience in france this past weekend of 12 13 january the yellow vests went into round 9 of protests against dictator macron his austerity program and not least his abject arrogance vis √† vis the working class a recent public statement of macron s is testimony of this below the belt arrogance trop de fran√ßais n ont pas le sens de l effort ce qui explique en partie les troubles que connait le pays translated too many french don t know the meaning of effort which explains at least partially the trouble this country is in the yellow vests and a majority of the french population want nothing less than macron s resignation protesters are consistently and largely under reported by christophe castaner the french interior minister this past weekend the official figure was 50 000 demonstrators countrywide when in reality the figure was at least three times higher the official french version would like the public at large inside and outside of france to believe that the yellow vest s movement is diminishing it is not to the contrary they are demonstrating all over france and that despite the macron regime s increasing violent repression rt reports on macron s orders the police are becoming more violent using military suppression to control protesting french civilians thousands have been arrested and hundreds injured by police brutality nevertheless the movement is gaining massive public support and the yellow vests idea is spreading throughout europe this spread is of course hardly reported by the mainstream media in fact 80 of the french back the yellow vests and their idea of a citizen initiated referendum ric for r√©f√©rendum d initiative citoyenne under which citizens could propose their own laws that would then be voted on by the general public the ric could effectively bypass the french parliament and would be enshrined in the french constitution a similar law exists since 1848 in switzerland and is regularly applied by swiss citizens it is a way of direct democracy that any country calling itself a democracy should incorporate in its constitution the uk is in shambles thousands are taking to the streets of london organized by the people s assembly against austerity calling for general elections to replace the failing tory government they are joined by the french gilets jaunes yellow vests out of solidarity many of the uk protesters are also wearing high visibility yellow vests this is in direct correlation with the ever growing louder debacle over brexit yes or no and how at this point nobody knows what britain s future is going to be propaganda and counter propaganda is destined to further confuse the people and confused people usually want to stick to the status quo there is even a movement of pro remain propaganda organized by some members of the european parliament imagine talking about sovereignty if brussels cannot even leave the brits alone decide whether they want to continue under their dictate or not h√©las the brits are largely divided but also past the stage of being swayed by foreign propaganda especially in this delicate question of leaving the eu which a majority of brits clearly decided in june 2016 prime minister theresa may has screwed up the brexit process royally to the point where many brits feel that what she negotiated is worse than no deal this has likely happened in close connivance with the unelected eu leadership which does not want the uk to leave and under strict orders from washington which needs the uk in its crucial role as a us mole in the european union on 15 january 2019 the uk parliament will vote on whether they accept the negotiated brexit conditions or whether they prefer a no deal brexit or will request an extension for further negotiations under article 50 of the treaty of lisbon which was imposed by the heads of state of the 28 members without any public vote and is a false stand in for a eu constitution other options include a general election and let the new leadership decide or a second referendum which after two years is legally possible the latter would likely cause severe public unrest followed by atrocious police oppression as already often witnessed in the uk in which case let s just hope civil war can be avoided for weeks the yellow vest movement has spread to belgium and the netherlands for similar reasons public discontent over austerity eu dictatorship over belgian and dutch sovereignty last friday one of the belgian yellow vests was overrun by a truck and killed authorities reported it as an accident greece the ms media report all is donkey dory greece is recovering has for the first time in many years a positive growth rate and is able to refinance herself on the open capital market greece is no longer dependent on the irate and infamous troika european central bank ecb european commission and imf reality is completely different as about two thirds of the greek population are still hovering around or below the survival level no access to public health care affordable medication public schools umpteen times reduced pensions most public assets and services privatized for a pittance nothing has fundamentally changed in the last years at least not for the better and for the majority of the people the troika has allowed the greek to go to the private capital markets to boost falsely their the greek s image among the international public at large basically telling the brainwashed populace it worked we the troika did a good job nothing worked people are unhappy more than unhappy they are indignant they demonstrated against angela merkel s recent visit to athens and their protests were violently oppressed by police forces what do you expect this is what has become of europe a highly repressive state of spineless vassals on wednesday 16 january the greek parliament may hold a vote of confidence against or for prime minister alexis tsipras the official and make believe reason is supposedly the controversy over the name of macedonia which in fact has long been settled the real reason is the public s discontent about the continuous and increasing blood letting by never ending austerity sucking the last pennies from the poor according to lancet the renowned british health journal the greek suicide rate is soaring nobody talks about it will tsipras survive a possible vote of confidence if not early elections who will follow tsipras don t be fooled by the term democracy the elite from within and without greece will not allow any policy changes that s when people √† la gilets jaunes yellow vests may come in civil unrest enough is enough in italy the coalition of the 5 star movement and the small right wing brother lega norte is pulled to the far right by lega s matteo salvini deputy prime minister and interior minister mr salvini is clearly calling the shots and his alliance is firing strongly against brussels and with good reason as brussels is attempting to impose rules on italy s budget while the same rules do not apply equally to all eu member states for example macron france s rothschild implant has special privileges as far as budget overrun margins are concerned mr salvini s anti brussels anti eu stance is no secret and he has a lot of italians behind him an italian yellow vest movement cannot be excluded the empire s vassal castle is crumbling and not even silently then there are the former soviet satellites hungary and poland turned right wing don t appreciate brussels meddling with hungary s anti immigration policy and in poland over a controversial overhaul of the judiciary system never mind whether you agree or not with individual country actions both cases are clear interferences in these nations sovereignty though upon the european court of justice s strong warning poland indeed blinked and reinstated the judges fired in the judiciary reform process poland s love for nato and brussels use of the nato leverage may have played a role in poland s reversal of decision nevertheless discontent in poland as in hungary among the public at large remains strong migration and the judiciary are just the visible pretexts the legendary tip of the iceberg reality is on a deeper level much deeper these countries are both reminded of what they considered the soviet union s handcuffs freedom is not being dictated by brussels the triad of systematic and willful destabilization and destruction of what we know as the greater middle east and western world is what we have to be aware of the east mostly russia and china is a challenge being tackled simultaneously impressively for the brainwashed westerner but rather meekly for those who are informed about russia s and china s military might and intelligence capacity this drive of destabilization cum destruction comes in three phases it started with the middle east which for the most part has become a hopeless hell hole a source of indiscriminate killing by the western allies say the emperor s puppets and mercenaries resulting in millions killed and in an endless flood of refugees destabilizing europe which is the second phase of the triad it s in full swing it happens right in front of our eyes but we don t see it it s the yellow vests austerity increasing inequality unemployment social sector s being milked to zilch by the financial system popular uprisings oppression by police and military forces it s reflected by the dismal powerlessness of the people that leads to enough is enough in the streets that s the way it s all wanted the more chaos the better people in chaos are easily controlled now comes phase three of the triad latin america it has already started three or four years back countries that have struggled for decades to eventually break loose with some form of democracy from the fangs of empire are gradually being subdued with fake elections and internal parliamentary coups back into the emperor s backyard the southern cone argentina chile brazil uruguay paraguay is gone except for bolivia peru colombia ecuador all the way to guyana are governed by neoliberal even neonazi shaded lords of washington but there is still venezuela cuba nicaragua and now also mexico that have not caved in and will not cave in in an extraordinary analysis thierry meyssan describes in the terrible forthcoming destruction of the caribbean basin how the pentagon is still pursuing the implementation of the rumsfeld cebrowski plan this time aiming at the destruction of the caribbean basin states there is no consideration for friends or political enemies thierry meyssan observes he goes on predicting that after the period of economic destabilization and that of military preparation the actual operation should begin in the years to come by an attack on venezuela by brazil supported by israel colombia an ally of the united states and guyana in other words the united kingdom it will be followed by others beginning with cuba and nicaragua the troika of tyranny as per john bolton only the future will say to what extent this plan will be implemented at the outset its ambitions exceed the crumbling empire s actual capacity when it comes all down to one single denominator it s the current western financial system that must go it is private banking gone berserk we are living in a financial system that has gone wild and running havoc uncontrolled a train of endless greed that is loosely speeding ahead and doesn t know when it will hit an unyielding steel enforced brick wall but hit it will it is a mere question of time people are sick and tired of being milked no end by a fraudulent pyramid system constructed by the us and her dollar hegemony and maintained by globalized private banking we are living in a private banking system that has nothing to do with economic development but everything with a greed driven domination of us consumers sold on debt and on money that we don t control despite the fact that we earned it with our hard labor despite the fact that it is our added value to what we call the economy no this system is totally disrespectful of the individual it is even ready to steal our money if it needs to survive our banking system it takes the liberty of administering it and basically appropriating it once our money is in a private bank we have lost control over it and mind you and get it into your brains private banks do not work for you and me but for their shareholders but through hundreds of years of indoctrination we have become so used to it that being charged interest for borrowing our own money through an intermediary who does nothing absolutely nothing but wait for profit to fall into its lap has become the normality it isn t this system has to be abolished the faster the better private banking needs to be eradicated and replaced by local public banking that works with local currencies based on local economic output way removed from globalized concepts that help steel resources empty local social safety nets all under the guise of austerity for progress we should know better by now there is no austerity for progress has never been this fraudulent imf world bank concept has never worked anywhere we have to de dollarize our money de digitize our money and pool it through a public banking system for the purpose of people s growth hence a society s or nation s growth there is currently one good example the bank of north dakota the bnd has helped the us state of north dakota through the 2008 and following years crisis with economic growth instead of economic decline with almost full employment versus skyrocketing unemployment in the rest of the us and the western world we need to build our common wealth with sovereign money backed by our sovereign economies as the empire and its vassals are crumbling badly they are shaking in their foundations it is time to rethink what we have been taking for granted and for normal a fraudulent and deceptive monetary system backed by nothing no economy not even gold we are living on sheer fiat money made by private banking by a mouse click and by letting us be enslaved by debt enough is enough the yellow vests have understood they want to get rid of their macron who keeps propagating the fraud it is time to rethink and restart as the crumbling is getting louder and louder empire s european vassal state is falling apart and will pull

introduction and summary the way workers are paid is changing as electronic forms of payment are increasingly replacing cash and checks for a large swath of moderately to highly paid workers who have access to bank accounts the technological transformation from paper checks to direct deposit has mostly brought benefits but for low paid workers who tend to have less access to the mainstream financial system the transition to electronic payments is more complicated this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply payroll cards an electronic form of workplace compensation that is a type of prepaid debit card can provide unbanked individuals with increased access to the financial system as well as the benefits of safety convenience faster payments and ease of use that come with it however the emergence of payroll cards and similar products that may be developed in the future carries risks as well fees associated with these products may extract wealth from the very workers who can afford it least unfortunately consumer protections relating to how workers are paid have not fully caught up to changing payment practices while elements of federal workplace and cofnsumer protection laws apply to payroll cards there are glaring gaps that leave workers exposed to junk fees such as those incurred by some workers for merely checking their account balances at atms only a handful of states most notably connecticut 1 hawaii 2 illinois 3 new york 4 and pennsylvania5 go significantly above federal requirements by banning certain kinds of junk fees ensuring workers can access their funds several times each pay period without charge and providing other protections still most states as well as the federal government have a long way to go to meaningfully protect consumers from existing electronic payroll practices moreover unless they change quickly states are likely to fall even further behind as payment practices continue to evolve this report explains how workers are currently paid highlights data showing an increasing use of payroll cards describes the types of workers most likely to use payroll cards and outlines the benefits and risks of this payment option in addition it reviews how the federal fair labor standards act and electronic fund transfer act provide workers with only limited protections and highlights the growing body of state regulations that have emerged to prevent the worst abuses finally the report offers policy recommendations for federal state and local policymakers to make sure that workers are adequately protected and are not separated from their wages notably the policies recommended in this report include collecting better data about how workers get paid the level of payment choice they receive at work and the fees they may incur improving protections for consumers by banning junk fees prohibiting overdraft and other credit features requiring deposit insurance and ensuring better access to worker funds requiring federal state and local governments to use best practices for payroll cards when paying their own workers and contractors improving enforcement of payroll card laws to ensure workers receive the protections they are afforded by law several of the report s recommended policy changes can be accomplished through executive action at the state and federal level though some reforms will require legislation while the policy recommendations in this report focus on payroll cards specifically the principles underlying those recommendations are universal for any form of electronic payment the advent of payroll cards is the most recent innovation in how workers are paid but it will not be the final one as new technology and payment methods continue to evolve policymakers must remain vigilant to any developments that threaten to separate workers from their wages workers should have a choice in how they are paid and their hard earned wages should not be eroded by a dizzying array of fees no matter the form of payment scope opportunity and risks of payroll cards how workers are paid the method by which workers are paid has undergone a substantial evolution employees are increasingly paid through electronic means namely direct deposit to a bank account or through a payroll card program instead of by cash or check according to the national automated clearing house association nacha in 1986 8 percent of workers were paid through direct deposit 6 in 2000 that number jumped to more than 50 percent and by 2015 it stood at 82 percent 7 this trend has mirrored the broader movement toward electronic payments across the u s economy as recently as 2000 check payments for goods and services outnumbered electronic transactions in terms of noncash payments 8 by 2015 however card payments and other electronic payments drastically outnumbered check transactions by a factor of six 9 this trend toward electronic payments will only continue to increase while a sizable majority of employees have their wages deposited into their checking or savings accounts a growing number of workers are receiving wages on payroll cards payroll cards are a type of prepaid debit card that in many ways function like a bank account every pay period the employer deposits the employee s wages either full or in some cases a specified portion directly onto the card the employee can then use the card for point of sale transactions in stores cash withdrawals and balance inquiries at atms or banks and online bill pay just as a consumer would use any other general purpose prepaid card or bank account the employee s funds are held in an account at an issuing financial institution in which they usually but not always receive the benefit of deposit insurance from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or the national credit union administration ncua payroll card programs vary from employer to employer with differing fee structures and additional services attached to the card estimates suggest that the prevalence of payroll cards has grown substantially in the past decade and is likely to continue growing at a rapid rate as employers move away from cash and checks in 2010 according to an industry estimate from payments consulting firm aite group there were 3 1 million active payroll cards across the country with 20 9 billion loaded onto those active cards 10 in 2017 both numbers doubled there were an estimated 5 9 million active cards with 42 billion in load value 11 by 2022 those figures are expected to jump to 8 4 million and 60 billion respectively 12 these figures far surpass the estimated 2 2 million workers who will be paid using paper checks in 2019 13 a 2014 deloitte survey on payroll payment methods also found a meaningful increase in payroll card usage 14 from 2011 through 2014 payroll card usage jumped from 1 percent of u s workers to 5 percent representing an increase from about 1 3 million workers to 7 million workers 15 it is also important to consider the breakdown of types of workers being paid with these cards a 2018 study from the center for financial services innovation cfsi found that relative to the population of working americans payroll card users tend to be younger occupy lower income brackets and have higher representation from certain communities of color 16 the demographic income and age trends of payroll card users generally line up with the latest data collected by the fdic on the broader universe of prepaid card users 17 publicly available information also points to the retail manufacturing and fast food industries as key sectors that use payroll cards 18 given the profile of workers paid using these products it is not surprising that the cards are prevalent in these industries still it is important to note that there is a lack of robust public data on payroll card usage and user demographics while the industry and nonprofit studies and surveys cited above are reasonably designed and executed the results are not always consistent furthermore there are no holistic government produced reports specifically focused on this market 19 the need to close the data gap on these products is discussed in the policy recommendations section of this report payroll card advantages the growth of payroll card adoption presents clear advantages and risks for both workers with and without bank accounts the benefits of this payment method differ depending on the level to which the user is already integrated into the traditional financial system payroll cards can serve as an important way for workers who are unbanked those who do not hold basic financial products such as savings and checking accounts to experience the benefits that come with access to the mainstream financial system for employers electronic forms of payment such as payroll cards are significantly cheaper to administer than payment by check and for governments it is easier to investigate wage theft allegations when private employers use payroll cards than when workers are paid through cash payments for unbanked workers a payroll card may be a much better payment option than cash or checks payment in cash can be inconvenient and is more likely to be lost or stolen compared with an electronic fund transfer onto a payroll card payroll cards have procedures to resolve errors and limit customer liability in cases of fraudulent charges and lost or stolen cards moreover with a payroll card workers do not need to physically pick up their wages from an employer or wait for the mail to arrive if paid by check natural disasters personal or family illnesses lost checks or other obligations may disrupt and delay an employee s ability to receive wages in person or by mail with payroll cards funds are directly deposited onto the card on payday and the employee typically has access to those funds immediately payroll card users are able to withdraw cash either from atms or financial institutions and can use their cards for point of sale transactions or for online bill pay this functionality provides unbanked employees with many of the same benefits that individuals with bank accounts and debit cards enjoy in addition to the benefits of safety and convenience payroll cards can be a significantly cheaper alternative to payment via check for unbanked employees although there can be risks which are discussed below check cashing fees for the unbanked can be excessive draining worker wages these fees can be as high as 1 to 5 percent of an unbanked worker s paycheck depending on the state and the pricing offered by local check cashing institutions 20 even assuming moderate fees an unbanked worker making 20 000 annually could pay 400 or more a year in check cashing fees 21 it is nearly impossible for employees to avoid these fees when they are paid by check and do not have access to an affordable bank account this type of fee makes the already precarious financial position of low income workers that much worse individuals cannot afford to and should not have to have their wages eroded when they try to simply access those hard earned dollars the 400 a year in check cashing fees comes into focus when considering that currently 40 percent of americans do not have enough savings to cover a 400 emergency expense 22 check cashing fees extract wealth from workers who can afford it the least and simply make it more difficult for them to build personal financial stability unbanked americans while outlining the benefits that payroll cards present it is particularly helpful to identify the subset of americans who fall into the category of unbanked according to the fdic s 2017 national survey of unbanked and underbanked households an estimated 6 5 percent of households roughly 14 1 million adults were unbanked in 2017 meaning they did not have a checking or savings account 23 the rate of unbanked u s households is nearly four times higher for those with annual family incomes below 15 000 and almost double for those with incomes between 15 000 and 30 000 24 relative to white households black and hispanic households were approximately five times as likely to be unbanked 25 unbanked individuals also tend to be younger 26 on a positive note the economic recovery has helped decrease the number of unbanked households to its lowest point since 2009 27 as the economy has recovered and employment levels have improved more workers have had funds to put into a bank account moreover a direct deposit from an employer is typically one of the transactions that triggers a free checking or savings account according the 2017 survey the dominant reason cited for households being unbanked at 52 7 percent was that they do not have enough money to keep in account followed by don t trust banks 30 2 percent avoiding bank gives more privacy 28 2 percent and account fees too high 24 7 percent 28 the benefits of payroll cards can extend beyond just the unbanked two different surveys suggest that the sizable majority of payroll card users do in fact have checking accounts 29 direct deposit to a bank account is probably an option for many of these workers so it is likely that they see benefits in using a payroll card as a complementary financial product for example workers and their families in this category can use the payroll card as a budgeting tool instead of spending money directly out of a checking account they can preserve funds in their bank account while spending only their wages or some portion of their wages in between pay periods workers using this strategy however are potentially exposed to the myriad fees charged by payroll cards when they could avoid many of the possible fees by receiving their full wages through direct deposit to their checking account there is one area where a payroll card might be cheaper than a checking account many payroll card programs do not offer overdraft services overdraft services let a user register a negative balance with the financial institution covering the payment instead of declining a transaction these fees which will be discussed in the next section can be costly and overdraft is frequently offered through traditional bank accounts using a payroll card that does not offer this service can shield workers from high overdraft fees if their alternative is a debit card linked to a checking account with overdraft activated that said some payroll card programs do offer overdraft services with high fees and since 2010 overdraft has not been automatic workers have the choice to opt into accepting overdraft services and fees in their checking account overdraft services overdraft originally extended as a customer courtesy has become an expensive consequence of limited or irregular cash flow and expenses banks and credit unions advertise overdraft protection as a benefit charging a fee to cover transactions that would otherwise be declined because the customer s account lacks sufficient funds this fee typically around 34 per transaction adds up quickly especially as debit card transactions are approved over and over when there is no money in the account 30 in 2016 consumers paid a total of roughly 15 billion in overdraft fees 31 the vast majority of these fees are concentrated in a small number of customers in volatile financial situations in a study of bank accounts at several large banks in the early 2010s nearly three quarters of all overdraft fees were paid by just 8 percent of accounts those incurring more than 10 overdrafts while 70 percent of accounts incurred no overdrafts at all 32 most customers who use overdraft pay more than a single fee among these large bank customers those who incurred at least one overdraft or non sufficient funds fee paid an average of 225 in such fees over the course of a year 33 the resulting fees and penalties can drive individuals out of the banking system entirely if their accounts are closed due to excessive fees most prepaid cards have remained true to their name and have not contained overdraft options but some cards do offer them simply having a bank account does not necessarily mean that a consumer is fully served by the traditional financial system and therefore products such as payroll cards can prove useful additionally higher quality payroll cards may have better mobile functionality or budgeting tools than an employee s bank account that said the public should be skeptical of the implications of evidence suggesting that a large percentage of payroll card users do have bank accounts though it is likely that the functionality budgeting and overdraft explanations are indeed reasons for some people with bank accounts to opt for a payroll card over direct deposit it is also possible that more nefarious reasons are at least partially to blame employers might be pushing employees into these products or making it more difficult to opt for direct deposit to an account of their choosing despite the legal requirements that there be some level of employee choice regarding the method by which they are paid 34 employees may not feel like they can exercise their right to select alternative payment options payroll card risks while payroll cards can provide benefits for the unbanked and even those with bank accounts these products carry meaningful risks associated with their fee structures that can separate workers from their full wages nationwide data on the amount of payroll card fees accrued by workers annually is not publicly available a clear consumer protection data gap that can and should be addressed setting aside the lack of national data several studies and employee lawsuits paint a picture of the potentially severe pitfalls of at least some of the existing payroll cards in use payroll cards can charge a variety of different fees workers could be charged for applying for or participating in the payroll card program for checking their account balance at atms for using customer service features for maintaining their account for having a low balance or account inactivity for making point of sale transactions in stores or online for being issued initial or replacement cards for overdrafting their account and for simply closing their account and requesting refund of remaining account funds the breadth and cost of fees charged by payroll cards varies by payroll card program but generally free checking accounts at a bank or credit union impose fewer so called junk fees workers may also face payroll card fees for additional cash withdrawals beyond the one free withdrawal required by law some payroll card programs offer overdraft services or other credit features that enable workers to borrow funds through the card these services may come with excessive fees and could saddle workers with debt in some payroll card contracts between employers and financial institutions employers receive financial incentives or kickbacks in exchange for offering a specific payroll card program that might be riddled with fees 35 for example in 2013 natalie gunshannon who worked at a pennsylvania mcdonald s franchise sued her employer for forcing employees to receive their wages on a payroll card with very high fees gunshannon already had an existing credit union account 36 the payroll card had sizable fees for making atm withdrawals for paying bills online for withdrawing cash at a bank for replacing lost or stolen cards and even for simply checking the card balance at an atm 37 gunshannon argued that these fees quickly added up and took a significant bite out of her and her fellow colleagues wages after favorable judicial rulings for the plaintiffs the mcdonald s franchise settled the suit for almost 1 million and now offers alternative payment options 38 an investigation into fast food chain hardees provides another illustrative case in 2014 a u s department of labor investigation found that the hardees payroll card program cost workers an average of 2 10 a week or about 110 a year 39 the fees pushed some workers pay below minimum wage a violation of federal law in 2016 the restaurant opportunities center united a nonprofit organization that advocates for better treatment of low wage restaurant workers conducted a study on the payroll card experience of darden restaurants employees 40 darden owns several well known restaurant chains across the country including olive garden and longhorn steakhouse roughly 48 percent of the company s 140 000 hourly employees are paid through payroll cards 41 the 2016 study found that 76 percent of darden employees using payroll cards reported paying atm fees and that 24 percent reported paying point of sale fees moreover 63 percent of employees reported that they were not told about all of the fees associated with the payroll card and 26 percent reported that they did not have a choice between the payroll card and alternative wage payment methods darden employees reported paying fees for atm use the replacement of lost or stolen cards and periods of account inactivity 42 darden denied most of the report s findings 43 beyond these individual lawsuits and investigations some broader studies have been conducted on payroll card fees and practices in 2012 the federal reserve bank of philadelphia released a study conducted using hundreds of millions of transactions on 3 million prepaid cards including payroll cards issued by meta payment systems 44 based on the transaction analysis the philadelphia fed found that the 20 percent of payroll card users that incurred the highest fees paid an average of 16 per month 45 while this may sound like a modest amount to spend at the federal minimum wage of 7 25 per hour it would result in more than 24 hours of gross earnings per year going directly to financial fees meanwhile a higher income worker with a bank account and direct deposit may incur no fees at all in 2014 the new york state attorney general s office initiated a data collection on payroll card programs and published a report on the findings 46 some of the employers who submitted data to the attorney general provided detailed information on the fees incurred by their workers the information from this set of employers revealed that 70 to 75 percent of the payroll card users incurred a fee of some kind the report also found that in some of the payroll card programs the fees averaged as high as 20 a month per worker fees were particularly high for programs that charged overdraft fees amounting to 46 to 63 percent of the fee revenue on some payroll card programs in addition the report found that workers were not receiving appropriately detailed and clearly written disclosures on the payroll card programs terms and conditions similarly in 2014 the new economy project the new york public interest research group and retail action project surveyed hundreds of workers in new york state of those surveyed the 17 percent who were paid on payroll cards noted atm fees monthly maintenance fees point of sale fees declined transaction fees and inactivity fees as the key fees they had incurred on their payroll cards 47 prior to initiating the prepaid card rulemaking process in 2014 the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb analyzed an array of prepaid card agreements including those for payroll card programs 48 the analysis showed that at least 75 percent of payroll card programs charged a fee for accessing account information through a paper statement and that these fees ranged from 1 to as much of 5 per occurrence moreover at least 12 percent of the payroll card agreements in the cfpb study had negative balance fees and at least 12 percent of the card programs did not pass deposit insurance through to account funds in order to protect them in case of a bank failure in 2018 nonprofit financial research institute cfsi released a survey of almost 700 payroll card users 49 of those surveyed 44 percent had incurred fees using their payroll cards within that subset that had incurred fees 74 percent of the payroll card users reported paying fees at least once a week furthermore 21 percent of those surveyed felt that they did not have a choice when it came to how they were paid other studies that have focused on general use prepaid cards have shed light on the types of fees that are also present on payroll cards two studies by the federal reserve bank of kansas city that were based on netspend data confirm that consumers who opt in to overdraft protection pay more each month for their prepaid cards 50 clear robust and nationwide data on payroll card fees incurred by workers every year is not publicly available as discussed in the recommendations section that must change the stories of workers who have sued their employers over these practices in several cases successfully as well as the various state nonprofit and regulatory surveys conducted demonstrate the risks posed by high fees some of the dollar amounts for the fees may not seem like a lot but for low wage workers they quickly add up these fees can amount to several hours of work a week for workers that could be the difference between making ends meet and falling even further behind moreover there is evidence that workers are being pushed into these cards even though federal law requires employees to be given a choice of payment methods 51 all told the studies investigations and lawsuits suggest that a small but significant and growing percentage of workers are paid on payroll cards furthermore a portion of these workers pay particularly high fees that can dramatically reduce their take home pay existing payroll card regulation payroll cards are regulated at the federal and state level and are governed by both labor and consumer protection laws before outlining what policymakers can do to improve the regulatory framework it is first necessary to examine the current safeguards in place for workers using payroll cards the provisions in place at the federal level provide some choice when it comes to how workers can be paid and they primarily use disclosure to protect payroll card users some states have gone beyond the federal baseline instituting bans on various payroll card fees and affording payroll card users additional protections federal policies federal worker protection laws do not directly address payroll cards but the fair labor standards act flsa contains several relevant provisions the flsa generally allows for electronic payment of wages including payroll cards as the law is relatively flexible on the manner in which workers are paid so long as it is cash or negotiable instrument payable at par rather than company coupons or similar instruments 52 the flsa also requires that workers be paid at least the minimum wage and that wages are received free and clear meaning they are not subject to impermissible deductions that primarily benefit the employer such as deductions to cover the costs of a required uniform 53 there is no formal guidance or interpretation from the department of labor about how the provisions apply to payroll cards nor has the judiciary clarified these standards as most cases have settled out of court yet according to current and former department of labor staff these provisions of the flsa have been interpreted to mean that payroll cards must allow workers at least one free complete withdrawal per pay period and that unavoidable fees cannot bring wages below the federal minimum 54 violations of the minimum wage provisions are subject to monetary penalties while violations of the free and clear standards are not under the flsa workers have a private right of action to go to court and states may set higher standards the primary federal consumer regulations affecting payroll cards flow from the electronic fund transfer act efta 55 this 1978 legislation provided consumers who receive an electronic transfer of funds with certain rights including specific mandated disclosures error resolution procedures and a limited liability framework the efta gave the federal reserve board the authority to implement and enforce the bill s provisions its implementing regulation is referred to as regulation e the protections of the 1978 legislation covered transfers to and from bank accounts among other accounts payroll card accounts which did not exist at the time were not explicitly included in the initial set of efta covered accounts in 2006 due to the increased use of these payment vehicles the fed finalized an amendment to regulation e that extended the protections of the efta to payroll card users 56 when the fed s 2006 regulation e amendments took effect in 2007 payroll card users began to enjoy the suite of efta protections one of the pillars of the efta framework is mandated disclosure 57 essentially the financial institution issuing the payroll card must provide certain disclosures to card users when contracting to use the product or at least before the first fund transfer among other things the payroll card issuer has to disclose the fees charged for electronic transactions or the right to make transactions in addition to disclosures regulation e included certain procedural requirements and afforded payroll card users with some limited protections under the regulation financial institutions must provide payroll card users with limited liability protection for unauthorized transactions and have error resolution procedures in place payroll card users also have the right to either receive periodic statements that include their transaction history and fees paid during that time period or have access to that information electronically with some requirements pertaining to the length of history that has to be displayed in addition regulation e prohibits employers from dictating which financial institution will receive the electronic transfer of the employee s compensation this effectively means that employers cannot require employees to receive their compensation through a payroll card they must offer an additional payment option typically employers that offer a payroll card will offer direct deposit to a bank account of the employee s choosing but state employment law governs additional requirements around alternative payment options 58 the efta also affords consumers private rights of action meaning they can sue in court over efta violations within one year of the violation 59 in 2009 the fed again amended regulation e and added a provision prohibiting financial institutions from providing overdraft services without the consumer s consent 60 overdraft services enable consumers to complete transactions when doing so would result in a negative account balance the financial institution provides the funds to make up the difference however the fees charged for this type of credit service are notoriously high and in some cases have been attached to payroll cards without workers consent the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank created the consumer financial protection bureau as an agency with the sole mission of looking out for consumers in the financial marketplace in establishing the agency dodd frank transferred rulemaking and enforcement authority over the efta and regulation e to the cfpb the enforcement authority of the cfpb extends to financial institutions issuing cards third party service providers connected with the card program and employers moreover under dodd frank state attorneys general have the authority to bring civil cases against these institutions in order to enforce regulation e and other rules promulgated by the cfpb 61 mandatory arbitration limits private enforcement while state and federal enforcement of these protections is crucial it is not sufficient workers run the risk of being unable to bring claims against their employer privately in court due to the presence of forced arbitration clauses in either their employment contracts or in the contracts for financial products that provide their wages under these agreements victims often unwittingly forfeit their right to pursue judicial remedies or to join class action lawsuits in court instead they must go through the private arbitration process which limits their ability to obtain relief 62 one analysis estimated that about 1 in 3 private sector workers are subject to forced arbitration 63 meanwhile in a cfpb sample of card agreements 44 percent of payroll cards contained mandatory arbitration language 64 that same study also found that 92 percent of general purpose reloadable prepaid cards representing 83 percent of this market overall required customers legal disputes to be resolved in arbitration rather than court 65 in 2017 the cfpb banned the use of forced arbitration clauses that prohibit class action lawsuits in financial contracts but the arbitration rule was struck down by congress and president donald trump 66 in 2018 the u s supreme court also upheld these forced arbitration agreements in employment contracts 67 in 2016 the cfpb exercised its rulemaking authority under regulation e and finalized a rule that primarily expanded the coverage of regulation e to prepaid card accounts which include general use prepaid debit cards and other similar products 68 this rule is scheduled to take full effect in april 2019 69 as previously discussed payroll cards were already covered by the efta s requirements the cfpb s 2016 prepaid rule did affect payroll cards by enhancing some substantive elements of regulation e including the disclosure framework the cfpb created a new short form and long form disclosure requirement that increased and clarified disclosures for payroll card users the short form disclosures create a format that is more standardized and easier to understand while the longer form document provides more in depth detail on the payroll card program beyond creating the new disclosure format the 2016 rule expanded the number and types of fees that must be prominently disclosed to employees before they enroll in the payroll card program including fees for atm balance inquiries customer service and inactivity 70 the 2016 rule also required the short form disclosure to include the two additional fee types beyond the fees that are explicitly required to be disclosed on the short form that generated the most revenue during the previous 24 months if a certain revenue threshold was met 71 in addition the rule improved the disclosure framework by establishing a requirement that employers either include a simple straightforward statement that employees do not have to accept the payroll card offered by an employer or include a list of the various payment options offered furthermore financial institutions are required to explicitly state whether the funds on the payroll card enjoy deposit insurance coverage while regulation e does not generally limit fees the new prepaid rule which applies to payroll cards along with interpretations of the previous payroll card rule does affect some fees 72 the 2016 prepaid rule increased the timespan of online and written transaction history information that employees have the right to access the old requirement was a 60 day history whereas the 2016 rule requires 12 months and gives employees the option to request up to 24 months 73 the rule also revised the content of the transaction histories financial institutions must include all fees incurred by the payroll card account in the past calendar month and year to date moreover payroll card agreements must be submitted to the cfpb additionally in order to address overdraft concerns the 2016 prepaid card rule added important new constraints on credit features linked to a prepaid card the changes in the cfpb s 2016 prepaid card rule certainly improved the regulation of payroll cards but largely maintained the disclosure centric regulatory approach however some states have gone much further than the federal government banning or limiting certain practices and fees altogether in short federal workplace and consumer laws allow workers to be paid on payroll cards as long as workers have free access to their money at least once a pay period required fees don t take wages below the federal minimum certain disclosures are made and workers have access to basic account information at no cost federal requirements for payroll cards74 fee disclosure yes card transaction history yes limited liability yes error resolution yes free withdrawals one choice to receive a payroll card yes fee prohibitions one75 ban on credit features no fdic pass through insurance requirement no state policies regulation of payroll cards also occurs at the state level and varies significantly across states some states have additional protections above the federal floor including bans on junk fees and stronger requirements for free cash withdrawals of payroll account funds unfortunately too many states provide no additional protections above the federal base currently 39 states and the district of columbia do not have rules in place that exceed federal baseline protections afforded by the efta and regulation e 76 seventeen of these states and the district of columbia do not have explicit rules governing payroll cards while the remaining 22 states have rules in place that largely reiterate federal requirements the 11 states that exceed baseline federal requirements connecticut 77 hawaii 78 illinois 79 kansas 80 kentucky 81 michigan 82 minnesota 83 new hampshire 84 new york 85 pennsylvania 86 and vermont87 have all enacted fee restrictions or other protections above the federal base since the cfpb retooled and improved payroll card program disclosures in 2016 these 11 states have exceeded federal requirements in the four following areas providing additional free access for fund withdrawals banning junk fees eliminating credit features and requiring deposit insurance for account funds four of the 11 states connecticut hawaii new york and vermont provide more free access to account funds beyond the one free withdrawal required by federal labor law connecticut hawaii and vermont also require payroll cards to offer three free withdrawals while new york requires the payroll card to have access to an atm network with free in network withdrawals 88 ten of the 11 states ban at least one junk fee but there is some variation between states on how many fees and which specific fees are restricted the most frequently banned junk fees include fees for account application fund transfers replacement cards and inactivity five states connecticut hawaii illinois new york and pennsylvania ban at least seven payroll card fees the mix of banned fees differs across these five states but includes the frequently banned fees listed above as well as fees for participation maintenance low balance point of sale transactions in stores some declined transactions and account closing seven of the 12 states connecticut hawaii illinois michigan minnesota new york and vermont effectively ban credit features such as overdraft services or payroll card linked loan programs from being connected with payroll card accounts 89 federal law only requires an affirmative consumer opt in and does not ban credit features outright although the new prepaid rule imposes limits on overdraft services and fees in the first year 90 in addition to an outright ban on credit features some of these states have limits on fees for declined transactions for example illinois bans fees on the first two declined transactions per month and requires reasonable fees for any additional declined transactions finally two states connecticut and hawaii require the federally insured financial institution issuing the payroll card to pass deposit insurance through to the individual account holder 91 the fdic and ncua have protocols in place to apply deposit insurance on an individual account basis for payroll card programs 92 without this requirement a financial institution could hold the payroll account funds in a master account that exceeds the 250 000 deposit insurance limit requiring financial institutions to follow the pass through protocols is an important safeguard to eliminate the possibility of workers losing their payroll card funds if the financial institution fails policy recommendations nonprofit groups and industry coalitions have done important work to encourage financial institutions and employers to voluntarily adopt best practices 93 yet while these efforts have improved payroll card practices it is time for state and federal policymakers to more consistently and fully use their authority in this area there are several steps that policymakers can take to ensure that workers actually receive the full value of their paycheck legislation may be required for certain changes yet other changes can be implemented by executive action depending in part on what is allowed under law indeed the sweeping payroll card rules implemented in new york were carried out through regulatory action 94 and local lawmakers can take action on several of the recommended policy steps without state or federal direction including data collection and improving how they pay their own workers policy recommendations collect better data federal state and local policymakers should collect and publish data on payroll card users the fees they incur and whether workers believe that they have a choice of payment options these inquiries should be conducted on an ongoing basis and remain attentive to future changes in how workers are paid improve protections for consumers policymakers should ensure that payroll cards are safe financial products that do not separate workers from their wages ensure access to account funds federal and state policymakers should require that payroll card programs offer at least three free withdrawals per pay period or unlimited free withdrawals from multiple in network atms within close proximity to the employee s place of business federal and state policymakers should require that payroll card programs offer at least three free withdrawals per pay period or unlimited free withdrawals from multiple in network atms within close proximity to the employee s place of business prohibit junk fees federal and state policymakers should ban junk fees altogether including fees for account application or participation card balance access at atms funds transfers account inactivity maintenance low balance the issuance of an initial card and annual replacement cards point of sale transactions declined transactions and account closing federal and state policymakers should ban junk fees altogether including fees for account application or participation card balance access at atms funds transfers account inactivity maintenance low balance the issuance of an initial card and annual replacement cards point of sale transactions declined transactions and account closing ban credit features federal and state policymakers should prohibit credit features such as overdraft services and lines of credit from payroll card programs 95 federal and state policymakers should prohibit credit features such as overdraft services and lines of credit from payroll card programs mandate pass through deposit insurance federal and state policymakers should require that payroll card programs follow the protocols in place to apply deposit insurance coverage for individual payroll accounts adopt best practices when paying government workers payroll cards used by the government to pay workers both contractors and direct employees should have low overall fees and no junk fees or credit features additionally they should enable workers to easily access their money multiple times or from an atm network without charge strengthen enforcement efforts federal and state policymakers should provide adequate funding of enforcement agencies engage in strategic enforcement of problem industries and involve community and worker organizations to amplify enforcement efforts and minimize fears of retaliation policymakers should strengthen private rights of action for workers and consumers the above policy recommendations are explained in more detail below collect better data policymakers must address the lack of detailed public data on workers who are paid through payroll cards their actual ability to choose a payment method at work and the fees they incur the cfpb should collect and publish data on fees from financial institutions that issue payroll cards in order to shine a light on these practices and put pressure on financial institutions to offer better products for workers this public report should outline the total value of payroll card fees paid by workers the breakdown of fees incurred by fee type income and demographic data on payroll card users and the percent of payroll card users who believed that they had a choice in how they are paid the report should also discuss the federal government s use of payroll cards to pay federal contractors and employees as well as fees associated with those cards furthermore the cfpb should restore the proposed requirement that payroll card fee schedules be submitted to and posted online by the cfpb however if the cfpb given its current leadership refuses or fails to conduct such data collection congress could use its authority and tools to conduct or require a similar study moreover the federal trade commission ftc shares efta and regulation e enforcement authority with the cfpb for nonbank companies within the ftc s jurisdiction 96 additionally in recent years the ftc has conducted some research and policy work on the efta so it could play a useful role in data collection as well 97 likewise state and local governments should conduct data collection on payroll cards in their respective jurisdictions including their use of these cards as employers the cfpb as well as state and local governments should conduct broader studies on the evolution of how workers are paid and the potential risks associated with new electronic payment methods beyond just payroll cards as they emerge improve protections for consumers through rulemaking or legislation the federal government should significantly raise the baseline protections in place for payroll card users workers using payroll cards should be afforded at least three free withdrawals per pay period including at out of network atms as an alternative workers should have access to unlimited free withdrawals at in network atms with several atms in close proximity to their place of work while some cards offer multiple withdrawals at tellers atms are far more convenient and are where workers are most likely to incur fees moreover such regulation or legislation should ban an explicit list of payroll card fees it is time that baseline protections move beyond simply disclosing junk fees and actually eliminate them the specific fees banned by states such as connecticut hawaii and new york represent a good start these include fees for account application or participation card balance access at atms customer service fund transfers account inactivity maintenance low balance the issuance of an initial card and replacement cards annually point of sale transactions some declined transactions and account closing furthermore credit features including overdraft services should be banned from payroll cards 98 prohibiting credit features outright would ensure that employees do not get trapped in a cycle of debt when using this financial product moreover financial institutions issuing these cards should be required to follow the fdic and ncua protocols to pass deposit insurance through to individual accounts 99 this requirement would protect employee funds in case the financial institution fails 100 currently action at the federal level to strengthen these protections is unlikely but states can and should pass payroll card legislation restricting these fees and practices for workers the payroll card protections enacted in new york hawaii illinois connecticut pennsylvania and six other states that exceed current federal requirements provide a template for action financial institutions and some employers will likely push back against efforts to enact strong rules governing payroll cards still this is a fight worth having when excessive payroll card fees come out of workers paychecks they are taken from the lowest income families and go straight to powerful financial institutions bottom lines financial institutions do not need to charge junk fees or limit free access to account funds in order for these cards to be profitable it is still a business line that banks will pursue but workers especially low wage workers who are more likely to be paid through payroll cards deserve these protections to ensure that they keep more of their hard earned wages it is worth noting that in states such as hawaii where strong rules have been enacted banks and employers are still offering payroll card programs adopt best practices when paying government workers if a worker paid by the government whether a direct employee or a government contractor opts for a payroll card that card should have low overall fees and no junk fees or credit features additionally it should enable workers to easily access their money from a number of locations without charge a report from the national consumer law center found that payroll cards used by nebraska oregon and oklahoma met its best practices criteria by making it easy for workers to access their wages and use their cards without incurring fees 101 cards used by these three states had no fees for accessing cash making purchases getting balances calling customer service or declining transactions they even gave workers at least one free out of network withdrawal per pay period 102 similarly the direct express card used by the federal government to pay benefits to recipients who do not have a bank account allows many different kinds of transactions without a fee 103 it is important to note that different agencies within federal state and local governments may use different types of payroll cards and therefore it is best practice to ensure that all payroll cards used meet a baseline of required features strengthen enforcement efforts though there is not adequate data to pinpoint the precise incidence of legal violations around payroll cards it is highly likely that compliance is an issue wage theft and other workplace violations are common especially in low wage workplaces 104 one estimate from the economic policy institute indicates that wage theft through violations of minimum wage standards costs u s workers more than 8 billion annually 105 because payroll cards are often used by low wage workers it is likely that employer violations of payroll cards laws are common in addition there are more specific signs that payroll card violations are likely to be problematic for example there have been a number of lawsuits alleging violations and the legal regulations are often weak or unclear some even lack financial penalties even when there are clear standards such as federal law that affords workers choice in whether or not they are paid on payroll cards evidence suggests that noncompliance exists and that workers are reluctant to come forward with claims about being forced into payroll cards 106 the following general strategies could improve enforcement provide enforcement agencies with adequate funding involve community and worker organizations in enforcement efforts in order to amplify these efforts and minimize fears of retaliation and strengthen workers private rights of action so they can collectively go to court to enforce labor laws 107 for starters the cfpb arbitration rule should be reinstated by congress as well as other provisions to restore consumers and workers day in court 108 this rule prohibited forced arbitration clauses enabling workers to join class action lawsuits against financial institutions 109 in 2017 congress narrowly passed and president trump signed a congressional review act resolution striking down the rule 110 in addition the department of labor must provide clear guidance for employers and employees on when payroll cards use results in flsa violations and congress should attach monetary penalties to violations of flsa s free and clear standard states that do not have clear standards on payroll cards should immediately move to address that problem over the next several years the burden of enforcement will likely fall on state agencies and attorneys general since the cfpb under former acting director mick mulvaney rolled back enforcement activities watered down settlements that were already underway and showed no interest in aggressively using the authorities at his disposal for example in 2018 the washington post found that publicly announced cfpb enforcement actions declined by roughly 75 percent compared with the average over the past few years 111 during her confirmation process new cfpb director kathy kraninger could not identify a single action taken by mulvaney with which she disagreed 112 it is unlikely that the cfpb will live up to its mission during her tenure states must fill this void conclusion as payment technologies in the broader u s economy have evolved and become increasingly electronic so to have the methods by which workers are paid more and more workers are receiving their compensation on payroll cards these products certainly have benefits they provide convenience safety and faster payments to those who might otherwise receive payment through cash or check they can be an important means of integrating the unbanked into the mainstream financial system these cards can also be a useful budgeting tool for workers and their families serving as a complementary financial product to traditional bank accounts but payroll cards come with risks as well junk fees limited access to free withdrawals and costly credit features can separate workers from their wages the workers most often paid on payroll cards are the low income workers who can least afford those charges thus far the federal government has taken a disclosure centric approach to electronic forms of payment that is to say payroll card issuers must provide extensive disclosures and access to information yet costly fees and harmful practices are not banned outright several states have gone above these federal protections paving the way for other states and hopefully the federal government to follow their lead beyond enacting enhanced protections for workers using these products federal state and local policymakers should collect better data on payroll card users and the fees they incur abide by best practices when using payroll cards to pay their own public workers or contractors and step up enforcement efforts to protect workers this report covers payroll cards specifically but as payment methods continue to evolve the themes in this paper will extend to new payment products financial technology firms will almost certainly develop new convenient app based payment products that look similar to payroll cards the name and functionality of these payment vehicles may change but the need to protect workers from high fees and preserve their choice will remain workers should have easy cost free access to their wages period about the authors
the chinese government is urging bond indices to move forward anyway arguing that lack of preparations by a few investors should not deny other investors the opportunity to own chinese bonds but some foreign investors are pushing back on an early inclusion claiming they have not yet created the necessary infrastructure to handle the investments that would result beijing is pushing hard for the inclusion of yuan denominated bonds that are traded in onshore markets in major global bond indices in an effort to encourage needed capital inflows clearly china needs capital inflows to fund its industrial restructuring and support for the economy which has slowed dramatically because of the trade war with the united states and because its once massive current account surplus is shrinking rapidly the inclusion of chinese bonds into global indices would automatically channel funds into china as many funds allocate money by passively tracking these indices to support the inclusion of chinese bonds in these indices pan gongsheng deputy governor of the people s bank of china told hundreds of delegates at the china bond market international forum in beijing on thursday that china would create a more friendly and accessible investment environment for investors in addition china would create exchange traded funds and foreign exchange hedging services for investors he added the speech by pan who also the heads the state administration of foreign exchange safe china s foreign exchange regulator highlighted beijing s effort to team up with the hong kong stock exchange bloomberg ftse and jp morgan to channel money into china in particular china is keen to get china bonds included in the bloomberg barclays global aggregate indices with a decision expected in april of course the decision is up to bloomberg and i have no right to interfere with it but if it is delayed just because a few investors are not well prepared it s unfair to other investors pan gongsheng deputy governor people s bank of china pan said that bloomberg chairman peter grauer told him last year that there were three key preconditions clear income and value added tax rates deployment of a delivery versus payment service on trading platforms and a trading allocation mechanism that had to be met before chinese bonds could be included in the indices i solved all three issues by september and i gladly wrote to mr grauer pan recalled in his speech nevertheless some investors continue to call for a delay in the inclusion of chinese bonds in the bloomberg barclays indices this has aroused great concern at the central bank we publicised the plan last year why cannot you prepare the investment process and technical preparations early pan asked of course the decision is up to bloomberg and i have no right to interfere with it but if it is delayed just because a few investors are not well prepared it s unfair to other investors pan said in a raised tone beijing is now well positioned to lure international bond investors given their under allocation of long term high yield chinese bonds the yield on 10 year chinese treasury bond is about 3 3 per cent higher than 2 8 per cent earning on us treasury 10 year notes the enthusiasm is also borne out in the statistics overseas investors hold 2 3 per cent of issues in the world s third largest bond market at the end of 2018 up from 1 9 per cent a year earlier but still well behind the rates of 35 per cent in indonesia and 25 per cent in malaysia despite yuan depreciation expectations in the latter half of last year and china us trade frictions overseas investors remained enthusiastic as 80 per cent of their funds allocated to emerging markets went to china pan noted earlier this week the safe announced that it would double to us 300 billion the investment quotas in the qualified foreign institutional investors programme a channel through which institutional investors can buy chinese stocks and bond although the growth pace of the world s second largest economy is set to slow this year pan said investors should focus on china s medium and long term potential a slowing economy isn t a bad thing since the government has already shifted to prioritising the quality and sustainability he said pan gongsheng deputy governor of the people s bank of china pboc answers a question at a press conference during the first session of the 13th national people s congress npc in beijing on march 9 2018 photo agence france presse instead he reminded investors of china s complete industrial chains and rapidly increasing middle class which should underpin the success of the country s economic transformation still beijing remains cautious about capital outflows which could exert pressure on yuan exchange rate and threaten financial stability it continues to impose strict capital controls on outbound investment and has so far refused to open the southbound channel of the bond connect that would allow chinese domestic investors to buy foreign securities through hong kong the one way bond market flows also indicated an uneven progress int the opening of the country s financial market foreign access to the financial industry remains limited except for a few cases most notably the controlling stake that swiss bank ubs group recently was allowed to buy in its china joint venture a majority of foreign financial firms who have applied to expand their businesses in china including bank card payment firms visa and mastercard as well as rating agencies s p and fitch are still anxiously waiting for license approval

his prepared remarks this quarter i would like to highlight some of the innovative domain led solutions we have co created with our clients over the past few quarters these examples demonstrate our ability to combine deep vertical knowledge high end analytics process expertise and technology to help our clients improve their competitive positioning the first solution i would like to discuss is a state of the art offering in the insurance space wns has developed the capability to assess challenging claims such as rooftop damages by using images captured through drone technology wns takes these drone images and uses advanced analytics and machine learning to assess damage and the associated claim this approach enables our insurance partners to automate damage assessments mitigate risk to employees and reduce cost a second solution in the insurance space is the digital claims notification application which can be used by policy holders brokers and third party administration agents to register and self serve their claims end to end with minimal or no human intervention the app is available on all smartphones handheld devices and desktops and is currently offered for both motor vehicle and home policies this application delivers a seamless experience to end customers enabling them to monitor the status of a claim on a real time basis in the healthcare space wns healthhelp has created a new capability which addresses the management of orthopedic interventions for knee hip shoulder and spine issues leveraging a newly developed process workflow and a patent pending clinical rules engine developed in cooperation with university affiliated physicians we are able to deliver significant savings to our clients while improving patient outcomes by reducing the amount of surgical intervention required and increasing the appropriate use of clinically correct evidence based treatment and finally for the energy and utilities vertical we have created a voice assisted solution utilizing amazon alexa to help manage workflows and end to end customer queries including the submission of meter readings payments account information and other faqs this innovation has significantly reduced call volume and emails lowered averaging handling time streamlined query hand off and improved customer satisfaction while this is currently deployed in the utility space we are working to customize the solution for other verticals i would also like to spend a little time on today s call discussing global business volatility and uncertainty and its impacts on wns and our clients as we have discussed on previous calls our clients have been dealing with a massive amount of business disruption associated with digital requirements regulatory changes technology transformation and the need to leverage analytics our customers understand that if they are not able to address these challenges and improve the end customer experience they will lose competitive positioning and market share additionally in my conversations with clients over the past few months it has become clear they are also concerned about global political instability access to talent and the possibility of a macro economic slowdown with this in mind they must find the time resources and funds to support their transformational business initiatives to date we have not seen any impact to

creating long term value for all of our key stakeholders i would now like to turn the call over to sanjay puria our cfo to further discuss our results and guidance sanjay sanjay puria chief financial officer thank you keshav with respect to our third quarter financials net revenue came in at 195 9 million up 5 8 from 185 2 million posted in the same quarter of last year and up 9 1 on a constant currency basis by vertical revenue growth was broad based with the shipping and logistics healthcare and insurance verticals each growing more than 14 year over year with respect to our service offerings revenue growth versus the prior year was driven by strength in industry specific bpm auto claims and finance and accounting sequentially net revenue increased by 0 2 on a reported basis and 0 1 constant currency quarter over quarter revenue growth with new and existing clients was largely offset by expected seasonality in our travel business in the third quarter wns recorded approximately 2 million of short term revenue which is not forecasted in quarter four this amount is the same as reported last quarter adjusted operating margin in quarter three was 23 as compared to 19 9 reported in the same quarter of fiscal 2018 and 21 last quarter on a year over year basis adjusted operating margin increased as a result of improved productivity currency movements net of hedging and operating leverage on higher volumes these benefits more than offset the impact of our annual wage increases sequentially adjusted operating margin increased as a result of improved productivity and favorable currency movements net of hedging the company s net other income expense was 2 8 million in the third quarter up from 1 5 million reported in quarter three of fiscal 2018 and up from 2 2 million last quarter year over year favorability was a result of higher interest income driven by better rates on our liquid mutual funds and lower interest expense resulting from scheduled debt payments sequentially interest income was up as a result of higher cash balances a slightly higher effective interest rate and onetime other income of 0 3 million wns effective tax rate for quarter three came in at 20 7 up from 10 8 last year and down from 21 8 last quarter last year in quarter three wns had a 5 2 million favorable net tax adjustments associated with provisions for the 2017 us tax reform bill this quarter the impact of the us tax reform bill was finalized and wns recorded an additional tax benefit of 0 4 million other changes in the quarterly tax rate are primarily due to the mix of work delivered from tax incentive facilities and the mix of profits between geographies for fiscal quarter four we expect our effective corporate tax rate to be approximately 22 and going forward in the 22 to 23 range the company s adjusted net income for quarter three was 38 million compared with 34 2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2018 and 33 7 million last quarter adjusted diluted earnings was 0 73 per share in quarter three versus 0 66 in the third quarter of last year and 0 65 last quarter this represents growth in eps of 11 8 year over year and 13 sequentially as of december 31 2018 wns balances in cash and investments totaled 215 2 million and the company had 75 4 million of debt the company generated 59 5 million of cash from operating activities this quarter and free cash flow of 54 8 million after accounting for 4 7 million in capital expenditures as keshav mentioned quarter three cash from operations was the highest in the company s history and was largely the result of sequential improvement in collection and higher profits dso in the third quarter came in at 32 days as compared to 30 days last year and 35 days

support of fiscal 2020 committed project ramps in our press release issued earlier today wns provided updated full year guidance for fiscal 2019 based on the company s current visibility levels we expect net revenue to be in the range of 787 million to 799 million representing year over year revenue growth of 6 to 8 revenue guidance assumes an average british pound to us dollar exchange rate of 1 27 for the remainder of fiscal 2019 excluding exchange rate impacts revenue guidance represents constant currency growth of 9 to 11 all of which is organic we currently have over 99 visibility to the midpoint of the revenue range consistent with january guidance in prior years adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 137 million to 141 million based on a inr70 to us dollar exchange rate for the remainder of fiscal 2019 this implies adjusted eps of 2 62 to 2 70 assuming a diluted share count of approximately 52 2 million shares with respect to capital expenditures wns currently expects our requirements for fiscal 2019 to be up to 35 million we ll now open the call for questions operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from korey marcello with deutsche bank your line is now open korey marcello deutsche bank analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my question i guess i just wanted to start out on the organic growth you know it remains really strong in recent quarters but it has moderated and even just looking at some of the short term revenues and timing and stuff is there anything else to kind of call out there and then i guess going forward as you kind of look at the demand environment in the pipeline currently should we expect the company to kind of maintain technical difficulty growth rates or is there potential for reacceleration from some of the larger deals ramping and things of that nature keshav murugesh group chief executive officer sure let me address that so i think the first thing i want to mention is that i m very comfortable with the state of our pipeline it continues to be very solid we re seeing larger deals more transformational deals in the pipeline and also being converted more importantly we re seeing these deals across all our core verticals horizontals and geographies in many cases with the investments we ve now made around technology we re seeing a lot of the deals now being technology transformation led along with a very strong finance and accounting and analytics kind of flavor so really broad based and across you know all areas i must say that at this point in time the deal position is stronger than the same time last year so while at this point in time we may have signed a fewer logos with you must realize they are all with higher acv and just to give you a statistic at this point in time it is 26 higher acv than this time last year so overall the metrics are actually tracking very well deal flow tracking very well client interactions going very well but finally we are never in control of timing timing finally becomes a factor that is controlled by the client having said that as i just mentioned in my prepared remarks i actually think that the demand environment is very strong and the potential for us to continue to do extremely well in this environment is very good david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations and i would just add to that korey in terms of kind of the organic constant currency growth rate that we ve been posting obviously we had a couple of quarters last year that were extremely strong and we knew coming into this year that the comparatives from our year over year basis were going to be much tougher in the back half of the year and i think you re seeing a little bit of that in terms of what s showing up with the slow growth rate but the reality is like you mentioned you know when you look at the known headwinds walking into this year which were 9 and back half loaded and you look at the fact that we ve been able to generate about 1 5 less on a year to date basis in terms of kind of the short term less visible revenues i think that really goes a long way to explain why the growth rate in the back half of this year while very very strong overall is a little bit slower than it s been in the last three four quarters korey marcello deutsche bank analyst great thanks guys and then i guess as a quick follow up i guess on the margin side those tend to be just tracking really nicely recently really above the 20 guidance that you guys talked about for 2019 or fiscal year 19 and even above the kind of high teens over the mid term any kind of update there for the year on where you expect margins to fall and any reason why you would expect these margins to kind of remain elevated over the next few quarters thanks sanjay puria chief financial officer yeah you know so for specifically for quarter three the margin was little on the higher side it was driven by a couple of factors which was currency favorability as well as the non recurring revenue of 2 million where majority of it fall to the bottom as well as a better performance from a productivity perspective having said that as we saw the exceptional quarter and it s not sustainable at this level but directionally we believe that margin approximately should be around 20 which is a very healthy margin as well as on quarter four as specifically as earlier as we ve mentioned that there was certain hiring in the infrastructure which was expected got pushed to quarter four and accordingly where guidance for quarter four is not hidden but we believe and expect margin to be in the range of 20 for quarter four as well as going forward korey marcello deutsche bank analyst thanks guys keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thanks korey operator our next question comes from mayank tandon with needham your line is now open kyle peterson needham company analyst hey good morning this is actually kyle peterson on for mayank today just want to touch a little bit on some of the vertical demand particularly i would know utilities has been a little bumpy i think you guys have had some project transitions in that space but just want to see kind of how is the core demand in that segment and just want to see if you have any visibility on when some of these transitions could start to level off a bit david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure let me take that kyle you know you are 100 correct the challenges that we ve had this year in the utility space were known coming into the year it s largely around a couple of clients where we knew one had a volume challenge and the other had a process consolidation challenge so the headwinds that we re seeing in the utilities space were known walking into the year we re probably getting if i got another quarter of headwind in that space so i do think we should have a pretty clean slate as we walk into fiscal 20 to be able to post growth within the utility and energy space that is more in line with company growth rate kyle peterson needham company analyst great and then if i could just follow up little bit on m a just want to see if you guys could add any color on what the pipeline is in that space if there s anything in particular you guys would be looking for in terms of whether it s vertical specialty technical capability or something like that keshav murugesh group chief executive officer sure i ll take that so you know once again i must mention that you know we will continue to be very opportunistic in terms of m a we believe m a you know particularly around capability led kind of growth is a good use of our cash we have a strong pipeline at this point in time is across some very core areas that we had we ve been identifying over the past few quarters we re looking at assets which are capability led and at the same time accretive to overall numbers of wns for us i think the focus is right time right size and fit and right the value that we want to make sure that it only adds to the overall momentum of the company i just want to remind you that at this point we over the past couple ph of years we have done some really nice tuck in kind of acquisitions and the approach that we have followed and the discipline that we have followed has been very successful and that s how we re going to see this play out so it ll be much more focused on capability led acquisition if something comes up which is transformational and is attractive we ll still look at it as well sanjay puria chief financial officer and maybe just to add to that you know as part of our capital allocation program m a based on the capability led as keshav mentioned is going to be one of the key focus kyle peterson needham company analyst understood thanks guys nice quarter keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you kyle operator thank you our next question comes from maggie nolan with william blair your line is now open maggie nolan william blair analyst good morning and good evening you mentioned deals with higher acv and obviously the nature of these deals and the nature of your work that you re doing is changing to some degree so does this also change the normal timeline we should expect in terms of when a new client may ramp up and peak in terms of revenue contribution david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure let me take that maggie i think you re 100 correct anytime we re dealing with the new customer and a scope that is transformational technology led in nature we do anticipate that the sales cycle will be longer and we saw that with both of the large deals that we ve added in q4 of last year and q1 of this year and that you know the ramp of those projects can be a little bit slower i think the biggest issue with the large transformational deal isn t necessarily the sales cycle changing but the fact that the timing of when they re going to start is extremely uncertain in fact the one that we find in the shipping and logistics area started a little bit early the one that we have signed in the insurance space we have been working on for a little over two years so it is a little bit more volatile in terms of starts and stops and we certainly have to watch how that plays out we want to make sure that when we look at the overall pipeline while we do have more large transformation led types of deals that we re augmenting those that pipeline with some of the smaller more short term deals as well but you know overall the pipeline is healthy it s robust but absolutely if we ve got by and large a higher percentage of that pipeline coming from large transformational deals i would expect to have a longer sales cycle on that type of work maggie nolan william blair analyst okay thanks understood and then given the macro environment and some of the commentary we ve been hearing about a tightening labor market what are we seeing in terms of wage increases and how does that compare with kind of typical wage increases are there any changes there to note david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah no changes to note i think we have seen some redistribution of where the wage increases are coming from across the portfolio but overall i think the expectation as we head into fiscal 20 is that weight wage increases and the overall impacts of the p l are going to be similar to what we ve seen in the past and that s incorporated in sanjay s comments about having a 20 operating margin going forward maggie nolan william blair analyst great thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you maggie operator thank you our next question comes from the line of moshe katri with wedbush your line is now open moshe katri wedbush securities analyst thanks good quarter can you talk a bit about the puts and takes in terms of what drove margins this quarter maybe you can go into some of the different variable and how these actually impacted margin including fx and then you know the acv number that was up 26 i m sorry is that a booking number or is that the backlog or the pipeline some color there will be helpful thanks david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so first i guess to your first the first part of your question moshe when you re talking about the operating margin are you looking at it from a sequential perspective or from a year over year perspective moshe katri wedbush securities analyst year over year david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations okay so on a year over year basis if you look at our adjusted operating margin we re up about 300 basis points if you were going to break that down i would break it into about 50 related to fx and 50 related to operations so i think you re looking at a nice healthy balance that s come from currency largely driven by depreciation in the indian rupee as well as favorability in terms of productivity and higher volumes that are driving leverage in our business so a nice mix in terms of what s contributed on a year over year basis when you look at the acv figure being up 26 on average year over year that is actually new client addition so that is sold business so from that perspective we re afraid to both the combination of backlog as well as booked based on when the deal was signed and when the deal started to generate revenue moshe katri wedbush securities analyst understood and then the commentary on 16 new renewals this year i mean year to date i think is that an the usual number maybe you can give us kind of a color in terms of relativity ph how does that compare to prior years and then looking into the next fiscal year is there anything unusual in terms of the renewal rates as well thanks david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so year to date we ve had we ve expanded 35 relationships and renewed 48 if you look at where we were in the same place of last year we were at 31 expansions and 40 renewals so i think we re tracking to actually be ahead of where we were last year in terms of expansion of existing relationship and renewals of renewals or extensions of contracts nothing at this point in time that s unusual i think as we head into fiscal 20 so good solid momentum in terms of our ability to cross sell and upsell our existing customer base moshe katri wedbush securities analyst great thanks for the color operator thank you our next question comes from joseph vafi with loop capital your line is now open joseph vafi loop capital markets analyst hey guys good results good morning good evening i was wondering i think i heard sanjay say that healthcare grew about 14 in the quarter i know that keshav mentioned the healthhelp innovation interventional solution in his prepared remarks just wondering if i can get a little more color on what s driving growth in healthcare and do you think if that s sustainable at this point then i have a follow up david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure let me take that joe i think you know we ve made some strategic investments over the last couple of years in the healthcare space specifically the acquisitions of healthhelp and value edge i think we re seeing the results of those acquisitions in terms of both the ability to expand the relationships that they had brought to the table as well as the ability to add new relationships to the portfolio the growth has been really solid we ve been adding new service offerings primarily in the pharmaceutical and in the healthcare payer space we certainly feel very very good about what we ve been able to do here our ability to add new logos that have the ability to expand over time so certainly view healthcare as a driver of growth and hopefully growing above company average going forward sanjay puria chief financial officer yeah and maybe just to add that you know with those acquisitions and the logos what we have we also had a good opportunity to cross sell lot of the existing services which is around finance and accounting and research and analytics to all those logos and we feel very positive about that joseph vafi loop capital markets analyst great that s helpful and then you know as we move forward and perhaps more deals are becoming more technology driven or led do we or how do we look at that technology investment in the company how much is that kind of goes into like an r d line versus perhaps technology work that is passed on to the customer in terms of overall pricing on deals thanks david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so let me take that joe i think you know in general when you look at our investments in r d sort of developing certain product capabilities the reality is the majority of the r d that we have as an organization is in evaluating product and then understanding how we can best incorporate those products and those solutions into our existing services and offerings so you know the r d is something that by and large gets expense now the reality is that everything that we do for our clients is customized so to the extent that either the software or the process needs to be customized refined changed for the specific customers that s something that s absorbed within the specific deal and taken to consideration when we look at the pricing in the margins on those activities joseph vafi loop capital markets analyst thanks so much david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks joe operator thank you our next question comes from joseph foresi with cantor fitzgerald your line is now open drew kootman cantor fitzgerald analyst good morning this is drew kootman on for joe i was wondering if you guys could touch on the potential areas for out performance as you look into the end of the year and fiscal 20 is that a new client signed existing client base acquisitions just wondering what will drive growth to above average in the future keshav murugesh group chief executive officer good question so i think from my perspective i m quite comfortable with the opportunities that are available in the existing pipeline for a new client itself and therefore how quickly some of those deals will actually convert into actual signings will actually determine how much of time we have across the rest of this year and maybe the next year to actually reap the benefits of that signings so i would say it s more working closely with the customer and really helping tipping them across that finish line so to speak more importantly i will say that the pipeline of growth that we are also seeing from existing clients that we signed say in the last in this year and maybe in the close of last year and the way they have started to ramp has significant potential for fiscal 2020 obviously and again in terms of how quickly some of those programs actually take off will determine where we actually end up in terms of overall numbers the most important thing i want to say here is wns sales people are really focused on working with the clients in terms of just helping them to appreciate the kind of offerings we have and then help them to take those decisions the company has made all the right investments in terms of sales in terms of domain in terms of technology analytics all the horizontal kind of services we have done some really strong acquisitions that are leading the way in terms of delivering on the pipeline and i would say that organic growth from a hunting point of view and a farming point of view and maybe a little bit of capability led m a will actually help take that number beyond the general expected number in the long term drew kootman cantor fitzgerald analyst great and just a quick follow up which regions do you expect to see the most strength heading into fiscal year 20 keshav murugesh group chief executive officer well at this point in time like i said growth is expected to be broad based so first and foremost i must again say that the pipeline that we have going into next year is strong across all the key geographies as well as offering areas having said that europe and uk actually led in terms of actual conversions during this year but that doesn t mean that some of the deals inside north america where decisions are now imminent will not actually you know change that kind of metric for next year so what we are focused on is just making sure that we have the right pipeline we have the right impact across that pipeline and we are focused on really taking it across every one of our core horizontal and vertical areas drew kootman cantor fitzgerald analyst thank you keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from bryan bergin with cowen your line is now open bryan bergin cowen company analyst hi thank you i wanted to ask on the fiscal 19 revenue growth range 200 basis points here i think it s about two times what typically it is at this point in time anything to call out there given your typical 99 visibility to midpoint david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah i think you know what we wanted to make sure that we were doing here bryan in terms of the guidance is making sure that people are still aware that we do have upside walking into the fourth quarter here obviously with over 99 visibility for the midpoint that the midpoint short of something going wrong at this point in time is pretty well locked in given that we don t have any short term revenues in our numbers for q4 given that we do have some pipeline opportunities here that we re working on one of the things we wanted to make sure was that we left some of the upside in the guidance for people to see here and obviously given the way we guide and given that the midpoint is visibility based we need to add the same downside to the upside to make that a true midpoint so becomes a math exercise after that but essentially we feel really good about our ability to meet the midpoint obviously given where our visibility is here if we wanted to make sure that we left a little bit of upside here bryan bergin cowen company analyst okay understood and then the acv figure you provided is encouraging i wanted to ask on the margin can you talk about the margin profile the new deal is coming through relative to your existing business are you getting are these tech led deals driving a structural change for you and then just of those new client additions i think you said four the industries that those are in david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so a couple of different things i think when you look at the deals we re signing and the structural margin portfolio we believe over the next three to five years these deals have the potential to be margin accretive to the company overall obviously if they re technology led if they re strategic to the customer then we do have the ability to generate better margins on that you know part of that transition though is making sure that clients continue to move down a path and transition the services from fte based to transaction and outcome based where we have that margin leverage so that decision to move in many cases is outside of our control but certainly we see that opportunity in terms of the client adds this last quarter we as keshav and sanjay mentioned we added four new clients three of them were actually in the retail cpg space and the other was in the travel space bryan bergin cowen company analyst okay thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks bryan operator thank you our next question comes from rick eskelsen with wells fargo your line is now open rick eskelsen wells fargo analyst good morning thank you for taking my question keshav in your prepared remarks you did mentioned that clients are asking about access to talent i wonder if you can just sort of talk about that as it relates to your business we ve heard from some of the larger it companies that some of the access to digital talent is harder but i know obviously the bpm industry is different on the talent side so maybe if you could talk about talent access keshav murugesh group chief executive officer sure i think with all the macroeconomic uncertainty that they are faced with i think what clients are really looking at doing is doubling down on making sure that they understand their markets wells what their customers want and really coming up with the right set of offerings and programs for their end customers therefore from their perspective what they re looking to do is really work with strong partners like wns who act as an extension of their enterprise and so when i spoke about talent there you know clearly what they re saying is we have enough on our plates in terms of just understanding where our business is headed and how to really stave off disruption in our business and therefore we have great appreciation of the kind of programs that you have as a company in terms of people process technology and talent and therefore are really encouraged by the kind of investments we re making around talent whether it is around skill building technical difficulty operator i m sorry ladies and gentlemen it looks like we had a disconnection again keshav murugesh group chief executive officer yeah so operator inaudible to continue david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure and i can kind of take the question so do you have a follow up to that because i can kind of take it from here rick eskelsen wells fargo analyst yeah i guess just to follow up david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations probably wait for a minute to be taken ph rick eskelsen wells fargo analyst the follow up was just on the travel and leisure side i think i heard in the prepared remarks that it was normal seasonality it looked a little bit bigger than normal so just curious you could kind of talk about that vertical in specific david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah similar things so the travel vertical we obviously from a sequential perspective had a seasonality issue and it s something that we see in our fiscal third quarter and the calendar fourth quarter of every year in addition to that we did have a ramp down in our business that we knew about walking into the year so we talked again about the 9 headwinds walking into the year the deals that we saw that we re going to create that headwind for us in the back half of the year were in the travel space in the utility space and then one in the auto claim space as well so this was something that was not a surprise to us actually it was something that we did proactively to help mitigate margins for us and again i think we feel pretty good about the travel space overall and where we sit but right now the optics are a little bit soft in that space on a year to date basis it s certainly less so rick eskelsen wells fargo analyst great thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks rick operator thank you and we do have them reconnected back again with us our next question is going to come from the line of frank atkins with suntrust your line is now open frank atkins suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks for taking my questions first question i wanted to ask a little bit about the top client any color on the dynamics there seen some nice movement there keshav murugesh group chief executive officer yeah i think what s really coming together is some of the effort that we ve been making over the past few quarters that we ve been talking about i think finally the client has actually started making good progress on some very core kind of programs that they were talking about for quite a while and having said that i must say that we continue to have some really compelling discussions with that client on a few more initiatives which may take a little longer but we re quite confident with the relationship that we have established and the impact that we have created for them we will benefit over the medium term david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations i think the other thing that s important to note frank is that over the last four quarters we have had some back and forth in terms of number one and number two client at wns so the number one client in any given quarter over the last four quarters has not necessarily been the same quarter to quarter and that s also important to understand frank atkins suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay thank you very much that s helpful and then secondly i wanted to ask about revenue by horizontal if we look at industry specific and analytics can you talk about some of the drivers and kind of key components of growth going forward and where could they be as a percentage or kind of revenue mix longer term david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure let me take that so when we look at the industry specific obviously the growth in that segment this year has been extremely strong we re up year to date i believe the industry specific revenues are up 21 part of what we see in that space is that a lot of the things that our customers are asking for from a demand perspective are domain led and specific to their verticals or sub verticals so we believe that industry specific will continue to be extremely strong for us it s where we ve seen the large transformational deals tend to be focused analytics should also be a driver for us along with f a these are ways that we re able to connect with our customers to generate enhanced business value and we do expect both of those segments to be strong going forward as well so if you were to kind of ask where the pipeline and where the growth has come from and what s representative of kind of where we see the industry it s strategic f a it s high end analytics and it s industry specific bpo frank atkins suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great thank you very much operator thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks frank operator our next question comes from the line of ashwin shirvaikar with citi your line is now open ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst thank you hey guys good job here congratulations david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks ashwin ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst my first question is on automation some of our checks show that new techniques like rpa are kind of becoming business as usual is this something that clients incorporate as a matter of course so would you tend to agree with that and as that becomes more normal is it possible to get metrics around automation number of bots penetration and things like that keshav murugesh group chief executive officer yes so let me just start with the answer i m sure dave and ron will have more to contribute but i think you know the first thing that we all must appreciate and understand is that every business today in the world is a tech business and you know what we may talk about some of these tools and efficiency gain kind of programs whether it s rpa machine learning ai things like that to just make life easier in terms of delivering a solution to our clients the reality is as we keep getting better and better at it we will just keep we ll keep making smoother this smoother delivery and we ll keep moving to newer and newer kind of designs newer technologies and newer ways of delivering the model so first thing i would say is that you know clients invest in technology platforms and things like that in order to get their model more efficient we invest in technology in order to deliver in a much more streamlined and seamless manner make sure that we can reduce our cost with a much more sticky business as well as create a business model for our clients which is derisked dramatically from a operational efficiency point of view at the same time we also had different partners in order to make sure that we are delivering the roi that our clients need so the reality is every one of these areas will continue to evolve and none of these areas will remain as a stand alone standard for the future as well so ron and dave if you want anything more please go ahead ron gillette chief operating officer yeah so i would agree with what keshav saying that automation is going to continue to be a theme with all of our clients tech enablement a theme there i would say that the number of bots deployed and trying to put metrics around that it doesn t really tell the story because it s more of what clients needs are and the state of their existing platforms and systems in most cases but that s just also one part of the story a lot of what we re doing today is innovative or transformational tools or platforms that we re creating and deploying to clients as well as looking at their existing systems and helping them reengineer them so that they can be more efficient and deliver the processes that we see and advocate to them as being best in class that they should adopt david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations and i would just add one other thing to what both keshav and ron said when you look at deployment of technology i think you can bifurcate to some extent that deployment of technology into new clients new relationships as well as the deployment of technology into existing clients now clearly as we ve spoken about the larger more transformational deals that we re signing and we re starting to ramp on we re seeing technology it s part of the initial solution and it s part of what we re going into the client with on the first instance the separate issue is how quickly existing clients allow the deployment of technology into their existing environments and part of both of these ash when that that s always important to remember is we re ready to deploy technology we have the tools we have the assets whether they re our own proprietary technology or third party partnerships we certainly know what they are and how to use them the biggest challenge that we tend to see is the amount of behavior change required on the client end that would enable us to leverage that technology so while we re aggressively pushing for deployment we still have a lot of clients that push back at this and say you know what the process changed the ownership and accountability that comes with that deployment of technology is not something that we re organizationally ready for yet so i think while it is as part of every discussion that we re having today the pace at which that technology gets deployed is going to be client specific keshav murugesh group chief executive officer yeah i think that that s important enough ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst got it appreciate it keshav murugesh group chief executive officer sorry ashwin it s just it s such an important question because it s not something that will disappear with this quarter it s something that we think will you know continue to gain momentum over the next few quarters as well you know wns position is that technology is just one of the inputs that go into delivering a great solution to its clients you know just rushing behind technology alone is not going to solve the business problem so i think along with that just being agile making sure there s a right business case behind it and finally the most important aspect which is ensuring there is end customer impact along with analytics being embedded into it is what we focus on delivering to our clients and that s what s really driving our business momentum ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst got it appreciate those insight you know the statement about adding seat capacity in anticipation of 2020 demand i might have missed it but did you also talk about the cadence of that addition of seat capacity and if you could also provide then clarity on the revenue per seat metric that did go down this quarter is that sort of the only part of those seat additions or what is something else going on there david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah so couple of things ashwin i think in sanjay s prepared remarks we re actually looking at the potential to add almost a 1 000 seats here in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the demand that we ve already signed here so part of what we re seeing and you saw it in the first quarter you saw it if you can see it again here in q4 is that when we do add seat capacity we tend to add it in a step function so you can t add 50 seats when you add 50 heads you add the seats and then you fill them you add the seats and then you fill them so q4 for us is going to be a step function an increase in seat capacity we re certainly not going to be increasing the headcount at the same pace that we re increasing infrastructure in the fourth quarter so from that perspective you will see the seat utilization metric come down but this is this is part of what we need to do to continue to prepare ourselves for the growth going forward in terms of the revenue per employee metric you re going to see swings quarter to quarter part of what happens if you just take the simple math and divide revenue by average number of heads as you don t get the currency impact the expectation for this full year that s implied in our guidance is that revenue per employee this year should be up a little bit over 2 so we are driving that productivity it is showing up net of the seat utilization metric in terms of higher margins for us this year the implied guidance for this fiscal year is a 21 operating margin so we are certainly making sure that we re focused on the seat utilization metric the revenue per employee metric but also need to understand quarter to quarter based on hiring cycles and infrastructure builds that those numbers can move ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst got it now that closes the gap i was looking for thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks ashwin operator thank you our next question comes from dave koning with baird your line is now open david koning robert w baird co analyst yeah hey guys i guess a couple of things just on the different revenue metrics the aviva contract they re the biggest client was up 20 year over year which is better than it s been in a while is there anything one off happening at the biggest client or is there something new with the revenue or the services you re selling that s going to sustainably kind of keep it at a pretty high level sanjay puria chief financial officer yeah so you know aviva perspective it s a mix of both things what we are also seeing some of the traction from a growth perspective and the expansion in some new areas that s driving growth it s also part of a non recurring revenue over there because of the some of the gain share model and the productivity what we are able to drive at the client end so it s a mix of both and having said that we are in discussion in various multiple new areas from a growth perspective again it s just a it s a matter of a time from a closure perspective david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah i think aviva continues to present a couple of opportunities for us dave as we spoke about in the past we wanted to continue to move into new areas and sell services the second is the integration of some of the acquisitions that they ve done over the past couple of years but we also understand that historically there has been some pressure there in terms of the productivity commitments that we have for aviva and the currency so a couple of things that are fighting against us but there remains some opportunities for us to continue to move that client relationship forward david koning robert w baird co analyst okay great and then the other thing i know travel historically we can see in the numbers it does have a little bit of negative seasonality in fiscal q3 no question but this quarter was a little worse maybe a few million worse than normal it seems to decline by 13 sequentially often it will be down modestly to kind of in this range but this was a little bigger anything to call out one time that it kind of bounces back in q4 sanjay puria chief financial officer so you know your observation is right that you know other than travel seasonality you know at the start of the year when we spoke about some of the known ramp down issues for the year it was also into the travel vertical but it was all known over there and it was around some specific client but there s a vertical the pipeline seems to be strong and great opportunity ahead so we expect it to because that s one of the travel it s one of the strongest vertical along with the insurance from a company perspective and we expect it to back on the track from a growth perspective david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah so this was part of the 9 headwind we knew about walking into the year dave david koning robert w baird co analyst yeah gotcha gotcha okay and then and then just the last quick thing so the interest other line you called out i think a few 100 000 or so of kind of onetime benefit but that should continue we shouldn t expect that to continue that dramatically different than 2 5 million 2 6 million per quarter or something like that right david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations no i think as long as the net cash balances remain the same we should be fine dave the one caveat i would say is that if we do get into healthy share repurchase numbers or we do get into an acquisition that would affect our cash balances then you could see that number change but overall yes i think in terms of our ability to continue to generate that in the business as usual environment yes correct david koning robert w baird co analyst okay and congrats you guys just keep crushing that thanks guys david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks dave keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from puneet jain with j p morgan your line is now open puneet jain j p morgan analyst yeah hi similar question to the one asked by ashwin before so are you seeing different automation or rpa adoption rates across horizontal and industry specific workflows and broadly how much of business can be automated and what s impact on deal contract value when you automate a workflow david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so let me take that puneet i mean i think we kind of gone to the question of you know look we are certainly deploying technology where we can we re deploying technology where our clients will allow it we do see it more as a function of the specific client relationship than to say we re automating this service or that service so we have for example industry specific work that s done you know 90 labor 10 technology we have industry specific work that s done 50 50 depending on what it is so i think part of it is understanding that what we re really doing and i think keshav spoke to this is leveraging technology that help us solve client problems but the portfolio and the overall mix is getting more technology enabled over time both from the combination of new clients willing to start a relationship with components of technology as well as existing clients over time migrating to allow us and enable us to leverage technology in terms of how we deliver what we re doing for them so look if everything we were doing we re in a transaction or an outcome based model we would be aggressively deploying technology but the reality is most of the things that we do 65 of our work is still fte based and in those relationships the client in many cases controls how we do the work where we do the work and with whom we do the work so a lot of this is not in our control and we re certainly aggressively pushing it we sell it on the front as an opportunity we tell clients that we re willing to migrate to these types of models and with technology enabled and whatever they re ready but we don t control the pace the same way we don t control the pace of when new deals start and when they ramp we don t control the pace of when clients move toward transaction and outcome based services and the technology enablement of those services puneet jain j p morgan analyst understood i mean and is there a way to size how much of business can be subject to technology deployment over the long term like i know like the use cases could change over time but based on what we know today based on technology environment today is there a way to size the impact of automation how much penetration potential there is david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations i mean it s keshav murugesh group chief executive officer i ll say that at this point in time what we re doing is we re appreciating the fact that the change that you re seeing around technology adoption is really still evolutionary it s just helping to create new opportunity for us from our perspective we are clearly focused on continuing to move up the value chain so while automation is something that is a very important part of the input that we bring to the table we had never taking away from the fact that human intelligence and human kind of intervention is going to be diluted so in every one of the areas we are focused on whether it is the vertical areas or horizontal areas or even the finance and accounting areas we re constantly really focusing on reskilling for digital and making sure that a unique combination of people technology and process comes together to drive outcomes for our clients and while doing that we will make the best use of automation in order to ensure our people are leveraged in the best possible manner so very difficult for us to size how much of it will actually get replaced by automation at this point in time all i will say is that the market out there is very strong for us the demand is very strong and it s going to take quite some time before which automation alone will deliver the kind of solutions that wns can deliver david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations and other thing just to add to that what keshav said puneet we ve seen over the last five six seven years that the market has expanded to the possible if you will i mean what is outsourceable today is dramatically different than what clients thought was outsourceable 10 years ago and i think you re going to see the same thing with technology and automation what is automatable today is going to be dramatically different look rpa is not new rpa has been around for a long long time it s just getting enough attention and enough momentum today to where people are getting comfortable to use it and that s again the same thing when our clients going to be comfortable allowing deployment and leverage of some of the technology and solutions are there when are they going to be vetted and market centric enough that clients will allow us to do that so that s something we don t have an answer for it s something we don t have control over but it is something we re out in front of and we re comfortable that we ll be able to help our clients get there when they want to puneet jain j p morgan analyst got it and let me also quickly ask the customary question on brexit with all the uncertainty in the uk and broadly like potential for macroeconomic slowdown can your backlog and pipeline support continued high single to low double digit growth over the near term if some of those risks materialize keshav murugesh group chief executive officer so puneet i must again mention that at this point in time brexit has generally been a non event for us some of the things that we have been reading about and the impacts that we re seeing whether it s on currency whether it s on demand all of it actually has been playing out very slowly over the past few quarters and i guess for most people believe even what happened yesterday or day before didn t really come out as a surprise because the market had already message written ph i just want to mention that for our business model brexit is just another form of disruption right and therefore while it may impact timelines in the short term the reality is our focus is to continue to make sure that we are being very partner like to our clients we re not seeing any let up in terms of the demand from clients who are supposedly actually impacted by this brexit and our conversations in terms of the impact that we can create for their businesses continues to be very positive puneet jain j p morgan analyst got it david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations and then i d just add to that i think just to add to that puneet whether it s brexit or whether it s the potential for a macro slowdown if you look at the value proposition for the services that we re delivering the value proposition doesn t change and i think it could be effectively argued that the value proposition in an environment where things are a little bit more challenging a little bit more complex a little bit more costly that the value proposition for process outsourcing actually increases our ability to execute and deliver on the disruption that they re dealing with in addition to the ability to save them money and add flexibility to the cost structure these are things that are very compelling and if we do see a slowdown or we do see a brexit there s as much if not more opportunity for that to actually help our business than to hurt it puneet jain j p morgan analyst understood thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thank you operator thank you our next question comes from vincent colicchio with barrington research your line is now open vincent colicchio barrington research analyst yeah just one for me what needs to happen to hit the high end of your expectations for the year david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations i think a couple of things vince we certainly need short term revenues to be sizable in the fourth quarter that would help us get there we need our existing client relationships to expand and we certainly have a healthy pipeline that can do that but again don t control the timing i think we d love to add a new client or two but given that we re in the middle of january here by the time we sign a deal and ramp a deal it s not going to have much of an impact on the quarter so the two biggest things that could help us get to the high end of the guidance or above for this fiscal year would be the short term less visible revenues as well as expansion of existing relationships vincent colicchio barrington research analyst fair enough thanks guys nice quarter david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks vince keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you

grew 12 versus the third quarter of last year to 0 73 per share in addition the company posted its highest quarter ever in terms of cash from operations sanjay will discuss the details of our third quarter financial performance in his prepared remarks this quarter i would like to highlight some of the innovative domain led solutions we have co created with our clients over the past few quarters these examples demonstrate our ability to combine deep vertical knowledge high end analytics process expertise and technology to help our clients improve their competitive positioning the first solution i would like to discuss is a state of the art offering in the insurance space wns has developed the capability to assess challenging claims such as rooftop damages by using images captured through drone technology wns takes these drone images and uses advanced analytics and machine learning to assess damage and the associated claim this approach enables our insurance partners to automate damage assessments mitigate risk to employees and reduce cost a second solution in the insurance space is the digital claims notification application which can be used by policy holders brokers and third party administration agents to register and self serve their claims end to end with minimal or no human intervention the app is available on all smartphones handheld devices and desktops and is currently offered for both motor vehicle and home policies this application delivers a seamless experience to end customers enabling them to monitor the status of a claim on a real time basis in the healthcare space wns healthhelp has created a new capability which addresses the management of orthopedic interventions for knee hip shoulder and spine issues advertisement advertisement leveraging a newly developed process workflow and a patent pending clinical rules engine developed in cooperation with university affiliated physicians we are able to deliver significant savings to our clients while improving patient outcomes by reducing the amount of surgical intervention required and increasing the appropriate use of clinically correct evidence based treatment and finally for the energy and utilities vertical we have created a voice assisted solution utilizing amazon alexa to help manage workflows and end to end customer queries including the submission of meter readings payments account information and other faqs this innovation has significantly reduced call volume and emails lowered averaging handling time streamlined query hand off and improved customer satisfaction while this is currently deployed in the utility space we are working to customize the solution for other verticals i would also like to spend a little time on today s call discussing global business volatility and uncertainty and its impacts on wns and our clients as we have discussed on previous calls our clients have been dealing with a massive amount of business disruption associated with digital requirements regulatory changes technology transformation and the need to leverage analytics our customers understand that if they are not able to address these challenges and improve the end customer experience they will lose competitive positioning and market share additionally in my conversations with clients over the past few months it has become clear they are also concerned about global political instability access to talent and the possibility of a macro economic slowdown with this in mind they must find the time resources and funds to support their transformational business initiatives to date we have not seen any impact to our business from these global risks and while there is a possibility that some clients could slow decision making for a period of time we believe that many clients committed to process outsourcing will continue to move forward with their strategic initiatives and may in fact accelerate plans to leverage lower cost and operating flexibility advertisement advertisement our capability to co create solutions with our clients tailored to their unique business requirements enables them to simultaneously reduce cost manage disruption digitize processes leverage a global talent pool improve the end customer experience and outperform in their respective industries in short an increasingly complex business environment continues to translate into healthy demand for strategic bpm initiatives we believe wns remains well positioned for success in this market based on our strong capabilities and ongoing investments in deep domain expertise technology and automation advanced analytics and process knowledge our approach is resonating well with both existing and prospective clients and our financial performance continues to validate our ability to execute we will continue to target industry leading performance and creating long term value for all of our key stakeholders i would now like to turn the call over to sanjay puria our cfo to further discuss our results and guidance sanjay advertisement advertisement sanjay puria chief financial officer thank you keshav with respect to our third quarter financials net revenue came in at 195 9 million up 5 8 from 185 2 million posted in the same quarter of last year and up 9 1 on a constant currency basis by vertical revenue growth was broad based with the shipping and logistics healthcare and insurance verticals each growing more than 14 year over year with respect to our service offerings revenue growth versus the prior year was driven by strength in industry specific bpm auto claims and finance and accounting sequentially net revenue increased by 0 2 on a reported basis and 0 1 constant currency quarter over quarter revenue growth with new and existing clients was largely offset by expected seasonality in our travel business in the third quarter wns recorded approximately 2 million of short term revenue which is not forecasted in quarter four this amount is the same as reported last quarter adjusted operating margin in quarter three was 23 as compared to 19 9 reported in the same quarter of fiscal 2018 and 21 last quarter on a year over year basis adjusted operating margin increased as a result of improved productivity currency movements net of hedging and operating leverage on higher volumes these benefits more than offset the impact of our annual wage increases advertisement advertisement sequentially adjusted operating margin increased as a result of improved productivity and favorable currency movements net of hedging the company s net other income expense was 2 8 million in the third quarter up from 1 5 million reported in quarter three of fiscal 2018 and up from 2 2 million last quarter year over year favorability was a result of higher interest income driven by better rates on our liquid mutual funds and lower interest expense resulting from scheduled debt payments sequentially interest income was up as a result of higher cash balances a slightly higher effective interest rate and onetime other income of 0 3 million wns effective tax rate for quarter three came in at 20 7 up from 10 8 last year and down from 21 8 last quarter last year in quarter three wns had a 5 2 million favorable net tax adjustments associated with provisions for the 2017 us tax reform bill this quarter the impact of the us tax reform bill was finalized and wns recorded an additional tax benefit of 0 4 million other changes in the quarterly tax rate are primarily due to the mix of work delivered from tax incentive facilities and the mix of profits between geographies for fiscal quarter four we expect our effective corporate tax rate to be approximately 22 and going forward in the 22 to 23 range the company s adjusted net income for quarter three was 38 million compared with 34 2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2018 and 33 7 million last quarter adjusted diluted earnings was 0 73 per share in quarter three versus 0 66 in the third quarter of last year and 0 65 last quarter this represents growth in eps of 11 8 year over year and 13 sequentially advertisement advertisement as of december 31 2018

committed project ramps in our press release issued earlier today wns provided updated full year guidance for fiscal 2019 based on the company s current visibility levels we expect net revenue to be in the range of 787 million to 799 million representing year over year revenue growth of 6 to 8 revenue guidance assumes an average british pound to us dollar exchange rate of 1 27 for the remainder of fiscal 2019 excluding exchange rate impacts revenue guidance represents constant currency growth of 9 to 11 all of which is organic we currently have over 99 visibility to the midpoint of the revenue range consistent with january guidance in prior years adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 137 million to 141 million based on a inr70 to us dollar exchange rate for the remainder of fiscal 2019 this implies adjusted eps of 2 62 to 2 70 assuming a diluted share count of approximately 52 2 million shares with respect to capital expenditures wns currently expects our requirements for fiscal 2019 to be up to 35 million we ll now open the call for questions operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from korey marcello with deutsche bank your line is now open korey marcello deutsche bank analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my question i guess i just wanted to start out on the organic growth you know it remains really strong in recent quarters but it has moderated and even just looking at some of the short term revenues and timing and stuff is there anything else to kind of call out there and then i guess going forward as you kind of look at the demand environment in the pipeline currently should we expect the company to kind of maintain technical difficulty growth rates or is there potential for reacceleration from some of the larger deals ramping and things of that nature keshav murugesh group chief executive officer sure let me address that so i think the first thing i want to mention is that i m very comfortable with the state of our pipeline it continues to be very solid we re seeing larger deals more transformational deals in the pipeline and also being converted more importantly we re seeing these deals across all our core verticals horizontals and geographies in many cases with the investments we ve now made around technology we re seeing a lot of the deals now being technology transformation led along with a very strong finance and accounting and analytics kind of flavor so really broad based and across you know all areas i must say that at this point in time the deal position is stronger than the same time last year so while at this point in time we may have signed a fewer logos with you must realize they are all with higher acv and just to give you a statistic at this point in time it is 26 higher acv than this time last year so overall the metrics are actually tracking very well deal flow tracking very well client interactions going very well but finally we are never in control of timing timing finally becomes a factor that is controlled by the client having said that as i just mentioned in my prepared remarks i actually think that the demand environment is very strong and the potential for us to continue to do extremely well in this environment is very good david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations and i would just add to that korey in terms of kind of the organic constant currency growth rate that we ve been posting obviously we had a couple of quarters last year that were extremely strong and we knew coming into this year that the comparatives from our year over year basis were going to be much tougher in the back half of the year and i think you re seeing a little bit of that in terms of what s showing up with the slow growth rate but the reality is like you mentioned you know when you look at the known headwinds walking into this year which were 9 and back half loaded and you look at the fact that we ve been able to generate about 1 5 less on a year to date basis in terms of kind of the short term less visible revenues i think that really goes a long way to explain why the growth rate in the back half of this year while very very strong overall is a little bit slower than it s been in the last three four quarters korey marcello deutsche bank analyst great thanks guys and then i guess as a quick follow up i guess on the margin side those tend to be just tracking really nicely recently really above the 20 guidance that you guys talked about for 2019 or fiscal year 19 and even above the kind of high teens over the mid term any kind of update there for the year on where you expect margins to fall and any reason why you would expect these margins to kind of remain elevated over the next few quarters thanks sanjay puria chief financial officer yeah you know so for specifically for quarter three the margin was little on the higher side it was driven by a couple of factors which was currency favorability as well as the non recurring revenue of 2 million where majority of it fall to the bottom as well as a better performance from a productivity perspective having said that as we saw the exceptional quarter and it s not sustainable at this level but directionally we believe that margin approximately should be around 20 which is a very healthy margin as well as on quarter four as specifically as earlier as we ve mentioned that there was certain hiring in the infrastructure which was expected got pushed to quarter four and accordingly where guidance for quarter four is not hidden but we believe and expect margin to be in the range of 20 for quarter four as well as going forward korey marcello deutsche bank analyst thanks guys keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thanks korey operator our next question comes from mayank tandon with needham your line is now open kyle peterson needham company analyst hey good morning this is actually kyle peterson on for mayank today just want to touch a little bit on some of the vertical demand particularly i would know utilities has been a little bumpy i think you guys have had some project transitions in that space but just want to see kind of how is the core demand in that segment and just want to see if you have any visibility on when some of these transitions could start to level off a bit david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure let me take that kyle you know you are 100 correct the challenges that we ve had this year in the utility space were known coming into the year it s largely around a couple of clients where we knew one had a volume challenge and the other had a process consolidation challenge so the headwinds that we re seeing in the utilities space were known walking into the year we re probably getting if i got another quarter of headwind in that space so i do think we should have a pretty clean slate as we walk into fiscal 20 to be able to post growth within the utility and energy space that is more in line with company growth rate kyle peterson needham company analyst great and then if i could just follow up little bit on m a just want to see if you guys could add any color on what the pipeline is in that space if there s anything in particular you guys would be looking for in terms of whether it s vertical specialty technical capability or something like that keshav murugesh group chief executive officer sure i ll take that so you know once again i must mention that you know we will continue to be very opportunistic in terms of m a we believe m a you know particularly around capability led kind of growth is a good use of our cash we have a strong pipeline at this point in time is across some very core areas that we had we ve been identifying over the past few quarters we re looking at assets which are capability led and at the same time accretive to overall numbers of wns for us i think the focus is right time right size and fit and right the value that we want to make sure that it only adds to the overall momentum of the company i just want to remind you that at this point we over the past couple ph of years we have done some really nice tuck in kind of acquisitions and the approach that we have followed and the discipline that we have followed has been very successful and that s how we re going to see this play out so it ll be much more focused on capability led acquisition if something comes up which is transformational and is attractive we ll still look at it as well sanjay puria chief financial officer and maybe just to add to that you know as part of our capital allocation program m a based on the capability led as keshav mentioned is going to be one of the key focus kyle peterson needham company analyst understood thanks guys nice quarter keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you kyle operator thank you our next question comes from maggie nolan with william blair your line is now open maggie nolan william blair analyst good morning and good evening you mentioned deals with higher acv and obviously the nature of these deals and the nature of your work that you re doing is changing to some degree so does this also change the normal timeline we should expect in terms of when a new client may ramp up and peak in terms of revenue contribution david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure let me take that maggie i think you re 100 correct anytime we re dealing with the new customer and a scope that is transformational technology led in nature we do anticipate that the sales cycle will be longer and we saw that with both of the large deals that we ve added in q4 of last year and q1 of this year and that you know the ramp of those projects can be a little bit slower i think the biggest issue with the large transformational deal isn t necessarily the sales cycle changing but the fact that the timing of when they re going to start is extremely uncertain in fact the one that we find in the shipping and logistics area started a little bit early the one that we have signed in the insurance space we have been working on for a little over two years so it is a little bit more volatile in terms of starts and stops and we certainly have to watch how that plays out we want to make sure that when we look at the overall pipeline while we do have more large transformation led types of deals that we re augmenting those that pipeline with some of the smaller more short term deals as well but you know overall the pipeline is healthy it s robust but absolutely if we ve got by and large a higher percentage of that pipeline coming from large transformational deals i would expect to have a longer sales cycle on that type of work maggie nolan william blair analyst okay thanks understood and then given the macro environment and some of the commentary we ve been hearing about a tightening labor market what are we seeing in terms of wage increases and how does that compare with kind of typical wage increases are there any changes there to note david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah no changes to note i think we have seen some redistribution of where the wage increases are coming from across the portfolio but overall i think the expectation as we head into fiscal 20 is that weight wage increases and the overall impacts of the p l are going to be similar to what we ve seen in the past and that s incorporated in sanjay s comments about having a 20 operating margin going forward maggie nolan william blair analyst great thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you maggie operator thank you our next question comes from the line of moshe katri with wedbush your line is now open moshe katri wedbush securities analyst thanks good quarter can you talk a bit about the puts and takes in terms of what drove margins this quarter maybe you can go into some of the different variable and how these actually impacted margin including fx and then you know the acv number that was up 26 i m sorry is that a booking number or is that the backlog or the pipeline some color there will be helpful thanks david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so first i guess to your first the first part of your question moshe when you re talking about the operating margin are you looking at it from a sequential perspective or from a year over year perspective moshe katri wedbush securities analyst year over year david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations okay so on a year over year basis if you look at our adjusted operating margin we re up about 300 basis points if you were going to break that down i would break it into about 50 related to fx and 50 related to operations so i think you re looking at a nice healthy balance that s come from currency largely driven by depreciation in the indian rupee as well as favorability in terms of productivity and higher volumes that are driving leverage in our business so a nice mix in terms of what s contributed on a year over year basis when you look at the acv figure being up 26 on average year over year that is actually new client addition so that is sold business so from that perspective we re afraid to both the combination of backlog as well as booked based on when the deal was signed and when the deal started to generate revenue moshe katri wedbush securities analyst understood and then the commentary on 16 new renewals this year i mean year to date i think is that an the usual number maybe you can give us kind of a color in terms of relativity ph how does that compare to prior years and then looking into the next fiscal year is there anything unusual in terms of the renewal rates as well thanks david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so year to date we ve had we ve expanded 35 relationships and renewed 48 if you look at where we were in the same place of last year we were at 31 expansions and 40 renewals so i think we re tracking to actually be ahead of where we were last year in terms of expansion of existing relationship and renewals of renewals or extensions of contracts nothing at this point in time that s unusual i think as we head into fiscal 20 so good solid momentum in terms of our ability to cross sell and upsell our existing customer base moshe katri wedbush securities analyst great thanks for the color operator thank you our next question comes from joseph vafi with loop capital your line is now open joseph vafi loop capital markets analyst hey guys good results good morning good evening i was wondering i think i heard sanjay say that healthcare grew about 14 in the quarter i know that keshav mentioned the healthhelp innovation interventional solution in his prepared remarks just wondering if i can get a little more color on what s driving growth in healthcare and do you think if that s sustainable at this point then i have a follow up david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure let me take that joe i think you know we ve made some strategic investments over the last couple of years in the healthcare space specifically the acquisitions of healthhelp and value edge i think we re seeing the results of those acquisitions in terms of both the ability to expand the relationships that they had brought to the table as well as the ability to add new relationships to the portfolio the growth has been really solid we ve been adding new service offerings primarily in the pharmaceutical and in the healthcare payer space we certainly feel very very good about what we ve been able to do here our ability to add new logos that have the ability to expand over time so certainly view healthcare as a driver of growth and hopefully growing above company average going forward sanjay puria chief financial officer yeah and maybe just to add that you know with those acquisitions and the logos what we have we also had a good opportunity to cross sell lot of the existing services which is around finance and accounting and research and analytics to all those logos and we feel very positive about that joseph vafi loop capital markets analyst great that s helpful and then you know as we move forward and perhaps more deals are becoming more technology driven or led do we or how do we look at that technology investment in the company how much is that kind of goes into like an r d line versus perhaps technology work that is passed on to the customer in terms of overall pricing on deals thanks david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so let me take that joe i think you know in general when you look at our investments in r d sort of developing certain product capabilities the reality is the majority of the r d that we have as an organization is in evaluating product and then understanding how we can best incorporate those products and those solutions into our existing services and offerings so you know the r d is something that by and large gets expense now the reality is that everything that we do for our clients is customized so to the extent that either the software or the process needs to be customized refined changed for the specific customers that s something that s absorbed within the specific deal and taken to consideration when we look at the pricing in the margins on those activities joseph vafi loop capital markets analyst thanks so much david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks joe operator thank you our next question comes from joseph foresi with cantor fitzgerald your line is now open drew kootman cantor fitzgerald analyst good morning this is drew kootman on for joe i was wondering if you guys could touch on the potential areas for out performance as you look into the end of the year and fiscal 20 is that a new client signed existing client base acquisitions just wondering what will drive growth to above average in the future keshav murugesh group chief executive officer good question so i think from my perspective i m quite comfortable with the opportunities that are available in the existing pipeline for a new client itself and therefore how quickly some of those deals will actually convert into actual signings will actually determine how much of time we have across the rest of this year and maybe the next year to actually reap the benefits of that signings so i would say it s more working closely with the customer and really helping tipping them across that finish line so to speak more importantly i will say that the pipeline of growth that we are also seeing from existing clients that we signed say in the last in this year and maybe in the close of last year and the way they have started to ramp has significant potential for fiscal 2020 obviously and again in terms of how quickly some of those programs actually take off will determine where we actually end up in terms of overall numbers the most important thing i want to say here is wns sales people are really focused on working with the clients in terms of just helping them to appreciate the kind of offerings we have and then help them to take those decisions the company has made all the right investments in terms of sales in terms of domain in terms of technology analytics all the horizontal kind of services we have done some really strong acquisitions that are leading the way in terms of delivering on the pipeline and i would say that organic growth from a hunting point of view and a farming point of view and maybe a little bit of capability led m a will actually help take that number beyond the general expected number in the long term drew kootman cantor fitzgerald analyst great and just a quick follow up which regions do you expect to see the most strength heading into fiscal year 20 keshav murugesh group chief executive officer well at this point in time like i said growth is expected to be broad based so first and foremost i must again say that the pipeline that we have going into next year is strong across all the key geographies as well as offering areas having said that europe and uk actually led in terms of actual conversions during this year but that doesn t mean that some of the deals inside north america where decisions are now imminent will not actually you know change that kind of metric for next year so what we are focused on is just making sure that we have the right pipeline we have the right impact across that pipeline and we are focused on really taking it across every one of our core horizontal and vertical areas drew kootman cantor fitzgerald analyst thank you keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from bryan bergin with cowen your line is now open bryan bergin cowen company analyst hi thank you i wanted to ask on the fiscal 19 revenue growth range 200 basis points here i think it s about two times what typically it is at this point in time anything to call out there given your typical 99 visibility to midpoint david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah i think you know what we wanted to make sure that we were doing here bryan in terms of the guidance is making sure that people are still aware that we do have upside walking into the fourth quarter here obviously with over 99 visibility for the midpoint that the midpoint short of something going wrong at this point in time is pretty well locked in given that we don t have any short term revenues in our numbers for q4 given that we do have some pipeline opportunities here that we re working on one of the things we wanted to make sure was that we left some of the upside in the guidance for people to see here and obviously given the way we guide and given that the midpoint is visibility based we need to add the same downside to the upside to make that a true midpoint so becomes a math exercise after that but essentially we feel really good about our ability to meet the midpoint obviously given where our visibility is here if we wanted to make sure that we left a little bit of upside here bryan bergin cowen company analyst okay understood and then the acv figure you provided is encouraging i wanted to ask on the margin can you talk about the margin profile the new deal is coming through relative to your existing business are you getting are these tech led deals driving a structural change for you and then just of those new client additions i think you said four the industries that those are in david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so a couple of different things i think when you look at the deals we re signing and the structural margin portfolio we believe over the next three to five years these deals have the potential to be margin accretive to the company overall obviously if they re technology led if they re strategic to the customer then we do have the ability to generate better margins on that you know part of that transition though is making sure that clients continue to move down a path and transition the services from fte based to transaction and outcome based where we have that margin leverage so that decision to move in many cases is outside of our control but certainly we see that opportunity in terms of the client adds this last quarter we as keshav and sanjay mentioned we added four new clients three of them were actually in the retail cpg space and the other was in the travel space bryan bergin cowen company analyst okay thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks bryan operator thank you our next question comes from rick eskelsen with wells fargo your line is now open rick eskelsen wells fargo analyst good morning thank you for taking my question keshav in your prepared remarks you did mentioned that clients are asking about access to talent i wonder if you can just sort of talk about that as it relates to your business we ve heard from some of the larger it companies that some of the access to digital talent is harder but i know obviously the bpm industry is different on the talent side so maybe if you could talk about talent access keshav murugesh group chief executive officer sure i think with all the macroeconomic uncertainty that they are faced with i think what clients are really looking at doing is doubling down on making sure that they understand their markets wells what their customers want and really coming up with the right set of offerings and programs for their end customers therefore from their perspective what they re looking to do is really work with strong partners like wns who act as an extension of their enterprise and so when i spoke about talent there you know clearly what they re saying is we have enough on our plates in terms of just understanding where our business is headed and how to really stave off disruption in our business and therefore we have great appreciation of the kind of programs that you have as a company in terms of people process technology and talent and therefore are really encouraged by the kind of investments we re making around talent whether it is around skill building technical difficulty operator i m sorry ladies and gentlemen it looks like we had a disconnection again keshav murugesh group chief executive officer yeah so operator inaudible to continue david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure and i can kind of take the question so do you have a follow up to that because i can kind of take it from here rick eskelsen wells fargo analyst yeah i guess just to follow up david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations probably wait for a minute to be taken ph rick eskelsen wells fargo analyst the follow up was just on the travel and leisure side i think i heard in the prepared remarks that it was normal seasonality it looked a little bit bigger than normal so just curious you could kind of talk about that vertical in specific david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah similar things so the travel vertical we obviously from a sequential perspective had a seasonality issue and it s something that we see in our fiscal third quarter and the calendar fourth quarter of every year in addition to that we did have a ramp down in our business that we knew about walking into the year so we talked again about the 9 headwinds walking into the year the deals that we saw that we re going to create that headwind for us in the back half of the year were in the travel space in the utility space and then one in the auto claim space as well so this was something that was not a surprise to us actually it was something that we did proactively to help mitigate margins for us and again i think we feel pretty good about the travel space overall and where we sit but right now the optics are a little bit soft in that space on a year to date basis it s certainly less so rick eskelsen wells fargo analyst great thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks rick operator thank you and we do have them reconnected back again with us our next question is going to come from the line of frank atkins with suntrust your line is now open frank atkins suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks for taking my questions first question i wanted to ask a little bit about the top client any color on the dynamics there seen some nice movement there keshav murugesh group chief executive officer yeah i think what s really coming together is some of the effort that we ve been making over the past few quarters that we ve been talking about i think finally the client has actually started making good progress on some very core kind of programs that they were talking about for quite a while and having said that i must say that we continue to have some really compelling discussions with that client on a few more initiatives which may take a little longer but we re quite confident with the relationship that we have established and the impact that we have created for them we will benefit over the medium term david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations i think the other thing that s important to note frank is that over the last four quarters we have had some back and forth in terms of number one and number two client at wns so the number one client in any given quarter over the last four quarters has not necessarily been the same quarter to quarter and that s also important to understand frank atkins suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay thank you very much that s helpful and then secondly i wanted to ask about revenue by horizontal if we look at industry specific and analytics can you talk about some of the drivers and kind of key components of growth going forward and where could they be as a percentage or kind of revenue mix longer term david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure let me take that so when we look at the industry specific obviously the growth in that segment this year has been extremely strong we re up year to date i believe the industry specific revenues are up 21 part of what we see in that space is that a lot of the things that our customers are asking for from a demand perspective are domain led and specific to their verticals or sub verticals so we believe that industry specific will continue to be extremely strong for us it s where we ve seen the large transformational deals tend to be focused analytics should also be a driver for us along with f a these are ways that we re able to connect with our customers to generate enhanced business value and we do expect both of those segments to be strong going forward as well so if you were to kind of ask where the pipeline and where the growth has come from and what s representative of kind of where we see the industry it s strategic f a it s high end analytics and it s industry specific bpo frank atkins suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay great thank you very much operator thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks frank operator our next question comes from the line of ashwin shirvaikar with citi your line is now open ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst thank you hey guys good job here congratulations david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks ashwin ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst my first question is on automation some of our checks show that new techniques like rpa are kind of becoming business as usual is this something that clients incorporate as a matter of course so would you tend to agree with that and as that becomes more normal is it possible to get metrics around automation number of bots penetration and things like that keshav murugesh group chief executive officer yes so let me just start with the answer i m sure dave and ron will have more to contribute but i think you know the first thing that we all must appreciate and understand is that every business today in the world is a tech business and you know what we may talk about some of these tools and efficiency gain kind of programs whether it s rpa machine learning ai things like that to just make life easier in terms of delivering a solution to our clients the reality is as we keep getting better and better at it we will just keep we ll keep making smoother this smoother delivery and we ll keep moving to newer and newer kind of designs newer technologies and newer ways of delivering the model so first thing i would say is that you know clients invest in technology platforms and things like that in order to get their model more efficient we invest in technology in order to deliver in a much more streamlined and seamless manner make sure that we can reduce our cost with a much more sticky business as well as create a business model for our clients which is derisked dramatically from a operational efficiency point of view at the same time we also had different partners in order to make sure that we are delivering the roi that our clients need so the reality is every one of these areas will continue to evolve and none of these areas will remain as a stand alone standard for the future as well so ron and dave if you want anything more please go ahead ron gillette chief operating officer yeah so i would agree with what keshav saying that automation is going to continue to be a theme with all of our clients tech enablement a theme there i would say that the number of bots deployed and trying to put metrics around that it doesn t really tell the story because it s more of what clients needs are and the state of their existing platforms and systems in most cases but that s just also one part of the story a lot of what we re doing today is innovative or transformational tools or platforms that we re creating and deploying to clients as well as looking at their existing systems and helping them reengineer them so that they can be more efficient and deliver the processes that we see and advocate to them as being best in class that they should adopt david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations and i would just add one other thing to what both keshav and ron said when you look at deployment of technology i think you can bifurcate to some extent that deployment of technology into new clients new relationships as well as the deployment of technology into existing clients now clearly as we ve spoken about the larger more transformational deals that we re signing and we re starting to ramp on we re seeing technology it s part of the initial solution and it s part of what we re going into the client with on the first instance the separate issue is how quickly existing clients allow the deployment of technology into their existing environments and part of both of these ash when that that s always important to remember is we re ready to deploy technology we have the tools we have the assets whether they re our own proprietary technology or third party partnerships we certainly know what they are and how to use them the biggest challenge that we tend to see is the amount of behavior change required on the client end that would enable us to leverage that technology so while we re aggressively pushing for deployment we still have a lot of clients that push back at this and say you know what the process changed the ownership and accountability that comes with that deployment of technology is not something that we re organizationally ready for yet so i think while it is as part of every discussion that we re having today the pace at which that technology gets deployed is going to be client specific keshav murugesh group chief executive officer yeah i think that that s important enough ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst got it appreciate it keshav murugesh group chief executive officer sorry ashwin it s just it s such an important question because it s not something that will disappear with this quarter it s something that we think will you know continue to gain momentum over the next few quarters as well you know wns position is that technology is just one of the inputs that go into delivering a great solution to its clients you know just rushing behind technology alone is not going to solve the business problem so i think along with that just being agile making sure there s a right business case behind it and finally the most important aspect which is ensuring there is end customer impact along with analytics being embedded into it is what we focus on delivering to our clients and that s what s really driving our business momentum ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst got it appreciate those insight you know the statement about adding seat capacity in anticipation of 2020 demand i might have missed it but did you also talk about the cadence of that addition of seat capacity and if you could also provide then clarity on the revenue per seat metric that did go down this quarter is that sort of the only part of those seat additions or what is something else going on there david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah so couple of things ashwin i think in sanjay s prepared remarks we re actually looking at the potential to add almost a 1 000 seats here in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the demand that we ve already signed here so part of what we re seeing and you saw it in the first quarter you saw it if you can see it again here in q4 is that when we do add seat capacity we tend to add it in a step function so you can t add 50 seats when you add 50 heads you add the seats and then you fill them you add the seats and then you fill them so q4 for us is going to be a step function an increase in seat capacity we re certainly not going to be increasing the headcount at the same pace that we re increasing infrastructure in the fourth quarter so from that perspective you will see the seat utilization metric come down but this is this is part of what we need to do to continue to prepare ourselves for the growth going forward in terms of the revenue per employee metric you re going to see swings quarter to quarter part of what happens if you just take the simple math and divide revenue by average number of heads as you don t get the currency impact the expectation for this full year that s implied in our guidance is that revenue per employee this year should be up a little bit over 2 so we are driving that productivity it is showing up net of the seat utilization metric in terms of higher margins for us this year the implied guidance for this fiscal year is a 21 operating margin so we are certainly making sure that we re focused on the seat utilization metric the revenue per employee metric but also need to understand quarter to quarter based on hiring cycles and infrastructure builds that those numbers can move ashwin shirvaikar citigroup analyst got it now that closes the gap i was looking for thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks ashwin operator thank you our next question comes from dave koning with baird your line is now open david koning robert w baird co analyst yeah hey guys i guess a couple of things just on the different revenue metrics the aviva contract they re the biggest client was up 20 year over year which is better than it s been in a while is there anything one off happening at the biggest client or is there something new with the revenue or the services you re selling that s going to sustainably kind of keep it at a pretty high level sanjay puria chief financial officer yeah so you know aviva perspective it s a mix of both things what we are also seeing some of the traction from a growth perspective and the expansion in some new areas that s driving growth it s also part of a non recurring revenue over there because of the some of the gain share model and the productivity what we are able to drive at the client end so it s a mix of both and having said that we are in discussion in various multiple new areas from a growth perspective again it s just a it s a matter of a time from a closure perspective david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah i think aviva continues to present a couple of opportunities for us dave as we spoke about in the past we wanted to continue to move into new areas and sell services the second is the integration of some of the acquisitions that they ve done over the past couple of years but we also understand that historically there has been some pressure there in terms of the productivity commitments that we have for aviva and the currency so a couple of things that are fighting against us but there remains some opportunities for us to continue to move that client relationship forward david koning robert w baird co analyst okay great and then the other thing i know travel historically we can see in the numbers it does have a little bit of negative seasonality in fiscal q3 no question but this quarter was a little worse maybe a few million worse than normal it seems to decline by 13 sequentially often it will be down modestly to kind of in this range but this was a little bigger anything to call out one time that it kind of bounces back in q4 sanjay puria chief financial officer so you know your observation is right that you know other than travel seasonality you know at the start of the year when we spoke about some of the known ramp down issues for the year it was also into the travel vertical but it was all known over there and it was around some specific client but there s a vertical the pipeline seems to be strong and great opportunity ahead so we expect it to because that s one of the travel it s one of the strongest vertical along with the insurance from a company perspective and we expect it to back on the track from a growth perspective david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations yeah so this was part of the 9 headwind we knew about walking into the year dave david koning robert w baird co analyst yeah gotcha gotcha okay and then and then just the last quick thing so the interest other line you called out i think a few 100 000 or so of kind of onetime benefit but that should continue we shouldn t expect that to continue that dramatically different than 2 5 million 2 6 million per quarter or something like that right david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations no i think as long as the net cash balances remain the same we should be fine dave the one caveat i would say is that if we do get into healthy share repurchase numbers or we do get into an acquisition that would affect our cash balances then you could see that number change but overall yes i think in terms of our ability to continue to generate that in the business as usual environment yes correct david koning robert w baird co analyst okay and congrats you guys just keep crushing that thanks guys david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks dave keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from puneet jain with j p morgan your line is now open puneet jain j p morgan analyst yeah hi similar question to the one asked by ashwin before so are you seeing different automation or rpa adoption rates across horizontal and industry specific workflows and broadly how much of business can be automated and what s impact on deal contract value when you automate a workflow david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations sure so let me take that puneet i mean i think we kind of gone to the question of you know look we are certainly deploying technology where we can we re deploying technology where our clients will allow it we do see it more as a function of the specific client relationship than to say we re automating this service or that service so we have for example industry specific work that s done you know 90 labor 10 technology we have industry specific work that s done 50 50 depending on what it is so i think part of it is understanding that what we re really doing and i think keshav spoke to this is leveraging technology that help us solve client problems but the portfolio and the overall mix is getting more technology enabled over time both from the combination of new clients willing to start a relationship with components of technology as well as existing clients over time migrating to allow us and enable us to leverage technology in terms of how we deliver what we re doing for them so look if everything we were doing we re in a transaction or an outcome based model we would be aggressively deploying technology but the reality is most of the things that we do 65 of our work is still fte based and in those relationships the client in many cases controls how we do the work where we do the work and with whom we do the work so a lot of this is not in our control and we re certainly aggressively pushing it we sell it on the front as an opportunity we tell clients that we re willing to migrate to these types of models and with technology enabled and whatever they re ready but we don t control the pace the same way we don t control the pace of when new deals start and when they ramp we don t control the pace of when clients move toward transaction and outcome based services and the technology enablement of those services puneet jain j p morgan analyst understood i mean and is there a way to size how much of business can be subject to technology deployment over the long term like i know like the use cases could change over time but based on what we know today based on technology environment today is there a way to size the impact of automation how much penetration potential there is david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations i mean it s keshav murugesh group chief executive officer i ll say that at this point in time what we re doing is we re appreciating the fact that the change that you re seeing around technology adoption is really still evolutionary it s just helping to create new opportunity for us from our perspective we are clearly focused on continuing to move up the value chain so while automation is something that is a very important part of the input that we bring to the table we had never taking away from the fact that human intelligence and human kind of intervention is going to be diluted so in every one of the areas we are focused on whether it is the vertical areas or horizontal areas or even the finance and accounting areas we re constantly really focusing on reskilling for digital and making sure that a unique combination of people technology and process comes together to drive outcomes for our clients and while doing that we will make the best use of automation in order to ensure our people are leveraged in the best possible manner so very difficult for us to size how much of it will actually get replaced by automation at this point in time all i will say is that the market out there is very strong for us the demand is very strong and it s going to take quite some time before which automation alone will deliver the kind of solutions that wns can deliver david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations and other thing just to add to that what keshav said puneet we ve seen over the last five six seven years that the market has expanded to the possible if you will i mean what is outsourceable today is dramatically different than what clients thought was outsourceable 10 years ago and i think you re going to see the same thing with technology and automation what is automatable today is going to be dramatically different look rpa is not new rpa has been around for a long long time it s just getting enough attention and enough momentum today to where people are getting comfortable to use it and that s again the same thing when our clients going to be comfortable allowing deployment and leverage of some of the technology and solutions are there when are they going to be vetted and market centric enough that clients will allow us to do that so that s something we don t have an answer for it s something we don t have control over but it is something we re out in front of and we re comfortable that we ll be able to help our clients get there when they want to puneet jain j p morgan analyst got it and let me also quickly ask the customary question on brexit with all the uncertainty in the uk and broadly like potential for macroeconomic slowdown can your backlog and pipeline support continued high single to low double digit growth over the near term if some of those risks materialize keshav murugesh group chief executive officer so puneet i must again mention that at this point in time brexit has generally been a non event for us some of the things that we have been reading about and the impacts that we re seeing whether it s on currency whether it s on demand all of it actually has been playing out very slowly over the past few quarters and i guess for most people believe even what happened yesterday or day before didn t really come out as a surprise because the market had already message written ph i just want to mention that for our business model brexit is just another form of disruption right and therefore while it may impact timelines in the short term the reality is our focus is to continue to make sure that we are being very partner like to our clients we re not seeing any let up in terms of the demand from clients who are supposedly actually impacted by this brexit and our conversations in terms of the impact that we can create for their businesses continues to be very positive puneet jain j p morgan analyst got it david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations and then i d just add to that i think just to add to that puneet whether it s brexit or whether it s the potential for a macro slowdown if you look at the value proposition for the services that we re delivering the value proposition doesn t change and i think it could be effectively argued that the value proposition in an environment where things are a little bit more challenging a little bit more complex a little bit more costly that the value proposition for process outsourcing actually increases our ability to execute and deliver on the disruption that they re dealing with in addition to the ability to save them money and add flexibility to the cost structure these are things that are very compelling and if we do see a slowdown or we do see a brexit there s as much if not more opportunity for that to actually help our business than to hurt it puneet jain j p morgan analyst understood thank you david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thank you operator thank you our next question comes from vincent colicchio with barrington research your line is now open vincent colicchio barrington research analyst yeah just one for me what needs to happen to hit the high end of your expectations for the year david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations i think a couple of things vince we certainly need short term revenues to be sizable in the fourth quarter that would help us get there we need our existing client relationships to expand and we certainly have a healthy pipeline that can do that but again don t control the timing i think we d love to add a new client or two but given that we re in the middle of january here by the time we sign a deal and ramp a deal it s not going to have much of an impact on the quarter so the two biggest things that could help us get to the high end of the guidance or above for this fiscal year would be the short term less visible revenues as well as expansion of existing relationships vincent colicchio barrington research analyst fair enough thanks guys nice quarter david mackey corporate senior vice president of finance and head of investor relations thanks vince keshav murugesh group chief executive officer thank you operator thank you at this time we have no further questions in the queue so this will conclude today s conference call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect everyone have a

by daniel lacalle argentina maintains a high country risk in fact it is currently the second highest in latin america and the third of the emerging countries if we include turkey what is the country risk it is the spread between the yield of the sovereign bond of a nation compared with the united states treasury bonds the lowest risk asset investors demand higher yielding bonds due to the risk of the issuer s economy to compensate for the currency and solvency risk argentina s country risk increased by 130 in 2018 due to delayed reforms constant devaluation and loss of foreign exchange reserves the country risk has fallen significantly from its high of 817 basis points to the current 706 however it remains the second highest in the region after venezuela the reasons why a rich and high potential country like argentina has a higher country risk than allegedly weaker developing countries are easy to explain the countries with the highest country risk are also those that have abused most of the financing of public spending by the central bank through the printing of currency argentina has a higher country risk than apparently more fragile economies due to the constant refusal on the part of the successive governments to adopt a prudent monetary policy and to defend the purchasing power of the currency when inflation rises and the currency is devalued due to this misguided monetary policy the purchasing power of that currency is destroyed and the country s investor security erodes risk increases because investors perceive that no relevant structural reforms are being carried out and this limits potential growth and increases the risk of inflation and default the default probability increases with the downward spiral of printing money to finance increasing public and extractive spending triggering inflation and raising taxes which leads to lower growth less investment and more displacement of the private sector that is the reason why countries with a relatively low debt to gdp ratio but huge monetary imbalances fail before countries with high debt to gdp but a prudent monetary policy that does not directly finance public spending it is not the same to create a transmission mechanism of monetary policy such as quantitative easing with all its flaws which curbs inflationary risk by generating firewalls in the transmission process because it is done through credit unlike directly prints money to finance current spending the second destroys the economy it is a direct transfer of wealth from the savers and salaries to the government and makes confidence in the currency disappear argentine citizens know this well country risk must be contained not only because it leads the state to finance itself at a higher cost and with less demand but because it drags the financing capacity of the real economy companies and families it is not just bad for public finances if yield soars in the asset that supposedly has less risk of the nation the sovereign bond it leads to a whole chain of negative impacts on the financing of the real economy the cost of financing of companies and families rises much more and credit dries up the only way that argentina will erase its unnecessarily high country risk is by cutting bloated public spending lowering taxes attracting investment and improving ease of doing business but more importantly it needs to stop financing public spending by printing pesos once and for all in 2018 argentina was among the four countries in the world with the highest inflation below venezuela south sudan and iran according to the international monetary fund argentina is also among the countries with the highest tax wedge in fact the highest total tax burden in the world according to the world economic forum the total tax rate absorbs all corporate profits in the index of economic freedom published by the heritage foundation argentina has improved but it continues to appear in one of the worst positions number 144 of a total of 180 countries we must emphasize that the nordic countries which are used constantly in television debates in argentina as an example are among the countries with the greatest economic freedom ranking between 12 denmark and 26 finland it is worth remembering this factor when talking about prosperity and redistribution there is no social policy if economic liberty and prosperity are not the primary objectives similarly in the doing business index which measures the ease of creating jobs and companies argentina appears in a slightly improved position with respect to 2017 but far below where it should be argentina occupies a very poor position 117 of 190 countries again the nordic countries rank between number 3 and 13 at the head of the table high inflation high taxes low economic freedom and very high burdens on investment four factors that worsened significantly in the cristina fern√£ ndez de kirchner tenure and that the macri administration has not done enough to improve only eliminating the unbridled printing of pesos from the central bank and the useless political spending financed with the rising money supply argentina would climb at least twenty positions in these indexes if the tax and bureaucratic burden were reduced to levels similar to those of the surrounding countries and the oecd average argentina would be as it deserves an international center of capital attraction and global investment and one of the countries with more solid growth only by cutting the impoverishing inflation the crazy printing of pesos and reducing taxation and bureaucracy argentina would climb to the top 50 in the aforementioned rankings quickly approaching chile and costa rica and shortening the enormous distance with france the united kingdom or the netherlands this would reduce the country risk to at least region average levels a public expenditure that already reaches more than 45 of gdp and denying the devastating effect of the predatory monetary policy lead argentina to constant and uninterrupted currency crises unbridled inflation and to discourage long term investment and prudent saving the imprudent use of the national currency as a subterfuge to cover enormous internal imbalances has only led to the fact that again it has lost 51 of its value in 2018 and that inflation continues to undermine the country s potential argentina has all the ingredients to be a global leading economy but the erroneous monetary policy the unbridled political spending and the extractive bureaucracy and taxation make the country a promise that always seems to be a disappointment because of internal factors disclosure no positions editor√¢ s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors
this article is more than 5 years old getty images when it comes to economic stimulus china is damned if it does and damned if it doesn t the market loves stimulus governments throwing money at infrastructure projects that require labor and steel and copper and cement or central banks propping up securities markets but when it comes to china that kind of stimulus is deemed unsustainable by xi jinping himself not only does it come with provincial governments funding businesses that lead to oversupply be it in housing or solar panels it also sends a signal to the market that china s economy is weaker that beijing is letting on china has been providing stimulus to the economy for months now the people s bank of china is buying stocks and allowing government banks to lend more money yet china s a shares are down again on thursday there s no signal of a trend upwards even though the a share market has outperformed the msci emerging markets and the s p 500 so far this month the x trackers china csi 300 ashr the biggest china a shares etf is up 5 52 year to date the s p 500 is up 4 43 markets moved higher today in hong kong because of vice premier liu he s visit to washington now being confirmed for january 30 and 31 but just two small and mid cap stocks made the market close lower shares of real estate developer jiayuan international plunged 81 on rumors that the company had missed a bond payment and would default jiayuan released a statement saying the rumors of pending default were false but this is exactly the kind of credit related hard landing case international investors are most wary about regardless of those concerns however china stimulus and an intervening central bank are seen as bullish for the country s stock market see china s central bank will prop up the stock market forbes 2019 bloomberg finance lp china keeps pumping out news that it s cutting taxes and lowering reserve requirements for banks as one investor put it rest assured the tax cut is not getting bigger with each pronouncement the current fiscal stimulus means china s central government deficit will go from 2 6 of gdp to 3 suggesting this is not your old great recession stimulus one thing stimulus means is fewer economic reforms or more reforms put on hold that doesn t mean policies for greater market access will die on the vine the trade war will keep prying those open like a hungry seastar clamping down on a clam but smaller issues such as tax collection and environmental regulations will likely be shelved china s real estate market which for ten years has been the second hottest story in china after the consumer story is not what it once was most of this is the government s doing xi has seen the ghost towns and not just in interior cities near mongolia but all along the yellow sea as well not far from downtown yantai a city of 7 million people provincial governments who often act like mini fiefdoms who may or may not listen to xi s warnings on debt rely on developers to buy land land sales account for at least 30 of their revenues with fewer buildings going up it is unlikely that provinces will extend tax cuts so it is unclear just how sexy these taxes are in china probably not too hot 2019 bloomberg finance lp credit growth remains the key says brian mccarthy founder of marcrolens a big picture investment research firm that s been particularly zeroed in on china without increasing the flow of credit to local governments there is no way to fund fiscal stimulus and no hope of turning around the real estate market that is so crucial to gdp growth and to local government finances he says unlike the u s china has more room to cut interest rates if the stimulus plans don t help the economy core inflation declined to 1 9 year over year in december from 2 2 in november the benchmark lending rate is around 4 35 china may not need to cut rates to spur growth if it returns to good old fashioned chinese style credit expansion xi might have to take one for the team longer term debt expansion could be a negative for china though the same can be said about the united states japan and much of western europe plans are already afoot to further expand the fiscal deficit and to implement additional off budget fiscal stimulus this year says jan dehn head of research for the ashmore group in london these and previously announced measures are likely to stabilize china growth in 2019
new york cnn business if there s a serious recession on the horizon the world s central banks may have trouble fighting it central banks took dramatic and unorthodox steps to prevent economic collapse during the financial crisis they slashed interest rates and in the years that followed spent trillions on bonds as part of an effort to spur growth one decade later global central banks are only starting to reverse those moves interest rates in developed economies remain incredibly low in some places they re even negative the federal reserve is unloading some of the bonds it bought but central banks in europe and japan have not yet done so the question now is whether central banks waited too long to raise rates to more normal levels leaving them unprepared for the next crisis if we have a recession i think it s going to be worse than normal said kenneth rogoff a professor at harvard university and former chief economist at the international monetary fund it will be more difficult to respond politics is also making life more complicated for central banks in countries like india and turkey they ve faced threats of political interference while president donald trump has repeatedly criticized the federal reserve another blown tire the outlook for the global economy has dimmed significantly in recent months as trade tensions caused growth to slow in countries including china and germany the international monetary fund and the world bank have cut their growth forecasts for 2019 and experts warn of more pain from us interest rate hikes trade conflicts and geopolitical risks such as brexit no one expected synchronized global growth to continue forever but actions taken by central banks over the past 10 years could limit their response to a sharp slowdown now think of a car traveling on a bumpy road with no spare tires you really don t want to have another blown tire said mohamed el erian the chief economic adviser at allianz azsey el erian said the federal reserve which raised interest rates four times in 2018 is in better shape than other leading central banks but its benchmark rate currently set between 2 25 and 2 5 remains historically low limiting the room it has to cut in order to spur growth even the fed has less flexibility than in the past he said the european central bank and the bank of japan are worse off the ecb s key lending rate is 0 while its deposit rate is 0 4 in japan short term rates have been in negative territory since 2016 they re very limited in what they can do rogoff said bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda federal reserve chairman jerome powell mario draghi president of the european central bank toshifumi kitamura afp win mcnamee thomas lohnes getty images running out of ammo then there s the unprecedented moves by central banks to snap up trillions of dollars worth of bonds after the crisis to support growth a policy known as quantitative easing or qe the united states only started shrinking its 4 5 trillion balance sheet in october 2017 and still holds roughly 4 trillion in debt securities while the federal reserve could technically start qe back up again el erian said such a program would likely be less effective in promoting sustainable growth europe only ended its qe program in december after creating 2 6 trillion 3 trillion in new money total holdings at the bank of japan have reached 554 trillion yen 5 1 trillion last year as it remained in stimulus mode under governor haruhiko kuroda those assets are worth more than the country s entire annual economic output put simply the central banking system is running out of ammo according to ed yardeni president of investment advisory firm yardeni research they may not have as much firepower or credibility next go round he said messy politics on top of these tough conditions are political pressures that could complicate the ability of some central banks to mitigate or respond to a slowdown in december the governor of the reserve bank of india abruptly quit after prime minister narendra modi s government leaned on him to do more to boost the economy ahead of elections the rapid appointment of a former government official to take his place further stoked fears of political meddling earlier last year turkey found itself in crisis after its central bank refused to raise interest rates despite soaring inflation which is turn sent the lira plummeting the decision came after president recep tayyip erdogan indicated that he wanted to take control of setting interest rates which he described as the mother and father of all evil in the united states trump has taken to publicly chastising fed chair jerome powell over rate hikes trump has even polled advisers on whether he has the legal authority to fire powell there more and more examples of how central banks independence is something that s not flying particularly in places where you have populist leaders yardeni said questions over political independence of central banks combined with their relative lack of horsepower means they might not be able to come to the rescue in a recession there may very well be limits to what monetary policy can accomplish yardeni said and it may be a mistake to tell the public they can fix all of our problems

world economic forum wef president borge brende attends a news conference ahead of the davos annual meeting in cologny near geneva switzerland january 15 2019 picture taken january 15 2019 reuters denis balibouse by silvia aloisi milan reuters an array of crises will keep several world leaders away from the annual world economic forum in davos next week which takes place against a backdrop of deepening gloom over the global economic and political outlook anxiety over trade disputes fractious international relations brexit and a growth slowdown that some fear could tip the world economy into recession are set to dominate the jan 22 25 alpine meeting and the mood will be somber the wef s own global risks report set the tone this week with a stark warning of looming economic headwinds in part due to geopolitical tensions among major powers some 3 000 business government and civil society chiefs are due to gather in the snow blanketed ski resort but among them are only three leaders of the group of seven most industrialized countries japan s prime minister shinzo abe german chancellor angela merkel and italian premier giuseppe conte donald trump who stole the davos limelight last year with a rare appearance by a sitting u s president pulled out of this year s event as he grapples with a u s government shutdown his french counterpart emmanuel macron is also skipping the meeting as he seeks to respond to the yellow vest protests while theresa may battles to find a consensus on brexit outside the g7 the leaders of russia and india are shunning davos while china whose president xi jinping was the first chinese leader to attend the elite gathering in 2017 to offer a vigorous defense of free trade is sending his deputy instead that will leave the likes of u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin and his british colleague philip hammond as well as china s vice president wang qishan and a host of central bankers with the task of trying to reassure business chiefs davos will be dominated by a high level of anxiety about stock markets a slowdown in growth and international politics said nariman behravesh chief economist at ihs markit the leadership presence is lower than last year but those who are going from mnuchin to central bankers to abe will be seeking to impart a sense of confidence and calm business and investors nerves revamp a u s administration official said the u s delegation which includes secretary of state mike pompeo and commerce secretary wilbur ross would also discuss the importance of reforming institutions such as the world trade organisation the international monetary fund and the world bank trump has harshly criticized globalization and questioned america s participation in multilateral institutions like the wto calling for a revamp of international trade rules it s time to revisit how some of these groups are structured and are they optimized for the challenges of today s economy the administration official said we fully intend to go to davos and be able to carry the president s message davos watchers said the absence of so many top leaders this year did not mean the glitzy forum had lost its mojo as a global stage for top politicians to present their agendas abe is going to davos not just as japanese prime minister but also as chair of the g20 it will be a perfect opportunity to lay the groundwork of upcoming g20 meetings said a japanese government source familiar with international affairs of course there may be inconveniences such as missing opportunities to hold bilateral meetings but that won t undermine the importance of davos he said a chinese official who has attended davos regularly but will not go this year said china had never expected to make progress on the trade row with the united states at the meeting it s just an occasion for making a policy statement he said the low turnout amongst major western leaders may also give more prominence to political personalities who may otherwise be upstaged davos will be the first major international outing for brazil s president jair bolsonaro elected on a wave of anti establishment and conservative nationalism also seen elsewhere he said on twitter he would present a different brazil free of ideological ties and widespread corruption for business chiefs the value of davos lies not so much in the public sessions but in the networking and deal making opportunities on the sidelines of the main conference it s the best place to pitch for ideas build connections and get your brand known said chen linchevski ceo of precognize an israel based start up developing software that prevents technical or quality failures at manufacturing plants it s the kind of place where in a few days you meet people you wouldn t

a small business investment company sbic is a privately owned and operated company that makes long term investments in american small businesses and is licensed by the united states small business administration sba the principal reason for a firm to become licensed as an unleveraged sbic is the special rules applying to investments in sbics made by certain financial institutions banks and federal savings associations as well as their holding companies have the ability to own or to invest in sbics and thereby to own indirectly more than 5 percent of the voting stock of a small business the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act generally prohibits a banking entity from acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in or sponsoring a private equity fund in addition non bank financial companies that engage in proprietary trading or ownership or sponsorship of a private equity fund may be subject to additional capital and quantitative limits these prohibitions are not applicable to investments in sbics additionally banks federal savings associations and their holding companies also receive community reinvestment act credit for sbic investments and in the case of banks and their holding companies also receive exemptions from certain capital charge regulations and lending affiliation rules under the gramm leach bliley act a business seeking a u s government contract that is a set aside for small businesses does not lose its status as a small business by reason of a control investment by an sbic this document provides a general overview of the sbic program for sbics not using leverage provided by sba the u s small business administration sba administers the sbic program through its investment division which employs approximately 80 people sba is an independent federal agency located at 409 third street sw washington dc 20006 202 205 6510 useful information about the sbic program is available on sba s website at www sba gov inv or may be obtained by contacting samuel j boyd jr 202 205 7546 sbia the sbic industry is served by an active trade association the small business investor alliance sbia which is located at 1100 h street nw suite 1200 washington dc 20005 202 628 5055 www sbia org sbia s president is brett palmer harry haskins the long term senior career sba manager of the sbic program is sbia s director of sbic relations sbia provides a variety of information and services to its members and represents the industry with sba and on capitol hill sbia publishes regular updates and is a resource for information concerning the sbic program historical perspective established by the united states congress in 1958 to stimulate long term investment in american small businesses the sbic program has evolved into a significant factor in financing smaller american businesses from the sbic program s inception to december 31 2017 sbics have provided approximately 91 5 billion of funding in more than 178 175 financing to businesses 1 including well known companies such as amgen apple computer costco federal express intel tesla and whole foods 2 the sbic program has undergone significant changes since its creation in 1958 the original program permitted only debenture leverage the small business equity enhancement act of 1992 drastically changed the sbic program it created a new form of sba leverage known as participating securities essentially preferred limited partnership interests in an sbic increased the amount of leverage available to an sbic to 90 million which subsequently was indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living since march 31 1993 and then modified in 2009 to be 150 million and again in 2018 to be 175 million required minimum private capital of 10 million for sbics using participating securities and 5 million for sbics using debentures provided for stricter sba licensing standards and enacted other changes to make the program more consistent with the private venture capital industry unlike the debenture program where sba is a creditor of the sbic which requires an sbic to make periodic interest payments the participating securities program required an sbic to pay sba a prioritized payment preferred return and a profit share when the sbic realized profits as a consequence the participating securities program was designed to permit investing in equity securities whether or not those securities had a current pay component this new program resulted in a large expansion of the number of sbic licenses granted following the burst of the technology bubble in 2002 the administration decided there no longer was a need for an equity sbic program and that the existing participating securities program would cause significant losses to sba accordingly sba decided to terminate the participating securities program and announced that beginning on october 1 2004 it would not issue commitments to use participating securities leverage or license new sbics using that leverage sba officials continue to emphasize that they believe the debenture program is working well and they want to expand it the governing law and regulations for the debenture program have undergone several revisions since 1994 that have further streamlined and improved the sbic program sba has continued its outreach to institutional investors bank regulators and prospective applicants in order to enlarge the existing debenture program and to create ways for sbics to make certain kinds of equity investments without undermining the financial integrity of the debenture program as of september 30 2018 3 there were 305 licensed sbics with approximately 15 8 billion of private capital and 10 9 billion of outstanding sba leverage of which 10 8 billion is debenture leverage and 18 million is participating securities leverage of these sbics 227 use debentures 25 use participating securities 47 do not use leverage and six are specialized sbics during the 2018 federal fiscal year october 1 september 30 federal fy ended september 30 2018 sba licensed a total of 25 sbics with approximately 1 2 billion of private capital of those 21 were debenture sbics and four were unleveraged sbics community reinvestment act credit current community reinvestment act cra regulations present banks other than certain small banks with a continuing need to make investments that qualify for cra purposes investment in an sbic is specifically identified in the cra regulations as a type of investment that will be presumed by the regulatory agencies to be a qualified investment for cra purposes the investment should be in an sbic that is located in or doing substantial business in the region in which the bank s assessment area is located but the sbic is not required to be headquartered within the assessment area itself the sbic act and other federal statutes explicitly permit banks bank holding companies federal savings associations and savings and loan holding companies to invest in sbics gramm leach bliley act and dodd frank act exemptions as part of the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act effective april 1 2002 the federal reserve board the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency adopted new regulations governing regulatory capital treatment for certain equity investments held by banks bank holding companies and financial holding companies under the regulations an 8 percent tier 1 capital deduction applies on covered investments that in the aggregate are less than 15 percent of an organization s tier 1 capital a 12 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 15 24 99 percent of tier 1 capital and a 25 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 25 percent and above of tier 1 capital the regulations exempt sbic investments from such capital charges so long as their value is less than 15 percent of tier 1 capital however the amount of sbic investments will be considered when determining capital charges with respect to other investments these rules however may be affected by contemplated changes to bank capital requirements to conform to the basel iii accords in addition ownership of a 15 percent equity interest in a portfolio company by a bank affiliated sbic will not give rise to a presumption that the portfolio company is an affiliate under sections 23 a and b of the glb act the dodd frank act generally prohibits a banking entity from acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in or sponsoring a private equity fund in addition non bank financial companies that engage in proprietary trading or ownership or sponsorship of a private equity fund may be subject to additional capital and quantitative limits these prohibitions are not applicable to investments in sbics the final regulations implementing the volcker rule under dodd frank act permit banking entities to invest in licensed sbics as well as in funds that have received permission from sba to file an sbic license application and to sponsor sbics investment advisers act exemption an adviser that solely advises sbics an entity that has received a green light letter authorizing it to submit a formal sbic license application to sba and an applicant that is affiliated with one or more sbics and that has applied for another sbic license is expressly exempted from the dodd frank act amendments to the investment advisers act of 1940 the advisers act which amendments require advisers to certain types of private funds to register with the securities and exchange commission or to become exempt reporting advisers the sbic advisers relief act which became law on december 4 2015 provides certain additional relief for investment advisers that advise private funds and sbics and for investment advisers that advise venture funds and sbics before the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to private funds that had assets under management in the united states of less than 150 million could rely upon the so called private fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements also prior to the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to one or more venture capital funds as defined by the sec could rely upon the so called venture capital fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements the sbic advisers relief act revised the private fund adviser exemption by excluding sbic assets from counting towards the 150 million threshold for purposes of determining whether an investment adviser satisfies the conditions for the private fund adviser exemption and by deeming sbics to be venture capital funds for purposes of the venture capital fund adviser exemption certain exemptions from sba regulations unleveraged sbics are exempt from many sba regulations which pertain to sbics using debentures including the management ownership diversity requirement which generally prohibits a single investor from owning greater than 70 percent of an sbic and requires that at least three institutional investors which are entities or natural persons that satisfy certain net worth criteria unaffiliated with management and one another and whose investments in the sbic are significant in dollar and percentage own at least 30 percent of the sbic the overline limitations which restrict how much can be invested in any one portfolio company and its affiliates restrictions on the sbic s use of its idle funds restrictions on the sbic s incurrence of third party secured debt certain recordkeeping requirements limitations on distributions to the sbic s investors and the requirement to obtain sba approval to decrease regulatory capital 4 by more than 2 percent per year but must notify sba of any reduction within 30 days by more than 2 percent per year but must notify sba of any reduction within 30 days prohibitions the sbic s ability to sell assets to its associates without sba approval sba consent requirements for certain types of co investments made with the sbic s associates the requirement that sba approve management services contracts with the sbic s management company and the sbic s initial management expense and any changes thereto although the sbic is required to notify sba of such initial management expenses and of any such changes the requirement to obtain sba s prior approval for new directors and officers other than the chief operating officer although the sbic is required to notify sba of any such new directors or officers within 30 days and limitations on the amount of management fees the sbic is permitted to pay sbic investments an sbic can only invest in small businesses and must invest at least 25 percent of its invested funds in smaller enterprises 5 sba regulations define a small business as a company with tangible net worth total net worth less goodwill of less than 19 56 million and average after tax income exclusive of loss carry forwards for the prior two years of less than 6 5 million a company failing that test can still qualify as a small business if it meets the size standards for its industry group under an alternative test the size standards for industry groups under this alternative test are based on the number of employees typically 500 to 1 000 for a manufacturing company or gross revenues 6 a smaller enterprise is a company with a net worth excluding goodwill of less than 6 million and average after tax income for the prior two years of less than 2 million or which meets the alternative test importantly in making a determination under the size test and the alternative test the company and all affiliates of the company must be considered companies are affiliates of each other if one controls or has the power to control the other or a third party or parties control or have the power to control both sbics and private funds exempted from registration under certain sections of the investment company act of 1940 are not considered affiliates of a company for purposes of determining whether that company qualifies as a small business or smaller enterprise certain debt to equity ratios must also be met if an sbic finances the change of ownership of a small business with more than 500 employees sbic regulations preclude investment in the following types of businesses companies whose principal business is re lending or re investing venture capital firms leasing companies factors banks many kinds of real estate projects single purpose projects that are not continuing businesses companies that will use the proceeds outside of the united states or have more than 49 percent of their tangible assets or employees outside the united states at the time of financing or within one year following the financing unless the funding is used for a specific u s purpose that is acceptable to sba businesses that are passive and do not carry on an active trade or business and businesses that use 50 percent or more of the funds to buy goods or services from an associated supplier historically sba regulations prevented an sbic or two or more sbics acting together and its associates controlled or related persons from controlling a small business except on a temporary basis to protect its investment or if the small business was a start up in december 2000 legislation was enacted eliminating the legislative basis for regulating control during the investment period effective november 21 2002 sba adopted final regulations permitting an sbic and its associates to control a small business for up to seven years and with sba s consent for a longer period to permit an orderly sale of the investment or to ensure the financial stability of the small business sbics are precluded from making investments in a small business if it would give rise to a conflict of interest generally a conflict of interest may arise if an associate7 of the sbic has or makes an investment in the small business or serves as one of its officers or directors or would otherwise benefit from the financing investing in an associate generally requires prior sba approval unless an exception applies joint investing with an associate such as another fund controlled by affiliates of the general partner may be made on the same terms and conditions and at the same time or on terms that are fair to the sbic terms of portfolio company financings an sbic may make investments in the form of debt with no equity features loans debt with equity features debt securities or stock rights to acquire stock and interests in limited partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures equity securities investments must be made for a term of not less than one year except for bridge loans in anticipation of a permanent financing in which the sbic intends to participate or to protect the sbic s prior investment loans and debt securities must have amortization not exceeding straight line the permissible interest rate depends on the type of debt for straight loans the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 19 percent or ii 11 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate for debt securities the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 14 percent or ii 6 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate regulations define an sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage and describe the maximum permitted rate when more than one sbic participates in the financing the applicable interest rate is calculated adding in all points fees discounts and other costs of money other than i application fees of up t 1 percent of the proposed financing and closing fees of up to 4 percent of the financing for debt securities or 2 percent for loans ii permitted prepayment penalties and iii reasonable monitoring expenses each of which may be charged in addition to the permitted interest in addition an sbic may be reimbursed for its reasonable closing costs including legal fees an sbic may also charge a default rate of interest of up to 7 percent and a royalty based on improvement in the performance of a portfolio company after the financing an sbic is permitted to require a small business to redeem equity securities but only after one year and only for a price equal to either i the purchase price or ii a price determined at the time of redemption based on a a reasonable formula that reflects the performance of the company e g based on the book value or earnings or b fair market value determined by a professional third party appraiser mandatory redemptions not complying with these requirements will result in the investment being treated as a debt security subject to the interest restrictions described above however the small business can be required to redeem the sbic s equity security earlier than one year after its issuance if the small business has a public offering has a change of control or management or defaults under its investment agreement an sbic is permitted to retain its investment in a business that ceases to be a small business and is permitted to continue to invest in such a large business until the company has a public offering following a public offering the sbic is permitted to exercise rights to acquire securities that were obtained prior to the public offering if within one year of the initial financing by an sbic a portfolio company changes its business to one in which an sbic is prohibited from investing then the sbic must divest itself of the investment absent sba s approval to retain the investment sbic operations sba has adopted a number of regulations and policies concerning operating requirements of sbics intended to assure their proper management principal regulations and policies include an sbic and its associates may provide management services to small businesses in which the sbic invests but only may charge for services at competitive rates for services actually rendered unleveraged sbics are required to value their assets annually pursuant to valuation guidelines approved by sba sba has issued model valuation guidelines that are similar to those customarily used by venture capital firms but do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles an sbic s ability to borrow funds from third parties is subject to sba regulation although sbics using debentures may only incur unsecured debt unleveraged sbics may incur secured debt sbics are required to file a variety of reports with sba none of which generally are considered burdensome these reports include an annual financial statement which is certified to by the sbic s independent certified public accountants and contains information concerning each portfolio company valuation reports as described above capital certificates reporting among other things changes in regulatory capital reports as to changes in the sbic s management material litigation a brief report describing each investment and copies of reports sent to investors and if applicable to the sec sba will conduct regulatory examinations of each sbic on an annual basis sba has certain rights and remedies if the sbic violates sba regulations remedies for regulatory violations are graduated in severity depending on the seriousness of the regulatory violation for minor regulatory infractions warnings are given for serious infractions restrictions on distributions and making new investments may be imposed management fees may be required to be reduced and investors may be required to pay their unfunded capital commitments to the sbic in severe cases sba may require the limited partners to remove the partnership s general partner or manager or its officers directors managers or partners or sba may obtain appointment of a receiver for the partnership organization sbics are organized under state law as corporations limited partnerships or limited liability companies investors investors may be either domestic or foreign individuals or entities the sbic act specifically authorizes banks and federal savings associations to invest up to 5 percent of their capital and surplus in sbics certain investors owning 33 percent or more of an sbic are required to submit certain background information to sba and are subject to sba s fingerprinting requirements all investors in an sbic and anyone owning 10 percent or more of any investor owning 10 percent of an sbic must be identified to sba in the sbic s license application restrictions on transfer investors in an sbic may not transfer their interests without sba s prior consent additionally without sba s consent an sbic may not release any of its investors from the liability to make the full amount of their capital contribution licensing sba uses a two step licensing process for first time sbics in the first phase an applicant completes and submits to sba a form entitled management assessment questionnaire maq an applicant must pay sba a non refundable fee of 10 000 at the time it submits the maq 8 the maq contains the elements of the applicant s business plan as well as detailed information concerning the experience of each of the principals to carry out the business plan sba generally requires that at least two substantially full time principals have at least five years of successful investment experience at a decision making level in the types of investments the applicant is proposing to make generally each individual s track record should include at least 10 15 investments with a reasonable number of complete realizations during the last ten years and preferably including some that are quite recent sba also considers how long and in what ways the management team has worked together sba views the track record of the principals and the cohesiveness of the key principals as being fundamentally important additionally sba is concerned about the internal management of the sbic they prefer a team composed of three to five principals although as few as two and as many as six also are acceptable however sba does not want dominance by a single principal over investment and other management decisions including personnel matters they do not want to license a one man band sba looks at the division of the sbic s carried interest to evaluate relationships they have an informal rule that no principal may own 50 percent or more of the carried interest unless there are only two principals and they each have 50 percent the maq is then reviewed by sba s investment committee after which the principals if appearing qualified are invited to meet with the members of the investment committee after the meeting with the applicant s principals sba s investment committee may turn the application down or issue a green light letter indicating that the applicant has passed the first part of the application process and now is authorized to file a formal application at the present time a green light letter usually is issued three to four months following submission of the maq and immediately after the interview an applicant that receives a green light letter must file its formal license application not more than 18 months after the date of that letter applicants must pay he maq applicants must pay sba an additional non refundable license application fee of 25 000 at the time they submit their formal application for an sbic license 9 after receipt of the green light letter and obtaining commitments for at least the minimum required regulatory capital from investors satisfying the diversity requirement the applicant files a formal application which contains additional information about the applicant and the management team as well as the applicant s and its general partner s or manager s organizational applicant documents although the regulations require a debenture sbic to have at least 5 million of regulatory capital sba generally requires an sbic to have firm commitments when its formal license application is filed for an amount of capital that is sufficient to enable the sbic to have a first closing and conduct its operations even if it does not subsequently raise additional funds depending on the projected size of the sbic sba could require 10 20 million of private commitments for an unleveraged sbic or more at the time the application is filed during the formal licensing process sba seeks to determine that there is a qualified management team and that the sbic has a good chance of operating profitably sba reviews the applicant s business plan projections and organizational documents and conducts reference and other background checks including litigation searches and an fbi fingerprint check on the management team the process presently is taking approximately six to nine months sba requires applicants to advise their investors that the investors are not entitled to rely on sba s review of the applicant in deciding whether to invest after a license application is filed and accepted for processing by sba an applicant may make pre licensing investments which will be included in the applicant s regulatory capital if they are submitted to and approved by sba prior to the investment being made sba requires 10 business days to review such pre licensing investments but approvals frequently take longer sba does not determine the quality or wisdom of the investment rather sba simply seeks to determine if the investment is made in compliance with sba regulations once licensed sba pre approval of investments is not required sba requires all principal members of the management team to attend a one day regulations class run by sba and will only permit one pre licensing investment to be made prior to at least one person from applicant attending the class arrangements for attending the regulations class are made by contacting sbia timeline applicants should assume the following timeline for securing a license management assessment questionnaire 3 6 months formal license approval 6 12 months total 9 18 months this timeline assumes the license application is filed immediately upon receipt of the green light letter licensing second funds for second sbic funds sba follows a process that is similar to licensing new funds with one important exception if certain conditions are satisfied instead of filing a maq the process is initiated by submitting a formal written request asking sba to issue a green light letter for the new fund sba now requires the submission of a nonrefundable fee in the same amount that would have been paid had a maq been submitted to utilize this process and avoid writing a new maq to obtain a green light letter there should be substantially the same management team that is pursuing an investment strategy that is substantially similar to that of the existing sbic after submission of a request outlining the proposed new sbic sba s office of operations compares the new fund and the prior fund s similarity of business plan changes in management team track record profitability liquidity and prior sba compliance record and makes a recommendation to the investment committee that in turn makes a decision whether to issue a green light letter for the new fund following receipt of that letter when the new fund has

margaritis schinas also said we have not received such a request from the uk for an extension and should there be a uk request to extend this will be decided unanimously by the 27 and of course the

the coming monday the conservative party s leader in the house of commons andrea leadsom told the parliament today that a full day s debate on the motion will take place on tuesday 29 january subject to the agreement of the house regarding the possibility of a second referendum opposition labour leader jeremy corbyn said if a second referendum takes place then obviously the party will decide what role we will play in that but i can t really go along with the idea that it should simply be a re run of what happened in 2016 and there has to be a discussion about the options that we put forward ecb lautenschlaeger still expects 2019 rate hike but data driven ecb executive board member sabine lautenschlaeger a known hawk said the central bank could still raise interest rate in 2019 she told politico that i ll wait for the projections coming in march before i change my view she added i m data driven in this and i think that as we are still in the environment we projected also pointing to

alexander winning emma rumney thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe pretoria reuters the south african reserve bank defended its mandate of price stability on thursday after the ruling african national congress said the bank should broaden its focus to include employment and economic growth south african reserve bank governor lesetja kganyago speaks at imfc press conference during the imf world bank spring meeting in washington u s april 21 2018 reuters yuri gripas the central bank s mandate now focuses on price stability but the anc said in its 2019 election manifesto that monetary policy should also take into account other objectives such as employment creation and economic growth governor lesetja kganyago said the bank s mandate was to protect the value of the currency in the interest of balance and sustainable growth changing the mandate he said meant amending the constitution so anyone who says that the sarb must focus on growth has clearly not read the constitution kganyago told reporters after announcing that the bank had decided to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 6 75 percent the fathers and mothers of our constitution took the view that to have balanced and sustainable growth you need price stability sponsored stories president cyril ramaphosa said on wednesday that the ruling party had no intention of tinkering with the independence of the reserve bank south africa s economy only recently emerged from a recession triggered in part by investor worries about policies such as the anc s plans to make the reserve bank fully state owned and allow land expropriation without compensation after thursday s rate decision the rand weakened to a session low of 13 8175 per dollar past attempts to alter the central bank s mandate have caused the rand to weaken kganyago said the monetary policy committee had noted an improved near term inflation outlook mainly driven by a drop in oil prices and a stronger rand the bank now projects inflation will average 4 8 percent this year down from a previous forecast of 5 5 percent an average of 5 3 percent is expected in 2020 the overall risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to be moderately on the upside against this backdrop the mpc unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged kganyago said all 27 economists surveyed by reuters had predicted rates would be left unchanged but they said a hike was likely at its third meeting of the year in may with reserve bank governor stating that growth forecast for 2019 has been revised down the dovish tilt could support speculation over the central bank slowing down on rates this year said lukman otunuga a research analyst with fxtm writing by olivia kumwenda mtambo editing by james macharia larry king
as mark twain never said it ain t what you don t know that gets you into trouble it s what you think you know for sure that just ain t so over the course of this year and next the biggest economic risks will emerge in those areas where investors think recent patterns are unlikely to change they will include a growth recession in china a rise in global long term real interest rates and a crescendo of populist economic policies that undermine the credibility of central bank independence resulting in higher interest rates on safe advanced country government bonds a significant chinese slowdown may already be unfolding us president donald trump s trade war has shaken confidence but this is only a downward shove to an economy that was already slowing as it makes the transition from export and investment led growth to more sustainable domestic consumption led growth how much the chinese economy will slow is an open question but given the inherent contradiction between an ever more centralised party led political system and the need for a more decentralised consumer led economic system long term growth could fall quite dramatically unfortunately the option of avoiding the transition to consumer led growth and continuing to promote exports and real estate investment is not very attractive either china is already a dominant global exporter and there is neither market space nor political tolerance to allow it to maintain its previous pace of export expansion bolstering growth through investment particularly in residential real estate which accounts for the lion s share of chinese construction output is also ever more challenging downward pressure on prices especially outside tier 1 cities is making it increasingly difficult to induce families to invest an even larger share of their wealth into housing although china may be much better positioned than any western economy to socialise losses that hit the banking sector a sharp contraction in housing prices and construction could prove extremely painful to absorb any significant growth recession in china would hit the rest of asia hard along with commodity exporting developing and emerging economies nor would europe and especially germany be spared although the us is less dependent on china the trauma to financial markets and politically sensitive exports would make a chinese slowdown much more painful than us leaders seem to realise a less likely but even more traumatic outside risk would materialise if after many years of trend decline global long term real interest rates reversed course and rose significantly i am not speaking merely of a significant over tightening by the us federal reserve in 2019 this would be problematic but it would mainly affect short term real interest rates and in principle could be reversed in time the far more serious risk is a shock to very long term real interest rates which are lower than at any point during the modern era except for the period of financial repression after world war ii when markets were much less developed than today while a sustained rise in the long term real interest rate is a low probability event it is far from impossible although there are many explanations of the long term trend decline some factors could be temporary and it is difficult to establish the magnitude of different possible effects empirically one factor that could cause global rates to rise on the benign side would be a spurt in productivity for example if the so called fourth industrial revolution starts to affect growth much faster than is currently anticipated this would of course be good overall for the global economy but it might greatly strain lagging regions and groups but upward pressure on global rates could stem from a less benign factor a sharp trend decline in asian growth for example from a long term slowdown in china that causes the region s long standing external surpluses to swing into deficits but perhaps the most likely cause of higher global real interest is the explosion of populism across much of the world to the extent that populists can overturn the market friendly economic policies of the past several decades they may sow doubt in global markets about just how safe advanced country debt really is this could raise risk premia and interest rates and if governments were slow to adjust budget deficits would rise markets would doubt governments even more and events could spiral most economists agree that today s lower long term interest rates allow advanced economies to sustain significantly more debt than they might otherwise but the notion that additional debt is a free lunch is foolish high debt levels make it more difficult for governments to respond aggressively to shocks the inability to respond aggressively to a financial crisis a cyber attack a pandemic or a trade war significantly heightens the risk of long term stagnation and is an important explanation of why most serious academic studies find that very high debt levels are associated with slower long term growth if policymakers rely too much on debt as opposed to higher taxation on the wealthy in order to pursue progressive policies which redistribute income it is easy to imagine markets coming to doubt that countries will grow their way out of very high debt levels investors scepticism could well push up interest rates to uncomfortable levels of course there are many other risks to global growth including ever increasing political chaos in the united states a messy brexit italy s shaky banks and heightened geopolitical tensions but these outside risks do not make the outlook for global growth necessarily grim the baseline scenario for the us is still strong growth europe s growth could be above trend as well as it continues its long slow recovery from the debt crisis at the beginning of the decade and china s economy has been proving doubters wrong for many years so 2019 could turn out to be another year of solid global growth unfortunately it is likely to be a nerve wracking one as well source b ft disclaimer opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those

state owned firms were able to achieve record high revenues and profits because of relatively stable growth in the domestic economy and supporting measures enacted by the government according to peng huagaung a spokesman for the state asset oversight agency last year firms owned by the central government booked revenues of 29 1 trillion yuan about us 4 3 trillion up 10 1 per cent from 2017 while net profits reached 1 2 trillion yuan a rise of 15 7 per cent from the previous year according to figures released by the state owned assets supervision and administration commission of the state council sasac on thursday revenues and profits at china s state owned enterprises hit historic highs last year even as the country s private firms fought for their survival amid the slowest period for economic growth in a decade state firms also benefited from cost cutting as well as better efficiency and risk management amid the slowdown in economic growth a chinese national flag flies in front of skyscrapers of the pudong lujiazui financial district stand in shanghai china on december 28 2018 photo bloomberg the figures are in stark contrast to the performance of china s private sector where many companies are fighting for their lives entrepreneurs are struggling to finance their companies and pay debts due to limited access to credit and the high cost of borrowing when credit is available corporate debt defaults among china s private firms hit a record high last year china s private firms are concentrated in the manufacturing real estate retail and wholesale sectors the non performing loan ratio for the manufacturing sector stood at 4 2 per cent last year and at 4 7 per cent for the wholesale and retail sectors both well above the 1 7 per cent rate for all commercial bank loans according to estimates from moody s we expect the debt servicing capacity of borrowers in cyclical sectors to remain vulnerable to a slowing economy in particular those exposed to potential spikes in trade frictions with the us moody s said in a report this week china s banks are more likely to provide funds to state firms than to private companies because of the perception that the debts of state owned firms are implicitly guaranteed by the government however the advantages that state owned firms have enjoyed in recent years may be trimmed back in the period ahead as the government looks to address international trade frictions and to stabilise economic growth the united states and european union china s largest trading partners have complained about the benefits that state owned firms enjoy such as monopolies in certain sectors and lower cost financing than available to private firms arguing that the special benefits distort markets to the disadvantage of private firms whether chinese or foreign the central government however insists that state companies must play a vital role in the national economy and answer to the communist party beijing has touted the idea of competitive neutrality under which state owned and privately owned companies would be able to compete on equal terms through reforms of policies on subsidies taxes trade instruments such as tariffs and other support mechanisms when they unnecessarily distort competition many analysts believe it would be difficult to make meaningful reforms to support competitive neutrality given that state firms are making healthy profits meanwhile china s central bank has recently introduced measures aimed at reducing finance costs for private firms chief among them is reducing the amount of reserves that banks must keep at the central bank the people s bank of china has also stepped up support for private bond financing to increase the availability of funds for smaller firms on january 4 chinese premier li keqiang reiterated the government s call for more bank lending to privately owned enterprises including small and micro enterprises during a visit to state banks now the policy direction has shifted to helping private firms said larry hu head of china economics at macquarie in the past two to three years it was all about supporting state firms they change their policy support every now and then hu said the renewed support for private enterprise should help improve their profit margins is better than before whether it will solve all the funding problems i think it will be very difficult hu said

2018 new insurance written and the higher annual persistency associated with our prior business the business we have written since 2008 has very strong credit characteristics and is expected to generate meaningful returns for shareholders even if we experience a moderate economic downturn in the future i have previously said that the biggest near term challenges to the size of the mortgage origination market and therefore the volume of business we will insure are rising interest rates and lack of housing inventory well mortgage rates have actually remained attractive and there is an increasing supply of homes coming to the market so while many are predicting a slowdown in housing i remain optimistic because consumers continue to feel confident about their future economic prospects and i feel very good about our ability to serve our customers given our capital strength and position in the market moving on to credit for a moment performance continues to be outstanding our inventory of delinquency notices declined sequentially and year over year and is now at a level not seen since the mid 1990s further after adjusting for the impact of the hurricanes of 2017 the number of new delinquency notices received during the quarter declined on a year over year basis the strong credit performance continues to be a tailwind for our financial results before i turn it over to tim i know many of you have questions about the competitive dynamics within the industry when it comes to competing in the market our strategy is fairly straightforward we want to remain a relevant business partner with our customers in order in order to prudently grow insurance in force generate long term premium flows and create book value growth for our shareholders recently more competitors have introduced pricing engines that use a number a greater number of loan level characteristics to determine premium rates than the traditional rate card we have also just begun to deploy our own pricing engine called miq miq allows a more granular approach to risk based pricing which assists in managing risk and shaping the insured portfolio however we know that one approach to pricing does not work for all customers so customers that prefer to use a rate card approach may continue to do so in terms of broad market adoption of miq we expect it to be customer driven but i believe that will increase over the course of 2019 with that let me turn it over to tim timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks pat in the fourth quarter we earned 157 7 million of net income or 0 43 per diluted share compared to 27 3 million or 0 07 per diluted share in the same period last year the significant increase reflects the reduction to our deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of 2017 that resulted from the 2017 tax law change to provide better insight into our operating results and to make year over year comparisons of the finance results more meaningful we disclose adjusted net operating income a non gaap measure a reconciliation of gaap net income to adjusted net operating income is included in the body of the press release in the fourth quarter our adjusted net operating income per diluted share was roughly flat at 0 42 compared to 0 43 in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from increases in some areas and decreases in others premiums earned increased due to higher average insurance in force as well as a higher profit commission from our quota share reinsurance transactions partly offset by a lower effective premium rate additionally in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 90 million shares associated with the 9 convertible junior subordinated debentures were not included as they were anti dilutive the shares are included in the fourth quarter 2018 calculation losses incurred were 28 million compared to a negative 31 million for the same period last year losses incurred consist of reserves established on new delinquent notices plus changes to previously established loss reserves during the fourth quarter of 2018 there was a 22 million reduction in losses incurred due to changes in previously established loss reserves before reinsurance compared to a reduction of 103 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as we do each quarter we review the performance of the delinquent inventory to determine what if any changes should be made to the estimated claim rate and severity factors of previously received notices we continue to experience a favorable credit cycle the positive development was driven by higher than expected cure rates and delinquencies that are aged 12 months or greater during the quarter we received 38 fewer new delinquency notices than we did in the same period last year much of the decrease was due to the high number of notices we received in the fourth quarter of 2017 that resulted from various hurricanes the claim rate on new notices received in the fourth quarter of 2018 was approximately 9 which reflects the current economic environment and anticipated cures and compares to 10 excluding the hurricane impact in the same quarter last year and was flat to the 9 we used last quarter new delinquency notices received from the legacy book represent the majority of new notices received in the quarter the new books account for just 33 of the new delinquency notices but account for approximately 84 of the risk in force as of december 31st 2018 the relatively low delinquency activity from the larger more recently written books reflects their high credit quality as well as economic condition while continuing to diminish in number we expect that the legacy books will continue to be the primary source of new notice activity in the coming quarters reflecting the smaller delinquency inventory the number of claims received in the quarter declined 22 from the same period last year net paid claims in the fourth quarter were 75 million the effective average premium yield for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 47 3 basis points the effective yield was lower sequentially for a variety of reasons including changes on losses ceded to reinsurers changes in the recognition of premiums on single premium policies changes in premium refund accruals and premiums ceded connected to the recent iln transaction while there could be some volatility we expect that the effective premium yield will trend lower in future periods this decline is expected mainly because the older books of business written at higher premium rates continue to run off and replace the new books of business written at lower premium rates net underwriting and other expenses were 50 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 44 million in the same period last year the increase in expenses was primarily due to compensation including stock based compensation which reflects the stock price as of the grant date and changes to our non executive compensation as well as other expenses we expect that in 2019 expenses before reinsurance will be flat to 2018 the effective tax rate for the quarter was 19 compared to 89 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate was materially impacted by the change in the tax code that resulted in a revaluation of our deferred tax assets we expect that the effective tax rate going forward would be 21 as this quarter included a true up related to our irs litigation as we reported in the press release during the quarter mgic paid a 60 million dividend to the holding company and for the full year paid 220 million to the holding company the dividend payment reflects the fact that mgic is generating meaningful capital and that we expect to be able to be continuing to do so for the foreseeable future we expect the dividend of at least this quarter s level will continue to be paid to the holding company on a quarterly basis subject to the approval of our board as a reminder before paying any dividends we notify the oci to ensure it does not object to any dividends paid from mgic at quarter end our consolidated cash and investments totaled 5 3 billion including 248 million of cash and investments at the holding company the consolidated investment portfolio had a mix of 78 taxable and 22 tax exempt securities a pre tax yield of 3 09 and has a duration of 4 1 years our debt to total capital ratio was approximately 19 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 at the end of the fourth quarter using pmiers 1 0 mgic s available assets totaled approximately 4 8 billion resulting in a 1 4 billion excess over the required assets if pmiers 2 0 were effective the excess would have been 1 billion a 26 excess over the required assets now that pmiers 2 0 which is effective march 31st 2019 is finalized we are in process of determining what level of excess would be appropriate on a going forward basis at the end of the fourth quarter mgic s statutory capital is 2 6 billion in excess of the state requirement next i want to spend a few minutes discussing our capital position and how we think about allocating capital we utilized an additional 75 million of the share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and repurchased nearly 7 million shares at an average cost of 11 06 for the full year we repurchased nearly 60 million 60 million shares at an average cost of 10 95 we have 25 million remaining under our share repurchase program that does not expire until the end of 2019 i would expect us to continue to be opportunistic in utilizing the remaining authorization regarding the appropriate level of excess to pmiers it is difficult to actively manage to a specific target given the regulatory requirements for paying dividend some level of excess provides a nice buffer against adverse economic scenarios as well as the potential for additional capital requirements from the gses should they occur in the future when we discuss strategy to allocate and utilize the capital that exists at the writing company we first estimate how much capital is needed to support the new business that is being written we have also started to become modestly more active with the gse risk transfer transactions that require capital support and we expect to remain active in this area provided the returns meet our thresholds of course we are also sending dividends now at a 240 million annual run rate to the holding company so when you take a step back and think about the existing uses of capital to new business and existing level of dividends they account for the substantial majority of capital that s being created annually at the writing company we do have periodic options to adjust the level of quota share reinsurance we utilize which could impact the amounts of excess but the level of reinsurance we have today creates the level of excess we do have plus it also helps with our dividend capacity in addition since pmiers is more restricted than the state capital standards we believe having an excess not unlike reinsurance is beneficial to our dividend paying discussions with the oci we will continue to analyze and discuss with the board the best options to deploy capital that maximizes long term shareholder value finally as pat referenced if we experience a moderate economic downturn that began today we d expect to continue to be profitable increase book value and maintain an excess over the pmiers 2 0 minimum required assets we arrive at that expectation based on our current internal modeling of the existing book of business that s based on modified 2017 ccar adverse scenario that make certain assumptions including among other items a 10 decline in home prices and an unemployment rising to approximately 7 and that incorporates our existing quota sharing insurance treaties and insurance like no transactions with that let me turn it back to pat patrick sinks chief executive officer thanks tim before moving to questions let me give a quick update on the regulatory and political fronts regarding housing finance reform we remain optimistic about the future role that our company and industry can have but it continues to be very difficult to gauge what actions may be taken and the timing of any such actions we continue to be actively engaged on this topic in washington a new fhfa director mark calabria has been nominated but needs to be confirmed meanwhile joe otting of the occ will be the acting fhfa director exactly what will unfold and how the role of the gses and private capital play out remains to be seen but we are encouraged that both calabria and otting see the private sector as part of the solution for transferring credit risk away from taxpayers regarding the fha we continue to think that it is unlikely that they will reduce their mi premiums and that the primary focus of the fha is on improving the operational policies and procedures in the reverse mortgage business with respect to the pilot programs that freddie and fannie have introduced based on our discussions with lenders the interest in these programs continues to be modest we will continue to monitor these initiatives but currently they do not materially change our forecast for niw or insurance in force growth in 2019 we are aware of the issues that face our company whether they are legislative competitive or credit related and are actively working on them while we don t know exactly how these issues will or will not impact our future we do believe that currently we are writing high quality new business in what is expected to be a low loss environment and that this business is being added to a book of business that itself is performing exceptionally well and we are generating significant shareholder value which we expect to continue for some time our company and industry offers many solutions and a great value proposition for lenders and consumers to overcome the number 1 barrier to homeownership the down payment and despite a lot of media coverage to the contrary mortgage credit is available and remains affordable for many consumers i believe that our company is well positioned to acquire and manage mortgage credit risk in a variety of forms supported by a robust capital structure that includes our strong balance sheet and where appropriate reinsurance treaties and the capital markets we accomplished a great deal in 2018 we grew our insurance in force by more than 7 investment income increased and in a smaller overall origination mortgage market we wrote nearly 3 more business we repurchased more than 4 of our common stock outstanding executed an insurance linked note transaction that reduces potential future earnings volatility decreased our debt ratios received an a minus rating from a m best for the main operating subsidiaries and increased dividends to our holding company to 220 million in 2019 i expect that our insurance in force will continue to grow due to the level of new business we expect to write and strong persistency further i anticipate that the number of new mortgage delinquency notices claims paid and delinquency inventory will continue to decline i continue to believe that there is a greater role for us to play in providing increased access to credit for consumers and reducing gse credit risk while generating good returns for shareholders and we remain committed to pursuing those opportunities that is why when i look ahead i m very excited and confident about the future for mgic with that operator let s take questions michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations mary we re ready for questions now questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of chris gamiatoni from compass point your line is now open chris gamiatoni compass point analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my call just to clarify on the capital statement is it is there any reason not to believe that you could buy back at least at the level that you receive dividends from the subsidiary timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer chris this is tim i mean i think we weigh a number of factors including what other needs are at the holding company so i don t want to say that we would buy at at least that level obviously this last year we looked to be opportunistic and we thought we had cash at the holding company to be able to utilize for that but i wouldn t go as far as saying that we would be able to buy at at least that level it depends upon price it depends upon other factors as well chris gamiatoni compass point analyst okay and when do you anticipate being able to get normal dividends out of the subsidiary when the constituencies are built back up to a sufficient level timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think from a run rate basis chris i mean part of it is i think the ordinary dividends would be at a lesser level than we have right now and so there s always that sort of discussion with the regulator as to what part is ordinary what part would be extraordinary but i think the way you sort of phrased it until the constituencies are fully built there still is some headwind as far as getting ordinary dividends at sort of a good run rate and so we still have a few years to go before that s fully built chris gamiatoni compass point analyst okay and just to clarify in the statements about profitability in a downturn did i hear it right that you were using the ccar adverse scenario timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer correct 2017 modified chris gamiatoni compass point analyst and is there any way to give us a sense of does profitability mean you make a dollar or is it like a 3 roe or any type of level just very roughly timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t think we re going to give that level of detail chris gamiatoni compass point analyst okay all right that s all the questions i have thank you timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of randy binner from b riley fbr your line is now open randy binner b riley fbr analyst good morning thanks so i have a question about miq and you had mentioned that you re going to continue to offer kind of standard rate card format so what can you kind of break out what percent of your business now is in that new pricing model and then as you look out in the future kind of what percent of your business do you think would transition to the more of that multivariate model than the rate card patrick sinks chief executive officer this is pat we just have rolled it out here in january so it s quite new so i don t have any specific numbers relative to percentages and then as we have consistently said it all starts with the customer if customers want it sooner rather than later we ll be prepared my sense is it ll be a gradual increase over the course of the year so we haven t said we haven t publicly stated any kind of target by the end of the year but we will be in the market with it as is everybody else and we will compete randy binner b riley fbr analyst yes i mean i guess i mean it s scalable right because i think what we ve heard from some other writers is that their books pretty rapidly move to the black box pricing from the rate card so if the demand was from 90 of your counter parties want to do it could you hit that goal by the middle of the year or would there be constraints to that patrick sinks chief executive officer well i don t want to put a time frame on when we hit it i will say again we ll compete so if the market moves faster because of customers wanting it we will be in the market randy binner b riley fbr analyst and then on the reserve release nominally it is a little bit smaller than this quarter than it s been in the past couple any color you can provide on what action years the reserve release apply to timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think most of the most of the notice inventory is still out of the oh prior books so it s really across those books is where the majority of the reserve release would be from and as i mentioned it s really from the 12 months more delinquent is where we saw improvement on a cure rate randy binner b riley fbr analyst okay great thank you patrick sinks chief executive officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of phil stefano from deutsche bank your line is now open philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst yes thanks good morning i was hoping you could talk a little bit about the iln impact on the quarter were there any expenses associated with that was there any premium yield drag that i think it came priced late october so supposedly there s some more premium drag that s going to come from this any ways to think about that timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes phil actually this quarter i can talk about it unlike last quarter so we did disclose in the risk factors some amount of premium drag from this i would say that was a little bit heavy because of some of the initial sort of costs associated with the transaction so i think from a run rate it s something less than 10 million for a year that you could think about this costing it s a very cheap effective cost to capital and so from that standpoint we feel very good about it from an expense standpoint there was a little bit but nothing as i mentioned increase in expenses this year year over year that wasn t really the main reason so again we feel like it s another good form of capital for us we think it is cost effective and also attaches at a nice spot so it s a great tool to have philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst got it okay second one is what s the free cash flow conversion as a percentage of earnings how are you guys thinking about this timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer were you talking about free cash flow philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst yes timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer percent of earnings well i mean i think to me i guess we always think of it through the lens of what we have at mgic and what how that turns into pmiers and what ultimately get to be dividends to the holding company and so we don t think of it in terms of sort of that everything is all free cash flow because of the restrictions on dividends but from mgic s perspective as i talked a little bit on the opening comments as we think about dividends to the holding company at basically a 240 million run rate the amount of capital needed to deploy back into the business to write new business as well as to be able to support some of the other sort of gse risk share things that we re looking at that takes up the majority of the sort of the cash flow that we re creating although we are still building in excess to pmiers as you noticed over the last year so that s sort of how i think about where the free cash flow is going right now philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst got it okay and the last one for you is circling back on miq as we think about the number of factors that are potential for you to use in pricing do you have a feel for how many factors you re going to be using initially i mean thinking about the rate card at least in mind as being a two factor model how much more information do you think you re going to be gathering and pricing from is it five is it six not to put a definite number on there but maybe you can just help us think about the amount of metrics that you re going to be looking at stephen mackey chief risk officer yes so this is steve mackey so in the way we ve constructed this we have call it a base pricing grid and then a set of add ons price adjusters and that base pricing grid is roughly eight factors which gets you to probably around 70 000 prices unique prices and then with the adjusters there s four categories of adjusters and those are based on ltv and fico and that puts the number of price unique prices well over 1 million philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark devries from barclays your line is now open mark devries barclays capital analyst yes thanks tim could you give us some sense of what impact if at all the iln transaction will have on your ability to request additional dividends from oci timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer well mark it right now we think we re going to get full pmiers credit for it and from we have excess from a state regulatory standpoint it helps in the discussions for sure and that s one of the things that we factor into is into our thought process around all of reinsurance is how much does it help us is it a dollar for dollar sort of that we get to take that out by no means is that the case but it helps build sort of the overall picture for our regulator i think as far as how we are able to any sort of downturn were to happen that we are in a good spot and that they feel very comfortable with the level of dividends mark devries barclays capital analyst okay and is there any color you can give us on where ultimately over the next several years you think that 60 million a quarter dividend could ultimately go to timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer i think that s really really tough to say obviously our earnings are exceeding that right now but i don t think that we would expect even going back pre crisis that we re able to get out our full earnings on an annual basis definitely not a quarterly run rate so it s conversations we continue to have with the regulator as you notice the rate of increase slowed this year but we were still able to increase it up to the 60s during the second half of the year so there ll be additional conversations that we have and we think we have a good story to tell mark devries barclays capital analyst okay fair enough and then are you thinking at all about dividend to shareholders as part of your capital returns timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer it s one of the things that we talk about with our board pretty much every quarter just to talk about it as an option and have done so for a while i think a number of factors go into that obviously we ve been executing on share repurchase and have used that as a preferred method currently and so i d say there s nothing imminent right now but it s something that we always talk about as one of our options mark devries barclays capital analyst okay got it is there a valuation in the shares in which you d be less inclined to buyback your stock i m assuming we re not anywhere close to it right now timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i don t want to get too much into the detail but we know when we look at it obviously to think that we re hopefully creating shareholder value by buying it back below intrinsic value through a number of different ways to think about that so again we executed this last year where we thought that was the case and also thought we had the wherewithal to do so at the holding company and going forward that will be sort of the lens that we plan on looking through as well mark devries barclays capital analyst okay got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of doug harter from credit suisse your line is now open douglas harter credit suisse analyst thanks can you talk about the factors or the mix that led to the modest decline in the premium on new insurance written this quarter michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations doug this is mike i think versus mix i mean it s really more about fully implementing of those price changes from earlier in the year as it kind of rolled through right we ve made those they were effective june july so you didn t have a full period in the third quarter now you have a full period in the fourth quarter so i d say it s more driven by those price changes than it was by mix douglas harter credit suisse analyst got it so sort of normalizing for that you would characterize it as relatively flat michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations yes i mean it s mix dependent absolutely douglas harter credit suisse analyst okay and then i guess as you think about the pricing engine kind of as you roll that out is there expected to be any impact on pricing either positive or negative from the rollout of that michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations this is mike again i mean yes that s the whole point of going to those types of pricing engines is to more accurately reflect the current conditions and expected conditions going forward up or down douglas harter credit suisse analyst okay michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations but it s hard to give you any percentages because it s going to be environment dependent douglas harter credit suisse analyst understood thanks operator your next question comes from the line of bose george from kbw your line is now open bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst hey guys good morning so just actually going back to the question on the premium on niw so going forward is it safe to say that 50 basis points number is a good run rate unless the mix changes so now all the price reductions are kind of fully incorporated in there michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations bose this is mike no again i don t think it s going to be mix of environment dependent and how much transitions from rate card over to miq and some things of that nature so as tim has guided to and we ve guided to for a number of quarters and years actually is that the more importantly the effective yield of the overall portfolio we think would continue to trend lower over time bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst i mean i can understand why the effective yield on the insurance in force will trend down this i mean on the niw doesn t it reflect sort of the reduced rates already in that number michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations well for the current period yes but we re not going to give we can t give and we re not going to give forward guidance relative to where we think premium rates will be in future periods it s just something that we don t do bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst i mean that s fair but i mean there s no if prices are relatively stable in the market then there s no reason to think premiums should necessarily decline right if the mix is not changing meaningfully michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations well i think the keywords used there if things are stable and but there could be changes up or down as previous somebody asked earlier bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay fair enough thanks and then actually just in terms of the premium this quarter can you just quantify was there a benefit to the premium just from the reserve release timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer there was some benefit from the reserve release because we re able to effectively release some return premium accruals but i would say that was it was more modest than it has been in most recent quarters bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thanks and then actually one on the ilns do you foresee doing more of those transactions just as you clearly don t need the capital but just as part of a broader approach to risk management timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes tim again i mean i think our view is it s another form of capital and risk transfer that we can utilize and it s cost effective when we issued it capital markets can change but it s something that us and others in the industry have utilized more so this last year and i think it s safe to assume that if markets are available that s something we ll consider strongly in the future bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thanks actually just one more what s a good tax rate going forward timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think point to 21 is probably good we were a little bit off this quarter but 21 is the right way to think about it moving forward bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay great thanks timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of jack micenko from sig your line is now open jack micenko susquehanna financial group analyst good morning hey tim can you just maybe get a little more granular on the 2 basis points sequentially i mean how much of it was mix how much of it was the release how much of it was maybe a fall off on accelerated premium how do we think about the 2 basis points the sort of sum of the parts timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer it was really spread across all those jack from an example for the single premium acceleration i think our accelerated premium fell from being 6 6 the last couple of quarters down to 5 1 this quarter so i think that s like a third of a basis point when you look at all everything is entitled with reinsurance as far as iln and then change in profit commission everything that was probably somewhere closer to a basis point so you mix all those things together that i think starts to get us closer to the 2 basis points jack micenko susquehanna financial group analyst okay and then i guess we re at 26 excess now 1 billion under 1 0 you had i think always sort of pointed to a 10 to 15 maybe walk us through why i mean obviously you re evaluating it but is 10 to 15 the right number under 20 is it why could it be lower why could it be higher just help us understand sort of where that may sort of fall in as you think through it timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jack i think it is something we re still looking at i think it i don t know if it s easy or early enough to say if it would be higher or lower at this point but i think we look at it along with the types of capital we have with the reinsurance and we ve talked before that we have the options on some of our quota share to make changes to that if we wanted to so i think we ll look at it but again to a certain extent that we think that it s giving us additional dividend capacity having that excess that is another factor that we think about as well so to the extent that we aren t able to get out the same amount of dividend i think that s when you think us trying to come back a little bit closer to where our targets than before with pmiers 2 0 the main change was taking away the premium credit so there weren t a lot of other changes so that s one thing that we ll consider when we think about what the right level is going forward jack micenko susquehanna financial group analyst and then sort of one follow up to that i mean what are you thinking i mean obviously you re thinking about some growth and there s this 240 million kind of run rate number out there but obviously you re assuming there s portfolio growth do you have an niw forecast for 19 for the industry and for your company as well michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations yes jack this is mike i mean for our company we re looking at probably flat to last year saw right around 50 billion obviously the overall market s going to be a little bit smaller given refis and where the purchase activity is coming in at so we d see about the same levels in 19 versus 18 jack micenko susquehanna financial group analyst all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of geoffrey dunn from dowling partners your line is now open geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst thanks good morning tim the expense growth book i think you suggested flat on a gross basis what changes about 19 after a couple of years of mid to upper single digit growth timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer jeff we said that before ceding commission that it would be flat 19 to 18 it s something that we talk about periodically we like to be focused on expenses be smart about it the last few years i think we ve had some expenses that we ve as i mentioned earlier some things with restricted share that have had things rise up because the stock price was up we ve talked a little bit about investing a little bit more from some of the technology things things like that we feel like we re at a good run rate right now that we re able to sort of benefit from some of those things moving forward and particularly on the technology investment and so i think we took a hard look at it in the environment and think that it s the right thing to sort of try to keep that flat when we look at 19 geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst what s more sustainable long term is it something closer to a low single digit gdp number or mid single digits i think i ve asked before and suggested that mid single plus timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s tough to say i mean i think again we re going to look at this hard and look at ways to leverage technology moving forward so we re focused on 19 and trying to be flat in 19 and if inaudible is successful in that i think we continue to look out past that point but i don t think we expect to have expense growth rate higher than gdp by any means geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst okay and then your qsr ran through the 18 book i believe has that renewal occurred have you renewed it have you changed the cede level can you update us on that front timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we have renewed it for 19 at similar cede level i d say similar structure and related sort of bells and whistles associated with it geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst okay then with the iln market with the assuming conditions remain favorable why renew at a 30 cede rate rather than drop it to 15 or 20 type of thing i think you ve indicated in past calls that you d consider maybe a blended approach with traditional and capital markets so given all the options right now why maintain a 30 on the 19 book timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean that s a good question geoff i mean part of the thought process is we re getting the 30 on the 19 book which is a forward commitment for us any additional iln we would do we wouldn t be able to place iln on that for over a year at this point we still find the very attractive cost to capital and the fact that we have in our other quota share transactions ability to terminate those early i think that s where we d look to sort of trim and sort of right size as opposed to doing it on the forward commitment basis geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst okay and can you remind i think you had some sort of termination option recently or am i mis remembering that timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no i think every six months basically starting at the end of this year we have the ability on our oldest quota share to be able to terminate if we wanted to so we did not do that as of the end of this year but we have another option every six months going forward geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst okay thanks timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of mihir bhatia from bank of america your line is now open mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thanks for taking my questions just wanted to start with firstly the government shutdown well i was curious if you ll are seeing any impact of that across your portfolio whether it being maybe people are more looking to work more with the private mis versus the fhas or seeing delayed closings or just impacts of some of the laid off or not laid off furloughed workers where you re not maybe delinquencies and stuff and if it extends for longer what are some of the impacts you might see michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations mihir this is mike so the short answer to the first part of your question is no we haven t seen any impact to it from the conventional lending world the irs is processing their verification of employment and things of that nature what happens if it extends longer we ll have to wait and see clearly the number of workers compared to the overall employment base and homeowner base is relatively small but who knows we ll see how long it lasts and what implications that has to overall economic conditions and confidence but nothing as of today mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then second question is just on going back to miq for a second and your roll out of it as you roll it out is there any expense associated with it as in if you need to roll it out faster with all the other companies doing it would there be higher incremental like maybe expenses are there some efficiencies with rolling it out versus the rate card process or is it pretty much the same patrick sinks chief executive officer this is pat it ll be more reallocation of resources so there might be some increase in expenses on the margin but nothing material mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then the other thing i was curious on the pricing itself within miq obviously it s more granular so you re able i assume that means some borrowers end up with a little bit maybe higher cost versus the rate card while some have a benefit but what if you ran your whole niw like this quarter through it would you on average end up in the same place would you end up a little bit better worse michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations mihir this is mike we are not going to make any comments and won t make any comments relative to pricing what it s been or where it could be in the future mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay fair enough i think i mean just the last question obviously new leadership at the fhfa and i was curious a couple of years ago there was a fair amount of stock around deep mi and hoping to do that new leadership at least in past before they assumed their roles had shown i think more openness to private markets taking on some more risk so i was curious if that is something you see happening or is it just out of the question with the way the government congressional shutdowns and opposing parties being in charge et cetera patrick sinks chief executive officer this is pat it s difficult to predict for the reasons you said at the end there that it will happen because there s so many moving parts including political reality that said we believe it continues to be a good idea and it s a discussion we want to have with mr calabria and mr otting depending on how it plays out so it s something we will continue to pursue because we think it s the right thing to do in terms of housing policy it s the right way of de risking the gses we think we will have a receptive audience in terms of they re willing to listen but will it actually translate into action that remains to be seen mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator operator instructions you have a follow up question from bose george from kbw your line is now open bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst hey guys thanks actually just a quick follow up on the iln the cost of the iln this quarter was that in the niw premium number that you gave the 50 2 basis points timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer the cost of the iln for this quarter would be are you talking about oh the 50 2 basis points that s on a direct basis so that is not included in there bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay and then just to clarify the 10 million run rate annualized cost of the iln did you say that was fully in the numbers for this quarter and were there some other expenses as well timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say it was more heavily weighted this quarter than it would be at a run rate going forward and i d say it s slightly less than 10 million a year so if you look at the run rate for this quarter that would get you above the 10 million so a little bit of additional cost associated with it in the initial quarter that starts up but on a run rate going forward again i think something just shy of 10 million on the premium bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay great thanks timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator there are no further questions at this time you may continue patrick sinks chief executive officer okay this is pat thank you for joining us on the call this morning and your interest in our company as i said in our my summary we had an outstanding 2018 in terms of managing the business i thank my 800 coworkers and we are very

instructions thank you it is now my pleasure to introduce your host for today mike zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations you may begin your conference michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations thanks mary good morning and thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in mgic investment corporation joining me on the call today to discuss the results for the fourth quarter of 2018 are chief executive officer pat sinks chief financial officer tim mattke and chief risk officer steve mackey i want to remind all participants that our earnings release of this morning which may be accessed on mgic s website which is located at mtg mgic com under newsroom includes additional information about the company s quarterly results that will we will refer to during the call and includes certain non gaap financial measures we have posted on our website a presentation that contains information pertaining to our risk in force and new insurance written and other information we think you will find valuable during the course of this call we may make comments about our expectations of the future actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements additional information about those factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the call are contained in the form 8 k that was filed earlier this morning if the company makes any forward looking statements we are not undertaking an obligation to update those statements in the future in light of subsequent developments further no interested party should rely on the fact that such guidance or forward looking statements are current at anytime other than the time of this call or the issuance of the form 8 k at this time i d like to turn the call over to pat patrick sinks chief executive officer thanks mike and good morning i m pleased to report that we had another strong quarter of financial results and are in an excellent position to continue to serve our customers while creating shareholder value in 2019 in a few minutes tim will cover the details of the financial results but before he does let me make a few comments the quarterly financial results reflect the very low credit losses of our post 2008 business and the favorable operating environment we are experiencing especially as it relates to employment wage growth and housing demand the main driver of our future revenue our insurance in force grew nearly 8 over the last 12 months ending the quarter at 209 7 billion the increase was driven by our 2018 new insurance written and the higher annual persistency associated with our prior business the business we have written since 2008 has very strong credit characteristics and is expected to generate meaningful returns for shareholders even if we experience a moderate economic downturn in the future i have previously said that the biggest near term challenges to the size of the mortgage origination market and therefore the volume of business we will insure are rising interest rates and lack of housing inventory well mortgage rates have actually remained attractive and there is an increasing supply of homes coming to the market so while many are predicting a slowdown in housing i remain optimistic because consumers continue to feel confident about their future economic prospects and i feel very good about our ability to serve our customers given our capital strength and position in the market moving on to credit for a moment performance continues to be outstanding our inventory of delinquency notices declined sequentially and year over year and is now at a level not seen since the mid 1990s further after adjusting for the impact of the hurricanes of 2017 the number of new delinquency notices received during the quarter declined on a year over year basis the strong credit performance continues to be a tailwind for our financial results before i turn it over to tim i know many of you have questions about the competitive dynamics within the industry when it comes to competing in the market our strategy is fairly straightforward we want to remain a relevant business partner with our customers in order in order to prudently grow insurance in force generate long term premium flows and create book value growth for our shareholders recently more competitors have introduced pricing engines that use a number a greater number of loan level characteristics to determine premium rates than the traditional rate card we have also just begun to deploy our own pricing engine called miq miq allows a more granular approach to risk based pricing which assists in managing risk and shaping the insured portfolio however we know that one approach to pricing does not work for all customers so customers that prefer to use a rate card approach may continue to do so in terms of broad market adoption of miq we expect it to be customer driven but i believe that will increase over the course of 2019 with that let me turn it over to tim timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks pat in the fourth quarter we earned 157 7 million of net income or 0 43 per diluted share compared to 27 3 million or 0 07 per diluted share in the same period last year the significant increase reflects the reduction to our deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of 2017 that resulted from the 2017 tax law change to provide better insight into our operating results and to make year over year comparisons of the finance results more meaningful we disclose adjusted net operating income a non gaap measure a reconciliation of gaap net income to adjusted net operating income is included in the body of the press release in the fourth quarter our adjusted net operating income per diluted share was roughly flat at 0 42 compared to 0 43 in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from increases in some areas and decreases in others premiums earned increased due to higher average insurance in force as well as a higher profit commission from our quota share reinsurance transactions partly offset by a lower effective premium rate additionally in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 90 million shares associated with the 9 convertible junior subordinated debentures were not included as they were anti dilutive the shares are included in the fourth quarter 2018 calculation losses incurred were 28 million compared to a negative 31 million for the same period last year losses incurred consist of reserves established on new delinquent notices plus changes to previously established loss reserves during the fourth quarter of 2018 there was a 22 million reduction in losses incurred due to changes in previously established loss reserves before reinsurance compared to a reduction of 103 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as we do each quarter we review the performance of the delinquent inventory to determine what if any changes should be made to the estimated claim rate and severity factors of previously received notices we continue to experience a favorable credit cycle the positive development was driven by higher than expected cure rates and delinquencies that are aged 12 months or greater during the quarter we received 38 fewer new delinquency notices than we did in the same period last year much of the decrease was due to the high number of notices we received in the fourth quarter of 2017 that resulted from various hurricanes the claim rate on new notices received in the fourth quarter of 2018 was approximately 9 which reflects the current economic environment and anticipated cures and compares to 10 excluding the hurricane impact in the same quarter last year and was flat to the 9 we used last quarter new delinquency notices received from the legacy book represent the majority of new notices received in the quarter the new books account for just 33 of the new delinquency notices but account for approximately 84 of the risk in force as of december 31st 2018 the relatively low delinquency activity from the larger more recently written books reflects their high credit quality as well as economic condition while continuing to diminish in number we expect that the legacy books will continue to be the primary source of new notice activity in the coming quarters reflecting the smaller delinquency inventory the number of claims received in the quarter declined 22 from the same period last year net paid claims in the fourth quarter were 75 million the effective average premium yield for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 47 3 basis points the effective yield was lower sequentially for a variety of reasons including changes on losses ceded to reinsurers changes in the recognition of premiums on single premium policies changes in premium refund accruals and premiums ceded connected to the recent iln transaction while there could be some volatility we expect that the effective premium yield will trend lower in future periods this decline is expected mainly because the older books of business written at higher premium rates continue to run off and replace the new books of business written at lower premium rates net underwriting and other expenses were 50 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 44 million in the same period last year the increase in expenses was primarily due to compensation including stock based compensation which reflects the stock price as of the grant date and changes to our non executive compensation as well as other expenses we expect that in 2019 expenses before reinsurance will be flat to 2018 the effective tax rate for the quarter was 19 compared to 89 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate was materially impacted by the change in the tax code that resulted in a revaluation of our deferred tax assets we expect that the effective tax rate going forward would be 21 as this quarter included a true up related to our irs litigation as we reported in the press release during the quarter mgic paid a 60 million dividend to the holding company and for the full year paid 220 million to the holding company the dividend payment reflects the fact that mgic is generating meaningful capital and that we expect to be able to be continuing to do so for the foreseeable future we expect the dividend of at least this quarter s level will continue to be paid to the holding company on a quarterly basis subject to the approval of our board as a reminder before paying any dividends we notify the oci to ensure it does not object to any dividends paid from mgic at quarter end our consolidated cash and investments totaled 5 3 billion including 248 million of cash and investments at the holding company the consolidated investment portfolio had a mix of 78 taxable and 22 tax exempt securities a pre tax yield of 3 09 and has a duration of 4 1 years our debt to total capital ratio was approximately 19 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 at the end of the fourth quarter using pmiers 1 0 mgic s available assets totaled approximately 4 8 billion resulting in a 1 4 billion excess over the required assets if pmiers 2 0 were effective the excess would have been 1 billion a 26 excess over the required assets now that pmiers 2 0 which is effective march 31st 2019 is finalized we are in process of determining what level of excess would be appropriate on a going forward basis at the end of the fourth quarter mgic s statutory capital is 2 6 billion in excess of the state requirement next i want to spend a few minutes discussing our capital position and how we think about allocating capital we utilized an additional 75 million of the share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and repurchased nearly 7 million shares at an average cost of 11 06 for the full year we repurchased nearly 60 million 60 million shares at an average cost of 10 95 we have 25 million remaining under our share repurchase program that does not expire until the end of 2019 i would expect us to continue to be opportunistic in utilizing the remaining authorization regarding the appropriate level of excess to pmiers it is difficult to actively manage to a specific target given the regulatory requirements for paying dividend some level of excess provides a nice buffer against adverse economic scenarios as well as the potential for additional capital requirements from the gses should they occur in the future when we discuss strategy to allocate and utilize the capital that exists at the writing company we first estimate how much capital is needed to support the new business that is being written we have also started to become modestly more active with the gse risk transfer transactions that require capital support and we expect to remain active in this area provided the returns meet our thresholds of course we are also sending dividends now at a 240 million annual run rate to the holding company so when you take a step back and think about the existing uses of capital to new business and existing level of dividends they account for the substantial majority of capital that s being created annually at the writing company we do have periodic options to adjust the level of quota share reinsurance we utilize which could impact the amounts of excess but the level of reinsurance we have today creates the level of excess we do have plus it also helps with our dividend capacity in addition since pmiers is more restricted than the state capital standards we believe having an excess not unlike reinsurance is beneficial to our dividend paying discussions with the oci we will continue to analyze and discuss with the board the best options to deploy capital that maximizes long term shareholder value finally as pat referenced if we experience a moderate economic downturn that began today we d expect to continue to be profitable increase book value and maintain an excess over the pmiers 2 0 minimum required assets we arrive at that expectation based on our current internal modeling of the existing book of business that s based on modified 2017 ccar adverse scenario that make certain assumptions including among other items a 10 decline in home prices and an unemployment rising to approximately 7 and that incorporates our existing quota sharing insurance treaties and insurance like no transactions with that let me turn it back to pat patrick sinks chief executive officer thanks tim before moving to questions let me give a quick update on the regulatory and political fronts regarding housing finance reform we remain optimistic about the future role that our company and industry can have but it continues to be very difficult to gauge what actions may be taken and the timing of any such actions we continue to be actively engaged on this topic in washington a new fhfa director mark calabria has been nominated but needs to be confirmed meanwhile joe otting of the occ will be the acting fhfa director exactly what will unfold and how the role of the gses and private capital play out remains to be seen but we are encouraged that both calabria and otting see the private sector as part of the solution for transferring credit risk away from taxpayers regarding the fha we continue to think that it is unlikely that they will reduce their mi premiums and that the primary focus of the fha is on improving the operational policies and procedures in the reverse mortgage business with respect to the pilot programs that freddie and fannie have introduced based on our discussions with lenders the interest in these programs continues to be modest we will continue to monitor these initiatives but currently they do not materially change our forecast for niw or insurance in force growth in 2019 we are aware of the issues that face our company whether they are legislative competitive or credit related and are actively working on them while we don t know exactly how these issues will or will not impact our future we do believe that currently we are writing high quality new business in what is expected to be a low loss environment and that this business is being added to a book of business that itself is performing exceptionally well and we are generating significant shareholder value which we expect to continue for some time our company and industry offers many solutions and a great value proposition for lenders and consumers to overcome the number 1 barrier to homeownership the down payment and despite a lot of media coverage to the contrary mortgage credit is available and remains affordable for many consumers i believe that our company is well positioned to acquire and manage mortgage credit risk in a variety of forms supported by a robust capital structure that includes our strong balance sheet and where appropriate reinsurance treaties and the capital markets we accomplished a great deal in 2018 we grew our insurance in force by more than 7 investment income increased and in a smaller overall origination mortgage market we wrote nearly 3 more business we repurchased more than 4 of our common stock outstanding executed an insurance linked note transaction that reduces potential future earnings volatility decreased our debt ratios received an a minus rating from a m best for the main operating subsidiaries and increased dividends to our holding company to 220 million in 2019 i expect that our insurance in force will continue to grow due to the level of new business we expect to write and strong persistency further i anticipate that the number of new mortgage delinquency notices claims paid and delinquency inventory will continue to decline i continue to believe that there is a greater role for us to play in providing increased access to credit for consumers and reducing gse credit risk while generating good returns for shareholders and we remain committed to pursuing those opportunities that is why when i look ahead i m very excited and confident about the future for mgic with that operator let s take questions michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations mary we re ready for questions now questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of chris gamiatoni from compass point your line is now open chris gamiatoni compass point analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my call just to clarify on the capital statement is it is there any reason not to believe that you could buy back at least at the level that you receive dividends from the subsidiary timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer chris this is tim i mean i think we weigh a number of factors including what other needs are at the holding company so i don t want to say that we would buy at at least that level obviously this last year we looked to be opportunistic and we thought we had cash at the holding company to be able to utilize for that but i wouldn t go as far as saying that we would be able to buy at at least that level it depends upon price it depends upon other factors as well chris gamiatoni compass point analyst okay and when do you anticipate being able to get normal dividends out of the subsidiary when the constituencies are built back up to a sufficient level timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think from a run rate basis chris i mean part of it is i think the ordinary dividends would be at a lesser level than we have right now and so there s always that sort of discussion with the regulator as to what part is ordinary what part would be extraordinary but i think the way you sort of phrased it until the constituencies are fully built there still is some headwind as far as getting ordinary dividends at sort of a good run rate and so we still have a few years to go before that s fully built chris gamiatoni compass point analyst okay and just to clarify in the statements about profitability in a downturn did i hear it right that you were using the ccar adverse scenario timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer correct 2017 modified chris gamiatoni compass point analyst and is there any way to give us a sense of does profitability mean you make a dollar or is it like a 3 roe or any type of level just very roughly timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t think we re going to give that level of detail chris gamiatoni compass point analyst okay all right that s all the questions i have thank you timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of randy binner from b riley fbr your line is now open randy binner b riley fbr analyst good morning thanks so i have a question about miq and you had mentioned that you re going to continue to offer kind of standard rate card format so what can you kind of break out what percent of your business now is in that new pricing model and then as you look out in the future kind of what percent of your business do you think would transition to the more of that multivariate model than the rate card patrick sinks chief executive officer this is pat we just have rolled it out here in january so it s quite new so i don t have any specific numbers relative to percentages and then as we have consistently said it all starts with the customer if customers want it sooner rather than later we ll be prepared my sense is it ll be a gradual increase over the course of the year so we haven t said we haven t publicly stated any kind of target by the end of the year but we will be in the market with it as is everybody else and we will compete randy binner b riley fbr analyst yes i mean i guess i mean it s scalable right because i think what we ve heard from some other writers is that their books pretty rapidly move to the black box pricing from the rate card so if the demand was from 90 of your counter parties want to do it could you hit that goal by the middle of the year or would there be constraints to that patrick sinks chief executive officer well i don t want to put a time frame on when we hit it i will say again we ll compete so if the market moves faster because of customers wanting it we will be in the market randy binner b riley fbr analyst and then on the reserve release nominally it is a little bit smaller than this quarter than it s been in the past couple any color you can provide on what action years the reserve release apply to timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think most of the most of the notice inventory is still out of the oh prior books so it s really across those books is where the majority of the reserve release would be from and as i mentioned it s really from the 12 months more delinquent is where we saw improvement on a cure rate randy binner b riley fbr analyst okay great thank you patrick sinks chief executive officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of phil stefano from deutsche bank your line is now open philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst yes thanks good morning i was hoping you could talk a little bit about the iln impact on the quarter were there any expenses associated with that was there any premium yield drag that i think it came priced late october so supposedly there s some more premium drag that s going to come from this any ways to think about that timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes phil actually this quarter i can talk about it unlike last quarter so we did disclose in the risk factors some amount of premium drag from this i would say that was a little bit heavy because of some of the initial sort of costs associated with the transaction so i think from a run rate it s something less than 10 million for a year that you could think about this costing it s a very cheap effective cost to capital and so from that standpoint we feel very good about it from an expense standpoint there was a little bit but nothing as i mentioned increase in expenses this year year over year that wasn t really the main reason so again we feel like it s another good form of capital for us we think it is cost effective and also attaches at a nice spot so it s a great tool to have philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst got it okay second one is what s the free cash flow conversion as a percentage of earnings how are you guys thinking about this timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer were you talking about free cash flow philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst yes timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer percent of earnings well i mean i think to me i guess we always think of it through the lens of what we have at mgic and what how that turns into pmiers and what ultimately get to be dividends to the holding company and so we don t think of it in terms of sort of that everything is all free cash flow because of the restrictions on dividends but from mgic s perspective as i talked a little bit on the opening comments as we think about dividends to the holding company at basically a 240 million run rate the amount of capital needed to deploy back into the business to write new business as well as to be able to support some of the other sort of gse risk share things that we re looking at that takes up the majority of the sort of the cash flow that we re creating although we are still building in excess to pmiers as you noticed over the last year so that s sort of how i think about where the free cash flow is going right now philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst got it okay and the last one for you is circling back on miq as we think about the number of factors that are potential for you to use in pricing do you have a feel for how many factors you re going to be using initially i mean thinking about the rate card at least in mind as being a two factor model how much more information do you think you re going to be gathering and pricing from is it five is it six not to put a definite number on there but maybe you can just help us think about the amount of metrics that you re going to be looking at stephen mackey chief risk officer yes so this is steve mackey so in the way we ve constructed this we have call it a base pricing grid and then a set of add ons price adjusters and that base pricing grid is roughly eight factors which gets you to probably around 70 000 prices unique prices and then with the adjusters there s four categories of adjusters and those are based on ltv and fico and that puts the number of price unique prices well over 1 million philip stefano deutsche bank securities inc analyst got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark devries from barclays your line is now open mark devries barclays capital analyst yes thanks tim could you give us some sense of what impact if at all the iln transaction will have on your ability to request additional dividends from oci timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer well mark it right now we think we re going to get full pmiers credit for it and from we have excess from a state regulatory standpoint it helps in the discussions for sure and that s one of the things that we factor into is into our thought process around all of reinsurance is how much does it help us is it a dollar for dollar sort of that we get to take that out by no means is that the case but it helps build sort of the overall picture for our regulator i think as far as how we are able to any sort of downturn were to happen that we are in a good spot and that they feel very comfortable with the level of dividends mark devries barclays capital analyst okay and is there any color you can give us on where ultimately over the next several years you think that 60 million a quarter dividend could ultimately go to timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer i think that s really really tough to say obviously our earnings are exceeding that right now but i don t think that we would expect even going back pre crisis that we re able to get out our full earnings on an annual basis definitely not a quarterly run rate so it s conversations we continue to have with the regulator as you notice the rate of increase slowed this year but we were still able to increase it up to the 60s during the second half of the year so there ll be additional conversations that we have and we think we have a good story to tell mark devries barclays capital analyst okay fair enough and then are you thinking at all about dividend to shareholders as part of your capital returns timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer it s one of the things that we talk about with our board pretty much every quarter just to talk about it as an option and have done so for a while i think a number of factors go into that obviously we ve been executing on share repurchase and have used that as a preferred method currently and so i d say there s nothing imminent right now but it s something that we always talk about as one of our options mark devries barclays capital analyst okay got it is there a valuation in the shares in which you d be less inclined to buyback your stock i m assuming we re not anywhere close to it right now timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i don t want to get too much into the detail but we know when we look at it obviously to think that we re hopefully creating shareholder value by buying it back below intrinsic value through a number of different ways to think about that so again we executed this last year where we thought that was the case and also thought we had the wherewithal to do so at the holding company and going forward that will be sort of the lens that we plan on looking through as well mark devries barclays capital analyst okay got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of doug harter from credit suisse your line is now open douglas harter credit suisse analyst thanks can you talk about the factors or the mix that led to the modest decline in the premium on new insurance written this quarter michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations doug this is mike i think versus mix i mean it s really more about fully implementing of those price changes from earlier in the year as it kind of rolled through right we ve made those they were effective june july so you didn t have a full period in the third quarter now you have a full period in the fourth quarter so i d say it s more driven by those price changes than it was by mix douglas harter credit suisse analyst got it so sort of normalizing for that you would characterize it as relatively flat michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations yes i mean it s mix dependent absolutely douglas harter credit suisse analyst okay and then i guess as you think about the pricing engine kind of as you roll that out is there expected to be any impact on pricing either positive or negative from the rollout of that michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations this is mike again i mean yes that s the whole point of going to those types of pricing engines is to more accurately reflect the current conditions and expected conditions going forward up or down douglas harter credit suisse analyst okay michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations but it s hard to give you any percentages because it s going to be environment dependent douglas harter credit suisse analyst understood thanks operator your next question comes from the line of bose george from kbw your line is now open bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst hey guys good morning so just actually going back to the question on the premium on niw so going forward is it safe to say that 50 basis points number is a good run rate unless the mix changes so now all the price reductions are kind of fully incorporated in there michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations bose this is mike no again i don t think it s going to be mix of environment dependent and how much transitions from rate card over to miq and some things of that nature so as tim has guided to and we ve guided to for a number of quarters and years actually is that the more importantly the effective yield of the overall portfolio we think would continue to trend lower over time bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst i mean i can understand why the effective yield on the insurance in force will trend down this i mean on the niw doesn t it reflect sort of the reduced rates already in that number michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations well for the current period yes but we re not going to give we can t give and we re not going to give forward guidance relative to where we think premium rates will be in future periods it s just something that we don t do bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst i mean that s fair but i mean there s no if prices are relatively stable in the market then there s no reason to think premiums should necessarily decline right if the mix is not changing meaningfully michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations well i think the keywords used there if things are stable and but there could be changes up or down as previous somebody asked earlier bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay fair enough thanks and then actually just in terms of the premium this quarter can you just quantify was there a benefit to the premium just from the reserve release timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer there was some benefit from the reserve release because we re able to effectively release some return premium accruals but i would say that was it was more modest than it has been in most recent quarters bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thanks and then actually one on the ilns do you foresee doing more of those transactions just as you clearly don t need the capital but just as part of a broader approach to risk management timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes tim again i mean i think our view is it s another form of capital and risk transfer that we can utilize and it s cost effective when we issued it capital markets can change but it s something that us and others in the industry have utilized more so this last year and i think it s safe to assume that if markets are available that s something we ll consider strongly in the future bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thanks actually just one more what s a good tax rate going forward timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think point to 21 is probably good we were a little bit off this quarter but 21 is the right way to think about it moving forward bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay great thanks timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of jack micenko from sig your line is now open jack micenko susquehanna financial group analyst good morning hey tim can you just maybe get a little more granular on the 2 basis points sequentially i mean how much of it was mix how much of it was the release how much of it was maybe a fall off on accelerated premium how do we think about the 2 basis points the sort of sum of the parts timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer it was really spread across all those jack from an example for the single premium acceleration i think our accelerated premium fell from being 6 6 the last couple of quarters down to 5 1 this quarter so i think that s like a third of a basis point when you look at all everything is entitled with reinsurance as far as iln and then change in profit commission everything that was probably somewhere closer to a basis point so you mix all those things together that i think starts to get us closer to the 2 basis points jack micenko susquehanna financial group analyst okay and then i guess we re at 26 excess now 1 billion under 1 0 you had i think always sort of pointed to a 10 to 15 maybe walk us through why i mean obviously you re evaluating it but is 10 to 15 the right number under 20 is it why could it be lower why could it be higher just help us understand sort of where that may sort of fall in as you think through it timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jack i think it is something we re still looking at i think it i don t know if it s easy or early enough to say if it would be higher or lower at this point but i think we look at it along with the types of capital we have with the reinsurance and we ve talked before that we have the options on some of our quota share to make changes to that if we wanted to so i think we ll look at it but again to a certain extent that we think that it s giving us additional dividend capacity having that excess that is another factor that we think about as well so to the extent that we aren t able to get out the same amount of dividend i think that s when you think us trying to come back a little bit closer to where our targets than before with pmiers 2 0 the main change was taking away the premium credit so there weren t a lot of other changes so that s one thing that we ll consider when we think about what the right level is going forward jack micenko susquehanna financial group analyst and then sort of one follow up to that i mean what are you thinking i mean obviously you re thinking about some growth and there s this 240 million kind of run rate number out there but obviously you re assuming there s portfolio growth do you have an niw forecast for 19 for the industry and for your company as well michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations yes jack this is mike i mean for our company we re looking at probably flat to last year saw right around 50 billion obviously the overall market s going to be a little bit smaller given refis and where the purchase activity is coming in at so we d see about the same levels in 19 versus 18 jack micenko susquehanna financial group analyst all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of geoffrey dunn from dowling partners your line is now open geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst thanks good morning tim the expense growth book i think you suggested flat on a gross basis what changes about 19 after a couple of years of mid to upper single digit growth timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer jeff we said that before ceding commission that it would be flat 19 to 18 it s something that we talk about periodically we like to be focused on expenses be smart about it the last few years i think we ve had some expenses that we ve as i mentioned earlier some things with restricted share that have had things rise up because the stock price was up we ve talked a little bit about investing a little bit more from some of the technology things things like that we feel like we re at a good run rate right now that we re able to sort of benefit from some of those things moving forward and particularly on the technology investment and so i think we took a hard look at it in the environment and think that it s the right thing to sort of try to keep that flat when we look at 19 geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst what s more sustainable long term is it something closer to a low single digit gdp number or mid single digits i think i ve asked before and suggested that mid single plus timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s tough to say i mean i think again we re going to look at this hard and look at ways to leverage technology moving forward so we re focused on 19 and trying to be flat in 19 and if inaudible is successful in that i think we continue to look out past that point but i don t think we expect to have expense growth rate higher than gdp by any means geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst okay and then your qsr ran through the 18 book i believe has that renewal occurred have you renewed it have you changed the cede level can you update us on that front timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we have renewed it for 19 at similar cede level i d say similar structure and related sort of bells and whistles associated with it geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst okay then with the iln market with the assuming conditions remain favorable why renew at a 30 cede rate rather than drop it to 15 or 20 type of thing i think you ve indicated in past calls that you d consider maybe a blended approach with traditional and capital markets so given all the options right now why maintain a 30 on the 19 book timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean that s a good question geoff i mean part of the thought process is we re getting the 30 on the 19 book which is a forward commitment for us any additional iln we would do we wouldn t be able to place iln on that for over a year at this point we still find the very attractive cost to capital and the fact that we have in our other quota share transactions ability to terminate those early i think that s where we d look to sort of trim and sort of right size as opposed to doing it on the forward commitment basis geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst okay and can you remind i think you had some sort of termination option recently or am i mis remembering that timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no i think every six months basically starting at the end of this year we have the ability on our oldest quota share to be able to terminate if we wanted to so we did not do that as of the end of this year but we have another option every six months going forward geoffrey m dunn dowling partners analyst okay thanks timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of mihir bhatia from bank of america your line is now open mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thanks for taking my questions just wanted to start with firstly the government shutdown well i was curious if you ll are seeing any impact of that across your portfolio whether it being maybe people are more looking to work more with the private mis versus the fhas or seeing delayed closings or just impacts of some of the laid off or not laid off furloughed workers where you re not maybe delinquencies and stuff and if it extends for longer what are some of the impacts you might see michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations mihir this is mike so the short answer to the first part of your question is no we haven t seen any impact to it from the conventional lending world the irs is processing their verification of employment and things of that nature what happens if it extends longer we ll have to wait and see clearly the number of workers compared to the overall employment base and homeowner base is relatively small but who knows we ll see how long it lasts and what implications that has to overall economic conditions and confidence but nothing as of today mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then second question is just on going back to miq for a second and your roll out of it as you roll it out is there any expense associated with it as in if you need to roll it out faster with all the other companies doing it would there be higher incremental like maybe expenses are there some efficiencies with rolling it out versus the rate card process or is it pretty much the same patrick sinks chief executive officer this is pat it ll be more reallocation of resources so there might be some increase in expenses on the margin but nothing material mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then the other thing i was curious on the pricing itself within miq obviously it s more granular so you re able i assume that means some borrowers end up with a little bit maybe higher cost versus the rate card while some have a benefit but what if you ran your whole niw like this quarter through it would you on average end up in the same place would you end up a little bit better worse michael j zimmerman senior vice president of investor relations mihir this is mike we are not going to make any comments and won t make any comments relative to pricing what it s been or where it could be in the future mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay fair enough i think i mean just the last question obviously new leadership at the fhfa and i was curious a couple of years ago there was a fair amount of stock around deep mi and hoping to do that new leadership at least in past before they assumed their roles had shown i think more openness to private markets taking on some more risk so i was curious if that is something you see happening or is it just out of the question with the way the government congressional shutdowns and opposing parties being in charge et cetera patrick sinks chief executive officer this is pat it s difficult to predict for the reasons you said at the end there that it will happen because there s so many moving parts including political reality that said we believe it continues to be a good idea and it s a discussion we want to have with mr calabria and mr otting depending on how it plays out so it s something we will continue to pursue because we think it s the right thing to do in terms of housing policy it s the right way of de risking the gses we think we will have a receptive audience in terms of they re willing to listen but will it actually translate into action that remains to be seen mihir bhatia bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator operator instructions you have a follow up question from bose george from kbw your line is now open bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst hey guys thanks actually just a quick follow up on the iln the cost of the iln this quarter was that in the niw premium number that you gave the 50 2 basis points timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer the cost of the iln for this quarter would be are you talking about oh the 50 2 basis points that s on a direct basis so that is not included in there bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay and then just to clarify the 10 million run rate annualized cost of the iln did you say that was fully in the numbers for this quarter and were there some other expenses as well timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say it was more heavily weighted this quarter than it would be at a run rate going forward and i d say it s slightly less than 10 million a year so if you look at the run rate for this quarter that would get you above the 10 million so a little bit of additional cost associated with it in the initial quarter that starts up but on a run rate going forward again i think something just shy of 10 million on the premium bose george keefe bruyette woods analyst okay great thanks timothy j mattke executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator there are no further questions at this time you may continue patrick sinks chief executive officer okay this is pat thank you for
