what s new the iran nuclear deal is entering its fourth year of implementation with iran remaining in full compliance with its obligations meanwhile the trump administration which unilaterally withdrew the u s from the deal in may 2018 has reimposed punitive sanctions on iran these have started to bite why does it matter the u s appears to believe that economic and other pressure will compel iran to renegotiate suspend its ballistic missile program or reduce its regional footprint or even trigger regime shaking unrest iran s patience to date could snap leading it to violate the nuclear deal itself or retaliate against u s assets nearby what should be done to prevent an escalation tehran should continue complying with the deal exercise restraint and help calm regional conflicts it should also reform its banking sector other remaining signatories should engage iran diplomatically and economically candidates in the 2020 u s presidential election should say they would rejoin the deal if elected executive summary that the iran nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa has so far survived the may 2018 u s withdrawal is remarkable owing much to the other signatories efforts to keep it alive but with washington actively undermining the deal through reimposition and aggressive enforcement of sanctions with increasing risks of spillover from growing regional tensions and reports that some u s officials want a confrontation the agreement remains highly vulnerable iran might well persist with its present approach of complying with the deal and waiting out the trump administration but it will require continued efforts by europe in particular as well as russia and china to provide it with diplomatic and economic incentives tehran could facilitate these efforts by enhancing its banking standards and demonstrating its ability to play a more constructive role in the region starting with pressing the huthis in yemen to fully implement the initial deal brokered by the un special envoy democratic candidates in the 2020 u s presidential election should affirm their intent to rejoin the deal it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the jcpoa entering its fourth year of implementation is serving its primary objective according to the international atomic energy agency iaea iran s nuclear program remains contained within the limits imposed by the deal yet the deal s core bargain ie sanctions relief in return for nuclear restrictions and monitoring has unravelled as the reimposition of u s sanctions has deprived iran of most of the promised benefits while unilateral u s sanctions are proving effective they have left iran with rapidly dwindling oil revenues and contributed to skyrocketing inflation while washington s ultimate goals are not entirely clear the u s administration appears determined to push iran s economy down to the ground international investors and traders out of the country and the iranian people into the streets for some officials the objective is to bring iran back to the negotiating table for others to pressure it to curb its regional actions and ballistic missile program and for still others to destabilise or even topple the regime the jcpoa s fate now seems to depend on a three way race against the clock the u s is trying to bring maximum pressure to bear on iran in the minimum amount of time in the hope that iran s economy crumbles iran is exercising patience in the hope that the trump administration fails becomes distracted or is ousted from power in 2020 and europe has embarked on an earnest but largely symbolic scramble to prevent the deal s derailment by offering iran enough economic and diplomatic incentives for it to remain in the deal without deepening the trans atlantic rift even assuming the deal survives until these potential turning points reverting to the status quo ante might not be sustainable against the low probability of renegotiation given tehran s reluctance to validate trump s pressure policy or of regime change and considering iran s extensive experience in surviving economic duress and suppressing dissent washington might succeed in strangling iran s economy without achieving any of its goals instead it could lead iran to evade the deal s nuclear constraints or to use its proxies to target u s assets in the region both steps in turn could provoke a military confrontation to add another element of uncertainty political jockeying in both capitals is likely to increase in the run up to iran s 2020 parliamentary and 2021 presidential elections and a potential transition to a new supreme leader and the u s presidential election in 2020 even assuming the deal survives until these potential turning points reverting to the status quo ante might not be sustainable if trump wins re election it would be hard to imagine iran weathering another four years of crippling sanctions if a democratic candidate were to prevail he or she might well agree to resume u s compliance with the deal but also face strong pressure to fortify the jcpoa given that in 2024 the sun will set on key limits on iran s uranium enrichment capacity in other words at some point in the future there is a high probability that a successor agreement building on the jcpoa will be required while iran does not wish to contemplate this scenario at present the fact is that none of the parties to the jcpoa is fully satisfied with the deal neither iran because even under the obama administration sanctions relief was insufficient nor the u s or europe because certain nuclear constraints will expire relatively quickly and the deal does not limit tehran s ballistic missile program and regional activities the next two years could thus be well spent exploring options for a more sustainable successor arrangement that advances all sides interests ultimately the same calculus that brought iran and world powers to com promise after thirteen years of standoff and two years of intensive negotiations and which has led remaining jcpoa signatories to preserve it without the u s still holds the alternatives to this agreement a race between sanctions and centrifuges that could culminate in iran obtaining the bomb or being bombed would be much worse they still can and should be avoided tehran washington brussels 16 january 2019 use our interactive timeline to track the history of the iran nuclear deal i introduction in an era that now seems a distant memory the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa received unanimous un security council endorsement on 20 july 2015 it entered into force on 18 october 2015 and started being implemented on 16 january 2016 after the international atomic energy agency iaea certified iran s fulfilment of its commitments triggering sanctions relief in the last two years status reports crisis group noted that while iran improved over time in meeting its nuclear commitments sanctions relief failed to deliver on iran s arguably inflated expectations of an economic payoff donald trump s election in november 2016 made matters far worse trump as candidate had sworn to withdraw the u s from the accord as president he took a first stab at undermining the deal in october 2017 when he refused to certify it on the grounds that sanctions relief had been disproportionate to iranian nuclear concessions by january 2018 trump indicated he had run out of patience with his national security team s efforts and congress s reluctance to amend the deal thus while renewing u s sanctions waivers on 12 january 2018 he declared that he would nix the deal if congress and europe failed to fix it by may 2018 after several rounds of intense negotiations between the uk france and germany collectively known as the e3 and the trump administration a mutually acceptable compromise among western powers seemed within reach but trump deemed the progress insufficient and pulled the u s out of the jcpoa on 8 may 2018 starting the clock on the u s sanctions snapback the remaining jcpoa signatories have protested washington s decision and tried to keep iran compliant with the deal by actively working to preserve some of its economic dividends though their efforts are politically commendable their ability to cajole private sector actors in particular has been extremely limited as a result unilateral u s sanctions have inflicted serious harm on the iranian economy at the same time the trump administration has outlined at least thirteen demands upon iran entailing an overhaul of its nuclear foreign and defence policies it has also launched a diplomatic and information campaign against iran coordinated by a dedicated unit at the state department the combination of these measures has convinced the iranian leadership that washington s real motive might be more than behaviour change as it enters its fourth year of implementation the jcpoa is growing increasingly vulnerable this report which examines what will need to be done to both salvage the deal and avoid a regional escalation is based on interviews conducted throughout the year with european iranian and u s officials and private sector stakeholders as well as iaea officials it analyses the third year record of implementation and draws lessons from it it suggests that besides iran remaining compliant with the deal and efforts by other remaining co signatories to provide tehran with economic and diplomatic incentives to do so one way of sustaining the accord is to quietly explore ways to bolster it loading video crisis group s middle east north africa program director joost hiltermann visits tehran to assess the impact of u s sanctions on iran crisisgroup ii implementation record a mixed bag the bargain at the jcpoa s core is delivering mixed results the accord continues to verifiably restrict and rigorously monitor iran s nuclear program but the u s exit and reimposition of its nuclear related sanctions supplemented by new ones have largely deprived iran of the deal s promised economic dividends a nuclear commitments since january 2016 the iaea has verified iran s jcpoa compliance on thirteen separate occasions and the un secretary general has attested six times that iran is abiding by its jcpoa obligations the u s withdrawal notwithstanding iran has even enhanced its cooperation with the iaea a clear attempt at depriving the u s of any pretext for shifting the blame to iran tehran committed no technical infringements in the third implementation year and kept a comfortable distance from the jcpoa s thresholds for stockpiles of sensitive material ie 130 metric tonnes for heavy water and 300kg for low enriched uranium iran operated no more than 5 060 ir 1 centrifuges at natanz and no more than 1 044 ir 1 centrifuges at fordow progress lagged on the conversion of the heavy water reactor in arak into a proliferation resistant one and the bunkered fordow facility into a research and medical isotope production centre but these delays for which the u s withdrawal along with complex negotiations over technical designs and costs were largely responsible do not constitute a violation of the agreement indeed the u s sanctions snapback compounded the problem having designated the atomic energy organisation of iran aeoi and 23 of its subsidiaries as sanctioned entities the trump administration granted waivers for the arak and fordow projects as well as the bushehr power plant where russia provides fuel for the existing light water reactor repatriates its spent fuel and is constructing two additional power reactor units while in the words of a trump administration official these measures demonstrate that the u s does not stand in the way of a civilian nuclear program in iran the details of these waivers remain ambiguous creating doubt about their sustainability and thus causing additional delays in these facilities completion israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu strove to prompt an inspection crisis which could put iran if it were to deny un inspectors access to suspect sites in non compliance nuclear cooperation as outlined in jcpoa annex iii is one of the accord s key components yet it is voluntary in october the iaea held an international workshop on radioactive waste management in iran the european union eu which has invested 20 million in enhancing the country s nuclear safety practices held its third high level seminar on nuclear cooperation with iran in november 2018 but tangible progress remains scant the jcpoa s procurement channel for iran to gain access to dual use material and equipment managed by the joint commission s procurement working group also seems to have slowed down while it received and processed the same number of applications as in 2017 ie eighteen related to export of dual use technology to iran it received only one from germany after the u s reimposed its first round of sanctions in august 2018 by provisionally implementing the iaea s additional protocol to the comprehensive safeguards agreement as well as all the supplementary enhanced safeguards and transparency measures outlined in the jcpoa iran put its nuclear program under the most robust inspection regime currently in existence nonetheless israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu strove to prompt an inspection crisis which could put iran if it were to deny un inspectors access to suspect sites in non compliance in april netanyahu revealed 55 000 pages of documents and another 55 000 files on 183 cds that israeli intelligence operatives removed from a clandestine archive in tehran in early 2018 in september he claimed the existence of another warehouse in tehran containing as much as 300 tons of nuclear related equipment and material in 15 shipping containers he also alleged that the facility had held 15kg of radioactive material that iran had since dispersed around tehran he charged that the iaea was not doing enough to follow up on information on iran s past nuclear weapons work and called on the agency s director general to do the right thing go inspect this atomic warehouse immediately before the iranians finish clearing it out the iaea however did not succumb to pressures to politicise its verification work in iran nor did other countries with whom israel shared the intelligence alter their approach a concern during this period was that in response to u s violations iran could tinker with the deal around the edges while it did not do so supreme leader ali khamenei ordered the aeoi to quickly make preparations to reach to 190 000 swu in case european efforts to mitigate the impact of u s sanctions failed in response the aeoi reopened a plant for the production of uranium hexafluoride or uf6 which is the feedstock for centrifuges refurbished the electrical infrastructure at natanz enrichment site and built a factory that purportedly can produce rotors for up to 60 advanced centrifuges per day more recently iran announced preliminary steps to design a more efficient 20 per cent fuel assembly for the tehran research reactor none of these steps violates the jcpoa but in a clear attempt by iran to increase the pressure on the remaining parties to the deal signalled what its unravelling could entail b sanctions relief commitments following the lifting of nuclear related international sanctions in january 2016 the contours of an iranian economic recovery took shape iran s gdp growth rate was at 1 6 per cent in the year before the deal and then swelled to 12 5 per cent in the year after it took effect continuing to grow by 3 7 per cent in 2017 2018 inflation fell to single digits yet despite the inking of several marquee deals with major foreign firms normalising banking ties remained a challenge growth had already stalled by the summer of 2017 as uncertainties around the jcpoa s fate drove away much needed foreign investment and left the market in limbo the u s decision to withdraw from the jcpoa made those fears real scores of international companies announced that they would end or suspend their operations in iran even before u s sanctions formally came into effect these came in two major tranches an initial set of non oil sanctions on 7 august and a second more significant batch on 5 november against over 700 persons and entities including around 300 new targets as per previous sanctions 2010 2013 these latter sanctions targeted iran s lifeline its oil exports officially aimed at reducing these exports to nil the trump administration s maximalism helped it remove as much iranian oil from the market approximately one million barrels per day as its predecessor did with international support before the jcpoa more damaging to the iranian economy than the reduced volume of oil exports is the requirement under u s sanctions that their proceeds which constitute 35 per cent of government revenue as per the annual budget remain locked in escrow accounts that can only be used for imports from those countries perhaps most indicative of iran s post sanctions economic troubles is its currency crisis which saw the rial lose nearly 70 per cent of its value from march to september 2018 in fact u s sanctions pushed at an open door exposing inherent weaknesses in iran s economy and policymakers missteps in addressing them even before sanctions snapped back iran s banking sector burdened by a high percentage of nonperforming loans was reaching breaking point dozens of unlicensed credit unions which had mushroomed over the past few years became insolvent in 2017 sending angry depositors into the streets to calm the situation the government bailed out these institutions and repaid the depositors adding to the already ballooning money supply in parallel to slashing interest rates to protect their assets or secure a profit many iranians started converting their rial holdings into foreign currencies and gold the increase in demand for hard currencies coincided with challenges iran faced in repatriating its oil revenues as in early 2018 financial regulators in dubai and turkey severed banking channels to iran sensing the shortage of hard currency the market panicked and the rial whose value the government had kept artificially high for six years started to slide against the u s dollar the government s response was disastrous starting with its failure to take precautionary measures it then exacerbated the crisis by reducing the official exchange rate by about 15 per cent and unifying it with the open market rate restricting movement of capital out of iran declaring possession of foreign currency in excess of 10 000 illegal blaming the crisis on speculators its internal rivals and foreign foes and shutting down foreign exchange bureaus while injecting dollars into the market these steps empowered the black market accelerated capital flight and permitted rent seekers to benefit from arbitrage in august iranian officials projected that the country would lose nearly a million jobs by march 2019 as a result of sanctions then in august in a major turnabout the government decided to stop dictating the exchange rate allowing the open market to do so in parallel however and to combat the ensuing inflation it maintained the exchange rate of 42 000 rials to the u s dollar for importing 14 billion worth of essential staples with more revised fiscal policies the rial regained some ground and was trading at around 116 000 to the u s dollar on 14 january 2019 in the open market nonetheless devaluation caused prices of imported consumer goods and domestically produced goods using imported intermediate components to soar the year on year inflation rate in december 2018 reached 34 9 per cent in august iranian officials projected that the country would lose nearly a million jobs by march 2019 as a result of sanctions while the currency crisis has had some upsides for the government eg allowing it to pay most of its debt to the banking sector and stem capital flight it took a toll on the rouhani administration which many iranians perceived as impotent at best and incompetent at worst the president was forced to replace the central bank s governor in july in october he made four new appointments to key cabinet positions after parliament impeached the labour and economy ministers in november he accepted his key pro market economic adviser s masoud nili resignation and in january 2019 he had to let go of his health minister who had protested budget cuts and in a rare move parliament summoned the president for questioning in parallel the rouhani administration has striven to blunt the impact of u s sanctions it has emphasised expanding trade relations with iran s neighbours an oil bourse the iran energy exchange has begun oil sales from the national iranian oil company to private buyers notwithstanding the oil minister s concerns that it may lead to massive embezzlement as during previous sanctions regimes there are indications that iran is reviving a practice of blurring its crude oil shipments by disabling oil tankers location transponders tehran is also mulling using cryptocurrencies to evade u s sanctions in august supreme leader khamenei authorised the establishment of special courts to try economic corruption cases if past is prologue however efforts to tackle corruption will face an uphill battle at a time when iran increasingly relies on smuggling and black market trade to circumvent sanctions the black market s allure will also undermine the government s push to get other power centres to approve a hotly debated series of bills intended to remedy deficiencies in iran s anti money laundering and terrorism financing policies along the lines prescribed by the financial action task force fatf a key expectation of europeans trying to help iran preserve some of its banking channels to the outside world as with previous rounds the new u s sanctions inevitably will create winners and losers and have unintended consequences persons and groups with greatest access to state privileges particularly the islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc which controls borders are best positioned to survive and even thrive in the new environment in contrast the middle class and the poor bear the brunt of the economic duress reports from tehran suggest the emergence of a black market in medications and medical supplies amid shortages and rising prices the u s blacklisting of parsian bank one of iran s most reputable private sector institutions which u s treasury officials allege has links with seven to eight degrees of separation to iran s paramilitary basij force has had a chilling effect banking restrictions have also reportedly impeded food imports while iranian officials claim that the aviation sector whose hopes of a post jcpoa fleet overhaul were dashed is encountering difficulties refuelling in europe iran may be under severe sanctions but the u s maximum pressure campaign is not air tight with the world bank forecasting a marked rise in inflation and a 1 6 per cent economic contraction in 2018 2019 and a further 3 7 per cent shrinkage in 2019 2020 in addition to skyrocketing unemployment iran s short to medium term economic picture is increasingly bleak that said sources of resilience exist within the iranian economy the country s foreign debt to gdp ratio is among the lowest in the world it has a cushion of hard currency reserves estimated at more than 100 billion non oil exports are on the rise providing iran with a positive trade balance and tehran hopes that the remaining jcpoa signatories and other friendly nations will throw it an additional lifeline iran may be under severe sanctions but the u s maximum pressure campaign is not air tight as market realities compelled washington to grant eight waivers to key consumers of iranian energy washington allowed two more economic carve outs a temporary allowance for iraq s import of iranian electricity and an exclusion for iran s chabahar port the former was an acknowledgment of iraq s ongoing reliance on iranian natural gas supplies while the latter was a priority for india as well as afghanistan the full impact of sanctions largely will depend on how far china and india iran s largest oil customers will go in accommodating u s demands to significantly reduce their imports from iran by april 2019 when existing waivers expire on switzerland s ability to establish a banking channel aimed at supporting humanitarian trade ie food medicine and medical equipment with iran and on how successful europe will be in facilitating trade with iran though its special purpose vehicle spv the mechanism is designed to bypass u s restrictions through an accounting firm backed by the e3 s central banks that would establish a barter system using credits from iranian exports to europe to pay for european exports to iran without requiring monetary transfers that said even though these factors can make a difference none is likely to deliver genuine economic relief their significance in other words will be as much if not more political than financial iii a race against time the jcpoa s fate now seems to depend on a three way race against time the u s hopes to impose maximum pressure on iran as quickly as possible in the hope that iran s economy crumbles iran is exercising patience in the hope that the trump administration fails becomes distracted or is voted out of office in 2020 and europe is scrambling to put more time on tehran s clock while avoiding a deepening of the trans atlantic rift a washington maximum pressure the trump administration has been clear on two aspects of its middle east policy iran is the source of the region s ills and sanctions are the chief tool for countering it not all officials agree on the ultimate objective though all agree on the means that ought to be used and that an iran under economic pressure is better than one that is not the administration also is seeking to mobilise its allies against iran s ballistic missile tests and a wide range of other purported iranian misdeeds ranging from alleged non compliance with the chemical weapons convention to the treatment of protesters and endemic top down corruption by reinstating sanctions while iran remains within the restraints of the jcpoa the u s can in the words of a senior administration official have our cake and eat it too violate the agreement while iran abides by it beyond that some officials are satisfied at the thought that this gambit could deprive tehran of some resources it uses to project power in the region several administration officials including trump himself claim that they already are seeing tangible results such as diminished iranian deployment of and financial support for militant groups it is hard to square these contentions however with u s accusations of heightened activity by pro iranian shiite groups in iraq or continued claims of iranian destabilising behaviour in yemen more hawkish members of the administration go farther in believing that economic distress could prompt domestic unrest at a minimum compelling the iranian leadership to focus far more on internal than on external issues in what they consider the optimal scenario despite repeated assertions that regime change is not u s policy sanctions might destabilise the regime and trigger its collapse national security advisor john bolton reportedly hopes that tehran s reaction to increased pressure directly or through one of its proxies could provide the u s with the opportunity to conduct military operations against iran when in september the u s accused iran of encouraging shiite militias to target u s facilities in basra and baghdad some officials allegedly argued that an appropriate response would be to target iran itself bolton is said to have asked the pentagon for plans for a military strike in response then secretary of defense jim mattis is said to have opposed any such endeavour secretary of state mike pompeo s warning that the u s would not stand idly by if iran were to go ahead with plans for launching satellites sounded equally ominous possibly presaging some form of retaliation should iran proceed trump himself alongside several other officials still appears interested in and intent on negotiating a new deal with iran believing it is only a question of time before pressure drives tehran back to the bargaining table indeed to the apparent consternation of his more hard line advisers he has set no precondition for commencing negotiations some officials seem confident that talks between tehran and washington will occur before trump s first term ends there are even reports that u s officials have reached out to iranian officials to discuss the fate of u s prisoners in iran and the future of afghanistan although to date iran reportedly has rebuffed the outreach the more washington threatens tehran the likelier iran is to double down on policies it deems key to its national security so far there is little evidence that the administration is meeting any of its possible goals a preliminary internal assessment by the administration described to crisis group purportedly concludes that the u s approach has yet to curb iran s behaviour or entice tehran back to the negotiating table iran has accelerated the pace of its ballistic missile testing and according to u s officials continues to transfer missile parts to huthi rebels in yemen and to hizbollah in lebanon and syria more broadly there is little historical evidence of any correlation between iran s economic performance and regional policies likewise though many european capitals share washington s concerns about iran s ballistic missile tests and regional activities the trump administration s brazen campaigning including stark warnings to european firms not to evade u s sanctions has stirred resentment in europe and thus discouraged the kind of united front sought by the u s as further discussed below prospects for achieving the other purported u s goal new negotiations on a broader deal appear dim given iran s fear that agreeing to talks would only validate trump s approach and its insistence that the u s re enter into compliance with the jcpoa before the two countries discuss anything more in the same vein the more washington threatens tehran the likelier iran is to double down on policies it deems key to its national security its ballistic missile program a legacy of having been a victim of these weapons during the war with iraq 1980 1988 and its sole reliable conventional deterrent and the network of partners and proxies it has built in the region in part to protect against external threats b tehran maximum patience there is broad consensus in tehran that waiting out the trump administration is the best option available to iran at least until now iran has seen greater benefit in respecting the nuclear deal taking advantage of growing u s european tensions heightened u s isolation and eu efforts to mitigate the effect of u s sanctions than in itself violating the accord and reconstituting a united international front against it as an irgc strategist put it iran will stay in the jcpoa as long as we can use it to delegitimise u s actions iran also appears to have sought to avoid provoking the u s or as a senior iranian official put it be provoked by engaging in more aggressive behaviour in the region lest it encourage international buy in to the u s pressure campaign or military retaliation u s isolation confirmation of iran s moral high ground by the international court of justice and european efforts have allowed the rouhani administration to continue on its current path hoping that trump will lose in 2020 and that the next u s president will rejoin the jcpoa in practice however u s sanctions have turned out to be economically devastating threatening the sustainability of iran s strategic patience policy and increasing pressure in tehran to respond in december iran s former nuclear negotiator saeed jalili accused the rouhani administration of weakness and wasting the country s time for seven months only to see whether they will ratify or not in january 2019 the country s national security adviser warned that the time for europe to salvage the deal had ran out even members of the rouhani government are now questioning their own response to the u s withdrawal as overly timid iranians regularly convey these frustrations to their european interlocutors warning of the consequences of the deal s demise they periodically have floated the notion of a less for less arrangement pursuant to which iran would roll back some of the jcpoa s restraints and monitoring measures as a means of reciprocating the reimposition of u s sanctions but europe has firmly rejected any tinkering with the deal s limits pointing out that though we oppose the u s withdrawal from the accord it is for us essentially a non proliferation agreement which means that any iranian violation of its nuclear components would immediately trigger european sanctions a senior iranian official claimed that some in tehran were advocating going so far as to withdraw from the non proliferation treaty thereby ending all iaea inspections and limits on iran s nuclear program whether the calculus in tehran will change and under what conditions is unclear some officials assert that iran will reach the breaking point if and when its oil exports fall below 700 000 barrels per day which they fear could trigger hyper inflation and nationwide protests domestic politics and jockeying ahead of iran s forthcoming elections and a possible struggle to succeed supreme leader khamenei also could play a part increasing hardline criticism of the rouhani administration rouhani s weakening could allow the hardliners who have lost every election in iran since 2012 to retake the parliament in 2020 and the presidency in 2021 putting them in better position to determine who and what comes after khamenei for his part having watched his economic achievements and popular support vanish rouhani is likely to further align himself with the supreme leader ensuring that even if his presidency seems doomed he can survive politically beyond it as a potential heir to khamenei s mantle should iran decide that it must respond its reprisal could take several forms tehran could creep past some of the jcpoa s boundaries both as a show of defiance and in hopes of pressuring the deal s remaining parties to do more to save it on the lower end of the spectrum iran could overproduce a few kilograms of heavy water beyond the 130 tonne limit imposed by the deal such an infringement would fall in what an eu official called a grey zone an action inconsistent with the accord but which other co signatories might not view as a justification for entirely scrapping the deal riskier would be a decision to accumulate more than 300kg of low enriched uranium enrich at a level higher than 3 67 per cent testing a higher number of advanced centrifuges than allowed or interfere with iaea monitoring a senior iranian official claimed that some in tehran were advocating going so far as to withdraw from the non proliferation treaty thereby ending all iaea inspections and limits on iran s nuclear program alternatively iran could choose to respond asymmetrically by raising pressure on the u s presence in the region this option arguably could be more attractive to tehran given that it could hide its hand by using proxies or allies thereby reducing the risk of a european reaction and given its relatively strong hand in the region speaking in october a senior iranian national security official surmised that the likeliest theatre for such a confrontation might well be iraq we can add more fuel to the fires in yemen but that would not directly affect the u s there are u s forces in afghanistan but we lack the kind of assets there that we possess in the levant we have the upper hand in lebanon and syria but the situation in both countries is quite fragile and our gains could be quickly reversed by adversaries and even friends iraq is where we have experience plausible deniability and the requisite capability to hit the u s below the threshold that would prompt a direct retaliation the above scenarios individually or in combination are worrying especially given the risk of miscalculation in the absence of any reliable channels of communication between the u s and iran the alternative approach renewing negotiations with the u s seems unlikely even though it has been debated in tehran according to iranian officials decision makers considered three options seriously negotiate with the trump administration engage in talks as a means of gaining time or reject negotiations until the u s comes back into compliance with the jcpoa they seem to have quickly ruled out both genuine and tactical negotiations concluding that risks outweighed potential benefits any indication of a willingness to talk they feared could validate trump s approach demonstrating that pressure works and thus inviting more for iran to negotiate after it scaled back or froze its nuclear program and at a time when u s sanctions were biting would have the added disadvantage of allowing the u s to deal from a position of relative strength moreover washington s harsh rhetoric toward the iranian leadership has in the words of a senior iranian diplomat rendered the trump administration radioactive in tehran and therefore engagement with it a liability not an asset for any iranian politician the precedent of north korea s engagement with the trump administration might plausibly have convinced tehran to give talks a try after all talks between trump and north korean leader kim jong un have lessened pressure on pyongyang without forcing it to markedly curb its nuclear program a senior iranian official mused that talks between presidents trump and rouhani could result in a vague statement including commitments already made by iran under the jcpoa eg a commitment never to seek a nuclear weapon reduction of economic pressure on iran and a declaration of a historic breakthrough by the u s president nevertheless even he had concluded that engaging in talks would be politically perilous and offer overly uncertain returns unlike the north korean case moreover both regional and domestic u s forces seem eager for a confrontational relationship with iran reducing the likelihood that a summit alone would fundamentally change dynamics too trump s unpredictable and mercurial behaviour the hardline views adopted by his senior advisers both bolton and pompeo and his administration s pursuit of maximalist demands in talks with pyongyang at least according to briefings iranians claim to have received from their north korean counterparts further discouraged iranian advocates of negotiations arguably bolstering the case for a wait and see approach some iranian hardliners interpret u s actions in recent weeks from outreach to iran to discuss afghanistan s future to announcement of a withdrawal from syria as signs of growing acceptance of iran and abating risks of confrontation for the time being the leadership in tehran seemingly believes that it can remain afloat economically at least until 2021 and does not seem particularly concerned about internal stability it rests relatively easy despite a steady stream of demonstrations and strikes by almost all strata of iranian society from truckers to teachers university students women dervishes steel workers in ahvaz and sugar mill workers in haft tappeh the political elite is taking solace in the fact that although the number of protests is higher than previous years their scale and scope have not been increasing and that there is no obvious link among protesters in various cities whether the political establishment has taken the correct measure of its domestic challenge is uncertain but it appears to believe that it understands the scope of popular discontent that it has the will and capability to manage and if necessary suppress dissent that it has done the necessary to shield its core constituents ie the lower income more pious strata from the effects of u s sanctions and that it has placated other elements sufficiently to prevent their grievances from snowballing into a nationwide crisis in an attempt to further undermine the protesters the leadership has warned against a possible syria cisation سوریه سازی of the country its violent fragmentation along ethnic and sectarian fault lines purportedly as a result of efforts undertaken by the u s and its allies iran s projected image of self confidence is somewhat belied by the government s aggressive reaction to what it views as attempts to destabilise it it has thus responded brazenly to attacks claimed by ethnic minorities and the islamic state isis with missile strikes in iraq and syria and according to european officials targeting dissidents on european soil as further described below c brussels maxed out europe s strategy boils down to buying more time for cooler heads to prevail in tehran and return to power in washington this approach however has turned out to be a more difficult undertaking than initially anticipated europe awoke to the reality that there is very little state institutions can do to challenge the u s dollar s global pre eminence or dictate commercial decisions in an open market this realisation gave rise to debate over the need to restore europe s economic sovereignty but this ambition assuming it is pursued is unlikely to bear fruit to iran s benefit in the foreseeable future as a french diplomat put it we have been clear with the iranians that we cannot compensate them for the impact of the u s exit but we will do what we can to help them save face by preserving as much as possible of our economic trade for their part iranians have a difficult time adjusting to this reality an iranian diplomat said europe has the political but not the practical will to stand up to the u s in reality the measures taken by europe while symbolically significant have yet to deliver practical dividends for iran in august the eu updated its 1996 blocking statute that prohibits european companies from complying with secondary u s sanctions imposed on iran unless they are specifically authorised to do so firms that choose to comply with u s sanctions could now be subject to fines by european member states yet even though some companies have left iran specifically citing u s sanctions member states have taken no notable enforcement measures since august iranian officials perceive other steps such as the european commission s earmarking 18 million of a 50 million package for projects in support of sustainable economic and social development in iran as too little too late brussels has also had a few policy setbacks the european investment bank which was authorised by the european parliament and commission to lend to european projects in iran chose not to do so lest it jeopardise its ability to raise funds in u s markets in the same vein european governments efforts to spare the belgium based swift financial messaging service came to naught as the company gave in to u s demands to disconnect most iranian banks including the country s central bank from its network refusal of some european member states to host the special purpose vehicle dealt another blow to the credibility of these efforts much will depend on the spv s effectiveness as the lynchpin of europe s efforts to preserve the jcpoa the mechanism will be registered in the coming weeks in france led by a german official and have the e3 as its shareholders while the channel which offers a sophisticated compensation service for exports from and imports to iran is not primarily designed to be a humanitarian one european officials expect that it will initially be used primarily for food and medicine until more trust is built in its sustainability a key question is how the u s will react as a senior eu official put it the spv is not a magic wand it is designed to give confidence to the market and without creating darkness at the heart of the global financial system it is a fully transparent mechanism where due diligence knowledge could be shared as a corollary the u s could target it while the e3 s central banks ownership likely renders targeting the channel politically prohibitive for u s regulators the spv s transparent nature renders its users vulnerable to u s penalties moreover european companies may err on the side of over compliance with u s sanctions avoiding business with iran altogether given these challenges it is easy to overlook the europeans remarkable achievement in maintaining a united front in support of the jcpoa notwithstanding u s pressure especially on eastern european states and europe s conviction that iran plotted to kill dissidents on european soil the latter point was particularly costly and as a senior european official put it plotting assassinations on european soil is the most damaging thing iran could do after violating the jcpoa and sinking a u s warship in so doing tehran was playing with fire risking a significant backlash including against the jcpoa by the europeans tehran has publicly referred to these attacks as false flag operations aimed at driving a wedge between iran and europe and privately as either that an entrapment operation or the work of rogue agents but european officials say they possess strong evidence of iran s security apparatus s involvement in the plots on 8 january the eu approved targeted sanctions against two iranian officials and a unit at iran s intelligence ministry iran protested the targeted sanctions but so far they have not affected either party s decision to maintain economic and diplomatic ties in an effort to preserve the nuclear deal iv die another day while the u s exit from the jcpoa has not delivered the deal a fatal blow 2019 could prove even more challenging than the past two years politics in iran and the u s are likely to get more contentious as both countries near momentous elections as sanctions take their toll on the iranian people and especially if mitigation efforts by remaining jcpoa signatories prove unsatisfactory hardline voices in the iranian leadership that favour leaving the agreement or making the u s pay for its actions will grow louder their renewed aggressiveness coupled with electoral calculations could call into question iran s policy of strategic patience in washington trump s unpredictability aside two developments in 2020 could add more pressure on time in mutually reinforcing ways one is the u s presidential election which could be both a moment to showcase the results of trump s iran policy and a time to sharpen differences between the administration and democratic opponents the second is the scheduled removal of the un security council imposed conventional arms embargo on iran that based on the jcpoa s timetable should be lifted in october 2020 particularly against the backdrop of national elections the prospect of an embargo lift will likely amplify hawkish voices looking to increase pressure on iran and against the jcpoa finally regional tensions which have pitted iran in a simultaneous three front cold war against the u s israel and saudi arabia inevitably heighten the risk of an inadvertent or deliberate confrontation especially if as noted above some u s officials see benefit in a military clash as detailed in crisis group s iran u s trigger list an incident at any one of the points of friction among the parties be it in yemen syria iraq lebanon or the gulf or related to iran s missile tests could escalate with unpredictable consequences avoiding these scenarios should be the priority for the coming year and will require several steps to begin iran should not test the jcpoa s boundaries or escalate regional tensions either of which actions could persuade europe to join the u s in its pressure campaign and aggravate the potential for of a military confrontation by demonstrating its willingness to play a more constructive role in the region it could instead reduce the odds of both arguably the most likely place to start is yemen where un sponsored talks offer a genuine hope for de escalation and potential resolution of the four year long conflict as detailed in crisis group s reports just as the u s and western countries need to exert pressure on saudi arabia and the united arab emirates so too does iran need to press the huthis to fully implement the initial deal brokered by the un special envoy martin griffiths and engage in peace negotiations in good faith iran s regional discussions with the e4 the e3 plus italy should be deepened and broadened to other security issues of common interest beyond yemen relatedly just as belligerent iranian behaviour on the regional scene could alienate europe so too would a violent crackdown on protesters or human rights activists let alone fresh attempts to kill dissidents on european soil european states should continue to regularly engage politically with iranian officials at a high level if iran wishes to maximise benefits from the spv and other banking mechanisms it should approve and implement outstanding legislation including two bills on iran s accession to international conventions on terrorism financing and transnational organised crime to fully address the due diligence transparency regulatory and other concerns laid out in its fatf action plan failure to do so could render the reputational cost of working with the iranian banking sector prohibitive for international banks and may lead to the reimposition of suspended fatf counter measures that would further isolate iran s financial sector as far as europe is concerned it should focus on protecting and maintaining the jcpoa to that end the e3 ought to make every effort to ensure that the spv succeeds most importantly by providing clear briefings to european firms interested in using it for legitimate trade with iran russia and china should join the spv turning it into a stronger multinational mechanism going beyond economic incentives european states should continue to regularly engage politically with iranian officials at a high level this engagement could include at an appropriate time a symbolically important visit by the e3 s foreign ministers to tehran or a meeting of the jcpoa s joint commission the six remaining participants coordinated by the eu at the ministerial level to reaffirm europe s commitment to the jcpoa despite resistance by hardliners in tehran the eu should also pursue opening of an eu delegation office in tehran which could allow the eu to conduct more effective public diplomacy campaign in iran recognising iran s legitimate security concerns europe should take the lead in facilitating a regional security dialogue to lay the groundwork for an architecture tolerable to all sides in which the region s military imbalance could be addressed engagement does not mean that europe should be indifferent to iranian policies with which it has concerns including human rights violations plots against iranian dissidents on european soil or ballistic missile tests and transfers rather it means ensuring that its response to these activities does not undermine or overshadow its efforts to preserve the jcpoa any fresh sanctions should be targeted and carried out independently of steps taken to preserve the deal the u s side is more complicated as there is little hope that the trump administration will fundamentally alter its approach still some steps could be useful the newly seated house of representatives will have a much greater appetite for oversight of u s foreign policy relevant committees could hold hearings on the administration s iran policy to help shine light on where it is creating a risk of conflict and where necessary generate political pressure on the white house to take a step back as the 2020 election season gets underway democratic candidates could affirm their intent to rejoin the jcpoa as long as iran abides by its own obligations doing so would send a message to the iranian leadership that sticking to their nuclear commitments is indeed the wiser approach with regard to the administration though some senior officials might in fact wish to see iran violate the jcpoa or offer another justification for a more robust response the president himself appears to genuinely want to negotiate as discussed above there are reasons to doubt that iran will agree in the near term but the best option would be for the u s to propose discreet confidential talks focused on but not limited to the release of u s citizens imprisoned in iran under present circumstances iran probably would view public negotiations as an unacceptable surrender to u s bullying as occurred under the obama administration quiet diplomacy combined with a lowering of the rhetorical volume stands a better chance of success at the outset separately if the trump administration wants the iranian people to believe that it harbours no rancour toward them it ought to avoid impeding humanitarian trade with the country specifically the u s should not blacklist iranian banks or penalise their european or asian counterparts engaged in humanitarian trade optimally it would facilitate by issuing licenses or letters of comfort efforts by the e3 and switzerland to establish banking channels that allow the iranian people access to food medicine and other necessities the fact is that none of the parties to the jcpoa is fully satisfied with the deal for now iran s policy of wait and see is far preferable to one of nuclear brinkmanship or regional escalation but it too has its limitations it hinges on the hope that trump will have a one term presidency and that the next democratic president will choose to rejoin the jcpoa the first scenario is uncertain and while living under heavy sanctions for two more years is one thing doing so for an additional four would be quite another the second while possible would not be without its own set of challenges most of the new sanctions that the trump administration is imposing on tehran nearly 500 new designations in addition to 400 individuals and entities on whom nuclear sanctions were re imposed are non nuclear related they are framed as responses to iran s missile program and regional policies this framing could make it difficult and potentially politically costly for the next president to lift them absent major and improbable turnarounds in those areas timing also presents a potential hurdle in that jcpoa imposed limits on iran s uranium enrichment capacity are set to expire in 2024 even many of the deal s staunchest u s advocates see the importance of using the time in the run up to the sunsets to try to negotiate a supplemental and more sustainable arrangement if a candidate who favours rejoining the jcpoa wins the presidency he or she might wish to negotiate a follow on agreement with very little time left on the clock the fact is that none of the parties to the jcpoa is fully satisfied with the deal iran wishes that the sanctions relief was much more extensive both the u s and europe dislike the rapidly approaching sunset clauses regarding certain nuclear activities and would prefer to add language addressing tehran s ballistic missile program or regional activities while iran understandably feels burned by the u s s violation of the deal and thus refuses to consider a successor agreement at least so long as the u s remains in non compliance it would make sense for all parties to start considering what a better for better arrangement could look like addressing some of the u s s and europe s concerns about iran s regional and missile activities in return for additional relief from both primary and secondary u s sanctions those discussions in theory could start from scratch in january 2021 but it would be wiser to begin thinking about it in advance v conclusion the paradox of the trump administration s iran policy is that whether sanctions fail or succeed it has little chance of achieving its stated goals and runs a real risk of inducing the opposite outcome if iran perseveres in its strategic patience and opts to wait the trump presidency out the administration will have neither obtained the better deal to which it aspires nor altered iran s behaviour at that point those in the administration and among the u s s regional allies could press for a more belligerent policy a prospect to which secretary pompeo has alluded by arguing that we are accumulating risk of escalation in the region if we fail to restore deterrence conversely if sanctions and pressure truly harm iran its leadership could become less risk averse and take actions in the nuclear or regional realms inimical to u s interests hopes that domestic turmoil will threaten the iranian leadership appear equally questionable at least in the short term as discussed above years of experience in managing an anaemic economy with high inflation and extensive practice in skirting u s sanctions coupled with continued economic engagement with the eu china russia india and some of iran s neighbours could help tehran keep the economy afloat protests could well grow in scale and scope but for now there is little sign of them turning into a nationwide movement if they do the security apparatus can be expected to put its formidable repressive capability to work and if u s iranian tensions provoke a military confrontation the leadership might be better able to rally popular support and thus boost its fortunes at a time when it is embattled the jcpoa s demise is not inevitable its survival following the u s exit is largely the result of european efforts to preserve a modicum of trade with iran and of tehran s patience for now the priority should be to stay this course even as an assessment of how to bolster the deal sometime in the future begins tehran washington brussels 16

commodities are the right story for 2019 the markets are up and down like a bride s nightgown as my dad used to say bitcoin is in the toilet and tech stocks once as steady as the banks are as unreliable as an old apple computer if you re reluctant to dip your toe back into the stock market you re not alone the hunt for red october was a great movie but nobody thought red october would actually happen in october it did anyone that was invested saw their equities turn as red as a russian submarine commander the s p 500 churned when the calendar mercifully turned to november the benchmark us stock index had fallen 8 5 the worst month since february 2009 and the ugliest october since the collapse of lehman brothers in 2008 the dow and the nasdaq were equally pummeled and then it kept going december was the worst month since the great depression the financial talking heads couldn t decide what was going on the trade war with china speculation that the federal reserve would raise interest rates in december it did and slowing global growth were all trotted out as culprits algorithmic trading and end of the year tax selling also played a role as did good old profit taking by retail investors who figured it was as good a time as any to exit a nine year bull market a recent post mortem pointed the finger at retail bearish sentiment the partial us government shutdown and a weakening chinese economy despite improvement so far in 2019 some equity strategists are tempering expectations thinking that companies soon to be reported fourth quarter earnings and 2019 outlooks will be anemic so where is a smart investor cash account flush after having sold all their 2018 underperformers to park their capital in 2019 in a word commodities forget about trendy cryptocurrencies blockchain and marijuana we like investing in tangible things that create real jobs real money and real wealth the question is which commodities well an irrefutable truth right now is the global shift towards the electrification of the transportation system cars trucks buses trains as governments and businesses realize that saving the planet from certain environmental destruction involves moving from an oil based economy to one grounded on electric vehicles and sources of energy that emit fewer to no greenhouse gas emissions at ahead of the herd we re invested in commodities that ride this electrification trend among the metals we re most bullish on are copper lithium rare earths and gold the first three are crucial to this global transportation shift we continue to believe in gold because a it s smart to have gold as a portion of your portfolio most managers say 10 at minimum and b now is an excellent time to own physical gold or gold stocks all of this will be explained but first why commodities and why now we offer three reasons timing a lower us dollar and a global infrastructure build out 1 timing commodity prices rise and fall with economic conditions conventional wisdom has it that commodities tend to do well during late expansions and early recessions as the economy slows interest rates are cut to stimulate the economy remember qe the us dollar falls and demand for commodities which are priced in usd goes up along with commodity prices stocks and bonds on the other hand don t perform well during recessions a commodities supercycle can happen in the late stages of an economic expansion where growth is running so hot that companies can t produce enough commodities to keep up with demand the last commodities supercycle was between 2004 and 2008 from the bottom in 2003 to the peak in 2008 commodities rose over 300 so where are we now the popular narrative is that the great commodity supercycle of the 2000s collapsed in the great recession of 2008 then resumed from 2009 to 2011 the supercycle ended in the bear market of 2011 15 and we have only seen commodities recover since 2016 or so it goes the problem with this argument is it assumes a complete reset of commodity prices in fact this hasn t happened the prices of copper and other base metals gold and some agricultural commodities have indeed fallen from 2011 heights but not to below 2002 03 levels some like seeking alpha contributor geoffrey caveney believe that the commodity supercycle is far from over rather it s been put on pause and is about to take off again in a june 2018 commentary he writes i argue that the commodity supercycle has a lot more to do with industrial and base metals in particular since the trend was driven predominantly by china s massive consumption of industrial raw materials in its construction and infrastructure building boom of the 2000s the bottom line is this copper other base metals and iron ore are the true heart at the core of the commodity supercycle boom the boom was driven predominantly by china s voracious consumption of industrial raw materials in its construction and infrastructure building boom of the 2000s above all this required massive amounts of copper steel iron ore zinc lead and nickel most people in the market think the commodity supercycle ended with the bear market of 2011 2015 i disagree i think the supercycle merely got put on pause for a few years and i think it unpaused in 2016 the copper and base metal rally we have seen in the past couple years is the first step in the resumption of the commodity supercycle where s the evidence caveney points to the record amount of copper that china imported in spring of 2018 more than at the height of the supercycle driven by the country s belt and road initiative aimed at creating a huge infrastructure supply chain from over a hundred countries all feeding into new chinese bridges roads ports dams etc and we haven t even begun to supply the amount of copper needed for electric vehicles which promise to demand as much or more of the red metal currently used in construction transportation and communications casey research has a bit different take on the timing of commodities looking back at what happened in 2004 08 author nick rokke believes that the three tailwinds necessary for a commodities bull market strong global growth rising inflation and the expansion of credit in the united states are back again first while in 2004 all but one of the 35 countries in the oecd showed accelerating gdp growth currently all 35 countries do bloomberg graphed what global growth will look like in 2018 19 and 2022 23 of interest is what happens to china india and the us while china contributes the most to global growth in both charts it begins to pull even farther away from the us in the 2022 23 chart in 2018 19 the us and india are pretty close but in the early 2020s india contributes nearly twice to global growth as the states second inflation is on the rise again while the current us inflation rate of around 2 is within the range of the federal reserve there was no inflation in 2015 inflation is bad for bonds but good for commodities since price rises tend to float all boats including commodities third an expanding economy requires credit when the us economy is expanding as it is now people and businesses borrow more money which is used to buy products those products are made from commodities meaning demand for them increases as do their prices critics might argue that in 2004 total us credit grew by 10 versus the current measly 3 5 with the difference accounted for by the early 2000 s housing boom but as rokke maintains any time credit expands it s good for the overall economy these three conditions generally line up near the end of an economic cycle and we re in the melt up phase or late stages of the current bull market the conditions are now ripe for another supercycle in commodities dave forest also of casey research writes that a coming business inversion will be great for commodities what does this mean it means that when the business cycle expands making companies profitable and growing their dividends commodities tend to suffer the chart below compares historical dividends paid by the stocks making up the s p 500 index to the value of commodities measured by the crb index during periods of business expansion the ratio declined forest writes during each of the last four business expansion cycles the ratio of commodities to dividends dropped showing that as dividends were rising commodities were also falling but once the business cycle ends and stocks start to suffer commodities take off you can see how rising commodities lifted my ratio during each of the commodities booms blue bars that followed periods of business expansion i call this point the business inversion and it may be the most profitable pivot you can make in your portfolio this decade if you re not yet invested in commodities now s the time a resurgence is underway and it s shaping up to be the biggest bull market i ve seen in my career it appears that forest is onto something here when we look at the two main commodity indices the s p gsci gsg and the thompson reuters core commodity index crb while it s early days both show an uptick starting in the new year 2 lower dollar fed loosening a weak dollar usually means stronger commodities prices because the usd is the reserve currency and commodities are traded in dollars the value of the dollar is of crucial importance in determining the value of the commodity in question take the case of a low dollar when the dollar drops it takes less of another currency to buy dollars needed to purchase the commodity so the demand for that commodity will increase the inverse happens when the dollar strengthens as the dollar barreled along during the mining bear market of 2012 to 2016 commodity prices slumped for most of the past year however the greenback gained strength against a basket of other currencies with the us dollar index dxy rising from april until mid december as the chart below shows this is the opposite of us president trump s plan to keep the dollar low in order to make exports cheaper trump wants to bring jobs back to the us after many were exported abroad to take advantage of lower labor costs and therefore rebuild the us manufacturing sector what happened to keep the dollar high it was mostly the purchase of us treasuries a safe haven foreign investors purchased some 26 billion of t bills in may for example driven by fear of a trade war institutional and retail investors were also drawn to t bills due to their higher yields which competed with the average s p dividend yield the situation with the usd now however has changed since mid december the greenback has fallen due to doubts about the federal reserve s ability to raise interest rates any further while the fed originally planned to raise rates four more times in 2019 after last year s stock market rout it is being pressured to hold the rate hikes to two or possibly even none as the economy recovers if the dollar continues to fall and the federal reserve follows a looser monetary policy ie keeping rates low it will be good for commodities there are other factors that could affect commodities to the upside a resolution to the us china trade war would accelerate the ongoing usd downleg notes fxstreet adding in addition the rising dichotomy between the us solid fundamentals favouring further tightening and markets belief that some slowdown would be in the offing in turn prompting the fed to refrain from acting on rates this year keeps fresh usd buyers at bay and undermines any serious attempt of recovery in the dollar 3 global infrastructure spend commodities are the building blocks of the infrastructure we all rely on for daily life this includes roads bridges ports railways commercial buildings fibre optic installations sewers water lines etc iron ore and coking coal are the chief ingredients in steel copper is used in construction telecommunications and transportation and nickel is used to make stainless steel agricultural commodities feed the world and satisfy our modern day tastes without staples like wheat rice and corn billions of people would die coffee sugar and tobacco aren t life or death but doing without them would be a hardship for many these are just a few examples according to a 2017 report an expected 2 billion rise in population 46 in cities will necessitate 94 trillion in global infrastructure spending by 2040 that works out to 3 7 trillion a year an amount equal to the annual economic output of germany three of the top five countries most in need of new infrastructure are in asia china india and japan china being the world s largest commodities consumer will need about a third of the total 28 trillion the united states will have the largest gap in infrastructure spending 3 8 trillion despite trump s campaign pledge to fix america s crumbling cities much of the chinese demand will come from its belt and road initiative bri the belt refers to a network of overland road and rail routes and oil and natural gas pipelines planned to run along the major eurasian land bridges the road is a network of ports and other coastal infrastructure projects from southeast asia to east africa and the mediterranean sea taking copper as an example bri is expected to generate an extra 2 2 million tonnes of copper demand between now and 2030 that s about 10 of the total amount of copper mined throughout the world in 2017 20 million tonnes international copper study group more spending on infrastructure means more mined commodities more copper iron ore nickel zinc manganese vanadium lithium graphite rare earths etc so if we accept the reasoning that now is a good time to be getting into commodities the next question is which commodities electrification the most prevalent trend related to mined commodities is the shift driven by climate change away from the use of fossil fuels towards the electrification of the global transportation system future agenda a non profit think tank identifies three reasons for the inevitable move away from the internal combustion engine ice vehicle to the electric vehicle ev total cost of ownership brand commitment and political will battery powered electric vehicles versus hybrids or ices are already the cheapest option in the uk with a subsidy according to future agenda this is because while the up front cost of buying an ev is more than a gas vehicle owning an ev costs considerably less over time in terms of electricity use versus gasoline plus the relative lack of maintenance in an ev engine electric vehicles have far fewer moving parts than gasoline powered cars they don t have mufflers gas tanks catalytic converters or ignition systems there s also never an oil change or tune up to worry about but the clean and green doesn t end there electric drives are more efficient then the drives on ice powered cars they are able to convert more of the available energy to propel the car therefore using less energy to go the same distance auto manufacturers are increasingly investing in ev models just about all car makers are incorporating evs into their production mix and they are calling for public charging infrastructure to accommodate them volvo has banned the ice stating that this year all models will be electrics or hybrids nissan jlr daimler bmw geely and byd have made public commitments to evs the last piece is the hardest to accomplish political will in north america a very small percentage of the auto market is electric but elsewhere governments have made deeper commitments future agenda states with a focus on more co2 and nox legislation in cities stuttgart paris mexico city athens madrid paris all banning diesel by 2030 moreover countries such as norway the netherlands france germany uk china and india have indicated they will ban cars running on fossil fuels at ahead of the herd we are invested in commodities that support the electrification of the transportation system these include copper lithium and rare earths all of which are critical components of electric vehicles by 2047 there are expected to be upwards of 1 billion electric cars on the road all these evs will need lithium ion batteries containing lithium graphite nickel and cobalt plus other mined metals that go into evs like copper clean power we are also bullish on uranium since it will take a great deal more electricity to power all those evs which are estimated to be 35 of new vehicle sales in the us and around 75 of uk new vehicle sales by 2030 natural gas and coal power plants spew greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change renewables are great but they are currently a niche form of power and still require fossil fuel powered peaker plants coal or gas powered to supply an adequate amount of power to electricity grids if we want to save the earth and the signs are everywhere that the planet is in trouble from warming surface and ocean temperatures there is only one form of clean stable emissions free power that we can do it with nuclear uranium demand for uranium is directly tied to the need for nuclear power which is growing exponentially especially in asia due to the problems with air pollution from coal fired power plants the global demand for electricity is expected to increase by 76 by 2030 and while everyone knows about the electric vehicle revolution what is not often talked about is how will all that extra power be generated much of it will have to come from nuclear according to nuclear consultant uxc the global capacity for nuclear power is expected to grow by 27 between 2015 and 2030 that means a whole lot more uranium uxc estimates annual uranium demand will spike by nearly 60 from the current 190 million pounds of u3o8 the nuclear fuel to 300 million pounds by 2030 while the uranium price has been suppressed since 2011 when it took a major hit due to the nuclear accident cause by the tsunami in japan things are looking up uranium supply has been steadily dropping since 2016 that year total mined supply was around 163 million pounds in 2017 it was 154 million and in 2018 it was under 135 million with current u3o8 demand at 192 million pounds that leaves a shortfall of at least 57 million pounds where will this extra uranium come from while production at big canadian uranium mines mcarthur river and rabbit lake have been suspended due to low prices at current prices about three quarters of uranium mines are uneconomic exploration is going full tilt in the athabasca basin of saskatchewan the world s richest source of uranium ore with junior miners anticipating the return of higher prices the long wait might finally be over uranium was the best performing metal of 2018 one of the most promising uranium explorers is skyharbour resources tsxv syh in 2016 vancouver based skyharbour optioned the highly prospective moore project from denison mines the company also has a 50 interest in the preston project one of the largest land packages 75 965 hectares in the basin strategically located near fission uranium s patterson lake south triple r uranium deposit and nexgen energy s arrow deposit both of which contain high grade uranium while skyharbour is a top tier uranium explorer with the expertise to back that up the company is also a prospect generator meaning its strategy is to ink option agreements on its secondary properties thus allowing other companies to come in and incur exploration expenditures in return for earning stakes on those properties skyharbour s fall drill program at moore discovered a new high grade uranium zone with most of the zone below the unconformity the point where the sandstone meets the underlying basement rocks that s important because most of the highest grade deposits discovered in the athabasca basin in recent years have been found in the basement a new 3 000m program will include more exploratory drilling into the basement rocks with the goal of adding high grade uranium mineralization that can be plugged into a maiden resource expected to be published sometime this year copper while the copper price has lagged in recent months over fears of slowing chinese growth and the us china trade war the market fundamentals are solid over 200 copper mines currently in operation will reach the end of their productive life before 2035 most of the low hanging copper fruit has been picked new copper mines will be lower grade and farther afield meaning higher capex and production costs demand for the red metal needed for construction copper wiring communications and transportation is now being wired in pun intended to the electrification trend copper is an essential component of evs an average electric vehicle contains 85 kilograms of copper compared to 25 kg for regular vehicles that means copper demand is going to soar even higher than it already is second we are on the cusp of a major change in the copper market where supply is not going to be able to keep up with demand a supply deficit is expected as soon as 2020 there are already signs copper stockpiles at london metal exchange warehouses are at a decade low without new mines to fill the gap a 15 million tonne deficit is expected by 2035 if supply can t meet demand that means one thing higher prices it also means that governments and companies will be scrambling to get their hands on new copper properties to meet the demand nothing less than their economic growth is at stake without copper the construction communications and transportation industries would grind to a halt maintaining a smooth supply chain is critical to growth copper miners are on the hunt for new deposits that can help slow the inevitable decline of their aging mines consider this we have seen a recent flurry of mergers and acquisitions m a in the copper space barrick gold which took over randgold resources recently in a 6 1 billion deal wants to get back into copper and multi mineral behemoth rio tinto is rumored to be setting up an offer for a minority stake in teck resources quebrana blanca copper mine in northern chile for more on m a and the copper market read our copper fundamentals still solid according to bloomberg a survey of eight diversified major miners showed that copper is eating up an outsized share of their capital spending right now just shy of 8 billion between june 2017 and june 2018 a great place for major and mid tier copper producers to look for new acquisitions is canada the country has a storied copper mining history particularly in bc copper gold and saskatchewan vms deposits ample power and water and an experienced mining workforce we ve identified a copper junior in saskatchewan with a property well worth looking into rockridge resources tsx v rock has an option on the knife lake copper vms project currently owned by eagle plains resources tsx v epl the project is an advanced stage copper zinc and cobalt exploration property over 400 diamond drill holes have

begin in february or march the program will focus on confirmation drilling as well as expansion drilling and some exploratory holes this will provide ample news flow for the first half of the year lithium arguably lithium is the most important metal for electrification as the main ingredient in lithium ion batteries necessary for evs a steady supply of lithium for battery makers and auto manufacturers is going to be crucial this is why we ve been following the lithium market for going on a decade ever since former president obama announced in 2009 2 4 billion to support next generation electric vehicles like copper lithium is setting up to be in a deficit despite the lithium bears thinking that new supply will overwhelm demand as ev manufacturing goes bonkers we know this to be false to learn why read our why the lithium bears are wrong approximately 215 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent lce was produced in 2016 chile was the world s largest producer with 37

will each supply 15 china 10 and the rest of the world 15 according to roskill s 15th edition market outlook report demand from companies that produce batteries to power electric cars laptops cell phones etc is expected to increase 650 by 2027 with overall lithium demand forecast to more than triple over that period electric vehicle lithium ion battery pack manufacturers share of the market for lithium ion batteries will grow from 46 in 2017 to 83 by 2027 use of lithium hydroxide will increase from 25 of lithium compounds used in rechargeable batteries in 2021 to 55 by 2027 the chinese vehicle market is on its way to 38 2 million units sold in 2025 equal to 52 of global volume growth over that period by 2030 40 of vehicle sales in the region will be evs the european car market is likely to expand by 2 5m units by 2030 to reach 23 1m units annually with a roughly 30 penetration of evs by that time the us will lag and only 16 21 or 2 6m 3 5m of sales in 2030 is likely to be electric it is in this context that a new us lithium mine is being proposed next to albemarle s silver peak mine in clayton valley nevada the timing is excellent silver peak the only american lithium mine failed to increase production 2012 16 and its lithium grades are rumored to be dropping cypress development corp tsx v cyp has discovered a different type of deposit than the usual brine or hard rock lithium deposits which must either be mined using drill and blast methods or pumped into shallow ponds and allowed to evaporate allowing lithium carbonate to settle out in just two years cypress has gone from exploring its clayton valley lithium project resulting in a monster resource estimate to releasing an attractive pea last fall cypress is working to derisk the project which features an indicated resource of 3 835 million tonnes lce lithium carbonate equivalent and an inferred resource of 5 126 million tonnes lce the metallurgy for extracting the lithium from claystones is currently being perfected the results are expected to form a key piece of the upcoming prefeasibility study while there are risks to the project the upside is massive cypress has more than enough to supply america s current lithium needs and then some rare earths the rare earths needed for electric vehicles are neodymium and praseodymium used for making the magnets in electric motors and generators rare earth elements are also used in renewable energies like wind turbines smart phones and a plethora of defense applications china typically supplies about 80 of the global rare earths market or 156 000 tonnes the only supplier outside china right now is lynas corp which mines rees from its mount weld mine in western australia and processes them in malaysia molycorp operated the mountain pass mine in california up to 2015 when it closed due to low rare earth prices it has since restarted after being sold to a us led consortium out of bankruptcy but does not yet process the rare earths on us soil instead sending them to china the consortium plans to rectify that in the near future still it doesn t change the fact that the us is almost 100 dependent on china for its rees rare earths are central to the whole spectrum of defense technologies that are vital to every military without them countries would be unable to produce much of the military hardware and equipment required for national defense in most case there are no substitutes rare earth exploration stocks went on a tear from 2010 to 2015 after china restricted its exports of rees they abruptly crashed after china was forced by a world trade organization ruling to lift the restrictions that resulted in a torrent of chinese rare earth exports into the market and the inevitable collapse in prices today however the rare earth market is building up again thanks to new restrictions on chinese supply and a more acute need to take away the chinese monopoly and re gain control of elements critical to national defense last week it was reported that the chinese government published new guidelines designed to eliminate illegal mining and encourage more high end processing those sterile words are code for less polluting the process of extracting rare earth oxides from ore and refining them into useable products has come at a high price to the environment in china could this latest crackdown be china s attempt to manipulate the ree market again we can almost certainly bet on it but we have another factor that could play into a rare earth revival and that is a new high tech arms race that is developing between the superpowers donald trump s threat to withdraw from the 1987 inf treaty with russia may be the catalyst that starts a new arms race between the united states russia and china as each projects military power in defense of spheres of influence outside their borders an arms race requires rare earths something the us is in very short supply of not only that the united states is dependent on china for the mining and refining of rare earths it needs to expand and modernize its military fortunately we have a company that could help with that problem first legacy mining corp now defense metals corp tsx v defn after a name change entered into an option agreement with spectrum mining corp for its wicheeda lake claims in november 2018 wicheeda lake is a very attractive light rare earth deposit this deposit is less than a two hour drive from prince george bc a major logistics center roads run right to the deposit it has power water and a rail yard very close by it also has access to workers who are experienced miners and others experienced in chemical handling we think this is the perfect rare earth niobium deposit it has exceptional mineralogy easy metallurgy and location location location it has all the infrastructure necessary for a very low capex capital expenditure to be put into production and the timing couldn t be better the us and europe are both overwhelmingly dependent on their ree supply from china and are looking to correct that problem rare earths were included in a list of 37 minerals deemed critical to national security and economic prosperity as part of an executive order issued by president trump in late 2017 the order is a federal strategy to ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals gold gold isn t important for electrification of transportation but we continue to follow and be bullish on gold juniors since they offer the best leverage to a rising gold price since the stock market rout began in september gold has seen a bump gaining 9 between its 2018 low of 1 175 29 on august 14 and tuesday s spot price of 1 284 80 the metal has also been helped by speculation that the us federal reserve will either hold off raising interest rates in 2019 or limit them to two raises higher interest rates push gold prices down since investors prefer to park their money in bonds and other income yielding instruments rather than gold which pays no dividends the gold price is up but investors are also grabbing as much paper gold as they can according to the world gold council holdings of gold exchange traded funds etfs were up 3 in 2018 with december being the third straight months of net inflows more gold etfs bought than sold it s interesting to note that outflows from north american gold etfs caused by a strong us dollar throughout 2018 were more than offset by inflows to european gold etfs due to concerns over brexit central banks are also backing up the truck and loading up on gold bloomberg reports that after a two year hiatus china is again adding to its gold reserves according to hsbc fresh safe haven demand due to continuing concerns about equities along with higher volatility and economic uncertainty will push gold higher in 2019 proving that contrary to some opinions gold is still a safe haven out of the hundreds of junior gold stocks hoping to drill a discovery hole we ve chosen aben resources tsx v abn the canadian company has three separate projects on the go forrest kerr in the golden triangle of northwestern bc the chico gold project in saskatchewan and the justin gold project in the yukon last summer aben focused on forest kerr located right in the middle of the historic snip and eskay creek mines drilling in the north boundary zone discovered at the end of 2017 s drilling season intersected multiple high grade zones and precious metal values near surface the highest grade zone assayed at a whopping 331 grams per tonne g t or 9 65 ounces per tonne over 1 0m within a broader zone of 38 7 g t over 10m aben should have a very strong and early as possible start on forrest kerr this year they have a lot of information to compile over the winter five year drill pad and drilling permits have been received and money is in the till for their 2019 exploration program this is also expected to include drilling at chico in saskatchewan and justin in the yukon it s important to note that unlike a lot of canadian gold explorers aben is not only a winter play it has turned into a year round play with three very good projects conclusion after an ugly end to 2018 stock market investors are understandably cautious in where they go next despite a better start to the markets in 2019 there is still a lot of uncertainty but investors can get behind a good narrative and we believe the theme for 2019 is commodities we have pinned our thesis on three key points 1 commodities are cyclical and the timing is right to get in now 2 the us dollar is falling and will likely continue to fall or be range bound going forward a resolution to the trade war between the us and china and a looser monetary policy by the federal reserve both of which are likely would weigh on the dollar and be good for commodities 3 the need for infrastructure spending is not going to let up despite the chinese economy weakening beijing will continue to demand iron ore and base metals for its belt and road initiative and other ambitious megaprojects india and other developing nations are also in the mix the electrification trend we outlined as key to our investment thesis calls for a slew of battery metals lithium graphite nickel and cobalt along with tonnes of rare earths and copper and we haven t forgotten about how we re going to get all that extra energy needed to make the shift from fossil fuels to electric vehicles nuclear energy for this we need uranium put it all together and 2019 looks to be an excellent year for commodities by richard rick mills www aheadoftheherd

from the very day britain joined what would become the european union herbert w armstrong forecast that it would be a ruinous decision britain is going to look back on monday jan 1 1973 in all probability as a most tragically historic date a date fraught with ominous potentialities he wrote for that date marked the united kingdom s entry into the european community plain truth march 1973 britain s relationship with the eu is ending before our eyes but it is ending in disaster britain s government has just received its biggest defeat in parliament since 1924 for two years prime minister theresa may negotiated a brexit deal with the eu parliament has soundly rejected it only 202 members of parliament voted for the deal with 432 against labour leader jeremy corbyn has put forward a motion of no confidence in the government which will be decided tomorrow if that passes then labour will have a shot at forming a government and britain could end up with a leader radically more left wing than any other in history but if no one can get a majority then britain will be holding elections if theresa may wins the vote of no confidence she faces the herculean task of renegotiating an exit deal with the eu in less than three months and after that no one really knows all this chaos is full of unknowns will ms may still be prime minister by this time tomorrow no one knows what will britain s relationship look like with the eu no one knows where can we turn for answers and solutions to the same source that forecast this mess in the first place mr armstrong s forecast was rooted in his understanding of bible prophecy in the united states and britain in prophecy he explained that britain is a descendant of the ancient nation of israel he showed that britain was blessed not because of talent or righteousness but because of the obedience of its ancient ancestor abraham the promises made by his god and the incredible power of that god to keep those promises mr armstrong also explained the many prophecies that show the curses that would come if britain disobeyed god one of those curses is destruction at the hands of a german led european superstate for 39 years now i ve been telling our radio audience and plain truth readers that a political union of 10 nations in europe would rise resurrecting the holy roman empire of the middle ages he wrote in that 1973 article i was predicting this even before world war ii of course almost no one believed me then how did i know as far back as 1927 that this coming united states of europe would spring up in our time i knew because i saw it clearly revealed in biblical prophecy of course it s true that almost no one understands biblical prophecy but no wonder for almost no one understands what the gospel of jesus christ is or where and how in prophecy the united states and british commonwealth are identified it is remarkable how prescient bible prophecy is right now isaiah 59 paints a vivid picture of the state we find ourselves in we look for light but find only darkness we look for bright skies but walk in gloom we grope like the blind along a wall feeling our way like people without eyes even at brightest noontime we stumble as though it were dark among the living we are like the dead we growl like hungry bears we moan like mournful doves we look for justice but it never comes we look for rescue but it is far away from us verses 9 11 new living translation britain hoped bright skies were ahead after voting to leave the eu the result has been gloom now we grope around stumbling and unsure of what to do in hosea 5 12 god says that ephraim modern day england will be like a moth eaten garment in the end time god says i be unto ephraim as a moth a moth eaten garment looks good in the closet but take it off the hanger and it falls apart writes trumpet editor in chief gerald flurry in his booklet hosea reaping the whirlwind god says britain is like a moth eaten garment even though certain things may look good on the surface these two nations are ready to fall apart like the seemingly intact garment the full depths of britain s sickness are not visible from a cursory glance it s clear today that britain has fallen far from the heights of its imperial power but many looking on the surface don t understand how weak it truly is when britain voted to leave the eu in june 2016 many proclaimed a sunny future for britain freed from the shackles of europe britain could be great again today the british garment has been studied more closely it has been taken out of the closet and shaken a little and its truly terrible condition has been exposed the government can t navigate its departure from the eu without collapsing other scriptures paint a similar picture in leviticus 26 19 god tells the descendants of ancient israel which includes britain i will break the pride of your power notice there is still power to be broken the nation has some strength as far as britain has fallen since the height of its empire it still has some power but it has no will no national sense of purpose to use it as we saw today its political system is broken one cannot think of any time in history when the standing of british politicians either with the public at large or in the eyes of the outside world has ever quite deservedly been lower wrote the sunday telegraph s christopher booker this weekend his one time coauthor richard north agreed tweeting today we are seeing parliament in its death throes never more has it been so obvious that parliament is a failing institution buoyed by an equally lacklustre media which represents another failing institution bible prophecy actually identifies a critical lack of leadership in isaiah 3 god says that he is removing the leadership from jerusalem and from judah judah refers to the jews and jerusalem as the capital city to all of israel including modern britain notice god says that he will remove the stay and the staff gesenius hebrew chaldee lexicon of the old testament defines this as the chief persons of a nation on whom lean god goes on to list the specifics the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and the prudent and the ancient the captain of fifty and the honourable man and the counsellor and the cunning artificer and the eloquent orator verses 2 3 in the military in the judiciary and especially in politics the great leaders are gone this prophecy was fulfilled today look at the state of britain s government how much prudence wisdom judgment do you see there are many more scriptures along these lines the bible is full of prophecies that describe god s plan for britain and america mr armstrong wrote about this in his book the united states and britain in prophecy this book shows god s plan behind world events it was mr armstrong s most requested book with nearly 5 million copies going out during his lifetime with events like brexit and the continued decline of the united states it has proved only more true since his death watching your country descend into shambles is not a pleasant experience but this book gives the hope behind these events it explains why there is all this groping about at noon day on the 33rd anniversary of his death it remains more relevant than ever if you have not read it before you can request your free copy here and if you have read it before i d like to point you to a booklet that i guarantee you have not the anniversary of january 16 the date of mr armstrong s death has often seen historic events tomorrow we are releasing a brand new booklet explaining why trumpet managing editor joel hilliker will be offering it in his trumpet brief tomorrow so if you want to read a brand new booklet hot off the online press watch

politically economically culturally america is more divided than at any time since at least the vietnam war how did we get here part of the answer lies in the financial crisis that began a decade ago the rest comes from the long growing sense that for millions of people the american dream is a myth amid the banking crisis of 2008 the american motor industry was an afterthought in december 2008 a truculent congress voted down an emergency aid package for american automakers but neither president bush nor incoming president obama thought they could let gm and chrysler fail so these once great powerhouses of american industrialism were rescued by the diversion of funds originally allocated to the bank bailout by 2013 both were profitable chrysler celebrated its recovery in the way that corporate america does by booking a slot to run a headline grabbing commercial during the super bowl in february 2014 the spot was written directed and acted in person by bob dylan the wizened bard of counterculture americana against a backdrop of hopperesque noir dylan delivered a striking piece of high caliber nationalist kitsch is there anything more american than america cause you can t import original you can t fake true cool you can t duplicate legacy because what detroit created was a first and became an inspiration to the rest of the world yeah detroit made cars and cars made america partner insights ai and the competitive edge exploring sector specific opportunities with kpmg at sxsw if the american auto industry was back from the dead however the same could not be said for motor city since its heyday in the postwar era detroit had long been in decline at its peak it had a population of 1 8 million of whom 500 000 were african american hit by deindustrialization and white flight following the 1967 riots the population of the urban core of detroit had by 2013 shrunk to 688 000 of whom 550 000 were african american with most of its factories closed detroit was caught in a death spiral of unemployment racial disadvantage and predatory financing by 2013 36 percent of detroit s population was living below michigan s far from generous poverty line the unemployment rate was 18 percent housing was a crisis in 2005 68 percent of all the mortgages in detroit were subprime as the crisis cut a swath across america 65 000 homes in detroit were foreclosed more than half were considered of so little value that they were simply abandoned joining a total stock of 140 000 blighted properties trying to contain the contamination effect the city demolished entire tracts the city saddled with debts of between 18 billion and 20 billion appointed an emergency manager who in june 2013 filed for bankruptcy it was the biggest city bankruptcy in american history detroit was an extreme and much publicized case but it was not alone jefferson county alabama which included the steel city of birmingham had filed for bankruptcy in 2011 in 2012 it was stockton and san bernardino calif these places were far from being carbon copies of northern postindustrial detroit but taken together they symbolized the bewildering turn from american dream to american nightmare for most of obama s first term however it wasn t the worries of such places that preoccupied economic policy it was the fight to save wall street and global finance but in the 18 months following obama s reelection in november 2012 a sense of american malaise reached a new pitch with the crisis no longer dominating the horizon the concerns about america s long term trajectory the sense that things weren t normal came roaring back lifestyle three celebrated scottish distilleries gain new life master distiller rachel barrie puts a sense of place in every bottle of scotch she produces economist larry summers gave voice to the anxiety in a speech at the international monetary fund in november 2013 his subject the recovery and its deeply disappointing pace american policy makers might congratulate themselves that they were leading the europeans out of the recession and they were right to do so but summers warned america s recovery was the slowest on record in 2009 and 2010 the recovery had started strongly but since then economic growth had relapsed where was the bounce what was wrong the conventional view was that the united states was suffering from the aftereffects of an exceptionally severe financial crisis it would take time for markets and balance sheets to recover it was precisely to avoid such hangovers that economists like carmen reinhart and ken rogoff argued for financial restraint if you avoided the credit bubble and the excessive upswing you might avoid the bust keynesians like nobel prize winning economist paul krugman on the other hand insisted that the recovery had been needlessly slowed by a premature shift to austerity fed chair ben bernanke s quantitative easing qe could compensate to some degree but it could not make up for the shortfall in aggregate demand but what if the inadequate recovery was not simply the result of policy failure summers asked what if there was a deeper problem a chronic shortfall in the demand for investment relative to the supply of savings resulting in a sustained condition of secular stagnation summers invited his audience to look back to the period before the crash in retrospect everyone agreed that monetary policy before 2008 had been too easy there was a vast amount of imprudent lending going on but if that were the case one would have expected the american economy to have been on a dramatic bull run it had not despite the excesses of the housing boom growth up to 2008 had been average when compared with the 1950s and 60s it had been slow so imagine summers continued how satisfactory the performance of the u s economy would have been in the early 2000s in the absence of a housing bubble and with the maintenance of strong credit standards it would have been just as disappointing as the current recovery was turning out to be it might have been worse climate watch techonomy climate 2024 years of technological business and funding efforts may still fall far short of arresting greenhouse emissions especially as we sail past 1 5 c global warming top visionaries discuss the new reality at the techonomy climate west 2024 where innovation meets urgency to address the chronic shortfall in investment summers advocated a new era of government activism a burst of public investment would rebuild america s infrastructure and address the more fundamental questions posed by detroit physical reconstruction would be a means to restore a sense of national coherence and national pride summers was calling for what obama s administration had failed to deliver a drive to unify american society around a program of investment driven growth and comprehensive modernization the efforts at stimulus in 2009 and 2010 had not been negligible but they had been hedged by the anxieties of the moment resistance from congress an aggressive mobilization of right wing opinion and larry summers own nervousness about losing standing with democratic political operatives the result was a recovery that was not just slow but deeply inequitable devastating statistical data completed the picture in october 2013 two french economists emmanuel saez and thomas piketty published the latest release of a long running project on american inequality they calculated that of the growth generated by the economic recovery since 2009 95 percent had been monopolized by the top 1 percent that tiny fraction of the population saw their incomes rebound from the trough of the recession by 31 4 percent meanwhile 99 percent of americans had experienced virtually no gain in income since the crisis the data were subsequently revised to show a less extreme disproportion but in 2013 the numbers caused a sensation whereas a tiny elite were doing extremely well for average americans the secular stagnation thesis that summers advanced as a tentative academic hypothesis was simply the reality of the last 40 years could the national economy any longer be plausibly presented as a project common to all americans see all power 100 issue content here since america s bicentennial in 1976 productivity growth and the returns to labor in the form of household incomes had starkly diverged the average american shared only to a small degree in national economic growth almost all of its benefits were being monopolized by the highest paid and those wealthy enough to own significant portfolios of financial assets the financial crisis of 2008 had revealed how national economic policy was subordinated to the needs of giant transnational banks could the national economy any longer be plausibly presented as a project common to all americans arts culture miami s fusion of luxury art and innovation historic revival and contemporary opulence in the magic city a year into his second term as president president obama visited a community center in ward 8 an african american section of washington d c to make a major speech about america s social crisis he described the daily battles of ordinary americans struggling against the relentless decades long trend of income inequality our levels of income inequality rank near countries like jamaica and argentina half of all americans would experience poverty during at least one period of their lives the combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the american dream our way of life and what we stand for around the globe the distress of cities such as detroit was clearly shocking but as obama emphasized america s crisis was not confined to predominantly african american communities across the country class not race was the most important determinant of an american s life chances and the big story of his second term was rural white working class despair it was appalachia held back by structural change educational failure and immobility that lurched into the headlines at its most extreme this lethal combination came to be symbolized by an epidemic of drug addiction fed by cheap heroin from mexico and rampant opioid abuse among white americans deaths from overdose increased by 297 percent between 2010 and 2014 life expectancy among working class white americans had been decreasing since the early 2000s the crisis was undeniable the question was what to do about it when the left wing of the democratic party had taken up the issue of inequality in the 1990s the standard diagnosis had been technical and economic globalization had pushed top incomes up and lower incomes down imports of cheap manufacturers opened up by nafta and chinese accession to the wto benefited consumers but depressed wages and robbed blue collar americans of secure manufacturing jobs and the health and retirement benefits that went with them by 2013 experts close to the american labor movement estimated that the trade deficit with china had cost 3 2 million jobs and the competition of low wage foreign labor had depressed the wages of the 100 million american workers without a college education by 180 billion these were substantial effects but in an economy with a workforce of more than 150 million people and a wage bill of more than 7 trillion they were nowhere near large enough to explain the surge in inequality so the globalization argument was supplemented by a thesis of skills biased technological change this theory posited that the trend in technological development had offered disproportionate benefits to those with higher skills across the american economy whether exposed to trade or not artificial intelligence overwhelmed job recruiters getting sloppy per survey a survey by harris poll and jobs marketplace indeed indicates that dwindling hiring departments are swamped and not very efficient indeed says its ai can help the standard reformist response had been to advocate for a federal and state role in improving education providing affordable access to community colleges and offering trade adjustment assistance but after 20 years given the mounting inequality and declining mobility these measures could hardly be deemed a success between 1977 and 2014 the share of national income going to the top 1 percent before taxes and benefits had risen by 88 8 percent nor was this by accident every conceivable source of leverage and influence had been exploited by those with money to maximize their advantage as billionaire investor warren buffett famously put it actually there s been class warfare going on for the last 20 years and my class has won for those at the bottom none of this was news opinion polls especially those commissioned by the right wing had for a long time been recording the profound resentment among the american population at the way that both the economy and the political system seemed to be engineered to their disadvantage these views were often dismissed as conspiracy theories and often deservedly so online news sources such as breitbart provided a platform for racist and anti semitic rhetoric but if one stepped back from the poisonous language and crude logic the assumptions that inequality was systemic and that the system was rigged against working class americans were not paranoid but simply realistic from a radically different perspective and with completely different intent the american left had always made the case indeed it was this radical skepticism that set them apart from the liberal centrists who dominated the democratic party the left did not trust the institutions it did not believe that electing well intentioned products of elite colleges to steer a machine designed to favor the wealthy offered any hope of fundamental change it was the conversion of centrist liberal commentators to a more radical view that marked how serious the sense of the crisis had become in a remarkable series of new york times columns economist paul krugman adopted a dark view what do the pre and post crisis consensuses have in common krugman asked in december 2013 both were economically destructive deregulation helped make the crisis possible and the premature turn to fiscal austerity has done more than anything else to hobble recovery both consensuses however corresponded to the interests and prejudices of an economic elite whose political influence had surged along with its wealth robert reich a clinton era labor secretary underwent a similar disillusionment what reich now recognized was a critically important phenomenon the increasing concentration of political power in a corporate and financial elite that has been able to influence the rules by which the economy runs the problem is not the size of government but whom the government is for business finance how fair are the olympics economic impacts the olympics can be an economically crippling decision or not if you play your cards right france is sure it has some up its sleeve for paris 2024 in january 2014 reich went to congress to testify i ve served in washington and know how difficult it is to get anything done unless the broad public understands what s at stake and actively pushes for reform that s why we need a movement against economic inequality and in favor of shared growth a movement on a scale similar to the progressive movement at the turn of the last century unlike liberal progressives the libertarian right wing in the united states had never doubted that government was a problem indeed they had always vociferously argued that it was the entire problem america s downward slide the long running trends toward inequality and oligarchy the disaster of 2008 the lopsided recovery from it were all symptoms of the profound corruption brought about by big government meddling and its capture by interest groups of course the low top tax rates that had helped to create that outcome of extreme disparity were set by a republican congress nonetheless a large part of the american right agreed with obama that the american dream was in trouble it was just that for them he was the personification of everything that was wrong his defeat of mitt romney in 2012 only vindicated them in their belief that existing republican politics were hopelessly inadequate the republicans would never achieve the transformation they craved with a center right candidate like romney an enormously wealthy entrepreneur whose hard core conservative positions were never quite believed by those to whom they were meant to appeal in 2016 the right would find its candidate this article is adapted from the book crashed how a decade of financial crises changed the world by adam

summary in the time donald trump has been in the white house the economy added 4 6 million jobs including nearly half a million in manufacturing economic growth quickened but not as much as trump promised the number of regulatory restrictions stopped growing carbon dioxide emissions stopped falling and have increased 1 4 percent under trump illegal border crossings have gone up only 22 774 refugees resettled in the u s last year down 76 percent from 2016 the trade deficit increased 20 percent the federal debt rose by 1 7 trillion annual deficits accelerated after tax corporate profits soared to the highest on record analysis this is our fourth quarterly update of the trump s numbers scorecard that we posted in january 2018 and updated on april 16 july 11 and oct 12 we ll publish additional updates every three months as fresh statistics become available as always starting when we posted our first obama s numbers article more than six years ago and in the quarterly updates and final summary that followed we ve included statistics that may seem good or bad or just neutral depending on the reader s point of view we make no judgment as to how much credit or blame any president deserves for things that happen during his time in office opinions differ on that jobs and unemployment job growth slowed a bit under trump but unemployment dropped to the lowest point in nearly half a century employment total nonfarm employment grew by nearly 4 6 million during the president s first 23 months in office according to the most recent figures available from the bureau of labor statistics that continued an unbroken chain of monthly gains in total employment that started eight years earlier in october 2010 december saw an unusually large gain of 312 000 bringing the average monthly gain under trump to 199 000 but that s still less than the average monthly gain of 217 000 during obama s second term trump will have to pick up the pace even more if he is to fulfill his campaign boast that he will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created unemployment the unemployment rate which was well below the historical norm when trump took office has continued to fall even lower the bureau of labor statistics now figures the rate was 4 7 percent when he was sworn in newly revised seasonal adjustment factors introduced this month put the rate even lower than the 4 8 percent bls had been reporting the most recent rate for december is 3 9 percent and it had been down to 3 7 percent earlier in 2018 that was the lowest since december 1969 the historical norm is 5 6 percent which is the median monthly rate for all the months since the start of 1948 job openings another reason employment growth has slowed is a worsening shortage of qualified workers the number of unfilled job openings hit a new record of nearly 7 3 million as of the last business day in august which was the most in the 18 years the bureau of labor statistics has been tracking this figure it has declined a bit since then but openings still numbered nearly 6 9 million as of the last day in november the most recent figure available that s a gain of 1 4 million unfilled job openings or 26 6 percent since trump took office the number of job openings has exceeded the number of unemployed people looking for work since march of last year labor force participation despite the abundance of jobs the labor force participation rate which went down 2 8 percentage points during the obama years has remained little changed under trump the labor force participation rate is the portion of the entire civilian population age 16 and older that is either employed or currently looking for work in the last four weeks republicans often criticized obama for the decline during his time even though it was due mostly to the post world war ii baby boomers reaching retirement age and other demographic factors beyond the control of any president since trump took office the rate has fluctuated in a narrow range between 63 1 percent and 62 7 percent it was 63 1 percent in december up 0 2 percentage points from where it was the month trump took office manufacturing jobs manufacturing jobs increased under trump even faster than total employment the number rose by 473 000 between trump s inauguration and december that followed a net decrease of 192 000 under obama the increase since january 2017 amounts to 3 8 percent compared with the 3 1 percent increase in overall employment the number of manufacturing jobs is still 904 000 below where it was in december 2007 at the start of the great recession economic growth the economy grew somewhat faster under trump but not at the rate he promised it rose at a yearly rate of 3 4 percent in the third quarter of 2018 the most recent official estimate available growth under trump has averaged far less than the 4 percent to 6 percent per year that he promised repeatedly both when he was a candidate and also as president the economy grew only 2 2 percent during his first year and continued at a 2 2 percent yearly rate in the first quarter of 2018 according to the bureau of economic analysis as we reported in our last update it then spurted to a 4 2 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2018 trump proudly claimed credit but it then fell back to a 3 4 percent rate in the third quarter and it looks as though the economy slowed even further in the last quarter of 2018 the first official estimate from the bea isn t scheduled to be released until jan 30 however the gdpnow forecast produced by the federal reserve bank of atlanta projects that the fourth quarter growth rate will come in at 2 8 percent most economists believe the current growth spurt is temporary the most recent median forecast of the federal reserve board members and federal reserve bank presidents issued on dec 19 projected 3 0 percent growth for all of 2018 2 3 percent in 2019 and 2 0 percent in 2020 similarly the nonpartisan congressional budget office issued an updated economic forecast aug 13 projecting real gross domestic product to grow 3 1 percent for all of 2018 falling to 2 4 percent this year and 1 7 percent next year other leading economists tend to agree for the business and university economists who offered an annual gdp forecast to the wall street journal s monthly economic survey in january the average prediction was for 3 0 percent growth for all of 2018 falling to 2 2 percent this year and 1 7 percent next year similarly the national association for business economics december survey produced a median forecast of 2 9 percent growth for 2018 and 2 7 percent in 2019 regulations the growth of federal regulation has come to a stop under trump it wasn t exactly the sudden screeching and beautiful halt trump prematurely claimed back in december 2017 when in fact the number of federal restrictions was still growing but over the next several months the rise decelerated and then reversed the number of restrictions has now dropped to just about where it was when trump was sworn in the number of restrictive words and phrases such as shall prohibited or may not contained in the code of federal regulations went up by 0 73 percent during trump s first 15 months reaching a peak of nearly 1 09 million on april 6 2018 according to daily tracking done by the quantgov project at george mason university s mercatus center but as of dec 22 2018 the most recent date for which mercatus has posted a daily count the number had dropped to 1 079 926 which is just 325 more than on jan 20 2017 the day trump took office hovering near zero growth is a big change from the past restrictions grew at an average of 1 5 percent per year during both the obama years and the george w bush years according to annual quantgov tracking the mercatus count of restrictions doesn t attempt to assess the cost or benefit of any particular rule such assessments require a degree of guesswork and are sensitive to assumptions but it does track the sheer volume of federal rules with more precision than we have found in other metrics some of the recent changes are cosmetic since our last report the treasury department scrapped an entire chapter of zombie like regulations issued by the old office of thrift supervision which oversaw the savings and loan industry before being abolished in 2011 s ls have since fallen under other federal banking regulators but the obsolete ots rules remained on the books however many of the rules trump has eliminated are quite significant within a month of taking office for example trump signed a law nullifying an obama era rule prohibiting coal mining companies from dumping waste into streams and waterways last year his administration withdrew obama s edict requiring automakers to double the fuel efficiency of new cars and light trucks to 54 5 miles per gallon by the year 2025 instead the requirement will be capped at 37 mpg starting in 2020 and in may trump signed a massive rollback of banking regulations easing rules for all but the largest banks crime crime declined a bit in trump s first year and seems to have gone down again in 2018 at least in the nation s largest cities the number of homicides throughout the u s declined by 0 7 percent in 2017 according to the fbi s annual crime in the united states report after rising for the previous two years the number of all violent crimes went down by 0 2 percent and the number of property crimes went down 3 percent early data suggests that crime rates declined further in 2018 the brennan center for justice at the new york university school of law projects that the 2018 murder rate in the 30 largest u s cities will decline again by nearly 6 percent and the rate of all violent crime in 22 of those 30 cities will fall by 2 7 percent nationwide fbi figures for 2018 won t be released until later this year likely in september as a candidate trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the murder rate was the highest it s been in 45 years in fact the murder rate had dropped to the lowest on record in 2014 4 4 murders per 100 000 inhabitants and while it did rise for the next two years it was still only 5 4 per 100 000 in 2016 far below the peak rate of 10 2 reached in 1980 coal and environment coal mining jobs as a candidate trump promised to put our miners back to work but so far not many have regained their jobs a total of 35 700 coal mining jobs disappeared during the obama years but as of december only 3 200 of them had come back since trump took office according to bls figures that s 9 percent of the coal mining jobs lost during the obama years the outlook for coal miners remains bleak the energy information administration currently estimates that u s coal production will fall 3 percent this year and by another 7 percent in 2020 eia expects natural gas will continue to displace coal for the generation of electricity carbon emissions carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption are now going up under trump after falling for years under obama figures from the energy information administration show co2 emissions fell by a total of 14 3 percent between 2007 and 2017 due mainly to electric utilities shifting away from coal fired plants in favor of cheaper cleaner natural gas as well as solar and wind power after trump took office co2 emissions fell more slowly at first by 0 8 percent in 2017 half the 1 7 percent decline in obama s final year and the trend has now reversed entirely emissions during the most recent 12 months on record ending in september 2018 were 1 4 percent higher than in all of 2016 eia estimated on jan 15 that co2 emissions increased by 2 8 percent for all of 2018 compared with 2017 earlier the rhodium group a private research firm grabbed headlines with a preliminary estimate that the 2018 increase would be 3 4 percent whatever the actual figure turns out to be eia said the 2018 rise is due mainly to a hotter summer and colder winter that resulted in higher natural gas consumption it predicted that co2 emissions would fall by 1 2 percent in 2019 and 0 8 percent in 2020 if temperatures return to normal as forecast border security illegal border crossings which at first declined under trump have now risen to above where they were the year before he took office the number of people caught while illegally trying to cross the u s border with mexico each month plunged to a low of 11 127 in april of trump s first year according to figures released by the u s border patrol but since then the number has more than quadrupled hitting 51 856 in november and 50 753 in december for 2018 the monthly average was 38 885 which is 5 3 percent higher than the monthly average of 36 912 in 2016 looking in more detail at the recent rise which trump calls a crisis we see a strong upward trend since april 2017 by this measure apprehensions were 61 percent higher in december than in january 2017 when trump took office but we use a rolling monthly average for our comparisons because these monthly figures are subject to wide seasonal variations or what former homeland security secretary jeh c johnson called the seasonal uptick in the spring months and a drop off at the beginning of the year refugees the u s took in far fewer refugees under trump u s state department figures show only 22 874 refugees were resettled in the u s last year down from 96 874 in 2016 that s a decrease of 76 percent as a candidate trump at first called for a complete ban on all muslims entering the u s but later called instead for extreme vetting of immigrants seeking admission as president trump issued an executive order on march 6 2017 setting a ceiling of 50 000 for refugee admissions in fiscal year 2017 down from the 110 000 that president obama had set for that year he also suspended refugee admissions for 120 days ending oct 24 2017 and he cut the ceiling on refugee admissions even further for fiscal year 2018 to 45 000 on sept 24 last year he cut the ceiling again to 30 000 for the current fiscal year actual admissions have been running even below trump s ceilings however corporate profits after tax corporate profits are running at record levels under trump during the third quarter of 2018 they hit an annual rate of 1 98 trillion that and the previous quarter s figure of 1 96 trillion are the two best quarters ever recorded the current quarterly rate is 14 percent higher than the full year figure for 2016 the year before trump took office it is also 6 7 percent above the best full year figure ever previously recorded which was 1 86 trillion in 2014 these annual and quarterly estimates originate with the bureau of economic analysis see line 45 after tax profits got a boost in 2018 from the tax cut trump signed into law dec 22 2017 dropping the top federal tax rate on corporate income to 21 percent from 35 percent stock market stock prices continued their long rise with trump in office setting record after record only to see much of the gain erased in the final months of 2018 which ended with the worst december since 1931 at the close on jan 15 the standard poor s 500 stock average had tumbled nearly 11 percent from the record high set on sept 20 but it was still 15 3 percent higher than it was on the last trading day before trump s inauguration other indexes also saw recent declines but still hung onto part of what they had gained in trump s first year at the jan 15 close the dow jones industrial average made up of 30 large corporations was up 22 percent under trump and the nasdaq composite index made up of more than 3 000 companies was 26 8 percent higher than before trump took office the bull market that began in 2009 at the depths of the great recession passed its ninth anniversary in march and on aug 22 was widely proclaimed to be the longest running bull market in modern financial history but by the end of the year some market watchers were proclaiming that a bear market was underway wages and inflation the upward trend in real wages continued under trump and inflation remained in check cpi the consumer price index rose 3 6 percent during trump s first 23 months continuing a long period of historically low inflation in the most recent 12 months ending in december the cpi rose 1 9 percent the cpi rose an average of 1 8 percent each year of the obama presidency measured as the 12 month change ending each january and an average of 2 4 percent during each of george w bush s years wages paychecks continued to grow faster than prices the average weekly earnings of all private sector workers in real inflation adjusted terms rose 2 4 percent during trump s first 23 months after going up 3 9 percent during the previous four years those figures are for all private sector workers including managers and supervisors for rank and file production and nonsupervisory workers who make up 82 percent of all private sector workers real weekly earnings have gone up 2 5 percent so far under trump after rising 4 7 percent during obama s last four years in office consumer sentiment consumer confidence in the economy rose under trump but has slipped a bit since our last update the university of michigan s surveys of consumers reported that its index of consumer sentiment hit 101 4 in march of last year which was the highest in more than two decades but from there it slid to 98 3 in december that s 0 2 lower than it was in the month trump took office but still a favorable level for all of 2018 the level averaged 98 4 which was the best full year average since 2000 however the december survey picked up some emerging worries the survey s chief economist richard curtin said consumers reported more negative than positive news about job prospects for the first time in two years with the shift widespread across socioeconomic subgroups home prices and ownership home prices home prices soared to record levels under trump but recently have slipped back a bit the most recent sales figures from the national association of realtors show the national median price of an existing single family home sold in november was 260 500 earlier in june the average price hit 276 500 the highest ever recorded but prices fell back in subsequent months the november average is still 31 800 higher than the median price of 228 700 for homes sold during the month trump took office a gain in value of 13 9 percent the rise in the consumer price index during the same period was 3 6 percent the realtors figures reflect raw sales prices without attempting to adjust for such factors as variations in the size location age or condition of the homes sold in a given month or year even so a similar pattern emerges from the s p corelogic case shiller u s national home price index which compares sales prices of similar homes and seeks to measure changes in the total value of all existing single family housing stock the case shiller index for october sales the most recent available was a record high and was 11 5 percent higher than where it stood in the month trump took office whichever way you measure it homeowners have seen the value of their houses rise substantially since trump took office homeownership meanwhile the percentage of americans who own their homes has continued to recover from a years long slide gaining 0 7 percentage points since trump took office the homeownership rate began to slide after peaking at 69 2 percent of households for two quarters in 2004 it hit bottom in the second quarter of 2016 at 62 9 percent the lowest point in more than half a century and tied for the lowest on record the rate recovered 0 8 points before trump took office and has gone up another 0 7 points since then reaching 64 4 percent in the third quarter of 2018 according to the most recent census bureau figures not all americans have benefited from the rise in homeownership the homeownership rate for black households was 41 7 percent in the third quarter the same as it was at the end of 2016 and near a 50 year low according to the national association of real estate brokers trade the trade deficit that trump promised to reduce grew larger instead the most recent government figures show that the total u s trade deficit in goods and services during the most recent 12 months on record ending in october was 604 billion that s an increase of 102 billion or 20 2 percent compared with 2016 china the goods and services trade deficit with china grew at a similar clip up by 18 percent between 2016 and the most recent 12 months on record ending in october when it hit nearly 364 billion trump last year initiated a full scale trade conflict with china imposing tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods china has retaliated with its own tariffs on 110 billion in u s goods trump tweeted jan 8 that talks to strike a new trade deal with china are going very well but so far little progress has been made mexico meanwhile the much smaller trade deficit in goods and services with mexico totaled 75 billion during the 12 months ending in october an increase of 20 3 percent compared with 2016 canada the trade surplus that the u s runs with canada has practically disappeared under trump the trade balance was positive by less than 1 billion during the 12 months ending in october that surplus is 86 9 percent smaller than it was in 2016 for the most recent quarter ending sept 30 the u s actually ran a 2 7 billion trade deficit with canada on nov 30 trump and the leaders of canada and mexico signed a new trade agreement to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement which trump had promised to scrap during his campaign the new agreement will be called the united states mexico canada agreement or usmca the new agreement still requires approval by congress before it can take effect democrats took control of the house this month and speaker nancy pelosi has cast doubt on whether the new deal can gain approval without changes to some of its provisions health insurance coverage the number of people lacking health insurance has barely changed since trump took office but millions are expected to drop or lose coverage this year and in subsequent years the most recent report from the national health interview survey estimates that 28 5 million people were uninsured during the first six months of 2018 about 100 000 fewer than in 2016 only 8 8 percent of the population lacked health coverage during that time down from 9 0 percent during obama s last year that s a reversal of the trend in trump s first year when the number who lacked coverage rose by 700 000 according to the nhic trump failed to repeal and replace the affordable care act as he promised to do but in december 2017 he signed a tax bill that will end the aca s tax penalty for people who fail to obtain coverage that took effect this year earlier the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated that the end of the mandate penalty will cause 4 million people to lose or drop coverage this year rising to 12 million two years later and 13 million in 2025 food stamps the number of food stamp recipients went down since trump s inauguration as of september the most recent month for which figures are available 38 6 million people were receiving the aid the lowest number since november 2009 the number has gone down 4 1 million or 9 7 percent since january 2017 when trump took office the number generally has been going down since peaking at nearly 47 8 million in december 2012 as the economy recovered from the great recession of 2007 2009 in december the trump administration issued a proposed rule that would tighten work requirements for able bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 49 with no dependents generally the rules limit aid to three months for such adults but many states secured waivers to that rule during the 2007 2009 recession and still have them in place despite a booming economy trump s proposal would affect only a small fraction of all food stamp recipients however less than 9 percent of all people getting food stamps are classified as able bodied adults living in households without children and 26 percent of those are already working according to the u s department of agriculture judiciary appointments trump is putting his mark on the federal courts from top to bottom more quickly than obama was able to do in his first two years supreme court so far trump has won senate confirmation for two supreme court nominees justice neil gorsuch and justice brett m kavanaugh obama also was able to fill two high court vacancies during his first two years in office with justice sonia sotomayor and justice elena kagan but the kavanaugh nomination to fill the vacancy created by justice anthony kennedy s retirement is significant because kavanaugh may move the court to the right he is considered more conservative than kennedy who sometimes sided with the liberal justices to provide deciding votes on issues including gay rights abortion capital punishment and affirmative action however kavanaugh disappointed abortion foes when he sided with the court s liberals on one of his first votes against taking up a case about whether citizens should be allowed to sue states that cut off medicaid funding for planned parenthood health clinics court of appeals trump also won confirmation for 30 u s court of appeals judges during his first two years so far no judges have been confirmed by the current congress which was seated this month trump s total compares with only 16 for obama at the same point in his first term district court trump also has won confirmation for 53 of his nominees to be federal district court judges exceeding the 44 for whom obama had won confirmation at the same point in his presidency trump must share responsibility for this record with the republican majority in the senate republicans not only refused to consider obama s appointment of merrick garland to fill the supreme court vacancy eventually filled by gorsuch but they also blocked confirmation of dozens of obama s nominees to lower courts trump inherited 17 court of appeals vacancies for example including seven that had obama nominees pending but never confirmed federal debt and deficits trump inherited rising federal debt and deficits and his tax cut and spending increases are making both rise faster the federal debt held by the public stood at nearly 16 1 trillion at the last count on jan 14 nearly 1 7 trillion higher than when he took office that s an 11 6 percent increase under trump and that figure will go up even more quickly in coming years unless trump and congress impose massive spending cuts or reverse course and increase taxes trump s cuts in corporate and individual income tax rates as well as the bipartisan spending deal he signed feb 9 are causing the red ink to gush even faster than it did before the annual federal deficit for fiscal year 2018 which ended sept 30 was 779 billion up from nearly 666 billion the year before that s an increase of 113 billion much of the increase was due to reduced receipts from corporate income taxes which fell by 92 billion cbo estimates that the deficit will continue rising for the foreseeable future exceeding 1 trillion annually starting in fiscal year 2020 baseline deficit projections are in table 1 page 2 further cbo said on june 26 that under current law federal deficits will continue growing for the next 30 years reaching the highest level of debt relative to gdp in the nation s history by far cbo projected that under current law debt would reach 152 percent of the nation s total annual economic output by 2048 up from 78 percent currently oil production and imports u s crude oil production resumed its upward trend under trump rising 20 2 percent during the most recent 12 months on record ending in october compared with all of 2016 domestic oil production has increased every year since 2008 except for a 6 1 percent drop in 2016 after prices plunged to below 30 a barrel from more than 100 in 2014 the price returned to more than 50 a barrel by the end of 2016 and has hovered around 70 for many weeks prompting increased drilling and production as a result the trend to reduce reliance on foreign oil also resumed the u s imported only 12 8 percent of its oil and petroleum products during the first 11 months of 2018 down by nearly half from 24 4 percent in all of 2016 dependence on imports peaked in 2005 when the u s imported 60 3 percent of its petroleum and it has declined every year since except for 2016 when it ticked up by 0 3 percentage points sources bureau of labor statistics employment hours and earnings from the

on november 30 2017 the new fekola mine in mali continued to significantly outperform expectations running above plan on mill throughput and recoveries this resulted in fekola exceeding the upper limit of its already increased guidance range of between 420 000 and 430 000 ounces with gold production of 439 068 ounces in 2018 mill throughput was 5 6 million tonnes for the full year 12 above the budget of 5 0 million tonnes per annum mtpa the mill began running higher throughput during the second half of the year after determining additional capacity of up to 6 million mtpa was available from a detailed plant study mill gold recoveries averaged 94 7 compared to budget of 92 7 and continue to remain above design predictions over a broad range of ore types it is expected that the recoveries will continue to be within the range of design 92 7 and observed 94 7 recoveries the average grade processed was 2 58 grams per tonne g t below budget of 2 69 g t as the higher than budgeted tonnage processed consisted of medium and low grade ore completion of limited medium and low grade ore campaigns in the third and fourth quarter confirmed that the fekola mill recoveries continue to remain above design predictions over a broad range of ore types the resource model continues to perform as expected compared to actual mined grade and tonnage for the fourth quarter 2018 the fekola mine produced 105 280 ounces of gold 16 14 509 ounces above original budget in the fourth quarter of 2017 the fekola mine produced 105 110 ounces of gold including 72 903 ounces of pre commercial

2017 compared to the prior year gold production was lower by 13 24 188 ounces as planned due to a negligible amount of wolfshag ore being mined in 2018 while phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is being developed higher grade ore production is planned to resume from the wolfshag pit in late 2019 for the fourth quarter 2018 the otjikoto mine produced 44 766 ounces of gold approximately in line with budget compared to the prior year quarter gold production was lower by 15 7 680 ounces as planned due to a negligible amount of wolfshag ore being mined in 2018 for full year 2018 otjikoto s cash

represents 8 of the company s 2018 consolidated gold production as a result of national political unrest in 2018 development of the jabali antenna underground project had been temporarily suspended resulting in flooding of the underground workings the subsequent underground mine dewatering was completed in mid august and ramp development recommenced mine development in the fourth quarter of 2018 extended access to three mining areas zones 1 2 and 3 in the central and eastern areas of the mine ore production from jabali antenna underground consisted only of development ore in the fourth quarter with ore production from stopes in zone 1 and zone 2 anticipated in the first quarter of 2019 in addition the mine permit for the new jabali antenna pit continues to be delayed production had been budgeted to start from the jabali antenna pit in the third quarter of 2018 however progress has been made in key steps toward achieving a mine permit the company now anticipates receiving the permit in time to start production from the pit in the second half of 2019 mine permits are now in place for all other open pit and underground operations at la libertad as a result of the jabali antenna delays discussed above the planned mill feed for the year of higher grade open pit and underground ore was replaced with lower grade spent ore the resulting head grade for the year was 1 19 g t versus a budget of 1 76 g t in light of la libertad s underperformance its 2018 cost guidance was revised higher in the third quarter of 2018 for full year 2018 la libertad s cash operating costs were reforecast to be between 855 and 905 per ounce original guidance was between 745 to 790 per ounce and aisc were reforecast to be between 1 160 and 1 210 per ounce original guidance was between 1 050 to 1 100 per ounce as a result of the lower than expected production in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company now expects that la libertad will be at or slightly above the upper end of its cost guidance ranges el limon gold mine nicaragua el limon mine in nicaragua produced 49 629 ounces of gold in 2018 q4 2018 11 893 ounces near the low end of its revised guidance range of between 50 000 and 55 000 ounces el limon s 2018 production of 49 629 ounces of gold represents 5 of the company s 2018 consolidated gold production gold production at el limon was also affected by the national political unrest resulting in delays for the receipt of required permits for explosives and other shipments however in the fourth quarter of 2018 mining operations at el limon returned to budgeted normal production rates and development of the new limon central pit commenced in june 2018 el limon s gold production was also impacted by illegal road blockades the blockades were related to local employment issues for the community and were resolved through dialogue with a newly developed community stakeholder committee to ensure local concerns were addressed in light of el limon s underperformance its 2018 cost guidance was revised higher in the third quarter of 2018 for full year 2018 el limon s cash operating costs are reforecast to be at or slightly above the upper end of

average price of 1 262 per ounce compared to 639 million excluding 101 million of pre commercial sales from fekola on sales of 510 966 ounces at an average price of 1 250 per ounce in 2017 this significant increase in gold revenue of 92 586 million was attributable to the higher gold production and timing of gold sales relating to the sale of gold bullion and in circuit inventories included in opening inventories at the beginning of the year in 2017 for accounting purposes gold revenue earned net of related production costs from the sale of pre commercial production were credited to fekola s mineral property development costs for the fourth quarter of 2018 consolidated gold revenue was 272 million on sales of 221 307 ounces at an average price of 1 230 per ounce compared to 174 million on sales of 137 695 ounces at an average price of 1 264 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 2017 results exclude 101 million of revenue from the sale of 79 243 ounces of pre commercial production from fekola 2019 production outlook and cost guidance in 2019 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with consolidated gold production forecast to be in the range of between 935 000 and 975 000 ounces consolidated cash costs are projected to remain low in 2019 with cash operating costs forecast to be between 520 and 560 per ounce 2018 guidance was between 505 and 550 per ounce and aisc forecast to be between 835 and 875 per ounce 2018 guidance was between 780 and 830 per ounce the budgeted 6 increase in aisc per ounce over 2018 guidance mainly relates to slightly higher forecast cash operating costs and higher expected pre stripping sustaining capital costs at otjikoto if a gold price assumption of 1 250 per ounce is used the company expects to generate cash flow from operations of approximately 360 million in 2019 mine by mine 2019 ranges for forecast gold production cash operating costs per ounce and aisc per

between 625 and 665 per ounce gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as new high grade ore production from phase 4 of the fekola pit is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2019 the budgeted 7 increase in aisc over 2018 revised guidance mainly reflects both higher labour costs as workers transition to permanent positions and capital expenditures for mobile equipment rebuilds purchases fekola s aisc per ounce are forecast to decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year mainly due to higher expected gold production in the second half and the timing of budgeted capital expenditures in 2019 the fekola mine is budgeted to process a total of 5 75 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 2 44 g t and process gold recovery of 94 sustaining capital costs in 2019 at the fekola mine are budgeted to total 48 million including 27 million for pre stripping 12 million for mobile equipment rebuilds and 5 million for processing improvements non sustaining capital costs total 10 million including 5 million to complete the relocation of the fadougou village in october 2018 b2gold announced see news release dated 10 25 2018 a substantial increase in the mineral resource estimate for the fekola mine and positive results from the ongoing fekola mill expansion study the new increased mineral resource and the positive results to date from the fekola mill expansion study indicate the potential to increase mill throughput tonnage and increase annual gold production from fekola with moderate capital expenditure based on approximately 192 000 metres of exploration drilling in 928 drill holes including 70 877 metres in 294 holes drilled by b2gold since june 2014 b2gold reported an updated indicated mineral resource estimate of 92 810 000 tonnes at 1 92 g t gold for a total of 5 730 000 ounces of gold and an inferred mineral resource estimate of 26 500 000 tonnes at 1 61 g t gold for a total of 1 370 000 ounces of gold for the fekola mine mineral resources were reported within a pit shell using a 1 400 per ounce gold price and above a cut off of 0 6 g t gold probable reserves at the start of production at fekola were 49 2 million tonnes at 2 35 g t gold containing 3 7 million ounces these initial reserves less material mined to december 31 2017 are contained within the updated resource in addition pit shells were run using a gold price of 1 250 per ounce and demonstrate fekola s resiliency to lower gold prices the indicated mineral resource contains 90 670 000 tonnes at 1 94 g t gold for a total of 5 667 000 ounces of gold and the inferred mineral resource of 16 620 000 tonnes at 1 58 g t gold containing 844 000 ounces of gold the new mineral resource is contiguous to the north of the current fekola reserve pit boundary and extends the resource pit boundary 1 2 km to the north exploration drill results further north of the new resource pit boundary demonstrate that gold mineralization continues to the north and remains open indicating the potential to further expand mineral resources with additional drilling as outlined in the exploration section below infill drilling of approximately 25 000 metres of diamond drilling has commenced in 2019 with a goal to convert inferred resources to indicated resources these and previous drill results will be utilized to calculate new probable mineral reserves for the extended fekola deposit the company recently completed a preliminary fekola expansion study to evaluate the potential to expand the fekola mine and mill from the base case of 6 mtpa of ore throughput to 7 5 mtpa the results of the preliminary study indicate robust economics for the 7 5 mtpa expansion case with estimated process capital costs of 50 million given the additional capacity of the fekola primary crusher and sag mill and other process systems the study demonstrated that the 7 5 mtpa upside can be achieved with an upgrade of the ball mill circuit as well as other equipment upgrades based on the positive results of the preliminary fekola expansion study the company has contracted whittle consulting to work together with the company s technical teams to conduct a study to optimize the fekola expansion the study will evaluate many aspects of potential optimization including mining production rates pit and phase scheduling dynamic cut off grades ore stockpiling blending and dynamic processing throughput and recovery in addition the study will examine various processing throughput scenarios to maximize project net present value and the results will guide mining equipment mill expansion and project schedule decisions the results of the optimized fekola expansion study are expected to be released by the end of the first quarter of 2019 additionally the company will commence work on the front end engineering and design feed for the expansion masbate gold mine the philippines in 2019 the masbate mine is expected to produce between 200 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold primarily from the main vein pit at cash operating costs of between 625 and 665 per ounce and aisc of between 860 and 900 per ounce the budgeted 9 increase in aisc over 2018 revised guidance mainly reflects higher forecast heavy fuel oil hfo prices and the anticipated processing of lower grade ore in 2019 masbate s aisc per ounce are forecast to decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year mainly due to the timing of budgeted capital expenditures in 2019 masbate is budgeted to process a total of 8 0 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 1 07 g t and process gold recovery of 75 2 sustaining capital costs in 2019 at the masbate mine are budgeted to total 29 million including 9 million for pre stripping 6 million for processing spares and improvements and 2 million for mobile fleet rebuilds non sustaining capital costs are budgeted to total 9 million the masbate expansion project for the upgrade of the processing plant to 8 0 million tonnes per year remains on track for completion in early 2019 the upgrade which is being conducted by b2gold s in house team primarily consists of adding a third ball mill and upgrading the existing crushing circuit construction is now basically complete dry commissioning has commenced and feed through the new mill is expected before the end of january 2019 approximately 3 months ahead of schedule with the expansion online masbate s annual gold production is projected to be near 200 000 ounces per year during the mining phase and above 100 000 ounces per year when the low grade stockpiles are processed at the end of the open pit mine life otjikoto gold mine namibia the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 165 000 and 175 000 ounces of gold in 2019 primarily from the otjikoto pit at cash operating costs of between 520 and 560 per ounce and aisc of between 905 and 945 per ounce gold production is scheduled to be significantly weighted towards the second half of the year as a higher grade zone of the otjikoto pit is forecast to be processed in the third quarter of 2019 and high grade ore production from phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is scheduled to begin in late 2019 the budgeted 28 increase in aisc over 2018 guidance mainly reflects higher budgeted hfo and diesel prices increased budgeted mining tonnage and higher expected pre stripping sustaining capital costs otjikoto s aisc per ounce are forecast to significantly decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year mainly due to higher expected gold production in the second half and the timing of budgeted pre stripping costs and equipment rebuilds which are expected to be incurred mostly in the first half of 2019 in 2019 otjikoto is budgeted to process a total of 3 4 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 1 57 g t and process gold recovery of 98 sustaining capital costs in 2019 at the otjikoto mine are budgeted to total 51 million including 33 million for pre stripping relating to phase 2 and 3 of the wolfshag pit 7 million for mobile equipment rebuilds and 4 million to rebuild power plant equipment there is no non sustaining capital budgeted for otjikoto in 2019 la libertad gold mine nicaragua la libertad mine is expected to produce between 95 000 and 100 000 ounces of gold in 2019 at cash operating costs of between 840 and 880 per ounce and aisc of between 1 150 and 1 190 per ounce la libertad s production forecast assumes that production will start from the new jabali antenna pit in the second half of 2019 dependent upon the successful completion of resettlement activities and receipt of the remaining mining permits consequently la libertad s gold production is forecast to be weighted towards the second half of the year la libertad s aisc per ounce are forecast to significantly decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year mainly due to higher expected gold production in the second half and capital expenditures relating to the tailings storage facility lift which are all expected to be incurred in the first half of 2019 in 2019 la libertad is budgeted to process a total of 2 3 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 1 42 g t and process gold recovery of 94 sustaining capital costs for la libertad are planned to total 24 million including 11 million for the last raise of the tailings storage facility and 4 million for underground development there is no non sustaining capital budgeted for libertad in 2019 el limon gold mine nicaragua in 2019 el limon is expected to produce between 55 000 and 60 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 720 and 760 per ounce and aisc of between 1 005 and 1 045 per ounce gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as high grade ore production from the new limon central pit is scheduled to commence at the beginning of the second half of 2019 el limon s aisc per ounce are forecast to significantly decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year mainly due to higher expected gold production in the second half and the timing of capital expenditures el limon mine is budgeted to process 0 5 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 4 04 g t gold with gold recoveries averaging 90 9 sustaining capital costs for el limon are budgeted to total 8 million in 2019 including 6 million in underground development and 1 million in processing spares and equipment non sustaining capital is budgeted to total 23 million including 20 million for pre stripping costs for the limon central pit and 2 million for processing plant improvements in february 2018 the company announced a positive initial open pit inferred mineral resource at the newly discovered el limon central zone at el limon property in nicaragua of 5 130 000 tonnes at a grade of 4 92 g t of gold containing 812 000 ounces of gold see news release dated 02 23 2018 this resource has provided the open pit resources for the expansion study total inferred mineral resources from underground and open pit sources included in this study consist of approximately 6 0 million tonnes at a grade of 4 3 g t containing approximately 829 000 ounces mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability in october 2018 the company announced see news release dated 10 22 2018 positive results of an expansion study for el limon mine and that the company had signed a renewed two year collective agreement with the labour unions the expansion study was conducted as a preliminary economic assessment to evaluate the life of mine options for combining the remaining underground inferred mineral resources with the new el limon central zone open pit inferred mineral resource the results of this study recommend the expansion of the existing plant from 485 000 tonnes per annum tpa to 600 000 tpa and addition of a third stage of milling to achieve a fine grind the result would be a much longer mine life with significantly higher gold production and lower cash operating costs and aisc the third stage of milling also allows for the reprocessing of old tailings at the end of the mine life estimated expansion capital costs over a period of approximately 16 months for plant upgrades and expansions were reported as approximately 35 million positive drilling results continue to expand el limon central zone to the north indicating the potential to expand the mineral resources the zone is also open to depth indicating the potential to mine ore from underground in el limon central area once open pit mining is completed b2gold s technical team is currently updating el limon inferred mineral resource to include recent additional drilling results and conducting mine optimization studies with a view to potentially further improve the positive economics for el limon expansion these studies are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2019 in the meantime b2gold has allocated approximately 2 million of capital in the 2019 budget towards the expansion to ensure that the mill can continue to process 500 000 tonnes per annum with the harder limon central ore included 2019 exploration guidance following a very successful year for exploration in 2018 b2gold is planning another year of aggressive exploration

on november 30 2017 the new fekola mine in mali continued to significantly outperform expectations running above plan on mill throughput and recoveries this resulted in fekola exceeding the upper limit of its already increased guidance range of between 420 000 and 430 000 ounces with gold production of 439 068 ounces in 2018 mill throughput was 5 6 million tonnes for the full year 12 above the budget of 5 0 million tonnes per annum mtpa the mill began running higher throughput during the second half of the year after determining additional capacity of up to 6 million mtpa was available from a detailed plant study mill gold recoveries averaged 94 7 compared to budget of 92 7 and continue to remain above design predictions over a broad range of ore types it is expected that the recoveries will continue to be within the range of design 92 7 and observed 94 7 recoveries the average grade processed was 2 58 grams per tonne g t below budget of 2 69 g t as the higher than budgeted tonnage processed consisted of medium and low grade ore completion of limited medium and low grade ore campaigns in the third and fourth quarter confirmed that the fekola mill recoveries continue to remain above design predictions over a broad range of ore types the resource model continues to perform as expected compared to actual mined grade and tonnage for the fourth quarter 2018 the fekola mine produced 105 280 ounces of gold 16 14 509 ounces above original budget in the fourth quarter of 2017 the fekola mine produced 105 110 ounces of gold including 72 903 ounces of pre commercial

represents 8 of the company s 2018 consolidated gold production as a result of national political unrest in 2018 development of the jabali antenna underground project had been temporarily suspended resulting in flooding of the underground workings the subsequent underground mine dewatering was completed in mid august and ramp development recommenced mine development in the fourth quarter of 2018 extended access to three mining areas zones 1 2 and 3 in the central and eastern areas of the mine ore production from jabali antenna underground consisted only of development ore in the fourth quarter with ore production from stopes in zone 1 and zone 2 anticipated in the first quarter of 2019 in addition the mine permit for the new jabali antenna pit continues to be delayed production had been budgeted to start from the jabali antenna pit in the third quarter of 2018 however progress has been made in key steps toward achieving a mine permit the company now anticipates receiving the permit in time to start production from the pit in the second half of 2019 mine permits are now in place for all other open pit and underground operations at la libertad as a result of the jabali antenna delays discussed above the planned mill feed for the year of higher grade open pit and underground ore was replaced with lower grade spent ore the resulting head grade for the year was 1 19 g t versus a budget of 1 76 g t in light of la libertad s underperformance its 2018 cost guidance was revised higher in the third quarter of 2018 for full year 2018 la libertad s cash operating costs

average price of 1 262 per ounce compared to 639 million excluding 101 million of pre commercial sales from fekola on sales of 510 966 ounces at an average price of 1 250 per ounce in 2017 this significant increase in gold revenue of 92 586 million was attributable to the higher gold production and timing of gold sales relating to the sale of gold bullion and in circuit inventories included in opening inventories at the beginning of the year in 2017 for accounting purposes gold revenue earned net of related production costs from the sale of pre commercial production were credited to fekola s mineral property development costs for the fourth quarter of 2018 consolidated gold revenue was 272 million on sales of 221 307 ounces at an average price of 1 230 per ounce compared to 174 million on sales of 137 695 ounces at an average price of 1 264 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2017 the 2017 results exclude 101 million of revenue from the sale of 79 243 ounces of pre commercial

25 2018 a substantial increase in the mineral resource estimate for the fekola mine and positive results from the ongoing fekola mill expansion study the new increased mineral resource and the positive results to date from the fekola mill expansion study indicate the potential to increase mill throughput tonnage and increase annual gold production from fekola with moderate capital expenditure based on approximately 192 000 metres of exploration drilling in 928 drill holes including 70 877 metres in 294 holes drilled by b2gold since june 2014 b2gold reported an updated indicated mineral resource estimate of 92 810 000 tonnes at 1 92 g t gold for a total of 5 730 000 ounces of gold and an inferred mineral resource estimate of 26 500 000 tonnes at 1 61 g t gold for a total of 1 370 000 ounces of gold for the fekola mine mineral resources were reported within a pit shell using a 1 400 per ounce gold price and above a cut off of 0 6 g t gold probable reserves at the start of production at fekola were 49 2 million tonnes at 2 35 g t gold containing 3 7 million ounces these initial reserves less material mined to december 31 2017 are contained within the updated resource in addition pit shells were run using a gold price of 1 250 per ounce and demonstrate fekola s resiliency to lower gold prices the indicated mineral resource contains 90 670 000 tonnes at 1 94 g t gold for a total of 5 667 000 ounces of gold and the inferred mineral resource of 16 620 000 tonnes at 1 58 g t gold containing 844 000 ounces of gold the new mineral resource is contiguous to the north of the current fekola reserve pit boundary and extends the resource pit boundary 1 2 km to the north exploration drill results further north of the new resource pit boundary demonstrate that gold mineralization continues to the north and remains open indicating the potential to further expand mineral resources with additional drilling as outlined in the exploration section below infill drilling of approximately 25 000 metres of diamond drilling has commenced in 2019 with a goal to convert inferred resources to indicated resources these and previous drill results will be utilized to calculate new probable mineral reserves for the extended fekola deposit the company recently completed a preliminary fekola expansion study to evaluate the potential to expand the fekola mine and mill from the base case of 6 mtpa of ore throughput to 7 5 mtpa the results of the preliminary study indicate robust economics for the 7 5 mtpa expansion case with estimated process capital costs of 50 million given the additional capacity of the fekola primary crusher and sag mill and other process systems the study demonstrated that the 7 5 mtpa upside can be achieved with an upgrade of the ball mill circuit as well as other equipment upgrades based on the positive results of the preliminary fekola expansion study the company has contracted whittle consulting to work together with the company s technical teams to conduct a study to optimize the fekola expansion the study will evaluate many aspects of potential optimization including mining production rates pit and phase scheduling dynamic cut off grades ore stockpiling blending and dynamic processing throughput and recovery in addition the study will examine various processing throughput scenarios to maximize project net present value and the results will guide mining equipment mill expansion and project schedule decisions the results of the optimized fekola expansion study are expected to be released by the end of the first quarter of 2019 additionally the company will commence work on the front end engineering and design feed for the expansion masbate gold mine the philippines in 2019 the masbate mine is expected to produce between 200 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold primarily from the main vein pit at cash operating costs of between 625 and 665 per ounce and aisc of between 860 and 900 per ounce the budgeted 9 increase in aisc over 2018 revised guidance mainly reflects higher forecast heavy fuel oil hfo prices and the anticipated processing of lower grade ore in 2019 masbate s aisc per ounce are forecast to decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year mainly due to the timing of budgeted capital expenditures in 2019 masbate is budgeted to process a total of 8 0 million

6 0 million tonnes at a grade of 4 3 g t containing approximately 829 000 ounces mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability in october 2018 the company announced see news release dated 10 22 2018 positive results of an expansion study for el limon mine and that the company had signed a renewed two year collective agreement with the labour unions the expansion study was conducted as a preliminary economic assessment to evaluate the life of mine options for combining the remaining underground inferred mineral resources with the new el limon central zone open pit inferred mineral resource the results of this study recommend the expansion of the existing plant from 485 000 tonnes per annum tpa to 600 000 tpa and addition of a third stage of milling to achieve a fine grind the result would be a much longer mine life with significantly higher gold production and lower cash operating costs and aisc the third stage of milling also allows for the reprocessing of old tailings at the end of the mine life estimated expansion capital costs over a period of approximately 16 months for plant upgrades and expansions were reported as approximately 35 million positive drilling results continue to expand el limon central zone to the north indicating the potential to expand the mineral resources the zone is also open to depth indicating the potential to mine ore from underground in el limon central area once open pit mining is completed b2gold s technical team is currently updating el limon inferred mineral resource to include recent additional drilling results and conducting mine optimization studies with a view to potentially further improve the positive economics for el limon expansion these studies are expected to be completed

by macdonald dzirutwe harare reuters protests against fuel price hikes in zimbabwe have entered their third day posing a major challenge for president emmerson mnangagwa who replaced long time leader robert mugabe and promised to repair the creaking economy the crisis will not be easy to fix there is a severe shortage of dollars fuel and medicines while inflation hit 31 percent in november the highest in a decade foreign investors are by and large staying away what sparked the latest clashes everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals in the past two months the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods including medicines food and fuel motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line on saturday mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to 3 31 per litre from 1 32 from midnight but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash u s dollars it was the final straw for some zimbabweans and violent protests broke out on monday three people including a police officer died in those clashes and since then much of the country has been at a standstill as people stay at home many people blame mnangagwa for failing to fulfil his pre election promises to kick start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong arm rule of his predecessor genesis of cash shortages the country abandoned the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before in its place the government adopted the u s dollar and other currencies including sterling and the south african rand people hoped the move would spell the end of spiralling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless but over time supply of the u s and south african currencies dried up so in november 2016 authorities in harare launched a surrogate currency paper bond notes designed to ease acute hard currency shortages story continues the notes which now have a total face value of 400 million are backed by a 500 million loan from the african export and import bank the central bank has said they are used like cash officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1 1 on the street 1 fetches up to 3 bond notes reflecting the ongoing shortage of u s dollars and people s desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency a dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as 30 in bond notes companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits zollars when the bond note was introduced dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value government borrowing via treasury bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold it is these electronic dollars theoretically worth 10 billion and nicknamed zollars by economists that are raising fears that zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments zollars remain officially pegged at 1 1 to the u s dollar but on the black market 1 is now worth 4 zollars that has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments zimbabwe s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks cover for imports central bank data show the government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves but on friday the finance minister said zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months how are businesses affected companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment forcing them to buy dollars on the black market the government on monday postponed wage negotiations with civil service unions who are planning a nationwide strike from jan 22 to press for u s dollar pay civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies charities or large international corporations are paid in u s dollars last october the central bank ordered banks to create separate u s dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar the confederation of zimbabwe industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch the group said its members had a backlog of 480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers cooking oil and soap maker olivine industries said on saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers 11 million zimbabwe s largest brewing company delta beverages part owned by anheuser busch inbev said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened what s next despite the unrest at home mnangagwa still plans a visit later this month to the world economic forum in davos switzerland where he is expected to hold meetings aimed at luring back foreign investment the former spy chief installed after mugabe s removal in a coup in november 2017 was elected in july amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for zimbabwe and has said his nation is open for business but critics say the man nicknamed the crocodile is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms including repealing mugabe era laws that restrict the media mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of u s sanctions against officials from the zanu pf ruling party top military figures and some government owned firms which were imposed during mugabe s rule for what washington called violations of human rights and democracy the imf has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country s reform programme unless its 2 billion arrears with the world bank african development bank and european investment bank are paid harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a programme allowing the imf to monitor its economic reforms although it does not entail funding from the lender analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now but more clashes were expected unless mnangagwa s administration could find a solution to the cash woes additional reporting and writing by

the policy choice here which i subsequently confirmed with hammond to be sure relates to the 2000 u s law to grant china permanent normal trade relations pntr upon its subsequent entry into the world trade organization in 2001 the starting point for the now famed autor and colleagues dorn and hanson widely known collectively by the rockstar acronym adh china shock with this view wilcox and hammond today find ample company on the right including in the trump administration as it has become increasingly fashionable to cast pntr as a mistake responsible for the china shock and the wto as responsible for and not equipped to handle china s rise however this argument i e that pntr was an erroneous elite policy choice that disproportionately benefited the elites directly drove the china shock and combined with elites other laissez faire policies permanently scarred america s working class suffers from several flaws flaws that when combined prove fatal for the pntr thesis first and most obviously the thesis ignores the documented benefits of increased u s trade with china over the last two decades benefits that often accrue to the u s working class and manufacturing sector for example even if one were to treat the china shock literature as gospel various studies have found that trade with china in the 2000s still provided ample benefits for american consumers a group that of course includes those directly harmed by the china shock a 2018 paper for example found that chinese import competition between 2000 07 had substantial pro competitive effects on u s firms and generated over 202 billion in consumer benefits via lower prices equal to 101 250 per manufacturing job lost as calculated by the china shock papers a 2017 study found similarly impressive consumer gains another paper found that the consumer benefits of trade which are already heavily tiltedtoward america s poor and middle class were even more so for chinese imports because these u s consumers are more likely than their richer counterparts to shop at places like target and walmart one can argue that these consumer benefits are cold comfort to someone who lost a job to chinese import competition but they are nevertheless real widespreadand important chinese imports have also been found to generate substantial benefits for american companies including manufacturers and their workers one series of papers found that chinese import competition encouraged quite logically many american manufacturing firms to invest and innovate more another pro competitive effect another paper found net welfare benefits i e an economy s overall prosperity and living standards from the china shock for u s manufacturing and non manufacturing across regions just last week the san francisco fed found that about 56 cents of every dollar that americans spent on made in china imports last year actually went to american firms and workers the highest share of any country that same study also found that one third of all chinese imports were intermediate goods e g manufacturing inputs like auto parts used by american companies to produce globally competitive goods and services with respect to these types of global value chains the wto estimates that china is the top user exporter of made in america manufacturing inputs and the second largest source of inputs for american manufacturers behind only canada then of course there are the benefits that american farmers and workers derive from exporting to china the united states third largest export destination there is also evidence that many u s manufacturers adapted in the face of trade competition and automation and ended up hiring more americans just in different areas as the ft s gillian tett just recapped between 1977 and 2012 employees in non manufacturing plants that were owned by manufacturing firms rose from 13m to 23m primarily due to an explosion in service sector jobs such as design and it as a result by 2012 the us s manufacturing companies employed slightly more workers than in 1977 moreover that was not because of business churn 75 per cent of the manufacturing job losses in this period occurred at companies which remained in business and it was the incumbents which opened most of the non manufacturing plants in plain english this means that as chinese competition hit america s manufacturing groups quietly re engineered themselves hey increasingly hire service sector workers as their output soars she then cites other research showing that in many parts of america though not all vanishing manufacturing jobs have been replaced by new service work just in different areas as the ft s gillian tett just recapped between 1977 and 2012 employees in non manufacturing plants that were owned by manufacturing firms rose from 13m to 23m primarily due to an explosion in service sector jobs such as design and it as a result by 2012 the us s manufacturing companies employed slightly more workers

sector workers as their output soars she then cites other research showing that in many parts of america though not all vanishing manufacturing jobs have been replaced by new service work finally other economists have raised questions directly or indirectly about whether the china shock literature is telling a complete story when it comes to chinese imports u s manufacturing jobs and related issues a 2018 paper for example found that after accounting for manufacturing supply chains and those aforementioned intermediate inputs the overall effect of the china shock on american jobs and wages was quite positive another paper from last year used a dynamic general equilibrium model to find far fewer manufacturing job losses caused by the trade shock only 15 percent of the observed decline between 2000 and 2007 and net welfare gains across regions even in manufacturing another found that while the china shock produced losses for certain groups it generated overall gains in social welfare another found offsetting job gains in u s manufacturing exports and services while yet another found one third fewer manufacturing job losses and much different regional effects when using value added instead of gross trade flows and that job losses basically ended in 2008 other experts have raised methodological questions about the china shock findings including on marriage and finally others demand broader perspective about the china shock claims for example delong notes the concurrent and offsetting growth of other working class jobs krugman too while irwin citing a 2014 robert lawrence paper adds that imports from china may have resulted in involuntary displacement of 97 000 manufacturing workers per year on average adjusted to account for voluntary separations but that is less than one fifth of total involuntary job loss in manufacturing and less than 5 percent of all involuntary job losses over the same period autor himself calls the 2 million figure an upper bound that includes around 1 million non manufacturing jobs while his new marriage paperacknowledges that the analysis does not imply that surging import competition from china over the last two decades has been the sole or primary driver of these trends but only a plausible contributor indeed a look at the relatively steady decline in manufacturing jobs as a share of the u s workforce shows only a modest change before and after pntr passed and china entered the wto the moral of this literature review is not that chinese import competition produces only rainbows and butterflies in the united states or that there are no problems in the u s labor market or certain communities but simply that there s another rather large side to the china shock coin that side shows the substantial net benefits from trade certainly not only or overwhelmingly for elites and reveals the china shock issue to be more uncertain and complex than the one sided myopic caricature painted by many pntr china trade critics and more similar to the standard trade story discrete but more concentrated pains versus larger but more diffuse and harder to see benefits that s a story worth telling as are the significant issues arising from american workers failure to adjust to trade and other disruptions but it s not nearly the widespread american carnage you hear so often from those pushing the pntr thesis second the pntr thesis ignores the reality of china s entry into the wto and its export competitiveness for starters pntr did not actually open the united states to chinese imports since 1980 the united states government had granted china normal trade relations ntr status on an annual basis with congress routinely defeating legislation to deny china this treatment even right after the tiananmen square protests and the election of a president clinton who ran against ntr as a result chinese imports to the united states increased more than six fold in the decade preceding pntr and the rational expectation of most u s importers was more of the same chinese imports increased even more after pntr likely assisted by the certainty of permanent trade relations but it s a myth to say that some isolated elite policy choice in the late 1990s first exposed the u s market and u s workers to chinese import competition more importantly however is the ample evidence showing that the pntr elite policy choice was not the only or even main driver of the china shock that occurred in united states in the late 1990s and 2000s a 2017 paper for example found that approximately two thirds of the impact of china s wto entry on u s manufactured goods prices and thus on u s manufacturers and their workers came not from pntr but from china s own tariff reductions resulting from wto entry chinese import tariffs went from 15 percent in 2000 to 9 percent in 2006 the china shock papers themselves emphasizethat china s internal reforms on privatization trading rights and again import liberalization often in response to new wto commitments were major contributors to china s export competitiveness in the late 90s and 2000s a view subsequently confirmed elsewhere in other words pntr probably accelerated chinese exports to the united states though some experts question the magnitude of this driver but china s own reforms far beyond the control of those washington elites now said to be at fault also fueled the china shock furthermore it s a stretch to claim as many do that china s wto accession was really all that shocking at least for anyone paying the least bit of attention to u s trade policy in the 1990s which you d assume would include u s manufacturers and unions china first applied to join the wto under its predecessor the gatt in 1985 then reapplied in 1995 when the wto took over and finally acceded to the body in 2001 china s accession over this time involved dozens of bilateral and multilateral working party meetings negotiating texts disclosures and as noted above internal reforms china s final accession package a working party report and protocol of accession plus liberalization schedules for goods and services contained hundreds of pages of commitments by far the most of any acceding member up to that point and still today considered to be some of the deepest ever including many wto plus commitments that the united states and other members dictated via bilateral accession agreements and have since used for example to challenge chinese laws through dispute settlement or to restrict chinese imports more on these below notably the united states was the final holdout among large industrialized nations to approve china s wto accession via bilateral negotiations with u s negotiators demanding evermore concessions from the chinese government over a contentious 13 year period meanwhile u s trade representatives for multiple presidents from each major party frequently consulted with congress and the private sector including labor unions at every step of the process as required by u s law thus from a simple legal and historical perspective there was nothing shocking about the china shock it s an even bigger stretch to assert that based on the facts at the time washington policymakers really had much of a choice when it came to permanently normalizing trade relations with china in the late 1990s a move that every other wto member had done years earlier in this regard i recommend phil levy s 2018 piece in foreign affairs on the only actual alternatives to pntr each of them letting china in the wto but continuing the annual ntr process or even raising tariffs on chinese goods or keeping china from the wto entirely was clearly inferior in terms of economics and geopolitics to granting pntr indeed denying more than 1 billion people many of whom were in abject poverty in an modernizing economy access to an open multilateral trade organization one that already included communist cuba and for decades and tolerated eastern bloc command and control economies and dozens of socialist countries with pervasive state owned industries was simply not realistic especially given what policymakers knew or possibly could have known at the time about china s economic reforms this last point bears emphasis as noted above the reforms that china undertook during its wto accession often in direct response to wto requirements and member demands were so substantial as to drive along with additional reforms made shortly after accession china s incredible export competitiveness to assert that u s policymakers in the 1990s were somehow naïve that they should have somehow known that these reforms would cease or reverse a decade later under different leadership twice removed and thus deny china entry into the wto or deny pntr becoming the only wto member to do so is applying an impossible standard that only miss cleo could meet third the pntr thesis ignores the missed opportunities since china s wto accession especially the unused checks on chinese trade abuses that were among china s allegedly weak wto commitments as noted above china did undertake substantial trade and economic liberalization before and shortly after entering the wto but problems have undoubtedly arisen since then as my cato colleagues james bacchus simon lester and huan zhu just wrote however most of those problems can be addressed through wto dispute settlement whose rulings china tends to follow arguably moreso it should be noted than the united states if these new cases have not been pursued which they often haven t especially in the trump administration then that is an elite policy choice worth condemning not the original decision to admit china to the wto in the first place indeed it is either mistaken or misleading to claim that china s wto accession terms were weak and that the wto has utterly failed to discipline china s unfair trade practices when the sole means of imposing such discipline dispute settlement and the wto plus rules china agreed to including on intellectual property have never been fully utilized this is declaring defeat before ever firing a shot other elite policy choices since the passage of pntr also deserve scrutiny such as u s withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership which was in large part designed to contain china s geopolitical ambitions tax and tradepolicies that inhibit american companies global competitiveness a general failure to reform state and federal adjustment assistance and worker retraining programs in the face of immense trade technological cultural disruption or the imposition of tax occupational licensing zoning and other policies that actively discourage labor dynamism these policies are indeed worthy of criticism and debate but they have nothing to do with the original choice if you can even call it that to pass pntr allow china to join the wto or otherwise normalize trade with china fourth the pntr thesis ignores the many non laissez faire mechanisms in place for decades mechanisms that simply didn t work a core tenet of the pntr thesis is that american elites simply opened the floodgates to chinese imports with only a timid threat of wto disputes to protect american workers from unfair chinese imports this ignores however the mountain of government interventions that have been utilized at the federal level alone to restrict chinese imports otherwise protect or subsidize american manufacturers or assist american workers on trade the united states still maintains significant tariffs and tariff rate quotas on imports of sensitive products like trucks apparel footwear and food according to the group global trade alert moreover the united states has also long been one of the most frequent users of harmful non tariff government trade interventions ones that far outnumber its liberalizing measures over the same period this includes hundreds of special duties trade remedies like anti dumping and anti subsidy measures on all sorts of chinese imports most often using a special non market economy anti dumping methodology that practically ensures sky high duty rates often more than 100 percent on those goods coincidentally one of those wto plus accession commitments special to china and a few other economies these duties are specifically intended to offset unfair trade and subsidies that injure us manufacturers and workers and as the numbers indicate american companies and labor unions have been quite successful in petitioning for them dozens of other chinese imports are barred from the u s market as a result of section 337 actions that target intellectual property rights violations chinese investment meanwhile can be and has been restricted by the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius and us technology exports to china are often blocked on national security grounds and let s not forget about the auto bailouts the steel industry bailouts the alternative energy subsidies the manufacturing tax credits the exim bank loans procurement preferences like buy american and davis bacon the jones act and the pvsa and the billions of other taxpayer dollars that the united states has doled out to blue collar industries and workers over the last few decades at the federal level alone the united states government has also repeatedly tried to subsidize and retrain workers as i noted a few years ago in national review

despite promises to diversify the economy and fight corruption president joão lourenço s actions so far appear contradictory to his publicly voiced intentions miguel sanz in maputo joão lourenço has been president of angola since september 26 2017 about a year later he cemented his hold on power by taking over the chairmanship of the ruling movimento popular de libertação de angola mpla although he reshuffled the government for instance by replacing the transport minister and the vice president manuel vicente most other ministerial posts had not changed from the previous administration despite promises to diversify the economy and fight corruption his actions so far appear contradictory to his publicly voiced intentions lourenço inherited a dire economic situation characterised by serious shortages of foreign currency particularly of the dollar and the continual devaluation of the kwanza the currency depreciated 40 against the dollar in 2018 in addition inflation has hovered around 30 and is set to rise angola s economic troubles began in 2014 when global crude oil prices dipped and severely hampered the government s ability to generate revenue the country depends on oil for 75 of its government revenue and 90 of its exports an over dependency that has left the country vulnerable to economic shocks diversification has long been the answer but execution of a strategy and plan never materialised in the previous administration lourenço s election campaign centred on reducing dependency on the hydrocarbons sector and creating new revenue streams from existing resources or developing new ones diversification was also a key condition for the international monetary fund imf to agree to a three year extended fund facility for angola worth 3 7 billion which the creditor announced in december last year 990 million would be immediately disbursed ending corruption including bribery and money laundering was another condition diversification a priority angola is in desperate need of cash and therefore lourenço is pursuing an ambitious investment programme to develop the country s agricultural tourism and mining assets for instance the government is planning to invest 230 million across the country over the next six years to support its proyecto de desarrollo de agricultura comercial a development initiative that aims to commercialise the agricultural sector more than 77 million had already been invested in such projects countrywide by the end of 2018 oil majors such as bp total and exxonmobil have also signed memorandums of understanding with the state owned oil company sonangol to develop new ultra deep offshore oil operations but the amount of the investments has not yet been made public a lot of the money for the new investments appears guaranteed by the government against the backdrop of a poor economic outlook coupled with crude oil prices below the levels the government had counted on although brent crude prices rebounded early this year angola will have to resort to more borrowing the reprofiling of its debt with the issuing of 5 billion worth of euro and dollar denominated bonds probably explains the reduced fiscal deficit as maturities have been extended in the medium term but debt to gross domestic product remained at a risky 90 at the end of last year meaning that more commercial loans will be needed to finance the ambitious investment programme and will continue to damage economic growth prospects not least because china is angola s largest purchaser of oil angola already owes beijing about 23 billion but this number could be much higher furthermore because a lot of that debt with china has been guaranteed with oil swap deals increased volatility in crude oil prices is again likely to create more financial headaches for the government foreign investors are also likely to be concerned because a growing debt burden will hinder the government s ability to honour its debt repayments and to unlock financial resources anti corruption international observers were positively surprised when lourenço sacked the children of former president josé eduardo dos santos from key positions at sonangol and angola s sovereign wealth fund fundo soberano de angola fsdea josé filomeno dos santos a son of the former president and former head of fsdea and his business ally swiss angolan jean claude bastos de morais were arrested in angola in september last year on charges that they had conspired to defraud the state in multiple jurisdictions including in switzerland and the united kingdom both have denied wrongdoing based on a recognition that corruption was conducted with impunity under the previous administration lourenço s government in may last year adopted an amnesty bill for the voluntary repatriation of stolen state funds that had been moved offshore authorities in angola and the united states have indicated that close to 30 billion in illicitly obtained money from the state is being held in offshore accounts but the amnesty bill which expired in december appears to have attracted little interest according to legal practitioners on the ground and few actually repatriated any money the government has now promised to go after those who have stolen public funds and hidden it abroad angola s ability to do this remains in doubt repatriation of financial assets will also depend on the willingness of banks abroad to transfer the money tightening anti money laundering legislation across the world has made commercial banks more averse to high risk jurisdictions such as angola diminishing the effectiveness of the law since the de risking of angola s banking sector took place after the collapse of portugal s banco espirito santo in part caused by toxic credit at its angolan subsidiary few western banks have resumed correspondent banking relationships for transacting in us dollars which explains a lot of angola s current problems but because oil dependent angola s financial sector is highly dollarised such correspondent banking is also key to repatriating the stolen funds placing doubt on the likely success of lourenço s policies restoring trust depends on the government s ability to reform the financial sector which remains concentrated around a few politically exposed persons among angolan banks shareholders of the 27 commercial banks registered with banco nacional de angola the central bank and sector regulator five control over 80 of total banking assets deposits and loans the banking sector is highly centralised and the majority of angolans and small and medium sized enterprises are unable to access formal credit given that diversification is a priority of the lourenço presidency his ability to restructure the financial sector will be critical return to old habits lourenço s own behaviour during his first year in office began with lavish spending during a state visit to europe where the angolan delegation signed several agricultural development projects with french financiers among others according to reports on the maka angola news website the angolan delegation went on a spending spree chartering at least three aircraft including a boeing 787 vip private airliner a boeing 737 and a gulfstream business jet according to the leasing company the boeing 787 cost 74 000 an hour to charter this sort of spending does not marry well with lourenço s promises and his narrative of being a modest person others have pointed to the lourenço family s real estate property in bethesda maryland in the us a report by the washington post citing public records said the property was purchased in 2013 for 1 7 million by the lourenço family more questions emerge over lourenço s positioning vis à vis vicente whom portuguese prosecutors in 2017 charged with bribing that country s attorney general in 2011 lourenço refused to recognise the portuguese authorities competency to try the former vice president and lambasted the charges as interference by the former colonial power it was agreed that vicente would be tried in angola instead but this never occurred although vicente has been sidelined from the mpla leadership he remains an influential businessman in angola and abroad another worrying trend is potential nepotism and conflicts of interest including in the military in april last year the president promoted his brother general sequeira joão lourenço to deputy head of the president s intelligence bureau which oversees the military the police and the intelligence services two months earlier he allegedly sold a state owned aircraft to his brother s aviation company without a public tender and at an undisclosed price his plans to expand the military budget should sound alarm bells although angola already has one of the largest military budgets on the continent lourenço is intent on expanding it further ostensibly to fight piracy angola wants to expand its offshore oil production operations and modernising its naval capabilities would ensure security of such operations against such threats but the country has suffered few such attacks in recent years although official figures indicate that angola s military budget halved between 2014 and 2017 sweden based think tank sipri has noted that estimates of real military spending are hard to come by in sub saharan africa despite the decline in september 2016 middle east based privinvest group announced on its website that it would provide naval vessels to the angolan navy and construct a ship building facility together with a london based partner at about the same time it was revealed that privinvest had signed contracts to supply ships to mozambique which were never delivered this deal and two others left mozambique with a bill of 2 1 billion more than its total national debt at the time the company has faced resistance in other jurisdictions such as nigeria the africa report revealed in june last year that the nigerian finance minister in 2014 had refused to accept a 2 billion investment proposal from privinvest after it appeared clear that nigeria would have to provide most of the guarantees for the loans that would finance the joint venture privinvest had reportedly proposed to take control of a derelict shipyard from the nigerian navy and refurbish it conclusion napoleon walks if lourenço is serious about eradicating corruption he should be careful about who he deals with and how this may look to the outside world so far his defence scorecard his lavish spending support for vicente and family appointments have undermined his credibility that the highest ranks of the mpla and the broader governing elite in angola remain intact bar a few cosmetic changes to the political bureau the apex governing body of the mpla is also worrying adopting policies that are likely conditions imposed by international financiers such as the imf but that in reality are unlikely to produce any change in behaviour not only puts his own track record at risk but also mars the reputation of angola the lack of criminal convictions of former senior officials not only of the former president s family but also of other high ranking mpla cadres suggests that their behaviour will not change either the authorities are deliberately delaying the processes to get some initial goodwill from foreign investors or the system is so slow that no conviction will serve to deter future corrupt behaviour the end result is that foreign investors and financiers in angola are setting themselves up for considerable compliance and legal risks lourenço s lack of progress should prompt investors to adopt a more cautious approach just as napoleon in george orwell s animal farm promised a whole new way of governing once in power he quickly adopted the same habits as his former stewards distributed by the apo group on behalf of verdade
despite promises to diversify the economy and fight corruption president joão lourenço s actions so far appear contradictory to his publicly voiced intentions miguel sanz in maputo joão lourenço has been president of angola since september 26 2017 about a year later he cemented his hold on power by taking over the chairmanship of the ruling movimento popular de libertação de angola mpla although he reshuffled the government for instance by replacing the transport minister and the vice president manuel vicente most other ministerial posts had not changed from the previous administration despite promises to diversify the economy and fight corruption his actions so far appear contradictory to his publicly voiced intentions lourenço inherited a dire economic situation characterised by serious shortages of foreign currency particularly of the dollar and the continual devaluation of the kwanza the currency depreciated 40 against the dollar in 2018 in addition inflation has hovered around 30 and is set to rise angola s economic troubles began in 2014 when global crude oil prices dipped and severely hampered the government s ability to generate revenue the country depends on oil for 75 of its government revenue and 90 of its exports an over dependency that has left the country vulnerable to economic shocks diversification has long been the answer but execution of a strategy and plan never materialised in the previous administration lourenço s election campaign centred on reducing dependency on the hydrocarbons sector and creating new revenue streams from existing resources or developing new ones diversification was also a key condition for the international monetary fund imf to agree to a three year extended fund facility for angola worth 3 7 billion which the creditor announced in december last year 990 million would be immediately disbursed ending corruption including bribery and money laundering was another condition diversification a priority angola is in desperate need of cash and therefore lourenço is pursuing an ambitious investment programme to develop the country s agricultural tourism and mining assets for instance the government is planning to invest 230 million across the country over the next six years to support its proyecto de desarrollo de agricultura comercial a development initiative that aims to commercialise the agricultural sector more than 77 million had already been invested in such projects countrywide by the end of 2018 oil majors such as bp total and exxonmobil have also signed memorandums of understanding with the state owned oil company sonangol to develop new ultra deep offshore oil operations but the amount of the investments has not yet been made public a lot of the money for the new investments appears guaranteed by the government against the backdrop of a poor economic outlook coupled with crude oil prices below the levels the government had counted on although brent crude prices rebounded early this year angola will have to resort to more borrowing the reprofiling of its debt with the issuing of 5 billion worth of euro and dollar denominated bonds probably explains the reduced fiscal deficit as maturities have been extended in the medium term but debt to gross domestic product remained at a risky 90 at the end of last year meaning that more commercial loans will be needed to finance the ambitious investment programme and will continue to damage economic growth prospects not least because china is angola s largest purchaser of oil angola already owes beijing about 23 billion but this number could be much higher furthermore because a lot of that debt with china has been guaranteed with oil swap deals increased volatility in crude oil prices is again likely to create more financial headaches for the government foreign investors are also likely to be concerned because a growing debt burden will hinder the government s ability to honour its debt repayments and to unlock financial resources anti corruption international observers were positively surprised when lourenço sacked the children of former president josé eduardo dos santos from key positions at sonangol and angola s sovereign wealth fund fundo soberano de angola fsdea josé filomeno dos santos a son of the former president and former head of fsdea and his business ally swiss angolan jean claude bastos de morais were arrested in angola in september last year on charges that they had conspired to defraud the state in multiple jurisdictions including in switzerland and the united kingdom both have denied wrongdoing based on a recognition that corruption was conducted with impunity under the previous administration lourenço s government in may last year adopted an amnesty bill for the voluntary repatriation of stolen state funds that had been moved offshore authorities in angola and the united states have indicated that close to 30 billion in illicitly obtained money from the state is being held in offshore accounts but the amnesty bill which expired in december appears to have attracted little interest according to legal practitioners on the ground and few actually repatriated any money the government has now promised to go after those who have stolen public funds and hidden it abroad angola s ability to do this remains in doubt repatriation of financial assets will also depend on the willingness of banks abroad to transfer the money tightening anti money laundering legislation across the world has made commercial banks more averse to high risk jurisdictions such as angola diminishing the effectiveness of the law since the de risking of angola s banking sector took place after the collapse of portugal s banco espirito santo in part caused by toxic credit at its angolan subsidiary few western banks have resumed correspondent banking relationships for transacting in us dollars which explains a lot of angola s current problems but because oil dependent angola s financial sector is highly dollarised such correspondent banking is also key to repatriating the stolen funds placing doubt on the likely success of lourenço s policies restoring trust depends on the government s ability to reform the financial sector which remains concentrated around a few politically exposed persons among angolan banks shareholders of the 27 commercial banks registered with banco nacional de angola the central bank and sector regulator five control over 80 of total banking assets deposits and loans the banking sector is highly centralised and the majority of angolans and

gov andrew m cuomo s 175 billion state budget was so jam packed with policies that it will take multiple react o mat editions to capture all the opinions audubon new york executive director ana paula tavares governor cuomo s proposals include an aggressive agenda that will tackle some of the biggest environmental challenges facing our nation we fully support a carbon neutral future achieved through ambitious goals like using our working lands and forests to achieve greater carbon sequestration investing 1 5 billion in responsibly sited offshore wind and other renewables that minimize impacts to birds and other wildlife and banning offshore drilling for oil and gas we are thrilled to see governor cuomo recognizing the importance of natural climate solutions additional grants for forest management will improve forest resiliency and build on the success of audubon s bird friendly forest management programs and a ban on offshore drilling will help ensure habitats for coastal and marine birds are preserved the vision for new york state s forests waterways and beaches should focus on balancing human activities with the preservation of our unique ecosystems a source of pride for all new yorkers and a boon for our state s economy audubon new york looks forward to working with governor cuomo and the legislature to ensure these critical issues for birds and people are enacted into law new york state nurses association communications director carl ginsburg the new york state nurses association commends the governor and the department of health for taking this first and essential step towards enacting safe staffing legislation regulation in hospitals and nursing homes from buffalo to the bronx this is a huge step towards every patient in the state of new york getting the care they need and deserve safe staffing levels are essential to providing quality patient care new york patients are currently at risk because healthcare administrators are forcing nurses and caregivers to take on an unsafe level of patients new york needs a safe staffing law to help ensure that our patients always get the quality care they need studies show safe staffing reduces occurrences of avoidable patient deaths decreases incidents of hospital acquired infections shortens hospital stays reduces incidents of workplace violence and boosts overall nurse retention all of which add up to significant savings for hospitals to put it plainly safe staffing plans would not increase costs for hospitals or nursing facilities in fact just the opposite it would help contain costs and provide better care for all new yorkers new york conference of mayors executive director peter baynes when it comes to local governments and the property tax the governor s budget fails to abide by its theme of justice as it would eliminate state aid for the vast majority of new york s smallest local governments if the goal this legislative session is to enact progressive tax reform it will not be achieved by cutting local aid and removing municipalities ability to follow through on their goal to reduce the regressive property tax burden we urge state legislators to join nycom in the fight to restore these cuts preserve the essential municipal services funded by this aid and protect new yorkers from state induced increases in the regressive local property tax modern families coalition we re thrilled that governor cuomo is fighting on behalf of new york families who rely on medical assistance to become parents by lifting the antiquated ban on surrogacy agreements the governor has taken a tremendous step forward for new york s progressive values said the rev stan j sloan ceo of family equality council which works to advance equality for lgbtq families we look forward to working to ensure swift passage by the state legislature along with our tremendous bill sponsors senator brad hoylman and assemblywoman amy paulin new york association of alcoholism and substance abuse providers executive director john coppola new york has had the greatest system of prevention treatment and recovery services in the country unfortunately years of flat funding has compromised that system and its ability to continue to do its job under normal circumstances let alone in the midst of the opioid heroin and fentanyl crisis while we await the budget bills the funding levels that governor andrew cuomo appears to be proposing are not adequate for a fiscally challenged service delivery system to stop the continued escalation in overdoses and addiction in communities across new york the office of alcoholism and substance abuse services responsible for leading new york s battle against addiction is one of the state agencies that appears to be getting the flat funding referenced in the governor s address this was the budget approach in 2018 and as expected it did not stop the increase in overdose deaths it will not stop increasing overdoses in 2019 either if the bronx was a state it would have the second highest opioid related overdose death rate in the country behind only west virginia that statistic alone should be enough to change albany s approach to the opioid crisis which is the largest public health emergency related to drugs that we have ever experienced we need a smart strategy significant new investments to rebuild the workforce adjusting medicaid rates to accurately reflect costs so treatment providers can keep the lights on expanding medication assisted treatment bolstering prevention efforts and making treatment available on demand 24 7 are just some of the immediate steps we should be taking asap is hopeful the progressive leadership of senate leader stewart cousins and assembly speaker heastie will result in a more comprehensive plan than that included in the governor s proposal a policy change as dramatic as legalizing marijuana for adult use deserves the time and focus warranted by a cautious approach so that we avoid the mistakes made in other states asap urges the legislature to take the time to thoroughly consider all dimensions of legalizing marijuana preferably holding the debate outside the budget asap is encouraged that communities disproportionally impacted by past injustices are given attention in the governor s proposal policies should be driven by science good public health practice and data new york must be better prepared for the avalanche of unintended health and safety consequences experienced in other states brennan center for justice president michael waldman bold democracy reform requires bold leadership and today the governor demonstrated just that the policies he proposed small donor public financing and automatic voter registration will bring more new yorkers into the political process more people will have access to the ballot box and regular new yorkers will have a much stronger voice in albany these reforms are fundamental and they will make albany a model for the rest of the country new york farm bureau president david fisher new york farm bureau is grateful for the historic commitment governor cuomo s proposed budget is making to agriculture in the state the expected appropriations for agricultural research marketing and promotion will be a true investment in the state s farm families in addition there is increased support for the environmental protection fund and programs to address climate resiliency and soil health which are important to the future of new york agriculture new york farm bureau appreciates governor cuomo s leadership with this budget and we will work with him and the legislative leaders to secure final passage of the funding it is imperative in this struggling farm economy that state lawmakers understand the necessity of having strong state support for local food production farms are the backbone of the rural economy and play a vital role that benefits all of new york state new york state united teachers nysut president andy pallotta this legislative session represents a historic opportunity to invest in our future as we review the details of the governor s proposed budget we look forward to working with lawmakers and the governor to add additional funding for k 12 and higher education to immediately fix new york s broken teacher evaluation system and to fully fund suny and cuny reinvent albany reinvent albany appreciates the governor reaching an agreement with state comptroller dinapoli which appears to restore comptroller oversight over certain suny cuny suny research foundation and office of general services ogs centralized contracts in conjunction with the inspector general ig the agreement also gives the ig new oversight authority over all suny cuny nonprofit affiliates for which it can investigate complaints of fraud waste criminal activity corruption or conflicts of interest and refer criminal acts for prosecution contractors vendors and stage agency grantees will additionally be required to certify no collusion or conflicts in bidding and disclose family financial and employment relationships between contractors and state officials or electeds reinvent albany strongly supports many of the clean government measures proposed in governor cuomo s 2019 2020 budget we agree with the governor on a great number of his proposals and we believe there is support in the legislature for many of them we hope the governor works closely with the senate and assembly to reach consensus and put those measures into law drug policy alliance state director kassandra frederique repairing the damage done by marijuana prohibition is not negotiable restitution to communities most impacted by marijuana prohibition is the starting line legalization in new york must be as comprehensive as the damage that has been done throughout the state we have the chance to pass the most progressive marijuana legalization bill in the u s given new york s appalling history with racially biased marijuana enforcement we must be bold and innovative in creating justice and equity we want to see a policy that is responsive to the lives of new yorkers not solely business interests legalization can be an economic engine driving wealth and equity in marginalized communities and providing space for alternative economic systems if we work intentionally new york medical cannabis industry association we applaud governor cuomo for moving forward with a responsible adult use marijuana program in new york and we support his effort to ensure that historically disenfranchised communities impacted by the failed war on drugs participate in the new cannabis economy the registered organizations in the new york medical cannabis industry association nymcia look forward to playing an active role in building the adult use program we ve collectively invested more than 250 million in recent years to develop a state of the art infrastructure that s paved the way for the safest and most highly regulated medical marijuana program in the country we are hopeful the adult use legislation allows the existing medical providers to participate fully as that is the only way to keep prices low enough to ensure patients continue to receive the care they need and to protect against an illicit market we look forward to sharing our expertise with governor cuomo lawmakers and community leaders from across the state to create a robust regulated and equitable cannabis economy in new york liuna ny s patrick purcell on behalf of liuna ny s combined 40 000 members and over 1 500 signatory contractors we applaud governor cuomo for his commitment to hardworking new yorkers and recognizing the need for prevailing wage requirements on publicly subsidized projects for too long new york has been a developer s paradise doling out billions of our tax dollars to subsidize development with little to no standards in return for these investments under the governor s leadership new york will finally be able to shift the paradigm of procurement to ensure our hard earned tax dollars subsidize responsible development helping to end the race to the bottom we continue to see in construction we look forward to working with the governor and legislature in the coming months to make these prevailing wage requirements a reality for construction workers both upstate and down new york public interest research group environment while details are under review the governor s proposed green new deal offers an important starting point for the changes needed to protect residents from catastrophic climate change key climate change actions that must be included are stopping all fossil fuel infrastructure projects and committing to a fossil free future with measurable metrics and robust reporting with over 80 billion in water infrastructure needs the governor s proposed increase by 2 5 billion funding for the clean water infrastructure act if it is over the same time period puts new york on a faster track to repair and replace failing pipes and protect water sources new york must keep up with its trend of increasing funding to finally meet the state s outstanding drinking water needs banning plastic bags and expanding the bottle bill are critical steps to drastically reducing litter and solid waste but banning plastic bags must be coupled with a fee on paper bags to be most effective healthcare too many new yorkers need health insurance and still don t have it despite the federal affordable care act the governor s pledge to strengthen the state s health exchange and to expand coverage is necessary the state should look to other approaches such as one that relies on a single payer system to ensure that every resident has insurance coverage the state needs to do whatever it can to rein in the costs of prescription drugs higher education allowing financial aid for eligible college students who are undocumented is a significant improvement in the state s tuition assistance program the governor s plan to fund the next phase of the excelsior scholarship is welcome however we urge the legislature to closely examine spending on opportunity programs which provide aid and services to some of new york s most vulnerable students protections for student borrowers and regulating loan servicers are critically important and well past due mass transit the governor called for congestion pricing in manhattan to raise billions of dollars to pay for the repair and modernization of the mta s ever worsening transit system as straphangers continue to suffer from some of the worst commutes in the country the state must commit to significant improvements for the city s subways and buses chiefly by fully funding the mta s proposed fast forward plan we support progressive and sustainable sources of revenue like congestion pricing to ensure that happens reforms the governor s plans to improve elections dramatically overhaul and improve the state s campaign finance system including a voluntary system of public financing and further steps to improve voting are changes that should be embraced and improved measures to combat corruption in terms of contracting and ethics enforcement stand out as areas that need close review by the legislature legalizing marijuana for all adult use the governor s proposal to legalize cannabis for adult use in new york is an important step to reduce harms that current policies inflict on new york communities nypirg sees no valid reason to treat 18 19 or 20 year old adults differently than adults 21 or older new york must create a legal marijuana system that considers public health and safety issues and be led in policy discussions by impacted communities citizen action of new york co executive director jessica wisneski it s great that the governor has uplifted his long standing support for public campaign financing by prioritizing it in his executive budget and 100 day agenda there s no better way to counter trump s anti democracy agenda than by passing campaign finance reforms that amplify the voices of everyday new yorkers the new congress has made hr1 their first priority of 2019 in new york we can become national leaders by passing public campaign financing in the state budget the governor senate and assembly now all agree that we must overhaul new york s bail and discovery laws ensure speedy trial and legalize marijuana we need bail overhaul that centers decarceration protects due process and ends race and wealth based disparities in the system any marijuana legalization bill passed must address past harm by expunging conviction records and reinvesting in the communities most harmed by the decades long war on drugs on education the governor continues to ignore the facts public schools across the state are woefully underfunded we all have the same goals to finally achieve equity specifically for systemically underfunded schools in black and brown communities but we must acknowledge that the governor has failed to abide by the foundation aid formula which is in new york state law we are hopeful that the new state senate and long time allies in the state assembly will continue to fight for the funding our schools need the 2 2 billion increase called for by the board of regents aarp state director beth finkel governor cuomo s proposed 15 million increase for services that support working and middle class family caregivers in caring for their loved ones at home would help thousands of families this is a smart and visionary investment these services help prevent unwanted placements in much costlier and mostly taxpayer financed nursing homes and our rapidly aging population is driving higher need the increase would fund more home delivered meals transportation to medical appointments and assistance with bathing dressing and other daily activities the kind of support working and middle class caregivers need to continue caring for loved ones at home thousands of new yorkers are stuck on waiting lists for these critical non medicaid services and the governor s proposal would mean many more new yorkers will finally receive these services it s the right move to support family caregivers who by the state s own estimate provide 32 billion worth of unpaid care every year to our parents spouses and other loved ones aarp urges the legislature to support and enhance the governor s proposal aarp will also work with legislators to advance a tax credit for family caregivers which would help offset the nearly 7 000 that the average caregiver spends out of pocket every year on caregiving nearly 20 of income a tax credit for up to half of annual caregiving expenses up to 3 500 would especially help caregivers of color hispanic caregivers spend over 9 000 to care for their loved ones on average an astounding 44 of their income and african americans spend over 6 600 or 34 of income greater new york hospital association president kenneth raske new york s hospital community supports a number of governor cuomo s budget proposals especially the significant medicaid funding increase which as he stated is necessary given the threat of severe federal cuts to safety net hospitals i applaud the governor for standing with us against these cuts and for increasing the medicaid spending cap from 3 1 to 3 6 the same increase proposed for school aid along those lines i was struck by the governor s description of the stark contrast between recent health care spending increases and recent education spending increases health care spending has consistently stayed within its global cap restraints that s been a huge challenge for new york s financially struggling safety net hospitals i also praise the governor s proposal to study ways to provide universal access to health care gnyha members strongly believe that health care is a human right and stand ready to help with this endeavor the governor also proposes a study on health care staffing and the costs associated with different approaches while we have made it clear that we oppose staffing mandates from albany we will work with the governor and his staff to study the issue we look forward to studying the governor s budget proposal in greater detail and will provide further comments in the coming days national infertility association president ceo barbara collura we are encouraged by governor cuomo s commitment to the principles of the fair access to fertility treatment act this is a great start and puts new yorkers one step closer to fair access to fertility treatment there are more than 400 000 new yorkers struggling to build their families and we are confident the legislature will support them it s time that new york joins the growing number of states that require insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments it s the right thing to do new york state association of county health officials executive director there are several elements of the governor s budget address that appear promising including his proposal of dedicating marijuana tax revenue for public heath education data gathering and monitoring substance abuse prevention and research on cannabis use local public health departments will play a critical role in all of these activities therefore it is imperative that local health departments are properly resourced by the state to do so we also are heartened to see the governor s proposal to raise the age of tobacco sales and e cigarettes from 18 to 21 years of age the state of new york has long been a national leader in the fight against tobacco and the governor s announcement today further demonstrates the state s commitment to public health policy that is aimed to protect communities families and youth from exposure to tobacco products we look forward to reviewing the budget details as they become available and working with the governor and legislature to ensure we can effectively respond to the local public health needs of new york s communities national federation of independent business state director greg biryla nfib is ready to work with governor cuomo to make the landmark property tax cap permanent ensure continued income tax relief extends to small businesses that drive the middle class and bring additional accountability and discipline to government spending these actions proposed by the governor are essential to making new york state more affordable and ensuring small businesses can compete grow and hire in a modern economy nfib and our members remain concerned that some proposed employer mandates contained in the governor s address appear to embrace a flawed one size fits all regulatory model that severely limits the autonomy and flexibility small businesses need to attract talent and remain competitive the roadmap to a strong sustainable economy starts on the main streets that bisect and define every community in this state from the new york harbor to lake erie we look forward to partnering with the governor and every member of the legislature in the coming weeks to support the small business owners that risk it all to create an opportunity for themselves their communities and their state environmental advocates of new york executive director peter iwanowicz governor cuomo s budget acknowledges that it s a new day in new york with thoughtful proposals on environmental priorities like water infrastructure congestion pricing and climate the governor must also recognize that his partners senate majority leader andrea stewart cousins and assembly speaker carl heastie have been leading on these issues for years and are eager to get to work with all three state leaders expressing their strong commitment to the environment there are finally no more obstacles and no more excuses the time for new york to take its place as an environmental leader is now new york state afl cio president mario cilento governor cuomo has once again shown his unwavering commitment to stand up for all working men and women declaring new york state a national champion for organized labor as he highlighted his legislative priorities he called for enacting the most pro labor protections in the country by aggressively protecting the right to organize and collectively bargain i applaud the governor for calling for construction projects with public subsidies to be subject to prevailing wage to ensure they are built properly and i commend him for doubling down on his commitment to ensure working people are treated fairly in our great state in the wake of the janus decision we look forward to working with the governor to grow the middle class by ensuring working people continue to have a voice in the workplace by building an even stronger labor movement young invincibles northeast policy analyst melanie kruvelis the governor s proposed budget highlights the importance of investing in young new yorkers and recognizes that the next generation s ability to thrive is essential for new york s future as getting ahead in new york becomes increasingly more difficult and expensive particularly for low income new yorkers young people of color and the state s young immigrants the governor s proposed budget takes some important steps by ensuring pre existing condition protections remain in place prioritizing the passage of the new york state dream act and making voting easier for every new yorker although there s more work to be done at the state level to address the unique needs of young new yorkers today s proposed budget makes a commendable effort to help address the challenges facing new york s young people we look forward to working with leadership in albany to ensure that every young person in new york can achieve financial stability and flourish new york public transit association president bill carpenter we thank the governor for addressing the needs of transit systems across the state and making congestion pricing a priority nypta will continue to advocate for long term recurring funding for the mta and other systems through additional dedicated funding sources we look forward to working closely with the governor and legislators in the coming months to ensure that transit continues to play an important role in economic development education health care and the daily lives of millions of new yorkers children pac protect ny kids gary greenberg we welcome gov cuomo s support for the child victims act but believe the best outcome is for the senate and assembly to pass the child victims act immediately the governor can sign the bill by jan 30th there are 150 new york kids being sexual abused a day child sexual abuse is an epidemic in new york and this has to end now the child victims act must have no sol on criminal and civil cases a 1 year look back a victims assistance fund mandatory education in schools and mandatory reporting for priest rabbis all teachers all positions of authority the governor mentioned the catholic church and comments the pope made however clergy abuse accounts for just 5 percent of actual child sexual abuse a heinous crime we must give all victims justice and healing unshackle upstate executive director michael kracker we fully support the governor s adherence to a 2 percent state spending cap and the call for a permanent 2 percent property tax cap the property tax cap has saved overburdened homeowners approximately 25 billion since its passage enacting a permanent property tax cap should be a top legislative priority in the coming weeks we re also encouraged by the governor s commitment to upstate infrastructure investment repairing our aging roads bridges and water systems is imperative a strong economy requires a strong foundation despite these positive measures the governor advanced a number of proposals that would severely weaken our economy and hurt taxpayers the proposal to apply prevailing wage to all projects that receive state funding is a death sentence for upstate economic development initiatives under this mandate efforts to fix our crumbling infrastructure would be far too expensive to pursue we also oppose the governor s energy production mandate that would dramatically drive up costs for commercial and residential energy consumers these measures may be touted as progressive but in reality they re just painful additionally we are staunchly against taxpayer funded political campaigns wasting the state s limited tax dollars on high priced political consultants and annoying robocalls is simply unacceptable as governor cuomo has said in the past new york has no future as the tax capital of the nation new yorkers will continue to flee the state until albany takes action to reduce taxes across the board and improve the state s harsh business climate governor cuomo and the legislature must take full advantage of the new opportunity to stand up for struggling taxpayers this moment in time must not be wasted realities of single payer the realities of single payer coalition applauds the governor s efforts to achieve universal access to health care for all new yorkers our broad based coalition of employers health care providers labor unions health plans and brokers fully support his approach of building on the success of the affordable care act which has reduced the number of uninsured in new york to historically low levels and reduced the cost of individual coverage by 50 percent convening a commission for universal access to health care to identify policy options to improve access to care and strengthen new york s commercial insurance market is a pragmatic and progressive approach to attaining universal coverage we look forward to contributing to the policy objectives of the commission institute on taxation and economic policy research director carl davis if new york s lawmakers are going to legalize cannabis sales it s important that they get the tax structure right fortunately gov cuomo has begun to guide that debate in a reasonable direction with his proposal for a hybrid tax structure that considers not just the price of cannabis but also its weight there is ample evidence from colorado and other western states where legal cannabis sales are underway that retail prices will fall significantly in the years following legalization hitching cannabis taxes solely to the price of the drug is a recipe for long run revenue inconsistency and disappointment if cannabis becomes inexpensive then a cannabis tax based on its price will fail to generate meaningful revenue a weight based tax can help create a more consistent and robust revenue stream getting the tax structure right from the outset is important last year excise taxes collected from recreational cannabis sales in the states that have legalized it exceeded 1 billion for the first time cannabis tax revenue is poised to grow rapidly as new york and other states weigh legalizing cannabis connecticut delaware illinois new jersey rhode island and vermont are also considering legalization of recreational cannabis sales this year planned parenthood empire state acts president ceo robin chappelle golston we applaud governor andrew cuomo leadership to protect our access to safe legal abortion by enshrining this essential protection in our state constitution new york led the nation on reproductive rights almost 50 years ago and faced with unrelenting threats from a federal administration we will again the threat to our health care is real and governor cuomo has made it clear that we will never turn back the clock we look forward to working with the governor senate majority leader andrea stewart cousins and speaker carl e heastie to ensure new york continues to protect and advance access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care association of school business officials of new york the governor continues to shift blame for inadequate funding for high need school districts from the state to local districts who are still owed 4 1 billion in foundation aid if a school district is underfunded then how can they equitably distribute resources to individual schools within their district a majority of funding disparities between school buildings are the result of teacher salary differentials for more senior teachers and the location of special needs programs in addition the governor continues another worrisome trend in dictating how school districts spend and allocate their funds which started with the advent of community schools set aside within foundation aid foundation aid is supposed to be unrestricted aid that school districts use to meet their individual needs and now high need districts are being told how to spend any increases in their foundation aid if the governor wants this much control over how school districts allocate their funds he should consider running for school board association of towns executive director gerry geist gov cuomo s executive budget is another tough one for towns that have worked hard in recent years to provide essential services to taxpayers while making do with meager assistance from the state town officials are committed to making smart investments in communities statewide while keeping taxes in check but any proposal to make the tax cap permanent must also take into account the fact that municipal aid has not increased in 10 years and infrastructure funding through the consolidated local street and highway improvement program has not kept pace with inflation the association of towns will continue working with the governor and legislators to ensure that the final budget treats municipalities statewide with the fairness they deserve uber ny senior policy josh gold thank you governor cuomo for supporting congestion pricing a solution experts agree will actually ease congestion while funding mass transit uber believes that all users of manhattan s congested roads whether it s a personal vehicle delivery truck taxi or uber should pay their fair share to keep new york city moving forward american heart association state government relations director caitlin o brien electronic cigarette use among youth doubled between 2014 and 2016 from 10 5 to 20 6 and is continuing to rise this means every day more kids are increasing their risk for heart disease and stroke we have long known that if people don t use tobacco products by the time they are 21 their chances of doing so drop to only 2 percent gov cuomo s recognition of the public health benefits associated with tobacco 21 couldn t come at a better time youth need to realize that while flavored like their favorite candy these products actually contain the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes sweeping tobacco reforms are imperative to preventing deadly addiction and the numerous diseases and disabilities associated with its use we are glad to see that gov cuomo plans to prioritize education for this coming year the academic performance and physical wellness of children go hand in hand so focusing on strengthening school wellness policies in new york makes sense food industry alliance of new york state president ceo and albama crimson tide super fan while new york s retail food industry is supportive of the governor s effort to make the property tax cap permanent and the continued phase in of the previously enacted middle class tax cuts we have significant concerns with a number of proposals incorporated within governor cuomo s executive budget proposal we strongly oppose the proposed ban on single use plastic bags and believe it is not a sustainable solution for new york s environment or the retail food industry a plastic bag ban will simply push consumers to utilize paper bags which is both cost prohibitive to retail food stores and environmentally unfriendly this proposed ban also fails to recognize that new york s food industry is already a leader in promoting sustainable environmental efforts by encouraging the existing reuse and recycling law and by providing reusable bags further we are troubled by the proposed bottle bill expansion and pending review of specific language various labor protection mandates that were presented new york s retail food industry is often the first employer for many new yorkers and is a committed investor in communities across our state it is critically important that lawmakers recognize their importance to our economy as we move through this budget process new labor and environmental mandates cannot be absorbed considering the annual substantial growth in business costs and should be soundly rejected we look forward to working with the governor and lawmakers in both houses to boost new york s retail food industry nature conservancy in new york policy director jessica ottney mahar governor cuomo s robust environmental agenda reconfirms new york as a national leader he proposed significant steps to fight climate change including using our lands such as forests and wetlands to reduce carbon pollution and tackle global warming as well as creating programs to ensure a just transition to the clean energy economy the governor also doubled down on his commitment to a proactive and cost effective way to secure clean drinking water for our communities by proposing an additional investment of 2 5 billion for the current water infrastructure investment act powherny powherny looks forward to seeing the work begun by the women s equity agenda in 2013 to be completed and expanded during the 2019 new york state legislative session under the leadership of gov andrew cuomo the state senate and the assembly issues ranging from health care and women s reproductive health expansion of equal civil and voting rights fair and equal pay child care and education are all on the docket and in the budget this year creating an economy that works for everyone all across the state coupled with expanding rights will ensure new york s place as a progressive leader in the nation new york league of conservation voters president julie tighe new york is again showing environmental leadership as washington moves backward the governor is proposing bold ideas on a host of nylcv priorities for 2019 including congestion pricing a green new deal a 10 billion green future fund steps to address the recycling crisis toxic chemical product disclosure and protecting children from lead exposure we need to act on climate change not simply develop plans and set lofty goals that s why it s so exciting to see governor cuomo s green new deal his plan to green our state s power grid by 2040 with real measurable interim targets and commitment to climate justice are nation leading actions in combating climate change we are also thrilled that cuomo is advancing a congestion pricing plan it is past time to fix the subways and invest in transit deserts while reducing traffic and improving air quality congestion pricing is the only approach that does all three the green future fund will double the clean water infrastructure act s investment in protecting drinking water provide 3 billion for green energy and clean transportation and invest 2 billion to protect natural resources we look forward to working with the governor and our partners in the legislature to move these green policies and investments forward environmental advocates of new york clean water associate rob hayes governor cuomo s budget recognizes that water infrastructure funding is good for our environment good for jobs and good for communities the 2 5 billion in new funding announced today will be a major boost to communities struggling to protect their drinking water from corroding water mains crumbling wastewater plants and lead water lines we applaud the governor s proposal and look forward to working with the state senate and assembly to secure this funding in the sfy 2019 20 state budget american cancer society cancer action network state senior government relations director julie hart tobacco companies have been making a killing off new yorkers it s exciting to know that new york has a chance to be the national leader in standing up to big tobacco we know the tobacco industry can be deceptive and is always coming up with new products to entice kids to start strong tobacco control policies such as tobacco 21 can help reduce the burden of tobacco as the state enacts aggressive tobacco policies it is important for the state to supplement and not substitute funding for the state s tobacco control program in addition to taking a stand against the tobacco industry the state must ensure additional funding is provided for lifesaving cancer screenings lawsuit reform alliance of new york executive director tom stebbins as new york lawmakers finalize this bill they should ensure maximum compensation for the survivors not further enrich the lawyers law firms are already preparing for this legislation to pass by hiring p r firms running ads and setting up shop in new york from out of state stebbins said to protect the funds meant to compensate the victims a section should be added to limit lawyers fees by creating a fee schedule similar to what already exists for medical malpractice lawsuits healthcare association of new york state president bea grause hanys commends governor cuomo for a thoughtful and deliberate approach on key issues facing the healthcare sector the governor has proposed a commission to consider how to achieve universal access to healthcare in new york we believe that studying this complex issue is the right approach the governor has also proposed a nurse staffing study by the department of health we have strongly opposed mandated nurse staffing ratios in the past and continue to believe that inflexible mandates are the wrong approach in this regard multiple studies including the recent massachusetts health policy commission study clearly demonstrate that inflexible staffing mandates do not improve quality and only increase costs we stand ready however to discuss ways to make further improvements in patient safety and quality of care we look forward to a robust fact based dialogue on both of these issues we also support the governor s proposal to codify the provisions of the affordable care act including protections for pre existing conditions as well as his effort to address gun violence finally we look forward to working with the governor and state lawmakers on continued investment in the healthcare system in 2019 the state has made significant progress in recent years climbing in the national healthcare rankings and we want to continue and expand that progress smart approaches to marijuana new york president kevin sabet
investors have plenty to digest this morning as their plates are full with the continuing earnings season as the entree served with a side of news from overseas that could touch on global economic growth bank earnings continued to roll in bank of america nyse bac beat expectations on its top and bottom line as the bank says it benefited from corporate tax relief and rising interest rates meanwhile goldman sachs nyse gs also beat revenue and profit expectations and it was notable that a gain in equities trading revenue offset a decline in bond trading revenue that contrasts with jp morgan chase s nyse jpm and citigroup s nyse c performance jpm on tuesday became the second big bank in a row to report slower trading after c missed on q4 revenue monday broken brexit as earnings season continued investors were also digesting the news from yesterday that lawmakers in britain rejected their prime minister s plan for the nation s exit of the european union failure to approve a brexit plan by march 29 could result in a no deal brexit and no one is really sure what the economic consequences might be a no confidence vote is expected later today as the turmoil across the pond continued stocks seemed to be taking it in stride arguablybecause news reports had already suggested the brexit bill had little chance of passing more broadly the market may have already priced in european political uncertainty to an extent and would need more definitive headlines about whether there will definitely be a no deal exit or not before moving sharply china stimulus in a fresh sign that beijing is moving to shore up the chinese economy the nation s central bank on wednesday made an approximately 83 billion cash injection into the economy the move followed comments by china s premier that raised hopes for possible fiscal stimulus and added to optimism during tuesday s trading worries about china s economy the world s second largest have been mounting recently as the market has seen signs that the economy there could be stumbling notably in the form of recent data on manufacturing story continues on the trade front sen chuck grassley told reporters that u s trade representative robert lighthizer didn t see progress on key issues last week in talks between the two nations according to media reports the news flow about the trade war between the world s two largest economies whether bullish or bearish has kept the market on an emotional roller coaster for months amid worries that the dispute could crimp global economic growth netflix entertains market the communication services sector and the information technology sector were among the best performers on tuesday with the 2018 reorganization of the telecom consumer discretionary and tech sectors there is a good bit of overlap between technology and technology enabled companies in the new communications services sector take netflix nasdaq nflx for example it s a streaming company and doesn t make computers like say apple inc nasdaq aapl but it s still lumped together in the technology growth play that is the faang trade but it s also in the communications services sector so on tuesday it wasn t too surprising to see the whole faang group rally led by nflx s more than 6 5 jump on news that it would raise prices for its streaming subscriptions the news that nflx is confident enough to raise prices seems not only good for the tech sector but also as a barometer for consumer confidence as well however another school of thought might say that paying an extra 2 per month might not be that big a deal regardless of whether the economy is doing well or poorly plus staying in and binge watching tv sounds more like something one might do during an economic downturn and would be a cheaper date than say going out to eat the difference in performance from the financial sector which was up just 0 81 tuesday and communications services which tied for the best performing sector with a gain of 1 74 can serve as a reminder that with the heightened news flow during earnings season investors attention can often be divided the corporate communication also can help make trading more balanced as company performance can help mitigate negative news flow or good news from overseas can help mute worries over domestic companies we ll have to watch and see which of the continuing themes of 2019 get the most focus in coming days corporate earnings fed policy the chinese economy trade or brexit screen shot 2019 01 15 at 4 37 23 pm png figure 1 dropping dollar the u s dollar index dxy which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies and is pictured here as a candlestick chart has been on the decline after gaining sharply at the end of 2018 the ramifications of a meaningfully weaker dollar over time include the potential strengthening of overseas markets data source ice chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results inflection point for the dollar it s arguable that the u s dollar is at a pivot point the greenback rose against a basket of other currencies see above last year helped in part by tax cut spurred economic and corporate growth in the united states safe haven buying amid a topsy turvy stock market and concerns about global growth as the trade war escalated the fed s four interest rate hikes also helped boost the buck but much of that scenario seems to be changing the fed has telegraphed a more measured approach and u s stocks have been rebounding meanwhile there are signs that the u s economy may not grow as fast this year and projections that corporate profits may not be as robust as the first wave effects of tax reform wear off so if the dollar is at a pivot point and does head meaningfully lower in 2019 what could that mean for one thing it may help alleviate some pressure on china and emerging markets for china a weaker dollar could help make chinese investments more attractive helping policy makers who are already looking toward fiscal stimulus as a means of shoring up their economy without devaluing the yuan a weaker dollar would also bode well for emerging market countries with a lot of dollar denominated debt a falling u s dollar could mean that investors and traders might be considering moving some money into developed markets such as the eurozone especially if we get more clarity on britain s exit from the european union that could potentially help to boost their currencies at the expense of the dollar and might contribute to a 2019 where overseas markets could potentially outperform that of the united states producer inflation muted too while inflation has an important impact on both producers and consumers one advantage producers have is that they can often pass along higher production costs to end buyers so keeping an eye on what producers pay for inputs can be an important part of fed watching at the moment the fed has been more dovish in its commentary saying that it can afford to be patient with monetary policy because inflation is muted as we saw last week consumer prices in december fell 0 1 month over month and the core consumer price index which strips out food and energy rose an as expected 0 2 those benign numbers were reinforced on tuesday when data showed that december headline u s producer prices dropped by a more than expected 0 2 while core producer prices fell 0 1 even though a 0 2 rise had been expected producer price inflation is moderating which will

donald trump tells us the us economy is absolutely booming the strongest we ve ever had and the greatest in the history of america well at his mar a lago country club where the price of admission has doubled to 200 000 he is right the economy could not be better for the top 1 and corporate america in 2017 the top 10 corporate executives in america saw their combined compensation skyrocket by over 60 from the year before soaring to 1 85bn the top 25 hedge fund managers on wall street made over 15 3bn in compensation in 2017 up 40 from 2016 the highest in four years incredibly this 15 3bn is nearly double what all 140 000 kindergarten teachers in america made last year not surprisingly since trump was elected the five richest people in america have seen their wealth go up by over 100bn and corporations have announced over 1tn in stock buybacks in 2018 alone yes under trump the economy is absolutely booming for the billionaire class and corporate america but for working families the economy is not doing so great remember when trump promised that his tax giveaway to the rich would put an extra 4 000 into the pockets of middle class families well it didn t quite happen that way the reality is that bonuses for average workers are up by just two cents an hour since trump s tax plan was signed into law over the past year wages for average workers are up by 1 2 just 9 11 a week after adjusting for inflation meanwhile while the very rich get richer millions of americans are working longer hours for lower wages that is the economic reality under trump and that is the economic reality of the past 40 years the truth is that the average worker makes less today than he or she made 43 years ago after adjusting for inflation in other words as the price of healthcare prescription drugs housing childcare and a college education continue to go through the roof wages for the average worker have not kept pace further while the official unemployment rate is relatively low at 3 9 the real unemployment rate is much higher if you include those who have given up looking for work and those who are working part time when they need a full time job the real unemployment rate is not 3 9 it is 7 6 even worse over 20 of americans in their prime working years between the ages of 25 54 do not have a job which is higher than was the case 11 years ago and the real unemployment rate for young adults is still off the charts according to the most recent data from the economic policy institute over 25 of young white americans between the ages of 18 and 21 who have graduated high school are unemployed or underemployed for hispanic people in the same age group it is nearly 27 and young african american adults are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 40 no donald trump the economy is not absolutely booming when nearly 80 of workers live paycheck to paycheck hoping that they don t get sick or that their car doesn t break down it s not the greatest economy in the history of america when 43 of households can t afford to pay for housing food childcare healthcare transportation and a cellphone without going into debt the economy is not booming when americans are reaching retirement age in worse financial shape than their parents and when about half of older americans have no retirement savings and no idea how they will be able to retire in dignity it s not the strongest economy we ve ever had when hundreds of thousands of young people are unable to go to college because of the cost over 30 million americans have no health insurance one out of five americans can t afford the medicine prescribed by their doctors and over 40 million americans are living in poverty this is not an economy we should be proud of when we have the highest childhood poverty rate in the developed world and life expectancy in the us has gone down for the third year in a row while working families continue to struggle the us now has more income and wealth inequality than at any time since the 1920s while working families continue to struggle the us now has more income and wealth inequality than at any time since the 1920s since the wall street crash 46 of all new income that has been created in the us has gone to the top 1 corporate ceos have seen their incomes go up by 937 over the past 40 years and now make over 360 times more than their average workers while corporate profits are near an all time high wages as a percentage of the economy are near an all time low the most important economic reality of our time is that over the past 40 years there has been an enormous transfer of income and wealth from the middle class to the wealthiest people in america since 1979 the bottom 90 of americans have seen their share of national income decline from 58 to just 46 costing them nearly 11 000 per household as bad as income inequality is the inequality in wealth is even worse in america today the top 0 1 owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 the three wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of americans 160 million people meanwhile the median household in america has less wealth today than it did 35 years ago after adjusting for inflation and the average wealth of those in the bottom 40 is virtually zero while low income workers at walmart are forced to rely on food stamps medicaid and public housing to survive the walton family is now worth nearly 170bn shockingly the wealth gap between white americans and african americans has more than tripled over the past 50 years today the median white family has almost 10 times as much wealth as the median black family at a time of massive income and wealth inequality trump s policies are moving this country in exactly the wrong direction over 83 of the benefits of trump s tax plan is going to the top 1 the morally bankrupt budget trump released last year would have made massive cuts to programs desperately needed by working families the elderly the sick the children and the poor that is unacceptable instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations we must demand that they pay their fair share in taxes instead of an austerity program for working families and the poor we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations instead of throwing millions of americans off of the healthcare they have we must join every other major country on earth and guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege through a medicare for all system instead of cutting social security and nutrition assistance for seniors we should expand those programs so that every american can retire with dignity and respect instead of gutting the social safety net we should raise the minimum wage to a living wage of 15 an hour instead of cutting pell grants and increasing interest rates on student loans we should make public colleges and universities tuition free and substantially lower student debt instead of privatizing our infrastructure we should rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges transit and rail water systems and electric grid and create up to 15m good jobs in the process together we must fight for a society that works for the many not the few we must fight for economic social racial and environmental justice not unbridled greed
this essay draws on a talk given at fpri s miami salon on december 6 2018 china s one belt one road obor project was late in coming to latin america and the caribbean lac first announced by president xi jinping in 2013 obor later renamed the belt and road initiative bri did not arrive in the lac until 2018 when at a meeting of the china celac community of latin america and the caribbean chinese foreign minister wang yi claimed that bri would inject new energy into the china celac comprehensive cooperative partnership and open up new prospects given the impressive rise of the people s republic of china to the world s second largest economy first by some measures and the difficulties that many lac countries were experiencing it is hardly surprising that wang s offer was greeted with enthusiasm if brought to completion the integration of the lac region into bri would comprise 65 percent of the world s population and 40 percent of global gdp origins of the belt and road bri is a breathtakingly ambitious program designed to underwrite the costs of global economic growth as first explained the road would revive the ancient silk route albeit in re imagined form that passed through central asia with an equally fanciful maritime route that extended to southeast asia and africa there is a good deal of creativity here there were actually several routes through central asia they had their heyday during the mongol i e non han chinese yuan dynasty and the name silk route s itself was coined by german geographer baron ferdinand von richthofen who wrote of seidenstrasse chinese merchants did indeed venture to japan and southeast asia but with the exception of the short lived voyages of zheng he 1405 1433 the country was basically an inward focused continental power by the time that the bri reached lac the difficulties it created elsewhere had become well known in malaysia prime minister mahathir mohamad has accused his predecessor najib razak of complicity in a 15 billion dollar scheme involving deals with chinese companies to construct infrastructure projects at wildly inflated prices the chinese malay broker jho lo educated at harrow and the wharton school is believed to be in hiding in china before failing to be re elected najib had been conducting secret talks with the chinese leadership to allow chinese navy ships to dock at two malaysian ports when information began to leak the chinese offered to bug the homes and offices of wall street journal reporters who were investigating the allegations in sri lanka the port of hambantota has become the symbol for how china s largesse can result in disaster with only a one ship a day docking there and elephants trampling the port s surrounding fences the government was unable to pay back its loans and granted china a 99 year lease for debt relief in pakistan the imran khan government is being investigated for awarding a bri related dam construction project to a consortium of a chinese company and one founded by the prime minister s adviser after disqualifying another bid chinese nationals and pakistani workers on the china pakistan economic corridor have been murdered and there is controversy over the chinese presence at the strategically important port of gwadar and in new york patrick ho chi ping a hong kong surgeon is on trial for bribery charges related to his promotion of bri marketing his scheme as globalization 2 0 ho was able to sign nearly 20 billion in deals in africa russia and the u s with the bribes being listed as charitable donations from a virginia foundation that received its funding from shanghai china s loans to africa have been accused of encouraging dependency utilizing corrupt deals and endangering its natural resources kenya is in danger of losing its port at mombasa to china if as predicted it defaults on loans in europe there are concerns with chinese management with the port of piraeus in greece and with trainloads of goods entering europe but returning to china empty one belt one way according to skeptics thereby exacerbating the imbalance of trade warning signs ignored under such circumstances lac leaders might be expected to be wary of joining the bri yet wang s initiative was eagerly received in the words of one latin american economist much was promised little was demanded initially only a few countries formally declared their membership by signing memoranda of understanding mous panama was the first soon after it broke diplomatic ties with taiwan in november 2017 but 14 others signed on subsequently with the latest being ecuador in december 2018 the majority are smaller countries in central america and the caribbean or members of the new left venezuela bolivia and ecuador larger countries like argentina brazil colombia mexico and peru have not yet signed on since little has been made public about the terms of the mous it is difficult to assess the significance of accession to the bri formal agreement is not a prerequisite for participation in the bri or for receiving chinese loans and attracting chinese investment but it has been hinted that beijing would be more generous to those who do so as a case in point when the south pacific kingdom of tonga joined the bri in late 2018 it received a five year deferral on payment of a loan that china had given the kingdom several years before tonga is one of eight island nations in the south pacific that owe significant debt to china and repayment would have put significant strain on its resources in the lac case a number of infrastructure projects undertaken with china had been in existence before the bri was announced since they were in essence folded into the agreement there are problems in determining what effect participation in bri will have on the economies of the countries involved understandably chinese interests focus on projects that are of most value to the prc s own economy meaning the extractive industries foodstuffs and atlantic to pacific infrastructure endeavors that will reduce the time and costs needed to transport these commodities to china and bring back chinese goods for sale in the lac infrastructure projects include track renewal for argentina s belgrano cargas railway construction of the bi oceanic railway in peru and brazil and the tele pires dam in brazil in chile a trans pacific fiber optic cable that would connect china and chile has been under consideration since 2015 foreign minister roberto ampuero sees this and other bri projects as increasing status as an economic powerhouse in latin america backers hope that its completion will result in increased levels of general investment in santiago it is possible however that the undertaking will be adversely affected by the recent revelation that the chinese telecommunications giant huawei which would construct the cable has engaged in spying a brief summary of developments in several of the larger countries in the lac is illustrative of current trends brazil brazil may be an example of chinese clout indicating that resistance may be futile so cooperation with the prc is the only feasible alternative during his campaign for the presidency the outspoken jair bolsonaro showed hostility to china saying most notably that china wasn t buying from brazil it was buying up brazil however a week after winning the contest the president elect met with the chinese ambassador to brasilia sounding much more friendly describing china as a great cooperation partner bolsanaro said he welcomed chinese investment and hoped that there would be more trade between the two countries he had good reason to do so beijing has been quick to use economic warfare to deal with recalcitrant partners as then argentine president cristina fernández de kirchner discovered when her government filed anti dumping charges against china in 2010 china then discovered quality control issues with argentine soya diverting its purchases to brazil until argentina withdrew the charges something similar could happen to brazil the prc has been the country s largest trading partner since 2009 indicating that a cessation of or even slowdown in trade would have serious consequences brazil s exports to china in 2018 approached 50 billion about twice what it earned from the united states since bolsonaro s administration has had a rocky start help from china will seem attractive still given beijing s interest in extractive industries cooperation with the prc seems likely to create more problems for him china s record on both the treatment of indigenous peoples and on environmental protection was already under fire before bolsonaro assumed the presidency with one focus of criticism being the aforementioned tele pires dam a group of 21 non governmental organizations from argentina brazil bolivia ecuador and peru recently filed three reports from their review of 18 projects managed by 15 chinese business consortia the group found a systematic violation of the rights to prior consultation and participation alongside forced evictions destruction of places of cultural and natural importance and the criminalization of community leaders environmentalists are likewise concerned with destruction of the amazon which they describe as simultaneously a carbon sink the earth s lungs and a rainmaker for the planet sixty percent of the amazon rain forest is in brazil venezuela venezuela has become the lac s poster child for what can go wrong by accepting chinese loans after the country ran up a debt of over 70 billion dollars and spiraled into hyperinflation beijing cut back on further lending with venezuela s oil output mortgaged to china to meet its obligations in september president nicolas maduro went to beijing to plead for additional funds which apparently were not forthcoming the president agreed to sell an additional 9 9 percent stake to a sino venezuelan joint venture to a chinese state corporation which already controlled 40 percent with oil services and procurement at the joint venture to be handled by chinese companies according to reuters it was unclear what beijing was giving in return even more worrisome is the maduro government s collaboration with the huge chinese telecom company zte on a system known as carnet de la patria fatherland cards the project involves more than technical assistance a unit of zte is embedded within the venezuelan telecom provider cantv zte is only in theory a private company and has had various problems with the u s including being fined 1 19 billion for breaking sanctions by selling electronics to iran and north korea the carnet is a national database that can set up payments for medicine pensions and food but will also enable the government to keep track of dissidents and quash dissenting views domestically there have been complaints about this infringement of privacy while international business interests point out that the card will also give china a database not only on venezuelan citizens but also on foreign companies and their non venezuelan employees ecuador ecuador s government is also facing a huge budget deficit caused largely by debts to china run up by a previous president rafael correa committed the country to ship 90 percent of its exportable crude to the prc until 2024 under terms that have never been disclosed leaving current president lenin moreno to cope with the problem speaking to ecuador s national assembly in november finance minister richard martinez described the situation as unsustainable saying that the country needs a bailout loan of 10 billion from the international monetary fund much of the money from china has been wasted on projects that are not only useless but also dangerous the coca coda sinclair dam that was supposed to lift ecuador out of poverty has developed cracks in its chinese made machinery shorting out the country s entire electricity grid the only time engineers tried to use it coca coda is located near an active volcano which geologists have said could wipe the dam away with a chinese diplomat cited by the new york times as explaining we didn t give sufficient attention to the environmental reporting bolivia bolivia under president evo morales was also a recipient if chinese largesse receiving a 7 billion credit line in 2015 that helped it to achieve a 4 percent economic growth rate however by 2017 bolivia s accumulated debt to china stood at 710 million more than nine times that of a decade before and its trade deficit with the prc was 1 5 billion a six fold increase over the same time period most of the companies who were awarded contracts for infrastructure projects are chinese and according to bolivian senator jose alberto gonzalez china is pursuing its own interests it is the bolivian people who pay for it in the future future prospects at both the apec summit and in meetings with leaders of central american states u s vice president mike pence warned about debt diplomacy and debt traps urging countries to avoid a constricting belt or a one way road while requiring transparency in their commercial partnerships with other nations although pence named no nations the prc foreign ministry spokesperson immediately rebutted that washington was indiscreetly pinning labels on china to serve its own political needs at the expense of the well being of the people in developing countries there is nothing inherently wrong with the bri many countries might welcome cooperation with china as an opportunity to play the prc off against traditional trading partners bri is also attractive since it carries potential for gain both for individual leaders several have been accused of corruption and their countries however many appear to have given too little thought to the possible disadvantages like any other shrewd business entity beijing will portray its motives as altruistic while contributing to the benefit of all a win win situation is the standard phrase as in any economic system however there will be winners and there will be losers despite bolivia s woes its space agency reported that the country s first communications satellite tupac katari 1 earned 102 million in its first five years tksat 1 was launched in china and its personnel were trained there and a panamanian fruit export company was optimistic that its products would be enthusiastically received in the prc a chinese professor at a u s university believes that many of the prc s problems in latin america are caused by a lack of experience with environmental regulations and in dealing with ngos and that they will be able to adjust to the more democratic setting there nonetheless at least currently problems seem to outweigh advantages to concerns with the lack of transparency in agreements should be added the potential for de industrialization concentration on supplying the food and energy demands of the prc has diverted attention from the industrialization that lac countries have long pursued since chinese manufactured goods typically undercut the prices of domestically produced equivalents there has been de industrialization in some sectors and a decrease in inter lac trade in favor of trade with the prc it is also necessary to remember that what the prc promises does not always materialize finally it has proved impossible for the diverse countries of the lac to speak with one voice with beijing as has been seen with purchases of argentine soya being switched to brazil after a trade spat china can play one lac state against another caveat emptor author s note the prc actually has many environmental regulations though evasion in complying with them is widespread ngos also exist but are under constant scrutiny and are closed down for seemingly minor reasons
houston business wire kinder morgan inc nyse kmi today announced that its board of directors approved a cash dividend of 0 20 per share for the fourth quarter 0 80 annualized payable on february 15 2019 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on january 31 2019 kmi is reporting fourth quarter net income available to common stockholders of 483 million versus a net loss available to common stockholders of 1 045 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and distributable cash flow dcf of 1 273 million a 7 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 in 2018 kmi continued to fund all growth capital through operating cash flows with no need to access capital markets for that purpose the dividend we are declaring is a 60 percent increase from the 2017 fourth quarter dividend and is consistent with the plan to return value to shareholders that kmi announced during the summer of 2017 said richard d kinder executive chairman we are pleased that so far two of the three ratings agencies recognized the tremendous progress we made on our balance sheet and we fully expect the third agency to upgrade us later this year the fourth quarter capped a transformative year for kmi chief executive officer steve kean noted in 2018 we grew our business strengthened our balance sheet increased our dividend and found new opportunities to meet the growth in demand for u s infrastructure needed to serve domestic and global markets contributions from our natural gas segment were up substantially compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 we continued to make progress on two projects critical to the development of resources in the permian basin the gulf coast express and permian highway pipeline projects our three year campaign to strengthen kmi s balance sheet reached an important milestone as we ended 2018 with long term and short term debt less cash and cash equivalents of approximately 33 2 billion and an adjusted net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 4 5 times consistent with that achievement moody s and standard poor s have upgraded our credit ratings and we are on positive outlook for an upgrade by fitch ratings inc later in the year kmi president kim dang said we had a great year in 2018 earnings per common share increased from 0 01 in 2017 to 0 66 in 2018 or by more than 60 times the 2017 level our dcf per share of 2 12 exceeded 2017 dcf per share by 0 12 per share or 6 percent and we beat our budget by 0 07 per share or 3 percent the significant growth in segment earnings versus the fourth quarter of 2017 was led primarily by our natural gas segment that group s success mirrors the record breaking year enjoyed by the natural gas sector as a whole u s natural gas demand rose to 90 billion cubic feet per day bcf d from 81 bcf d in 2017 an 11 percent increase our interconnected natural gas transportation network strategically located products pipelines hub focused terminals and competitively advantaged co 2 business are well positioned to capitalize on increased u s oil and natural gas production we continue to benefit from fee based assets that generate predictable cash flows and a network that provides our customers with unrivaled flexibility dang continued once again we had very good commercial and operating performance we generated fourth quarter earnings per common share of 0 21 compared to a loss of 0 47 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and dcf of 0 56 per common share representing 6 percent growth over the fourth quarter of 2017 this resulted in nearly 821 million of excess dcf above our declared dividend as noted above kmi reported fourth quarter net income available to common stockholders of 483 million compared to a net loss available to common stockholders of 1 045 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and dcf of 1 273 million up 7 percent from 1 190 million for the comparable period in 2017 the increase in dcf compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to greater contributions from the natural gas business segment lower general and administrative expenses and lower preferred equity dividend payments these contributions were partially offset by reductions in kinder morgan canada earnings resulting from the trans mountain sale and reduced contributions from our terminals and co 2 segments net income was impacted by a 1 432 million favorable change in certain items compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 largely due to the impact of a charge related to the 2017 tax cut and jobs act taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 kmi s project backlog for the fourth quarter stood at 5 7 billion approximately 800 million less than the third quarter of 2018 with additions of 500 million in new projects primarily in the natural gas pipelines segment offset by approximately 1 3 billion in projects placed in service and other project capital adjustments excluding the co 2 segment projects kmi expects projects in the backlog to generate an average capital to adjusted ebitda multiple of approximately 5 3 times for the full year kmi reported net income available to common stockholders of 1 481 million compared to 27 million for 2017 and dcf of 4 730 million up 6 percent from 4 482 million for 2017 the increase in dcf was driven by greater contributions from the natural gas products pipelines and co 2 business units as well as lower general and administrative expense and lower preferred equity dividend payments these contributions were partially offset by reductions in kinder morgan canada earnings resulting from the sale of the trans mountain pipeline system higher sustaining capital expenditures and higher interest expense net income available to common stockholders was impacted by a 944 million favorable change in total certain items compared to 2017 largely due to the impact of the 2017 tax cut and jobs act related charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 as noted above 2019 outlook for 2019 kmi s budget contemplates declared dividends of 1 00 per common share dcf of approximately 5 0 billion 2 20 per common share and adjusted ebitda of approximately 7 8 billion kmi forecasts to invest 3 1 billion in growth projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2019 kmi expects to use internally generated cash flow to fully fund its 2019 dividend payment as well as the vast majority of its 2019 discretionary spending without the need to access equity markets kmi also expects to end 2019 with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 4 5 times kmi does not provide budgeted net income attributable to common stockholders the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to dcf and adjusted ebitda due to the impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by gaap such as ineffectiveness on commodity interest rate and foreign currency hedges unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities kmi s budgeted expectations assume average annual prices for west texas intermediate wti crude oil of 60 00 per barrel and henry hub natural gas of 3 15 per million british thermal units mmbtu consistent with forward pricing during the company s budget process the vast majority of revenue kmi generates is fee based and therefore not directly exposed to commodity prices for 2019 we estimate that every 1 per barrel change in the average wti crude oil price impacts dcf by approximately 8 million and each 0 10 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas impacts dcf by approximately 1 million the primary area where kmi has commodity price sensitivity is in its co 2 segment with the majority of the segment s next 12 months of oil and ngl production hedged to minimize this sensitivity the segment is currently hedged for 32 002 barrels per day bbl d at 55 81 bbl in 2019 17 000 bbl d at 56 37 bbl in 2020 9 400 bbl d at 55 06 bbl in 2021 and 3 500 bbl d at 56 88 bbl in 2022 overview of business segments the natural gas pipelines segment finished the year strong the segment s financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2018 was significantly higher relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 said kmi president kim dang the transmission assets saw higher revenue on el paso natural gas epng and natural gas pipeline company of america ngpl due primarily to increased permian related activity on kinder morgan louisiana pipeline kmlp due to the sabine pass expansion and on colorado interstate gas pipeline cig due to continued growing production in the dj basin the segment also benefited from continued increased activity on kinderhawk and south texas due to increased drilling and production in the haynesville and eagle ford basins these gains were partially offset by lower commodity pricing on hiland and loss of revenue due to a contract termination on southern gulf lng natural gas transport volumes were up 4 5 bcf d or 15 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by higher throughput on epng due to additional permian capacity sales on cig due to growing dj basin production on tgp due to power demand and projects placed in service on the texas intrastates kinder morgan texas pipeline tejas due to higher demand from shippers serving mexico and the texas gulf coast industrial markets and on ngpl due to cold weather early in the quarter increased permian receipts and power demand natural gas gathering volumes were up 21 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to higher volumes on the kinderhawk system natural gas is critical to the american economy and to meeting the world s evolving energy needs objective analysts project u s natural gas demand including net exports of liquefied natural gas lng and exports to mexico will increase from 2018 levels by 32 percent to nearly 119 bcf d by 2030 of the natural gas consumed in the u s about 40 percent moves on kmi pipelines and roughly the same percentage holds true for u s natural gas exports kmi expects future natural gas infrastructure opportunities through 2030 will be driven by greater demand for gas fired power generation across the country forecast to increase by 15 percent net lng exports forecast to increase almost five fold exports to mexico forecast to rise by 39 percent and continued industrial development particularly in the petrochemical industry the products pipelines segment earnings were up compared with fourth quarter 2017 performance due to contributions from the utopia double h and cochin pipelines partially offset by reduced contributions from kmcc dang said total refined products volumes were up 1 percent for the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2017 ethanol volumes for the quarter were up 5 percent while crude and condensate pipeline volumes were up 10 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 ngl volumes were down 11 percent in the quarter versus the previous comparable period due to unattractive pricing differentials across the cochin system lower volumes have minimal financial impact given the terms of the underlying contracts the terminals segment was down versus the fourth quarter of 2017 contributions from our liquids business which accounts for approximately 80 percent of the segment total were down 4 percent as the benefits of capacity increases in key hubs along the houston ship channel and edmonton alberta as well as organic volume growth at several houston area locations were more than off set by tank lease costs at our edmonton south terminal following the sale of trans mountain and continued softness in the new york harbor refined products storage market particularly at our staten island location said dang the edmonton south terminal tank lease costs have existed since the terminal was developed but prior to the trans mountain sale were treated as intercompany and not allocated to the segment dang continued despite higher coal volumes contributions from our bulk business were down 10 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 with earnings negatively impacted by certain asset divestitures and the expiration of a major coal contract co 2 segment earnings were down versus the fourth quarter of 2017 on lower ngl volumes and lower oil prices slightly offset by higher co 2 prices fourth quarter 2018 combined oil production across all of our fields was flat compared to the same period in 2017 on a net to kmi basis with increases in sacroc and tall cotton volumes up 5 percent and 26 percent respectively offset by declines at our other assets fourth quarter 2018 net ngl sales volumes of 9 4 thousand barrels per day mbbl d were down 7 percent compared to the same period in 2017 due to an operational outage in total for the full year of 2018 oil production on a gross and net to kmi basis was up 2 and 3 percent respectively versus 2017 dang said our realized weighted average oil price for the quarter was down 6 percent at 55 57 per barrel compared to 59 32 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2017 kinder morgan canada no longer has contributions due to the sale of trans mountain on august 31 2018 trans

conference call on the company s fourth quarter earnings non gaap financial measures the non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures of distributable cash flow dcf both in the aggregate and per share segment earnings before depreciation depletion amortization and amortization of excess cost of equity investments dd a and certain items segment ebda before certain items net income before interest expense taxes dd a and certain items adjusted ebitda adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per common share are presented herein certain items as used to calculate our non gaap measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either 1 do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or 2 by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses dcf is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders before certain items for dd a total book and cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and by external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and to measure and estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to dcf is provided herein dcf per share is dcf divided by average outstanding shares including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business general and administrative expenses are generally not under the control of our segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment earnings before dd a and amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment ebda segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for the certain items attributable to a segment which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables adjusted ebitda is calculated by adjusting net income before interest expense taxes and dd a ebitda for certain items net income attributable to noncontrolling interests further adjusted for kml noncontrolling interests and kmi s share of certain equity investees dd a net of consolidating joint venture partners share of dd a and book taxes which are specifically identified in the footnotes to the accompanying tables adjusted ebitda is used by management and external users in conjunction with our net debt to evaluate certain leverage metrics therefore we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income adjusted earnings is net income available to common stockholders before certain items adjusted earnings is used by certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding certain items as another reflection of the company s ability to generate earnings we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted earnings is net income available to common stockholders adjusted earnings per share uses adjusted earnings and applies the same two class method used in arriving at basic earnings per common share net debt and adjusted net debt as used in this news release are non gaap financial measures that management believes are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage net debt is calculated by subtracting from debt i cash and cash equivalents ii the preferred interest in the general partner of kinder morgan energy partners l p iii debt fair value adjustments and iv the foreign exchange impact on euro denominated bonds for which we have entered into currency swaps adjusted net debt is net debt increased by i 50 of the outstanding kml preferred equity and ii the amount of cash distributed to kml restricted voting shareholders as a return of capital on january 3 2018 net of the gain realized on settlement of net investment hedges of our foreign currency risk with respect to our share of the kml return of capital on january 3 2018 we believe the most comparable measure to net debt and adjusted net debt is debt net of cash and cash equivalents as reconciled in the notes to the accompanying preliminary consolidated balance sheets page our non gaap measures described above should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of dcf segment ebda before certain items and adjusted ebitda may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these non gaap measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these non gaap measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes important information relating to forward looking statements this news release includes forward looking

stated 2018 was a challenging year with the ramp up of underground production impacted by delays in equipment deliveries a competitive labour market and by the presence of more low grade mineralization than anticipated on the northern margin of the renard 2 orebody where the initial underground production ore was sourced our operating team overcame these challenges and underground operations achieved full design capacity at the end of august our third and fourth quarter production results have demonstrated significant improvements in grade and carat recoveries as mining progressed towards the high grade center of the renard 2 kimberlite we expect these results to continue into 2019 as we continue mining renard 2 from the 290 meter level and bring into production the higher grade renard 3 orebody from underground we are pleased to provide fy2019 guidance that illustrates the robustness of the renard mine with underground operations ramped up and carat recoveries currently exceeding those predicted by our mineral resource model 2019 will also see the development of the next underground mining horizon at renard 2 as well as surface and underground exploration work to seek improvements to the current mine plan fourth quarter and fy2018 sales results two tender sales were completed during the fourth quarter in total 253 929 carats of run of mine production

gross proceeds1 of 0 83 million2 at an average price of us 14 per carat 19 per carat2 the supplemental diamond production represents recoveries of small diamonds produced between july 21st and october 5th that are in excess of that expected from the renard mineral resource the achieved pricing of us 92 per carat for run of mine goods during the quarter represents a decrease of 11 compared to the third quarter the sales for the quarter continue to reflect a challenging rough diamond market over the period while the pricing of higher quality goods and specials remains strong certain categories of lower quality goods saw weaker prices in the fourth quarter these categories include 7 brown and rejection goods for fy2018 1 04 mcarats of run of mine production were sold for gross proceeds1 of

tender and other than in exceptional circumstances is a market price taker to monitor this marketing strategy a market real price index is generated using renard sales data the real price index trend shows a steady increase 27 in the real price index from the first sale in november 2016 to june 2018 as the rough market conditions improved goods quality and size improved and tender viewing and bids increased as buyers familiarity with the renard production increased the second half of 2018 saw a significant rough market price correction resulting in a price index decrease of 13 as compared to june 2018 index this market decline is partly attributed to the further weakening indian rupee the lack of available credit available to indian diamantaires and the fluctuating seasonal effects caused by important indian and jewish holidays in the third and fourth quarters fourth quarter and fy2018 production results fourth quarter mine production was 485 616 carats recovered from the processing of 605 960 tonnes of ore at an attributable grade of 80 cpht during the quarter mill feed was derived from the renard 2 underground mine 92 the renard 65 open pit 6 and renard 3 underground development 1 processing rates in the quarter averaged 6 600 tonnes per day compared to an annual plan of 7 000 tonnes per day processing rates were affected by the oversized material coming from the underground mine and are expected to increase to nameplate capacity with the improvement of rockbreaking capacity on the primary crusher pad full fy2018 year mine production was 1 32 mcarats recovered from the processing of 2 33 mtonnes of ore at an attributable grade of 57 cpht carats recovered and processed were below the low end of the revised guidance due to lower tonnages processed in the second half of november and december resulting from technical issues with the front end of the process plant carat recoveries in 2018 were affected by delays in the ramp up of the renard 2 underground mine the processing of low grade stockpiles to curtail the shortfall in mined tonnes during the transition from open pit to underground operations and the mining of lower than expected grades at the margin of the orebody during the initial phase of the underground ramp up by the end of the third quarter the ramp up of underground production at renard 2 was completed and a steady feed was achieved from underground operations figure 1 summarizes underground ore tonnage hauled to surface recovered grade improved by 39 and 45 in the third and fourth quarters respectively carat recoveries improved by 47 in both the third and fourth quarters carat recoveries missed the bottom end of the guidance range due to the process plant performing at lower than nameplate capacity in the second half of november and in december due to the aforementioned factors fy2019 production and sales guidance for fy2019 stornoway will report total carats recovered inclusive of all size fractions when providing recovery sales and pricing guidance and results reporting will also be segmented by two size segments larger and smaller than the 7 dtc sieve size in 2019 stornoway expects to produce between 1 80 and 2 10 mcarats from the processing of 2 40 to 2 55 mtonnes of ore ore will be derived primarily from the 290 meter level of the renard 2 underground mine with additional production from the renard 65 open pit starting in the second quarter renard 3 underground ore is expected to be available to supplement renard 2 production fy2019 production guidance reflects the steady state operations at the 290 meter level of renard 2 underground mine and improvement in grades demonstrated in the fourth quarter with further operational flexibility and grade increases expected once renard 3 underground ore becomes available between 1 80 and 2 10 mcarats are expected to be sold in 8 tender sales at prices between us 80 and us 105 per carat in 2019 total carats sold and achieved pricing per tender sale will be reported inclusive of the supplemental production price guidance has been established based on historical achieved diamond size distribution and sales performance market influence is deemed to be the main variable to the pricing range any improvements in the quality and size distribution of renard s diamond production that is achieved from ongoing process improvement initiatives would be expected to be reflected in the realized pricing for the 7 dtc sieve size product segment 2019 cost guidance for fy2019 cash operating costs are estimated at 120 to 130 million representing 47 to 54 per tonne processed or 57 to 72 per carat recovered fy2019 capital expenditures are estimated at 70 to 80 million principally related to the development of the underground mine at renard 2019 exploration program during fy2019 stornoway s exploration activities will focus on the renard project and providing growth through new projects including the continuation of an underground drill program initiated in 2018 to test the depth potential of the renard 3 kimberlite below the base of the currently defined mineral reserves the objective of this drill program is the conversion of inferred mineral resources and targets for further exploration tffe to indicated mineral resource and if warranted new mineral reserves in the current statement of renard mineral reserves and resources renard 3 comprises a proven and probable mineral reserve of 1 85 million carats 2 08 million tonnes at an average grade of 79 cpht to a depth of 255 meters however the corporation believes significant opportunity exists to expand it to greater depths and in turn extend mine life a 2014 15 deep directional drilling program at the adjacent renard 2 kimberlite intersected 126 6 meters of kimberlite interpreted as belonging to renard 3 at a vertical depth of approximately 1 000m implied true width was a minimum 47 meters this represents over 500 meters of untested exploration potential in the intervening undrilled levels and a tffe of between 3 5 and 6 4 million carats comprising 3 4 to 3 8 million tonnes between 105 and 168 cpht it is also planned to further test the renard 9 kimberlite with drilling from the existing underground mine workings the economic assessment of a renard 4 renard 9 open pit which would require a water retention structure within lagopède lake is ongoing exploration at renard will also target the upside potential of kimberlite bodies not currently in the mine plan a staged multiphase program will evaluate the economic potential of the renard 7 body as an additional potential source of open pit mill feed renard 7 lies entirely on land about 700m north of the renard 65 open pit and was previously tested by seven historical drill holes for which no archived core is available renard 7 is currently interpreted as a diatreme of greater than 120m in diameter dominated by pipe filling tuffisitic kimberlite with extensive hypabyssal kimberlite on the south side renard 7 is currently classified in the march 2016 ni 43 101 technical report as a tffe of between 6 3 and 9 4 million tonnes in size with a possible diamond content from 30 to 40 cpht the corporation considers this estimated diamond content as a minimum value and one purpose of the phase 1 exploration program 3 200m in 15 holes is to produce a better estimate the potential quantity and grade of any tffe is conceptual in nature there is insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource other exploration upside at renard will be considered on an ongoing basis stornoway also maintains an active portfolio of grassroots diamond exploration projects within canada results of work from the 2018 programs of sampling geological and geophysical surveys and drilling are still being received and will be evaluated to assess whether additional work is

obinna chima the central bank of nigeria cbn is expected to be more aggressive in mopping up excess liquidity in the money market in order to manage exchange rate pressure in 2019 analysts at csl stockbrokers limited have predicted the firm stated this in a report on its 2019 macroeconomic outlook obtained by thisday it also anticipated that the federal government would borrow at the long end of the fixed income securities curve to finance its budget deficit this is expected to result in an upward shift of the entire yield curve owing to this the firm recommended that domestic investors be active in the short end of the market and their keep their exposure in treasury bills while looking to add foreign currency exposure or add assets that have a natural hedge nigeria is no longer included in key global local currency bond market indices thus there are no forced buyers of naira denominated government debt to the opportunistic fixed income international investor we believe that 2019 will offer similar rewards as 2018 although the risk adjusted returns taking into account fx volatility may be difficult to match since the naira remained relatively stable in 2018 the fundamentals of the carry trade are unlikely to disappear in our view the simplest option for benchmarked investors is to have a market weight allocation a decision to go overweight will depend on relative value considerations with other emerging market countries at the moment with the impending election global economic uncertainty and political noise in democratic republic of congo gabon sudan coming out of africa we would recommend a market weight allocation in foreign currency it stated however for investors in nigerian eurobonds it recommended that they look to move overweight if nigerian eurobonds witness a sell off as nigeria s track record of honouring its external debt obligations is good the monetary policy committee mpc of the cbn maintained a tight stance through 2018 this was in tandem with further tightening of financial conditions in the united states by the us federal reserve bank committee members felt the need to maintain the country s attractiveness to foreign investors in a bid to sustain the inflow of foreign exchange hence the monetary policy rate mpr was left unchanged at 14 per cent inflationary pressures also eased more aggressively in the first half of the year on lower food price pressures inflation however remained sticky at 11 per cent in the second half of 2018 as food price pressures intensified slowing inflation had a beneficial impact on nigeria s real interest rate as it turned positive with the slowing in inflation as at november 2018 nigeria s real interest rate stood at 2 44 per cent from 1 19 per cent recorded at the end of 2017 and was higher than a real interest rate of 0 05 per cent recorded in the us in the year ahead we are of the opinion that the risks to monetary policy and inflation are skewed to the upside with the us fed poised to raise their benchmark interest rate at least twice in 2019 we anticipate foreign capital outflows could intensify in addition the uncertainty surrounding the 2019 elections could deter further foreign investment as foreign investors take cover in higher yielding less risky investment securities in the us on the back of this the mpc might be compelled to raise the mpr in a bid to stem the outflow of foreign capital the report added the firm envisaged a steep increase in inflation to a range of between 15 20 per cent at year end 2019 even though it expected inflation to remain at current levels till after elections we expect inflation to accelerate post elections as the new government ramps up spending also we expect a further depreciation of the naira which can result in a spike in the cost of imported items and feed into consumer prices it also projected global food prices could come under upward pressure due to climate change especially as 2019 according to the un meteorological agency is likely to be an el nino year developing countries that are dependent upon agriculture and fishing are usually most affected in previous years in response to poor harvest countries banned exports of grains leading to a sharp rise in food prices this could pass through to consumer prices in the domestic economy and intensify inflation oil price sustained its recovery earlier in the year before slipping to bear market territory in the fourth quarter 2018 brent prices topped us 80 bbl for the first time since 2014 and supply disruptions in venezuela libya canada angola nigeria and iran sent panic signals to the oil market which resulted in an exaggerated run up in prices prices also rallied on the threat of hurricane florence and its potential impact on oil infrastructure in the us it added

the european union imposed its first economic sanctions against iran in three years on december 8 the sanctions which target iran s intelligence services indicate that europe is hardening its position against iran the sanctions came after the government of denmark said it believed iran facilitated the murder of two dissidents in denmark and france these sanctions froze the financial assets of two members of iran s intelligence ministry and added them to the eu s terror list the same restrictions were placed on a unit of iran s intelligence agency the eu sanctions came as europe is attempting to salvage the joint comprehensive plan of action the agreement regarding iran s nuclear program implemented three years ago today was signed by iran along with the united states britain france germany china and russia the u s withdrew from the agreement in may 2018 but europe has tried to circumvent u s sanctions and keep the deal in place with iran the agreement was designed to reward iran for limiting its nuclear development but iran s aggressive behavior has continued and the eu faces a choice continue to work with iran or begin hardening against it danish prime minister lars løkke rasmussen said it was very encouraging to hear that the eu had imposed sanctions against iran it was done in response to hostile activities and plots being planned and perpetrated in europe including denmark the eu stands united he proclaimed uch actions are unacceptable and must have consequences very encouraging that eu has just agreed on new targeted sanctions against iran in response to hostile activities and plots being planned and perpetrated in europe including denmark eu stands united such actions are unacceptable and must have consequences dkpol eudk lars løkke rasmussen larsloekke january 8 2019 when the sanctions were announced the netherlands together with the united kingdom france germany denmark and belgium met iranian authorities stated dutch foreign minister stef blok in a letter to his nation s parliament blok said the meeting conveyed serious concerns regarding iran s probable involvement in these hostile acts on eu territory it said europe expects iran to cooperate fully in removing the present concerns if such cooperation is not forthcoming further sanctions cannot be ruled out it concluded as if on cue iranian president hassan rouhani made a bold announcement on december 10 soon in the coming weeks we will send two satellites into space using our domestically made rockets the following day the french foreign ministry called on iran to immediately cease all ballistic missile related activities designed to carry nuclear weapons including any tests using ballistic missile technology the times of israel reported that iran s posturing occurs near an important anniversary iran typically displays achievements in its space program in february during the anniversary of the 1979 islamic revolution this year marks the 40th anniversary of the revolution in which radical shiite clerics overthrew the nation s monarchy as a result the west lost a friend and gained an enemy the times of israel continued the u s and its allies worry the same satellite launching technology could be used to develop long range missiles as the united states continues to withdraw from the middle east another power needs to step in to restrain iranian aggression the u s is predominantly looking to israel saudi arabia and turkey as well as a potential arab nato to fill this role the issue with america s plan is that these nations have neither the unity nor the power to restrain iran s aggression so who could replace the united states bible prophecy says it will be a united european empire led by germany daniel 11 40 says iran will push against europe this push from iran is one of the factors that causes european unification these recent sanctions by the eu are the early stages of its unification against an aggressive iranian foreign policy the danish prime minister said it himself the eu stands united against iran and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over daniel 11 40 trumpet editor in chief gerald flurry describes this clash in his booklet jerusalem in prophecy the booklet covers israel s turn to germany and the prophetic events surrounding jerusalem in the near future request your free copy here mr flurry writes israel will turn to germany and the european union for help this will set the stage for a violent clash between the eu and islamic fundamentalism the bible refers to the two forces as the king of the north led by germany and the king of the south led by iran the eu s first batch of sanctions against iran in three years is a large step toward fulfilling this prophecy iran will continue its aggressive foreign policy eventually it will push europe too far watch for the eu to increasingly harden its position against iran until it is finally pushed over the edge and forced to retaliate for

muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please standby at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chase s chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer marianne lake ms lake please go ahead marianne lake chief financial officer thank you operator good morning everyone i m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation starting on page one the firm reported fourth quarter net income of 7 1 billion and eps of 1 98 on revenue of nearly 27 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 14 market impacts aside underlying business drivers remain solid including core loan and deposit growth consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season capital market activity and with credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses for the full year 2018 the firm reported revenue of 111 5 billion and net income of 32 5 billion both clear records even adjusting for the impact of tax reform and so we re entering 2019 with good momentum across our businesses turning to page two and some more detail about our fourth quarter results revenue of 26 8 billion was up 1 1 billion or 4 year on year driven by net interest income nii was up 1 2 billion or 9 on higher rates and on loan and deposit growth non interest revenue was down slightly with lower market levels impacting asset wealth management fees and private equity losses being offset by higher card fees and auto lease growth in ccb expense of 15 7 billion was up 6 year on year the increase relates to investments we re making in technology marketing real estate and front office as well as revenue related costs including growth in auto this was partially offset by a reduction in fdic fees as we had hoped the incremental surcharge was eliminated effective at the end of the third quarter and this is a benefit of a little over 200 million for the quarter across our businesses credit trends remain favorable across both consumer and wholesale credit cost of 1 5 billion were up 240 million year on year driven by changes in reserves in consumer we built reserves of 150 million in card on loan growth in wholesale over the last several quarters we have seen net reserve releases and recoveries however this quarter we had about 200 million of credit costs the gain largely reserve builds on select c i client downgrades driven by a handful of names across multiple sectors while we are constantly looking at a granular level foreshadows these downgrades are idiosyncratic and do not reflect signs of deterioration in our portfolios the outlook for credit as we see it remains positive shifting to the full year results on page three we reported net income for the year of 32 5 billion our return on tangible common equity of 17 and eps of 9 a share net income was a record for the firm as well as to each of our businesses even excluding tax reform revenue of 111 5 billion was also a record and was up nearly 7 billion or 7 year on year 4 3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and card margin expansion being offset by lower market nii non interest revenue was up 2 5 billion or 5 driven by cib markets and growth in consumer being offset by private equity losses and the impact of spread widening on sba we ended the year with adjusted expense of 63 3 billion up 6 which brings our overhead ratio to 57 for the year even as we continued to make very significant investments across the franchise and although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth results given tax reform adjusted for this or looking on a gaap basis we delivered nearly 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the year and well over 100 basis points for the full quarter on credit the environment remains favorable throughout 2018 credit costs were 4 9 billion down 8 driven by lower net reserve builds in consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sale moving on to page four and balance sheet and capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of 12 flat to last quarter risk weighted assets decreased with loan growth more than offset by derivatives counterparty and trading rwa given a combination in seasonality market conditions and model enhancements our net payout ratio for the quarter exceeded 100 and we repurchased 5 7 billion of shares moving to consumer community banking on page five ccb generated net income of 4 billion and an roe of 30 for the fourth quarter and for the year nearly 15 billion of net income and an roe of 28 customer satisfaction remains near all time high across our businesses for the quarter core loans were up 5 year on year driven by home lending up 8 card up 6 and business banking up 5 deposits grew 3 growth continues to slow given the rising rates environment but importantly we believe we continue to outpace the industry of note this quarter we opened the first 10 branches in our expansion markets including d c boston and philadelphia and although it s clearly early reception in the market and the performance of the new branches have been strong despite volatile market client investment assets was still up 3 and we saw record net new money flows for the year card sales were up 10 debit sales up 11 and merchant processing volumes up 17 reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season and in keeping with our focus on digital everything of note active mobile customers were up 3 million users or 11 year on year revenue of 13 7 billion was up 13 consumer business banking revenue was up 18 on higher deposit nii driven by margin expansion home lending revenue was down 8 driven by lower net production revenue in a low volume highly competitive environment and of note while not a material driver of overall expense revenue headwinds here were offset by lower net production expense and card merchant services auto revenue was up 14 driven by higher card nii on both loan growth and margin expansion lower cost net acquisition costs principally sapphire reserves and higher auto lease volumes card revenue rate was 11 6 for the quarter and 11 27 for the year as expected expense of 7 1 billion was up 6 driven by investments in technology and marketing and auto lease depreciation partially offset by lower fdic charges and other expense efficiencies on credit net charge offs were 18 million as modestly higher charge offs in cards were more than offset by lower charge offs in auto and home lending charge off rates were down year on year across all portfolios economic indicators remain upbeat and given the breadth and depth of our franchise we have a pretty good parameter from everything we see the us consumer remains very healthy now turning to page six on the corporate investment bank cib reported net income of 2 billion and an roe of 10 on revenue of 7 2 billion for the fourth quarter and for the year net income of nearly 12 billion and an roe of 16 in banking it was a record year for both total fees and advisory fees we went number one in global ib fee for the 10th consecutive year gaining share across all regions fourth quarter ib revenue of 1 7 billion was up 3 we saw continued momentum in advisory with fees up 38 driven by the closing of several large transactions for the year we ranked number two in wallet gaining share equity underwriting fees were down 4 but significantly outperforming the market we ranked number one for the year and the quarter and so our leadership positions across all products globally with particular strength in ipos as well as in the technology and healthcare sectors and debt underwriting fees were down 19 versus the strong prior year and better than the market we maintained our number one rank for the year and continued to hold strong lead left positions in high yield bonds and leveraged loans moving to market total revenue was 3 2 billion down 6 reported and down 11 adjusted for the impact of tax reform and slight in of margin loan loss last year a confluence of factors throughout the quarter including trade concerns around global growth in corporate earnings fears of a more mortgage fare as well as other negative headlines caused spikes in volatility which were amplified by markets by assets and liquidity and although we saw a decent client flow rates rallied spreads widened and energy prices fell significantly all against general market condition that was anticipating a stronger end to the year as a result fixed income markets in particular were challenging with revenue down 18 adjusted weaker performance across rates credit rating and commodities was partially offset by good momentum in emerging markets equities revenue was up 2 adjusted a solid end to a record year prime continued to do well but we saw clients deleveraging over the course of the quarter and cash and derivatives are solid in a tougher environment treasury services revenue was 1 2 billion up 13 driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates but also benefiting from fee growth on higher volumes security services revenue was 1 billion up 1 underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit credit adjustments other was a loss of 243 million reflecting higher funding spreads on our derivatives finally expense of 4 7 billion was up slightly with continued investments in technology and bankers and volume related transaction costs partially offset by lower fdic charges and lower performance based compensation the comp to revenue ratio for the quarter and for the year was 28 moving to commercial banking on page seven the commercial bank reported net income of 1 billion and an roe of 20 for the fourth quarter and for the year 4 billion of net income and an roe of 20 revenue of 2 3 billion for the quarter was down 2 as the prior year included a tax reform related benefits excluding its revenue was up 3 driven by higher deposit nii gross ib revenue of 600 million was down 1 year on year but up 4 sequentially on a strong underlying flow of activity particularly in m a full year ib revenue was a record 2 5 billion up 4 on strong activity across segments in particular middle market banking which was up 8 deposit balances were up 1 sequentially as client cash positions are seasonally highest toward year end although down 7 year on year as we continue to see migration of non operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives we believe we are retaining a significant portion of these flows expense of 845 million was down 7 year on year as the prior year included 100 million of impairment on leased assets excluding this expense was up 5 driven by continued investments in the business in banker coverage as well as in technology and product initiatives loans were up 2 year on year and flat sequentially c i loans were up 1 reflecting a decline in our tax exempted portfolio given tax reform adjusting for this we would have been up 4 which is still below the industry as we focus on client selection pricing and credit discipline but keep in mind in areas where we have chosen to grow such as in our expansion markets we are growing at or above industry benchmarks cre loans were up 2 also below the industry as we have proactively slowed our growth due to where we are in cycle through continued structural and pricing discipline and targeted selection of new deals underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs of 106 million including higher loan loss reserves largely due to select client downgrades moving on to asset wealth management on page eight asset wealth management reported net income of 604 million with a pre tax margin of 23 and an roe of 26 for the fourth quarter and for the year net income was nearly 3 billion pre tax margin of 26 and an roe of 31 revenue of 3 4 billion for the quarter was down 5 year on year with the impact of current market levels driving lower investment valuations and management fees as well as to a lesser extent lower performance fees these were partially offset by strong banking results and the cumulative impact of net inflows expense of 2 6 billion was flat as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance based compensation and lower revenue driven external fees for the quarter we saw a net long term outflows of 3 billion with strength in fixed income more than offset by outflows from equity and multi asset products additionally we had net liquidity inflows of 21 billion for the tenth consecutive year we saw net long term inflows of 25 billion this year driven predominantly by multi asset and in addition saw 31 billion of net liquidity inflow this year asset from the management of 2 trillion and overall client assets at 2 7 trillion were both down 2 as the impact at market levels more than offset the benefit of net inflows deposits were flat sequentially and down 7 year on year reflecting migration into investments and we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows finally we had record loan balances up 13 with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending moving to page nine and corporate corporate reported a net loss of 577 million treasury and cio net income of 175 million was up year on year primarily driven by higher rates other corporate saw a net loss of 752 million including on a pre tax basis funding our foundation for corporate philanthropy 200 million this quarter flat year on year and including a 150 million of markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments market related the remainder is driven by tax related items totaling a little over 300 million and within this are two notable components the first is regular weighted tax reserve and second represents small differences between the effective tax rate for each of our businesses and that for the overall company as we close the year so therefore there is an offset across our businesses our full year effective tax rate was just a little over 20 in line with guidance moving to page 10 and outlook we will give you more full year outlook and sensitivity information at the investor day as always however for now i did want to provide some color and reminders about the first quarter net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates on growth but quarter over quarter will be negatively impacted by day count and we expect the first quarter nii to be relatively flat sequentially while it is too early clearly to give guidance on fee revenues it s also fair to say that this quarter markets feel calmer and more positive and capital markets pipelines are strong so if the environment remains supportive we would expect normal seasonal strength in the first quarter but i will remind you that the first quarter of 2018 included a 500 million accounting write off as well as broad strength in performance expect expense to be up mid single digits year on year obviously market dependent primarily annualization effects and finally as i said we expect credit to remain favorable across products so to close while the market in the fourth quarter were more challenging we should not leave sight of the fact that 2018 was a strong year indeed a record for revenues net income and eps both reported and adjusted for tax reform fundamental economic data remains supportive of continued growth and we re generally constructive on the outlook for 2019 we have good momentum coming into the year and the company and each of our businesses are very well positioned with that operator we can open up the line for q a questions and answers operator our first question is from erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning marianne lake chief financial officer good morning erika erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst so the way bank s stocks have performed clearly investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near term and of course credit which you addressed i m wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected if the overhead ratio of 57 that you posted in 2017 and 2018 is something that you could continue to level off to or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when we re thinking about the overhead ratio marianne lake chief financial officer yeah so i would say a couple of things the first is just to remind you that 2017 and 2018 i would look at a gaap rather than a managed basis because of the adjustments to our revenues from tax reform but that said we have while we don t set expense targets nor do we set overhead ratio targets we have given you some outlook that would suggest that we continue to believe that a combination of revenue growth and expense discipline notwithstanding the investments that we ve been making we should see our overhead ratios continue to be stable to trending down to the kind of mid 50 s or 55 ish obviously the timing of that will depend on rates and markets and everything else so we would expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage on higher nii on growth if nothing else and continued solid growth in fees clearly in any one quarter you can have pluses and minuses that can be market dependent but generally over time we would still expect those trends erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you for that and just as a follow up question the market is also thinking that the last rate hike from the fed was december and i m wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if december was indeed the last rate hike for sometime marianne lake chief financial officer so i would say first of all just to say that the question mark about whether that s a pause or a stop is it the end of a cycle we don t think so we think the outlook for growth in the economy is still strong the consumer is still strong and healthy and we re expecting to still see maybe slower but still global growth going forward having said that just as a general matter you ve seen through our earnings at risk as we have put more and more of the benefit at past rate hikes in our run rate each incremental hike from here has while still positive significantly lower sort of incremental nii drive and that the front end skew is a lower percentage so it s not nothing so clearly lower front end rates or lower long end of the curve or a flatter curve all other things would be modestly negative but against that you kind of pointed out the potential for this to lead to lower or slower reprice and so as the fed pauses it is fair to say there could be an offset from lower reprice as people digest the data and understand whether this is a pause or no we would still look at we delivered 4 3 billion of nii growth in 2018 we ll still benefit in 2019 from the annualization effects of the higher rates we ve already had as well as solid growth so while you can t expect 2019 over 2018 to be at that level it would still be strong nii growth year on year james dimon chairman and chief executive officer i would just add the why is equally if not more important than the what so if you if it is a pause because you re going to go into recession you re going to reduce rates that obviously is very different than if it s a pause the economy is strong in their wage rates you know which one you would choose marianne lake chief financial officer right and this is where the end of a cycle it s no cycle we ve ever seen before so in that scenario if term loans and fund rates are at 2 5 no 4 4 5 5 5 plus i think we ve never seen that movie before but that s not our central case and by the way the house fee the research fee would still be to see incremental hikes this year if not in the first half in the second operator our next question is from jim mitchell of buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning maybe a question on the card business there s been chatter about sort of pulling back on rewards to kind of focus more on profitability i guess how do you think about the strategy in cards right now and can that i think the revenue yield in the card business was up 7 bps to 11 57 can that go higher from here as you maybe pull back on rewards marianne lake chief financial officer yeah i would say that when we think about the product continually have in the constructs rewards is a very important part of driving engaged relationships with our customers customers are very attuned to it and are looking for value in the product value and simplicity and ease of use are the three things in the products that we deliver and so for us engaged relationships drive profitability this is a still a very profitable business and so while we ll always make adjustments to our offerings it s not the case that we are looking at meaningful pull back pull back in rewards and if you think about things like sapphire banking where we re looking to bring the impact of our products together we re continuing to offer rewards based incentives to drive engagement with our customers so we think it s a solid strategy a business that already has good returns it s fair to say that we ve seen a lot of competitive response and competitive products in the marketplace that are driving high rewards offerings too and we ve not seen that lower our ability to net acquire new accounts so we feel great about the value proposition the simplicity and the compelling products that we have jim mitchell buckingham research analyst okay so we think we about marianne lake chief financial officer that s already a very profitable business jim mitchell buckingham research analyst right and so we think about still seeing decent growth how do we think about card losses specifically this year you seem pretty optimistic on credit should we still expect some seasoning or do you think the macro trends are that positive that we hold steady how do you think about credit in cards marianne lake chief financial officer so i think the macro trends are definitely positive so they are creating tailwinds but it s also true we talked about the fact that if you go back to 2014 2015 that we had expanded our credit books we had expanded it intentionally at higher risk adjusted margins but over the course of the last couple of years as we ve experienced outperformance we ve done sort of surgical risk pullbacks and we ve amended our collection strategy all of which have led to a charge off rate for the fourth quarter in 2018 that s down slightly year on year and for the year that s at 310 basis points which is reasonably meaningfully below our expectations even as late as the end of last year so we feel great that that kind of loss trend at that 310 basis points maybe a little bit higher is something we should look forward to at least into 2019 and it will be helped by a supportive macro environment and we are seeing if you unpick all of our trends you see the phenomenon of three vintages you d see the mature vintages that continue to be stable to grinding lower in terms of delinquencies and loss rates you see the older expansion vintages that have passed their peak delinquencies and are trending to a more stable low level and then you do have obviously with new acquisitions a cohort that are still seasoning that will continue but net net we re expecting a relatively stable loss rate that leveled similar to 2018 operator our next question is from saul martinez of ubs marianne lake chief financial officer hey saul operator and i m sorry his line has disconnected our next question is from john mcdonald of bernstein marianne lake chief financial officer hey john john mcdonald bernstein analyst hi good morning good morning marianne just wondering on the markets commentary obviously super early in the quarter but you mentioned things feeling better can you just talk about seasonality there but also just what feels better so far and then also in the fourth quarter what you saw in leverage lending market how much did you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and hung deals a little bit of color there would be helpful marianne lake chief financial officer sure okay so i would say that obviously the fourth quarter was challenging and there was a lot of market moves a big sort of broad set off and at that point there were elevated concerns around trade global growth data it was causing concerns there were concerns that the fed was going to continue to be hawkish and not necessarily as responsive to some of the things the market was worried about so there were a lot of negativity we think too much negativity priced into the fourth quarter and it started to change a bit when we saw the first really strong unemployment print which reminded people that there s a very long distance between 3 growth and a contraction so yes we could see slower growth but still growth in the us and across the globe a slightly more constructive narrative on trade and that continues to broadly progress we hope and believe in a positive direction a more dovish outlook from the fed the potential for that to be pauses in rates all being relatively supportive and the fact that a lot of people were on the sidelines through the fourth quarter and investor appetite is out there for good value where it can be found so i would say just early days in the first quarter there are still obviously risks to the outlook and any of those things could go in both direction but so far things just feel a little bit more positive and that s constructive and therefore you would hope to see normal seasonal strength in january on leveraged loans look sort of just start diving into the sort of potential for that to be hung bridges it s true that there was a significant market correction where the spreads widening across high yield bonds and leveraged loans in the fourth quarter clearly stepping back while the industry leverage finance commitments are up they are materially down from before the crisis and very different so credit fundamentals look pretty good having said that and by the way we paused on a lot of deals in the fourth quarter we ve maintained sort of protection in terms of flex pricing and flex protections and as a result the vast majority of our bridge book has still got a decent cushion and that s not to say that there is no deals that have the potential for there to be net losses after fees but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter i would also say that coming back to the first quarter that actually the market could be quite constructive for fixed income into the first quarter given a more dovish fed supporting corporate margin corporate default rates is going to stay pretty low and we do have time so none of the deals that we have need to be booked to market in a hurry and the market is moving in a positive direction john mcdonald bernstein analyst got it thanks very much operator our next question is from al alevizakos of hsbc al alevizakos hsbc analyst hi thank you for taking my question i again want to focus a bit on the market s performance you pretty much mentioned like weakness across the board in credit in fx in rates which i assume like it s the case first of all i want a bit of an outlook on how you think rates will perform now that volatility has picked up and more importantly you mentioned strength in emerging markets can i ask whether that was primarily in asia or latam thank you very much marianne lake chief financial officer so it s no good ever comes of talking about how we think things are going to pan out in the first quarter other than just the general comments i ve already made which is the environment should be more constructive and we are expecting decent volatility in client activity and we ll see how that pans out with respect to emerging markets latin america was a big piece but asia too al alevizakos hsbc analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from mike mayo of wells fargo securities marianne lake chief financial officer hey mike mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi can you hear me marianne lake chief financial officer yes mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst i guess i m a little torn between the year and the quarter so i ll just ask it to jamie jamie it seems like you guys are very happy with the year with all the record revenues and earnings but the fourth quarter are you happy with the fourth quarter given expenses credit fees james dimon chairman and chief executive officer i am fully happy with it the franchise is strong we re investing in new products and services but we re not immune from the weather volumes and volatility we re not immune from market prices and assets going up or down and i like the loans up 6 and assets up sub 10 long term flow is up i like the fact that credit card spend is up 10 merchant processing is up 17 shares in almost every business market shares have gone up that s what i look at i really don t pay that much attention to being busted a little bit by the fact that volumes are low in the last three weeks of december i honestly couldn t care less and i look at more like in equities we ve gained share and we re now bumping up to number one those folks have done a great job of course cash derivatives prime broker et cetera and fixed income we ve maintained our share and we re adding products and services around the world and we don t know marianne lake chief financial officer and even gained share james dimon chairman and chief executive officer we don t know what s going to happen next quarter and i don t care marianne lake chief financial officer and we take the same position like we had strong first half of the year and we said loan may continue but it may not and one quarter doesn t make a trend and so we don t really react to that sort of micro even though it was driven by the macro the real underlying business drivers continue to be strong and even in those businesses we are holding leadership positions and gaining share and so there is two parts and things will continue to move forward in a constructive manner mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst well as a follow up let s talk about the weather so the weather is lousy at the end of the year and jamie you were just appointed to your third year as chairman of the business roundtable so in that role what are you doing to help jpmorgan and i guess the other banks in terms of china the government shutdown immigration some of these headline issues that marianne talked about having hurt the cib in the fourth quarter james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yeah so december is terrible but if you look at january you have half of it back genuine spreads and markets and stuff like that and as brt i don t do anything to benefit jpmorgan that s about public policy that s good for the growth of american total and it s very specifically stayed away from doing about banks there but the brt does take up trade and we are supportive of the fact there are serious issues with china we d like to see the trade deal gets done it looks to us like they re marching along at least to this march 1st deadline date that they ll have enough will be done to kind of get an extension and hopefully complete the deal we would like to see immigration reform so proper border security allowing people who have advanced degrees to stay here having the doctors stay here having more merit based immigration and having some path to citizenship that is the brt position we want more innovation we d like to reduce regulations at the local and federal level to stop small business formation so if you look at the brt there are 10 verticals around it and we try to do things that are good for the growth of america and bad policy can slow down the growth of america as i pointed out over and over it takes 12 years to get the permits to build the bridge i mean and it took us 8 years to put a man in the moon it is time that we reform ourselves and not blame anybody else for our own lack of that we don t have kids getting out of school of educations whether you get jobs that our innovation slow down the government r d spending is down i always think it s look at yourself looking to do better and there s plenty this country could do better to help growth over the long run it s not about helping it next quarter operator our next question is from glenn schorr of evercore isi glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi there marianne lake chief financial officer good morning glenn glenn schorr evercore isi analyst good morning a follow up on john s question earlier on leveraged lending on slide 24 you see the balance on loans held for sale go from like 6 5 billion to 15 billion i heard your comments on marks i m assuming that that is just a disruption and you go back toward your normal level that s in the pipes and progress but i just want to make sure that i m not making that wrong assumption marianne lake chief financial officer yes we re not expecting anything to be elevated glenn schorr evercore isi analyst okay cool and james dimon chairman and chief executive officer that number goes up or down all the time just based on episodic what is cleared out of the books there s nothing on a number that we re afraid of glenn schorr evercore isi analyst understood curious on the credit on the couple of marks in c i i m just curious on how much of that is internal versus external rating agency and i guess it s a feel for the underlying fundamentals so how do you know we should treat that as idiosyncratic as you call marianne lake chief financial officer yes so it s internal and it s like five names four sectors we know the specifics it is situationally specific remember just to give you some context for those who can drive the dollar value regular way in any quarter given the size of our portfolio we might downgrade and upgrade hundreds of individual names based upon the circumstances and so when we say that we re looking at this and saying that things are idiosyncratic it s not just looking at the five situations that drive the biggest dollar value it s also looking at the hundreds of downgrades and the hundreds of upgrades and seeing if there s any trends or net worrying signs there and honestly not now and so if anything marginally we had more upgrades but it s just there s nothing to see right now in our portfolios and we re looking glenn schorr evercore isi analyst okay appreciate that james dimon chairman and chief executive officer we look for reasons to put up reserves marianne lake chief financial officer yes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer not to take them down marianne lake chief financial officer only the paranoids survive we are more paranoid than you are james dimon chairman and chief executive officer right glenn schorr evercore isi analyst last one obviously markets all went down in the fourth quarter and we had some freeze ups if you will in high yield first time in like 10 years but i m curious how you all think the markets functioned in general in other words things went down spreads widened out there was lots of fear but it felt like the plumbing was working but i don t want to put words in your mouth marianne lake chief financial officer yes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and half the people weren t even here the last two weeks in december marianne lake chief financial officer that s right the plumbing was working we didn t see any sort of algo or technology issues we didn t see any volumes that can be coped with while i said that there was a little bit of a lack of debt for the markets and liquidity that s typically the case when you have one way trends in a market and a lot of people similarly situated so i would say that relatively functioned well but challenging operator our next question is from andrew lim of societe generale andrew lim societe generale analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions i just had a follow on question from the vesting high yield marks question i mean you seem to getting impression that there weren t really much in the way of marks is that because you got very strong hedging strategies in place and that the decline in ficc revenues mainly was due to the lower volumes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer there were no marks marianne lake chief financial officer there were no marks in our bridge book right now we have for the vast majority we have good cushion and we expect to be able to clearing price through the market and for anything that s even borderline it s completely not material james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and i think some of the field did have a few marks marianne lake chief financial officer yeah james dimon chairman and chief executive officer if you look at what happened to flex pricing like mid december when things were at their worst yeah some of these things were very close to the end of their flex pricing and that means they re very close to having some kind of mark of course since then the spreads have kind of come back 40 marianne lake chief financial officer right andrew lim societe generale analyst interesting thanks and then my follow up question is that also mean the capital markets had a tough time but your wholesale lending the grids accelerated quite nicely and do you get the impression that corporates had a general shift to seek borrowing from banks such as yourselves because they were shut out of the market marianne lake chief financial officer i mean there was an uptick at the end of the year you saw in the industry data we saw it in our spot data for us in fact it was largely driven by one investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter but there was a little bit of an uptick a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing on the balance sheet but nothing i would call james dimon chairman and chief executive officer inaudible marianne lake chief financial officer no nothing that i would call unusual or a trend we didn t have to take down things that would have otherwise not cleared the market operator our next question is from matt o connor of deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning i want to circle back on the expense flexibility i think in your base case you re pretty clear that you re targeting positive operating leverage and moving down the efficiency ratio to the mid 50 s but what is some of the expense flexibility and where would it come from if the revenue is light i think in 2018 you accelerated some of the technology spend given tax reform you ve been opening branches some of that stuff obviously can t be pulled back but you always talk about some areas of flexibility so maybe what are those and if you could kind of size or help quantify some the flexibility you have that would be helpful thank you marianne lake chief financial officer yeah so i would say first of all that you saw that from 2013 through 2016 we had a pretty structural expense reduction program associated with simplifying our businesses so in terms of the low hanging fruit and things like that we would say largely that s been harvested we are always looking to generate core operating efficiencies so that we can absorb growth and when we are investing in technology and data one of the reasons to do it customer satisfaction product innovation aside is for efficiency so we are seeing some that come through we ll continue to drive that down james dimon chairman and chief executive officer but the efficiencies and the investments are all in the number that marianne gives and when she says up 5 marianne lake chief financial officer that s right james dimon chairman and chief executive officer roughly mid digits for marianne lake chief financial officer and so the way i would the way i would say it is that we continue to drive for expense discipline but as long as you feel as we do that the decision criteria that we use to determine the investments we re making which we think are strategically important for the long term growth of the company and the profitability of the company supporting our clients if those are good decisions for long term growth while we could obviously make changes we would not look to do that and so marketing expense for example is one area where you would say there s pretty sizable and immediate flexibility nevertheless when we invest in marketing we re driving new accounts and engage customers that drive long term growth so we invested through the cycle we think it sort of differentiates our long term performance and we d like to continue to do that 2019 over 2018 you wouldn t expect to see necessarily the same clip ups that you saw last year we did accelerate investments in 2018 and so more of the growth will be revenue related but still decent investments and the opportunity is still good to do that matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay that s helpful and then just on a sidebar here on the reserve bill as we think about credit quality are we just in the period now where we should assume kind of some reserve build consistent with loan growth each quarter or was this just a quarter where you had a couple of the lumpiness that really drove it i guess what i m getting at is last quarter you had james dimon chairman and chief executive officer we had pretty good model for it marianne lake chief financial officer sorry keep going matt o connor deutsche bank analyst i guess what i m getting at is like it s are we at the point where like just a couple lumpy loans is going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just maybe this is a bit unusual still marianne lake chief financial officer so first of all i just want to sort of point out that in the cards space we hopefully continue to grow healthy mid single digits there s the seasonality to cards balances and losses so you typically see reserve builds in the second half of the year that s what we saw this year and actually a little bit lower year on year than last and in the wholesale space you re going to see some things will be a bit lumpier and episodic given the nature of the loans that we have i wouldn t necessarily say that we expect to see a trend of some significant reserves but we ve been flatted by recoveries and releases over the course of the last couple of years partly or in large part at least earlier releasing reserves we took on energy when the energy went through the downturn and so we ll have some downgrades we might have some releases i would net net think that as we grow we would build but not disproportionately and we re arguably at the best point in the cycle so jamie mentioned earlier to the degree that we have the flexibility we re making sure that we re reserved accordingly operator our next question comes from saul martinez of ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hey good morning sorry about earlier i think i need to figure out how to use my phone multiple speakers no comment there lot of talk on macroeconomics and the policy backdrop in volatile markets but as you mentioned earlier you guys are in a pretty unique position in that you have pretty consistent dialog with a lot of economic agents whether it s corporates governments institutional investors and whatnot but just a sense of what your clients are saying what are they concerned about is there any concern on your part that some of these issues have sort of a self fulfilling effect in that it does end up leading to actions that precipitate a downturn or a recession marianne lake chief financial officer so i mean i think that we would look to the sort of macroeconomic data which is still generally supportive and say things should be good but for sure the sentiment is not immune to external factors and so manufacturing data has been a little weaker i would say capex is sluggish on let s say is around global growth government shutdown trades are not particularly helpful uncertainly is not good for anyone so there s no doubt that as things continue if there s an level of anxiety and uncertainty if it s not constructive for confidence and confidence to get stronger or less strong market so no i wouldn t say i think it s clear and present danger but i think we should be extremely careful because sentiment particularly consumer sentiment will be incredibly important and right now it s to good right sentiment in consumer and we just got back some sentiment from a whole bunch of our middle market companies that well neither are at their highs are still very high saul martinez ubs analyst right okay that s helpful if i could just ask about loan growth and just a more broad question about your ability to continue to outpace the industry and i suspect we ll get more color at investor day but just want to get your sense of the sustainability of growth and you mentioned on the commercial side maybe you scaled back a little bit maybe we re late cycle but where do you feel like you can continue to outgrow the industry where do you feel like maybe it s time to scale back on risk a little bit marianne lake chief financial officer okay so i mean i think it s incredibly nuance question because in general home lending has a challenging market backdrop for us it s tale of two cities we re doing quite well and gaining a bit of share in the kind of retail purchase market and we re holding sort of pricing discipline in correspond and losing share there so there s a challenging market backdrop card was doing well at and it s a factor of all things we talked about our investments in digital product rewards all of the above so we would like to believe that we ll continue to hold our own there auto is extremely competitive we play in prime super prime space and we re seeing competition from people who have different economic drivers in our sight credit unions and captives and so we re willing to lose share to maintain returns there you bifurcate c i we re growing in line or better than the industry in our expansion markets where we ve been making the investments where we ve been adding specialized industry coverage and we d like to see that because of the investments we re making but in mature markets where again being pretty prudent i wouldn t call it tightening but being very selective commercial real estate particularly construction lending yeah we are tightening we are being very cautious about new deals and selective about them so it isn t the case anymore that we would say we re seeking to grow although we ever were loan growth is an outcome of a number of factors may need a strategic dialog with our companies but also the environment we re in and it s extremely nuanced and in many of our businesses we re going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point james dimon chairman and chief executive officer so let me just reemphasize that we tell our management that we have no problem seeing loan books shrink marianne lake chief financial officer correct james dimon chairman and chief executive officer we are not going to be sitting here ever in our lives and say you got to grow the loan book you got to show loan growth remember warren buffett used to say in insurance business sometimes during the little business you re better off with the sales force go play golf in order to make new loans we are not going to be stupid and the other thing you have to always keep in mind is not the loan it s the relationship if you look at in total and so when it comes to middle market or all these other things there are reasons that we stay in a business knowing there s going to be a cycle and we re not going to be children when there s a cycle we know the losses are going to go up operator our next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning marianne lake chief financial officer good morning betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst are we playing golf all day yet or is that still far away james dimon chairman and chief executive officer credit is pristine mortgage credit is pristine middle market is pristine underwriting standard has been pretty good other than a few little pockets that marianne has mentioned but we saw people stretching in auto we saw some stretching and we re not in the subprime credit card but a little bit or few stretching that in leveraged lending we re not worried about our loan book i think you can have a logical conversation with kind of the non bank loan book but that s not our concern and it is what it is at the time so marianne lake chief financial officer and i think where businesses are notably a little bit less relationship driven i think about kind of low loan new relationships commercial term lending real estate banking mortgage to a lesser degree auto we are seeing we are losing or ceding share where it makes sense to do it james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and competition there we ve done this before is back everywhere and that s a good thing for america that means the pricing is a little tough and that you have to compete betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst yes so we re still off the golf course all right that s good just wanted to understand a little bit more on the expense side i know it was a even with the weather you guys put out a 14 rotce which is obviously best in class the question is on the expenses there s flexibility there but yet i know you ve got it to up single digits in 1q 2019 based on the prior conversation it seems like 1q might be an aberration of mid single digits or should i take that that s kind of the run rate you re expecting for the full year so why would 1q be a little bit different i guess is really the question marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i wouldn t fully annualize the first quarter but think about we ve added bankers and advisors across our businesses so you re going to get some annualization impact particularly first quarter into first quarter we had added more and more as the year progressed similarly something like auto lease where we grew our auto lease business revenues and expenses strongly in 2018 and that will be in our run rate in the first quarter so front office auto lease some of the technology investments we ve been making the annualization of those will be more pronounced first quarter to first quarter than fourth quarter to fourth quarter because many of them were in our run rate in the fourth quarter and then outside of that there s a bit more in real estate as we sort of execute on our head office strategy and then marketing foundation completion those things there are going to be timing so the first quarter will be higher i wouldn t annualize it we are going to see likely growth year over year much more because of revenue growth than because of investments at both year on year not the same level as the last year and we ll obviously give you a lot more detail and insights and thoughts on ranges and everything at investor day clearly operator our next question is from brian kleinhanzl of kbw brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst hi good morning marianne lake chief financial officer good morning brian brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst hi marianne just a quick question on the balance sheet i m sorry if you gave this already but can you kind of walk through the idea of lowering down the deposit with banks and kind of moving into repo what you saw in the quarter and then kind of is that just something that was temporary that s expected to reverse in the first quarter thanks marianne lake chief financial officer yeah so i mean it s fair to say that money market rates traded above ioer throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter and so through the quarter and that year end we were able to take advantage of the market opportunity to move out of cash into cash alternatives thinking of reverse repos and short duration assets and so for us it was yield enhancing opportunity to redeploy cash and a mix change rather than adding duration and that continues to be the case into the first quarter it contributed to our nim expansion in the fourth quarter we continue to have a bit of that mix shift in the first quarter and it s a market opportunity brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay and then a separate question i know it s not a big revenue driver anymore but within the mortgage banking you had a negative gain on sale in the quarter if you can just give us some color there what drove a negative gain on sale marianne lake chief financial officer yeah so in the quarter as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet we actually did a sale of conforming loans to the gses of about 5 billion the impact of that was to have a loss on the sale of the portfolio given that they ve been originated at lower rates so as rates are higher the fair value of the loans is lower against that if you were to look at the rest of the p l you ll see a benefit in net interest income because the interest rate risk of that has been transferred to the treasury department so it s geography it s is a loss on the sale of a portfolio against which there s funding breakage in nii just so that you know when we our mortgage loan with rwa at 50 versus a security at 20 with better liquidity value we did reinvest some of those proceeds in mortgage backed securities in treasury so we ll earn that back over time net to the company operator our next question is from steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hey good morning so wanted to start with just a bigger picture question on credit and the impact of normalization certainly the near term guidance sounds quite encouraging jamie you did make a comment recently at an investor conference talking about how the banking industry is over earning on credit not particularly a controversial remark but in the past you guided to a medium term loss rate blended basis of roughly 65 bps that does contemplate continued loan losses in commercial and just given that we re late cycle i was hoping you can maybe speak to your expectation for what a normalized credit loss rate is for jpmorgan given your current mix and where that might differ from your medium term loss guidance james dimon chairman and chief executive officer so we re not talking quarter over quarter we re just talking in general trends steven chubak wolfe research analyst i m talking bigger picture james dimon chairman and chief executive officer right so marianne has shown year to year what are consider normalized losses and for years we ve been doing better than that in credit card middle market large corporate mortgage has come back down to a very low number and at one point it is going to go up so i m not we re telling you what s going to happen next quarter right now it looks like it s kind of steady state but at one point we will not be surprised to see it go up i don t know if it could be second quarter or third quarter or fourth quarter and i don t know if we re late cycle we don t exactly know where we re in the cycle and so we just won t be surprised to see it go up in the number we look at it by product we don t look at it in a total as it can actually the number may vary against the total marianne lake chief financial officer no no and i think i hate to say this because i know that you don t want to wait a few weeks but we ll have a more complete conversation about kind of range of plausible outcomes on credit at investor day but when we gave our medium term simulation we said listen we did a 17 return on tangible common equity in 2019 and our medium term guidance is for 17 we ve under earned against our guidance in other parts of the cycle maybe we will over earn against it but nii and refi flags are higher and credit is benign and at some point we would expect those things to normalize but we would continue to see solid growth in all of our drivers so we don t know when it will be and actually we don t see anything that things i know you said is it second third or fourth quarter there s no indication that it s in any of those quarters but we ll have a more comprehensive discussion at investor day about range of plausible outcomes steven chubak wolfe research analyst all right looking forward to that and just one follow up for me on the ib outlook marianne i was hoping i could unpack just some of your comments around the how the ib backlog you cited that as being quite strong but just looking at the individual businesses for m a ecm dcm especially given some of the economic pressures outside the us what informs your outlook across each of those marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i would say that first of all we did see given the conditions in the fourth quarter a number of deals that got pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter particularly in ecm and dcm in m a it was a little bit more balanced for every deal that got pushed or stopped there there were more that came to take its place but as a result now as we go into the first quarter pipelines across the board are elevated relative to last year are pretty strong and at the end of the day we talked about earlier confidence is still high companies are still motivated to drive growth and so the environment should be constructive for continued m a technology healthcare the biotech innovation technology innovation momentum in ecm that we ve been benefiting from and the ipo pipeline should continue market dependent and notwithstanding december actually a sort of lower outlook for rates in the us should broadly be a tailwind for fixed income in the first quarter in the first half so the second half of the year i think is going to be determined by how things shape up over the next several months but looking into january again if the market remains generally constructive we should see tailwinds across the businesses james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and i think the intentional backlogs generally you want them high because that s good but they re all like an accordion too they come and go so that s not a forecast for the future that you d definitely get those revenues then you get delayed particularly things like ipos that you ve already seen and the other thing i d just want to point out is a shout out to the folks in the investment bank our market share went up in europe asia latin america and the united states last year that s what we really look at when we look at the business marianne lake chief financial officer 60 basis points full year approx james dimon chairman and chief executive officer 60 basis points full year and first time ever it went up in all four major markets operator our next question is from marty mosby of vining sparks marianne lake chief financial officer hi marty marty mosby vining sparks analyst good morning jamie i m glad that you mentioned that we don t know the red in of the cycle because that s kind of just assumed because of the lapse of time but not really the economic factors and then the other piece of this is when you look at losses they tend to be good until they go into recession then they re bad there s no just kind of normalization so the question about a normal rate of loss that we really have two dichotomous answers we have a good answer which is when we re expanding and the economy is stable and we have a bad answer one our recession it s kind of one or the other just wanted to see what you thought about that james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yeah you re exactly right at one point you re going to over earn and one point you re going to under earn and we try to when we look at the business we kind of try to price through that so we try to earn fair returns through the cycle and i totally agree with you we know it s going to they re going to change at one point and we try to do a better job underwriting too by the way we re not we do work hard and make sure we out underwrite other people as best we can marty mosby vining sparks analyst what s then the limits of volatility when you go into that bad period which is what you want to do you underwrite make sure you re defending against that cycle james dimon chairman and chief executive officer exactly and the other one you have is the reserves you put them up you take them down so our total reserves what 14 billion marianne lake chief financial officer yes 14 billion and a bit james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yeah but at one point they were 30 billion so we went from in the great recession we went from 7 billion to 30 billion back to 14 billion and i call it income paper marianne lake chief financial officer right james dimon chairman and chief executive officer it doesn t mean anything it s just right so when you go into that recession your losses go up any reserves have to go up and we re completely aware of that marianne lake chief financial officer although i think we could say for obvious reasons that we wouldn t expect any near term recession if there is one to look anything like it did before and even if it did given the credit quality of the portfolios performance will be not only absolutely better but we think strong on a relative basis james dimon chairman and chief executive officer so other than if you look at the consumer that 13 trillion that s outstanding other than student which is fundamentally own by the government the mortgage stuff that s been written is prime so it s back to 10 trillion but it s much better than what it was in 2007 and i think credit card i forgot the exact numbers it s much more prime than it was in 2007 i think orders are about the same but order actually outperformed in the marianne lake chief financial officer there s more prime james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yes more prime and outperformed in the great recession i think people in general has done a better job underwriting middle market and leverage stuff than it did last time so i think you don t need if you start a recession soon going into it their credit portfolio is much stronger than last time marty mosby vining sparks analyst and the follow up question to that is we talked about auto and some of those other places where you saw some of that deterioration what our models showing is that actually the discipline and the reaction time to that deterioration is much quicker than when we saw the one to four family cycle in the last time where you saw deterioration but growth just kept going we ve had so many banks jump in and say look we ve already pulled back on auto lending or we pulled back on multi family there s already been places where you ve seen that discipline so that discipline in itself puts a governor on economic growth which is why we re having less growth or slower growth but yet it also creates a like you said a stronger portfolio for that eventual downturn james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and i agree with you the lack of discipline we see is in student and a little bit in small commercial real estate operator our next question is from i m sorry marianne lake chief financial officer no keep going operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning marianne marianne lake chief financial officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst can you guys there s been a lot of talk about leveraged loans and how this time around everything seems to be underwritten better are there any tangible statistics that you can share with us or maybe on investor day you might to show us that yes the leveraged loan portfolio for you guys in particular is much healthier than maybe 2006 2007 and then second on this leveraged loan issue outside the banking industry what are some of the indirect hits that you and maybe some of your peers may experience none from the direct hit of a leveraged loan but for some of the craziness that s going on outside the banking industry james dimon chairman and chief executive officer so can i just give the big picture i think 1 7 trillion of leveraged loans ok so term a is about half of that these are very rough numbers ok most of which were banks and obviously safer than term b a big chunk over i think 60 or 70 of the term b is with non banks and so if you look at the banking system if you look at the leveraged lending rich book in 2007 it was over 400 billion today it s a number like 80 billion in 2007 there were commitments in no flex almost everyone has plenty of flex now so when you look at covenants there is kind of covenants but there s flex and there is a whole bunch of other stuff in there so it is far far far sounded today even these clos you look to underwrite the two clos they are far better underwritten with more equity more sub debt more mezzanine stuff like that and now go to the shadow banks they do things slightly differently a lot of those folks are they re quite bright they kind of know what they re doing someone s going to get hurt there and the issue there in the next recession isn t going to be what the loss and remember most of the major banks don t fund a lot of that we aren t taking huge indirect exposure to that by funding some of the non banks and i think the issue there is for the marketplace is going to be when you have a real recession the lender will not be there so lot of these borrowers will be stranded and so that and that s not that s an opportunity or a risk or something like that but it s not i wouldn t put it in the systemic category gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst and do you think that james dimon chairman and chief executive officer by the way again if you go back to 2007 it emerged in 2007 there was 1 trillion of bad mortgages that were kind of all over the place the clos sibs there are no sibs the clos are much smaller the leveraged lending book is a much smaller book capital liquidity is much higher so it is nothing like 2007 you will have a recession it just won t be like you had last time affecting the banking system it will affect the banking system we are little bit canaries in the coal mine we are not immune to what goes on in the economy but it won t be anything like you saw last time for most of the larger banks gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst no i would agree with that and do you think janet yellen and other federal reserve officials comments about leveraged lending is more directed to the exposure outside of the banking industry than inside the banking industry james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yes i do marianne lake chief financial officer yes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and again i don t think they were saying it s huge and systemic they re saying it s something they should keep an eye on and i think that the regulatory do keep an eye on that gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst right and then just a pivot on a deposit question obviously non interest bearing deposits are tough to keep as rates are going higher can you guys give us some color on the non interest bearing deposits there was obviously a small decline what parts of the business you re seeing that and the fed s unwind of its balance sheet how much of an impact do you think that might be having on the non interest bearing deposits marianne lake chief financial officer so the migration into product from non interest to interest bearing is predominantly or largely exclusively a wholesale thing at this point there is not enough rate benefit in the interest bearing savings to drive into product migration definitely some growth outlook in cds given pricing but it s wholesale right now and it s mainly rate related and not balance sheet related in terms of the fed unwind james dimon chairman and chief executive officer can i just make a comment about interest rates and the balance sheet of fed so the interest rate is one thing but the balance sheet of fed obviously is causing changes in the flow of funds it s causing changes in the banks now have options other than reserves at the central bank because the two year and three year bond yields for corporate government bond is much higher some people are preferring to own that because they think they d be paid better than corporate risk so changing the whole bunch of fund flows which concerns people but i d say it s part and process of normalization marianne lake chief financial officer yes operator our next question is from ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin analyst hi thanks marianne lake chief financial officer hi ken ken usdin analyst hi good morning there were couple of fed or regulatory documents out in late december one is codifying the three year burning of stated cecl impacts and then another one where they are pushing out till 2022 on their own implementation of cecl accounting in the supervisory stress test i was just wondering just any takeaways you had from reading that and any hopes you might have for just as we get toward some finalization of which way cecl goes and how it looks aspirations around that and how that interacts with ccar and such james dimon chairman and chief executive officer before marianne answers that question i just want to do a shout out to jefferies because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year ken usdin analyst i ll pass that along jamie marianne lake chief financial officer and following that it s hard to follow i would say that we ve been pretty clear about the fact that our biggest concern around cecl was like properly understanding not just for us but regulators to properly understand the implications for capital not only in benign but in stressed scenarios and what the implications of the outcome that it could have on the willingness of people to extend credit particularly as cycles age and with the outlook for volatilities to increase so having a transition is obviously helpful you should imagine that we would likely avail ourselves of that opportunity that is what it is for me the question that needs to be clarified is if we are to include the impact of cecl in company run stress test but the federal reserve is not going to include it in the stress test we need to kind of understand the insight between those two things particularly if that might coincide with a turn in the cycle in actual fact so i think we re looking for continued clarity from the regulators about what exactly that means if we re embedding these assumptions into our stress tests and our results sooner than they are how do we think about the implications of that on our distribution plans and capital outlooks and importantly if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans i do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics conceptually don t change that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential volatility and we should worry about that james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and it ll be a big number for like credit card so if you put on 3 now on when you build the loan book by 100 the number would be 6 some number in the future will be much higher so i do think particularly smaller banks will react fairly dramatically on how they run their loan books to do that marianne lake chief financial officer so our view is that more on that just needs to be done in the industry about what this looks like i hope that what was meant by we should include it in company run stress test is for us to collectively learn and for the regulators to have the time to respond to that but remember 2022 considering all the discussion we ve had on this call about the cycle how long the cycle is when there s a turn in the cycle i mean we could actually face a stress before that and so it s great that they are waiting a bit but it might all be a bit of an academic point depending on what happens actually ken usdin analyst yeah that s a fair point and jamie you ve also said in the past that you guys lend on accounting right don t lend on accounting and lend on economic right but there s this kind of challenge to that that marianne just mentioned about the unintended consequences and so it would be interesting to see that if there is in fact a point where banks don t lean in as you just mentioned marianne marianne lake chief financial officer yes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer they will change marianne lake chief financial officer yes and we have the luxury or the flexibility of being able to say that we can continue to lend based upon the underlying economics but someone who has a differently situated balance sheet and return profile may not be able to do that ken usdin analyst okay thanks for the color operator our next question is from mike mayo of wells fargo securities marianne lake chief financial officer hey mike mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi a follow up on the net interest margin two sides to the question one is commercial loan pricing i guess it s been kind of brutal you ve had the bdcs private equity firms loan funds all competing has there been any let up with some of the dislocation the capital markets late in the year and the other side retail deposit betas marianne you thought they would get a lot worse i don t think it s been as bad as you thought what was your retail deposit beta and what do you still expect james dimon chairman and chief executive officer before marianne answers that can i just go back to the cyclical stuff one of the issue it s not just cecl a lot of things that have been built and since the crisis were really good but there was more pro cyclicality built into it and so you re going to see the next downturn that we have a far more pro cyclical accounting liquidity and rules capital rules and stuff like that which we don t know the full effect of that but if i was a regulator i d be very cautious about constantly building pro cyclicality into the system and i gave you the example is our loan loss is going from 7 billion to 30 billion or whatever they went to back to 14 billion it will affect how people respond to in the downturns and it will cause people to pullback much quicker than maybe in the past in total marianne lake chief financial officer okay so just on your question so corporate loan spreads i would say we did see sort of pretty brutal grinding down in corporate loan spreads but over the last actually couple of quarters we saw them find a bit of an equilibrium and stabilize at levels so while i would say it s still true to say that there is a lot of competition at least in the space in which we re operating we re seeing spreads at relatively stable levels in the corporate space and honestly i don t remember saying that i thought we would see an acceleration that was dramatic in retail betas in the short term i mean obviously at some point when we have this level of rates and the spread between market rates and rates paid get to a certain level and if normalization continues we would expect to see reprice lags sort of catch up but we have not seen that yet outside of cds in retail space right now mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and the way you calculate it what was your retail deposit beta this quarter and how does that compare to the past marianne lake chief financial officer so in checking and savings and lead savings it s nothing in cds it s something but around to a very small number mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you marianne lake chief financial officer thanks mike operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you just a quick follow up marianne have your investment bankers on the front lines passed on any concerns about the government shutdown there s been reports that the sec is not open and is that slowing down the investment banking business and your thoughts on that please marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i would say that we ve been we benefited from the fact that year end and into the early part of january and holiday season have a light calendar typically in january for ipos in particular but for sure if we don t see the ability to get approvals from sec on ipos and to a lesser extent some of the m a deals that need approvals from government agencies it will be problematic in the ability to see those activity levels play out and fees be realized so it s one of many things that would behoove us to end this sooner rather than later gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you operator and we have no further questions at this time marianne lake chief financial officer thanks very much james dimon chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect duration

gold price â us 700 or us 7000 does either of the above preclude the other in other words if we expect gold to reach 7000 00 per ounce and we are correct does that mean that we can t reasonably expect gold to go as low as 700 00 per ounce conversely if we are predicting or expecting gold to decline from its current level and even breach 1000 00 per ounce on the downside can 7000 00 per ounce or anything even remotely close to that number be a reasonable possibility i do not think either one precludes the other in fact i think it is entirely possible that we can see bothfigures and not necessarily spread over an inordinately long period of time either here is a possible scenario that would allow that to happen as the u s dollar strengthens the u s dollar price of gold declines this is clearly evident in the price action of gold since its high point of approximately 1900 00 per ounce in 2011 there is no way to know for certain how long relative dollar strength will last and it is reasonable that if ongoing dollar strength takes gold below 1000 it might come to rest somewhere between 860 890 00 per ounce in january 1980 gold peaked at 850 00 revisiting that number is plausible and well within the realm of realistic speculation and yes there are technical indicators that point to a gold price of as low as 700 00 per ounce but what type of economic conditions might accompany the reality of that price projection i think the consensus is that an ongoing stronger u s dollar would be accompanied by a stronger economy that makes sense but what if it doesn t happen that way what if the economy continues to struggle even more remember we have been subjected to huge creations of money and credit over the past ten years and that is on top of similar policies and actions by the federal reserve over the past one hundred years is our economy strong enough to weather the effects of attempted normalization or is it too late i believe that is exactly the question that is plaguing the federal reserve and it is the reason they have struggled with firm decisions on altering their accommodative expansion of money and credit this is most obvious in their lack of decisiveness regarding interest rates regardless of that whatever the federal reserve has done or hasn t done since 2011 when gold peaked at 1900 00 has been interpreted positively generally at least as far as the u s dollar is concerned otherwise we would not have seen the u s dollar price of gold drop over that time to its current level of 1290 00 and previously as low as 1040 00 in january 2016 but even with a relatively stronger u s dollar the economy still struggles and there are indications that it could get worse regardless of the fed s attempts to avoid it deflationis a very real possibility an implosion of the debt pyramid and a destruction of credit would cause a settling of price levels for everything stocks real estate commodities etc worldwide at anywhere from 50 90 percent less than currently it would translate to a very strong u s dollar and a much lower gold price those who hold u s dollars would find that their purchasing power had increased the u s dollar would actually buy more not less but the supply of u s dollars would be significantly less this is true deflation and it is the exact opposite of inflation of course this would be accompanied by a complete collapse of any and all forms of real estate commodities stocks etc pretty much any asset or item denominated in u s dollars the most severe effects would be felt in the credit markets and in any assets whose value is primarily determined and supported by the supply of credit available things would be much worse than what we experienced in 2008 12 the biggest difference would be that the changes would result in depression like conditions on a scale most of us can t even imagine and the depression would likely last for years maybe even decades imagine if you will that groceries gasoline and house rent cost half of what you now spend whatever cash you have or is available to you would buy twice as much and you would have money available for other things deflation in and of itself is not a bad thing a u s dollar that is worth more in purchasing power should be welcomed unfortunately depressed economic conditions would make life for most of us nearly unbearable you might not have a job or you might live in an area which experiences social unrest also there could be disruptions in transportation and the orderly supply and delivery of various goods and services as far as gold is concerned its price will be determined by seeking a level that is inversely in accordance with whatever level of strength the dollar achieves for example if purchasing power of the u s dollar increases by one hundred percent generally speaking then we can expect a fifty percent decrease in the u s dollar price of gold as bad as those things may sound it will likely be a lot worse what will make things worse will be intervention and interference by government government hates deflation and not because of any perceived negative effects on its citizens it is because the government loses control over the system which supports its own ability to function inflation fractional reserve banking enhanced supplies of money and credit are intentional creations of governments and central banks they are used to fund and reinforce the operation and grandiose plans of government and the big banks hence we can expect government to respond decisively to any series of events which resemble those previously described their intentions would be clear all efforts would be focused similarly to those employed in our previous brush with financial disaster just a few years ago but don t expect similar results the events themselves are a logical end result of a financial system which has overdosed on artificial stimulation not entirely dissimilar to an addict s reactions to long term drug abuse since each successive financial fix requires a stronger dose to maintain the expected results and since the ongoing systemic damage is cumulative we reach a point that demands recognition of the problem and then painful steps to resolve it successfully the government and the federal reserve will not ever acknowledge the harm their policies have caused and they will never take the steps necessary to right a sinking ship and even if the attempt were made the shock to the system would likely be too much to bear at this point at best they might be able to postpone the inevitable rejection what government definitely will do is anything and everything that they think will minimize end and reverse events which would bring about deflation which is exactly what they did ten years ago and they barely managed to avert complete disaster at least temporarily but we don t really know how much systemic damage was done i e exactly how much money and credit were created how big is the fed s balance sheet and how badly inflated are the numbers how under capitalized are the banks i assure you it is much worse than anything we have been told similar events today would bring about the price collapse in various markets which we discussed as well as usher in deflation and a full scale depression all of this would be resisted on every front by government and the federal reserve they would literally launch an all out financial war and maybe another real war too by opening the money and credit spigots full force in a futile attempt to reverse the credit implosion and negative price action of critical assets their efforts and intentions would be counter productive and harmful the depression in our scenario would last much longer than needed and the price declines which are necessary to correct the excesses of the past and cleanse the system would be countered every step of the way by regulations and programs of dubious value the efforts of government would actually worsen things and prolong the suffering it is more likely though that the results would be much worse than anything we could expect even a relatively strong u s dollar would be unable to survive the onslaught in their efforts to save the patient the government would kill the dollar we would likely find ourselves awash in money and credit created without regard to potential damage all in order to stave off the inevitable results while ignoring their curing effects on a very ill economy as the reality of the new depression sets in the failure of initial efforts by government will be seen more clearly they will then step up their efforts damage to the u s dollar would be reflected in the u s dollar price of gold which could easily go from 700 00 to 7000 00 in months maybe weeks by that time the u s dollar price of gold will be meaningless what will be more important is owning physical gold the turmoil social unrest and economic upheaval that accompanies a complete repudiation of the u s dollar will probably set us back fifty years or more on a lifestyle basis so if you are one of those who thinks that 7000 00 gold is right around the corner better plan accordingly and don t discount entirely the possibility of deflation and 700 00 gold before your wish comes true kelsey williams is the author of two books inflation what it is what it isn t and who s responsible for it

operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chaseâ s fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chaseâ s chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer marianne lake ms lake please go ahead marianne lake thank you operator good morning everyone iâ m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website please refer to disclaimer at the back of the presentation starting on page 1 the firm reported fourth quarter net income of 7 1 billion and eps of 1 98 on revenue of nearly 27 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 14 market impacts aside underlying business drivers remain solid increasing core loans and deposit growth consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season faster market activity and the credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses for the full year 2018 the firm reported revenue of 111 5 billion and net income was 32 5 billion both clear records even adjusting for the impacts of tax reform and so weâ re entering 2019 with good momentum across all businesses turning to page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results revenue of 26 8 billion was up 1 1 billion or 4 year on year driven by net interest income nii was up 1 2 billion or 9 on higher rates and on loan and deposit growth non interest revenue was down slightly with lower market levels impacting asset wealth management fees and private equity losses being offset by higher card fees and auto lease growth in ccb expense of 15 7 billion was up 6 year on year the increase is related to investments weâ re making in technology marketing real estate and front office as well as revenue related costs including growth in auto this was partially offset by a reduction in fdic fees as we had hoped the incremental surcharge was eliminated effective the end of the third quarter and this is a benefit of a little over 200 million for the quarter across our businesses credit trends remained favorable across both consumer and wholesale credit costs of 1 5 billion were up 240 million year on year driven by changes in reserves in consumer we built reserves of 150 million in cards on loan growth in wholesale over the last several quarters we have seen net reserve releases and recoveries however this quarter we had about 200 million of credit costs again largely reserve builds on select c i client downgrades driven by a handful of names across multiple sectors while we are constantly looking at the granular level these downgrades are idiosyncratic and do not reflect signs of deterioration in our portfolio the outlook for credit as we see it remains positive shifting for the full year results on page 3 we have posted net income for the year of 32 5 billion a return on tangible common equity of 17 and eps of 9 a share net income was a record for the firm as well as to each of our businesses even exceeding tax reform revenue of 111 5 billion is also record and was up nearly 7 billion or 7 year on year 4 3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and card margin expansion being offset by lower markets nii non interest revenues was up 2 5 billion or 5 driven by cib markets and growth in consumer being offset by private equity losses and the impact of spread widening on fca at the end of the year the adjusted expense was 63 3 billion up 6 which brings our overhead ratio to 57 for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise and although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth in cards given tax reform adjusted for this or looking on a gaap basis we delivered nearly 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the year and well over 100 basis points for the fourth quarter on credit the environment remained favorable throughout 2018 credit costs were 4 9 billion down 8 driven by lower net reserve build in consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sales moving on to page 4 on balance sheet and capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of 12 flat to last quarter risk weighted assets decreased with loan growth more than offset by derivatives counterparty and trading rwa given a combination of seasonality market conditions and all the enhancements our net payout ratio for the quarter exceeded 100 and we repurchased 5 7 billion of shares moving to consumer community banking on page 5 ccb generated net income of 4 billion and an roe of 30 for the fourth quarter and for the year nearly 15 billion of net income and an roe of 28 customer satisfaction remains near all time highs across our businesses for the quarter core loans were up 5 year on year driven by home lending up 8 card up 6 and business banking up 5 deposit grew 3 growth continues to slow given the rising rate environment but importantly we believe we continue to outpace the industry of note this quarter we opened the first 10 branches in our expansion markets increasing d c boston and philadelphia and although itâ s clearly early perception in the market and the performance of the new branches has been strong despite volatile markets client investment assets were still up 3 and we saw record net new money flows for the year card sales were up 10 debit sales up 11 and merchant processing volume up 17 reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season and keeping with our focus on digital everything of note active mobile customers were up 3 million users or 11 year on year revenues of 13 7 billion was up 13 in consumer business banking revenue was up 18 on higher deposit nii driven by margin expansion home lending revenue was down 8 driven by lower net production revenues in a low volume highly competitive environment and of note while not a material driver of overall expense revenue headwinds here were offset by lower net production expense and cards merchant services auto revenue was up 14 driven by higher card nii although loan growth and margin expansion lower card net acquisition costs principally sapphire reserve and higher auto lease volumes card revenue rate was 11 6 for the quarter and 11 27 for the year as expected expense of 7 1 billion was up 6 driven by investments in technology and marketing and auto lease appreciation partly offset by lower fdic charges and other expense efficiencies on credit net charge offs was down 18 million as modestly higher charge offs in card were more than offset by lower charge offs in auto and home lending charge off rates were down year on year across all portfolios economic indicators remain upbeat and given the breadth and depth of our franchise we have a pretty good barometer from everything we see the us consumer remains very healthy now turning to page 6 on the corporate investment bank cib reported net income of 3 billion and roe of 10 on revenue of 7 2 billion for the fourth quarter and for the year net income was nearly 12 billion and an roe of 16 in banking it was a record year for both total fees and advisory fees we ranked number one in global ib fees for the 10th consecutive year gaining share across all regions fourth quarter ib revenue of 1 7 billion was up 3 we feel continued momentum in advisory with fees up 38 driven by the closing of several large transactions for the year we ranked number 2 in wallet gaining share equity underwriting fees were down 4 but significantly outperforming the market we ranked number 1 for the year and the quarter and saw our leadership positions across all products globally with particular strength in ipos as well as in the technology and healthcare sectors and debt underwriting fees were down 19 versus a strong prior year and sectors in the market we maintained our number one brand rank for the year and continued to hold strongly lead left positions in high yield bonds and leveraged loans moving to markets total revenue was 3 2 billion down 6 reported and down 11 adjusted for the impact of tax reform and steinhoff margin loan loss last year a confluence of factors throughout the quarter including trade concerns around global growth and corporate earnings fears of lower mortgage fares as well as other negative headlines caused spikes in volatility which were amplified by markets that assets and liquidity and although we saw decent client flow rates rallied spreads widened and energy prices fell significantly all against general market conviction that was anticipating a stronger end to the year as a result fixed income markets in particular were challenging with revenue down 18 adjusted weaker performance across rates credit trading and commodities was partially offset by good momentum in emerging markets equities revenue was up 2 adjusted a solid end to a record year client continued to do well but we saw client deleveraging over the course of the quarter and cash derivatives were solid in a tougher environment treasury services revenue was 1 2 billion up 13 driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates but also benefitting from fee growth on higher volumes security services revenue was a 1 billion up 1 underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit credit adjustments and other was a loss of 243 million reflecting higher funding spreads on all derivatives finally expense of 4 7 billion was up slightly with continued investments in technology and bankers and volume related transaction costs partly offset by lower fdic charges and lower performance based compensation the comps and revenue ratio for the quarter and for the year was 28 moving to commercial banking on page seven the commercial bank reported net income of 1 billion and an roe of 20 for the fourth quarter and for the year 4 billion of net income and a roe of 20 revenue of 2 3 billion for the quarter was down 2 and for prior year included a tax reform related benefit excluding this revenue was up 3 driven by higher deposit nii gross ib revenue of 600 million was down 1 year on year but up 4 sequentially on a strong underlying flow of activity particularly in m a full year ib revenue was a record 2 5 billion up 4 on strong activity across segments in particular middle market banking which was up 8 deposit balances were up 1 sequentially as client cash positions are seasonally highest toward year end although down 7 year on year as we continue to see migration of non operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives we believe we are retaining a significant portion of these flows expense of 845 million was down 7 year on year as the prior year included 100 million of impairment on leased assets excluding this expense was up 5 driven by continued investment in the business in banker coverage as well as in technology and product initiatives loans were up 2 year on year and flat sequentially c i loans were up 1 reflecting a decline in our tax exempt portfolio given tax reform adjusting for this we would have been up 4 which is still below the industry as we focus on client selection pricing and credit discipline but keep in mind in areas where we have chosen to grow such as in our expansion markets we are growing at or about industry benchmarks cre loans were up 2 also below the industry as we proactively slowed our growth due to where we are in the cycle through continued structural and pricing discipline and targeted selections as we build underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs at a 106 million including higher loan loss reserves largely due to select client downgrades moving on to assets and wealth management on page eight assets and wealth management reported net income of 604 million with a pretax margin of 23 and an roe of 26 for the fourth quarter and for the year net income was nearly 3 billion pretax margin at 26 and an roe of 31 revenue of 3 4 billion for the quarter was down 5 year on year with the impact of current market levels driving lower investment valuations and management fees as well as to a lesser extent lower performance fees these were partially offset by strong banking results and the cumulative impact of net inflows expense of 2 6 billion was flat as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance based compensation and lower revenue driven external fees for the quarter we saw net long term outflows of 3 billion with strength in fixed income more than offset by outflows from equity and multi asset products additionally we had net liquidity inflows of 21 billion for the 10th consecutive year we saw net long term inflows of 25 billion this year driven predominantly by multi assets and in addition saw 31 billion of net liquidity inflows this year assets under management of 2 trillion and overall client assets of 2 7 trillion were both down 2 as the impact of market levels more than offset the benefit of net inflows deposits were flat sequentially and down 7 year on year reflecting migration into investments and we continue to capture the vast majority inflows finally we had record loan balances up 13 with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending moving to page nine and corporate corporate reported a net loss of 577 million treasury and cio net income of a 175 million was up year on year primarily driven by higher rates other corporate saw a net loss of 752 million including on a pre tax basis funding our foundation for corporate philanthropy 200 million this quarter flat year on year and including a 150 million of markdown on certain legacy private equity investments market related remainder is driven by tax related items totaling a little over a 300 million and within this are two notable components the first is regularly tax reserve and second represents small differences between the effective tax rate for each for our businesses and that for the overall company as we close the year so therefore there is an offset across our businesses our full year effective tax rate was just a little over 20 in line with guidance moving to page 10 and outlook we will give you more full year outlook and sensitivity information at investor day as always however for now i would like to provide some color and reminders about the first quarter net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates and growth but quarter over quarter will be negatively impacted by day count and we expect the first quarter nii to be relatively flat sequentially while itâ s too early clearly to give guidance on fee revenues itâ s also fair to say that this quarter market is still calmer and more positive and capital market pipelines are strong so if the environment remains positive we would expect normal seasonal strength in the first quarter but i will remind you that the first quarter of 2018 included a 500 million accounting write off as well as broad strength in performance expect expense to be up mid single digits year on year obviously market dependent primarily annualization effects and finally as i said we expect credit to remain favorable across products so to close while the markets in the fourth quarter were more challenging we should not lose sight to the fact that 2018 was a strong year indeed a record for revenues net income and eps both reported and adjusted for tax reform fundamental economic data remains supportive of continued growth and weâ re generally constructive on the outlook for 2019 we have good momentum coming into the year and the company and each of our businesses are very well positioned with that operator we can open up the line for q a question and answer session operator our first question is from erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian hi good morning so the way bank stocks have performed clearly investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near term and of course credit which you addressed iâ m wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected if the overhead ratio of 57 that you posted in â 17 and â 18 is something that you could continue to level off to or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when weâ re thinking about the overhead ratio marianne lake yes so i would say a couple of things the first is just to remind you that â 17 and â 18 i would look at a gaap rather than a managed basis because of the adjustments to our revenues from tax reform but that said we have while we donâ t set expense target nor do we set overhead ratio targets we have given you some outlook that would suggest that we continue to believe that combination of revenue growth and expense discipline notwithstanding the investments that weâ ve been making we should see our overhead ratio continue to be stable to trending down to the kind of mid 50 so 55ish obviously the timing of that will depend on rates and markets and everything else so we would expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage on higher nii on growth if nothing else and continued solid growth in fees clearly in any one quarter you can have pluses and minuses that can be market dependent but generally over time we would still expect those trends erika najarian and just as a follow up question the market is also thinking that the last rate hike from the fed was december and i m wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if december was indeed the last rate hike for some time marianne lake so i would say first of all just to say that the question mark about whether thatâ s a pause or a stop is it the end of the cycle we donâ t think so we think the outlook for growth and the economy is still strong the consumer is still strong and healthy and we are expecting to still see maybe slower but still global growth going forward having said that just as a general matter youâ ve seen through our earnings at risk that as we have put more and more of the benefit of past rate cut rate hikes in our run rate each incremental hike from here has whilst deposited significantly lower sort of incremental nii drive and that the front end sku is a lower percentage so itâ s nothing but clearly lower front end rates or lower long end of the curve or a flatter curve all other things would be net modestly negative but against that you pointed out the potential for this to lead to lower or slower reprice so as the fed pauses it is fair to say there could be an offset from lower reprice as people digest the data and understand whether this is a pause or not we would still look we delivered 4 3 billion of nii growth in 2018 we will still benefit in 2019 from the annualization effects of the higher rates weâ ve already had as well as solid growth so while you kind of expect 2019 over â 18 to be at that level it would still be strong nii growth year on year jamie dimon i would say why itâ s equally if not more important than it was so if it is a pause because you are going to recession youâ re going to do trades that obviously is very different than itâ s to pause economy is strong and they raise rates you know which one you would choose marianne lake and if this were the end of the cycle itâ s not a cycle weâ ve ever seen before so in that scenario if terminal fed run rates 2 5 4 5 5 plus i think weâ ve never seen that movie before but thatâ s not our central case and by the way the house did a research view we would still need to see incremental hike this year if not in the first half in the second operator our next question is from jim mitchell of buckingham research jim mitchell maybe a question on the card business there has been chatter about sort of pulling back on rewards to kind of focus more on profitability i guess how do you think about the strategy in cards right now and can that i think the revenue yield in the card business was up 7 bps to 11 57 can that go higher from here as you maybe pull back on rewards marianne lake yes i would say that when we think about the product continuum we have in the contrast rewards is a very important part of driving engaged relationships with our customers customers are very attuned to it and are looking for value in the product value and simplicity and ease of use are the three things in the products that we deliver so for us engage relationships drive profitability this is still a very profitable business so while we will always make adjustments to our offerings itâ s not the case that we are looking at a meaningful pullback in rewards and if you think about think for example our banking where we are looking to bring the impact of our products together we are continuing to offer rewards based incentive to drive engagement with our customers so we think itâ s a solid strategy of business that already has good returns itâ s fair to say that weâ ve seen a lot of competitive response and competitive products in the marketplace that are driving high rewards offerings too and weâ ve not seen that lower our ability to acquire new accounts so we feel great about the value proposition the simplicity and the compelling products that we have so itâ s very profitable business jim mitchell so we think about still seeing decent growth how do we think about card losses specifically this year you seem pretty optimistic on credit should we still expect some seasoning or do you think the macro trends are that positive that we hold steady how do you think about credit and cards marianne lake so i think the macro trends are definitely positive so we are creating tailwinds but it s also true we talked about the fact that if you go back to 2014 2015 that we had expanded our credit box we d expanded it intentionally at higher risk adjusted margins but over the course of the last couple of years as we ve experienced that performance we ve done sort of surgical risk pullbacks and we amended our collection strategy all of which have led to a charge off rate for the fourth quarter in â 18 that s down slightly year on year and for the year that s a 310 basis points which is reasonably meaningfully below our expectations even as late as the end of last year so we feel great that that kind of loss trends at that 310 maybe a little bit higher is something we should look forward to at least into 2019 and it will be helped by a supportive macro environment and we are seeing if you unpick all of our trends you see the phenomenon of three vintages you see the mature vintages that continue to be stable to grinding lower in terms of delinquencies and loss rates you see the older expansion vintages that have crossed peak delinquencies and are trending to a more stable level and then you do have obviously with new acquisitions cohorts that are still seasoning that will continue but net net we re expecting relatively stable loss rate that levels similar to 2018 operator our next question is from saul martinez of ubs i m sorry his line has disconnected our next question is from john mcdonald of bernstein john mcdonald hi good morning just wondering on the markets commentary obviously super early in the quarter but you mentioned things feeling better can you just talk about seasonality there but also just what feels better so far and then also in the fourth quarter what you saw in leverage lending market how much do you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and the hung deals little bit of color there would be helpful marianne lake sure okay so i would say that obviously the fourth quarter was challenging and there was a lot of market moves a big sort of broad set of and at that point there were elevated concerns around trade global growth data was causing concerns there were concerns that the fed was going to continue to be hawkish and not necessarily as responsive to some of the things the market was worried about so there was a lot of negativity we think too much negativity priced into the fourth quarter and it started to change a bit when we saw the first really strong unemployment trend which reminded people that there s a very long distance between 3 growth and a contraction so yes we could see slower growth but still growth in the u s and across the globe a slightly more constructive narrative on trade and that continues to broadly progress we hope and believe in a positive direction and a more dovish outlook from the fed that potential for that to be pauses in rates or being relatively supportive and the fact that a lot of people were on the sidelines through the fourth quarter and investor appetite is out there for good value where it can be found so i would say just early days in the first quarter there are still obviously risks to the outlook and any of those things could go the worse direction but so far things are just a little bit more positive and that s constructive and therefore you would hope to see normal seasonal strength in january on leveraged loans sort of just diving into the sort of potential for that to be hung bridges itâ s true that there was a significant market correction with spreads widening across high yield bonds and leveraged loans in the fourth quarter clearly stepping back while the industry leveraged finance commitments are they are materially down from before the crisis and very different so credit fundamentals look pretty good having said that and by the way we passed on a lot of deals in the fourth quarter we ve maintained sort of our sort of protection in terms of flex pricing and flex protection and as a result the more maturity of our bridge that has still got decent cushion thatâ s not to say that there s no deal that has the potential for there to be net losses after fee but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter i would also say that coming back to the first quarter that actually the market could be quite constructive to fixed income into the third quarter given a more dovish fed supporting corporate margin corporate default rates are going to stay pretty low and we do have time so none of the deals that we have need to be brought to market in a hurry and the market is moving in a positive direction operator our next question is from al alevizakos of hsbc al alevizakos thank you for taking my question i again want to focus a bit on the market s performance you pretty much mentioned like weakness across the board in credit in fx in rates which i assume like is the case first of all i want bit of an outlook on how you think rates will perform now that volatility has picked up and more importantly you mentioned strength in emerging markets can i ask whether that was primarily in asia or latam thank you very much marianne lake so itâ s no good of a conserve talking about how we think things are going to pan out in time in the first quarter other than just the general comment iâ ve already made which is the environment should be more constructive and weâ re expecting decent volatility in client activity and we will see how that pans out with respect to emerging markets latin america was a big piece but asia too operator our next question comes from mike mayo of wells fargo securities mike mayo i guess iâ m a little torn between the year and the quarter so iâ ll just ask it to jamie jamie it seems like you guys are very happy with the year with all the record revenues and earnings but the fourth quarter are you happy with the fourth quarter given expenses credit fees jamie dimon iâ m fully happy with it the franchise is strong weâ re investing in new products and services but weâ re not immune from the weather and volumes and volatility weâ re not immune from market prices and assets going up and down and i like the loans up 6 assets up long term flows up i like the fact that credit card spend is up 10 merchant processing is up 17 shares in almost every business market shares have gone up thatâ s what i look at i really donâ t pay that much attention to speed bump it a little bit but the fact that volumes were low in the last three weeks of december i honestly could care less i look at more in equities weâ ve gained share and weâ re now bumping up to number one those folks have done a great job of course cash derivatives prime broker et cetera and fixed income has maintained our share and weâ re adding products and services around the world and we donâ t know itâ s going to happen next quarter and i donâ t care marianne lake and we take the same division we had strong first half of the year and we said long may it continue but it may not and one quarter doesnâ t make a trend and so we donâ t really react to the sort of micro even though it was driven by the macro the really underlying business drivers continue to be strong and even in those businesses we are holding leadership positions and gaining share and so this too will cost and things will continue to move forward in a constructive manner mike mayo as a follow up letâ s talk about the weather so the weather is lousy at the end of the year and jamie you were just appointed to your third year as chairman of the business roundtable so in that role what are you doing to help jpmorgan and i guess the other banks in terms of china the government shutdown immigration some of these headline issues that marianne talked about having hurt the cib in the fourth quarter jamie dimon yes so december is terrible but if you look at january you have half of it back generally in spreads and markets and stuff like that and as brt i donâ t do anything that benefits jpmorgan thatâ s about public policy thatâ s good for growth of america in total and so very specifically stayed away from doing about banks there but the brt does take up trade and we are supportive of the fact there are serious issues with china we would like to see the trade deal get done it looks like to us they are marching along at least to this march 1st deadline date that enough will be done to kind of get an extension and hopefully complete the deal we would like to see immigration reform so proper border security allowing people who have advance degrees to stay here having the doctors stay here having more merit based immigration and having some path to citizenship that is the brt position we want more innovation weâ d like to reduce regulations at the local and federal level that stop small business formation so if you look at the brt there are 10 verticals around that and we try to do things that are good for the growth of america and bad policy can slow down the growth of america i have pointed out over and over it takes 12 years to get the permits to build the bridge and it took eight years to put a man on the moon it is time that we reform ourselves and not blame anybody else for own lack of that we don t have kids getting at school of educations where they get jobs the innovation has slowdown the government r d spending is down i always think what can you do better and there is plenty in this country to do better to help growth over the long run and itâ s not about helping it next quarter operator our next question is from glenn schorr of evercore isi glenn schorr follow up on johnâ s question earlier on leverage lending on slide 24 you see the balance on loans held for sale go from like 6 5 billion to 15 billion i heard your comments on marks i m assuming that that is just disruption and you go back towards your normal level that s in the pipes and progress but i just want to make sure that i m not making that wrong assumption marianne lake yes we are not expecting anything to be elevated glenn schorr okay cool andâ jamie dimon that number goes up or down over time just based on episodic what is cleared out of the books there is nothing in our number we are afraid of glenn schorr understood curious on the credit on the couple of marks and c i i m just curious on how much of that is internal versus external rating agency and i guess it s a feel for the underlying fundamentals how do you know we should treat that as idiosyncratic as you go marianne lake so itâ s internal and itâ s like lines sectors we know the specifics it is situationally specific remember just to give you some context while those can drive the dollar value regular way in any quarter given the size of our portfolio we might downgrade and upgrade hundreds of individual names based upon the circumstances so when we say that we are looking at it and saying that things are idiosyncratic itâ s not just looking at the five situations that drive the biggest sort of value itâ s also looking at the hundreds of downgrades and hundreds of upgrades and seeing if there is any trends or net worrying concern and honestly not now then so if anything marginally we had more upgrades but itâ s just there is nothing to see right now in our portfolios and we are looking jamie dimon we look for reasons to put up reserves not to take them down marianne lake we are more paranoid than you are glenn schorr last one obviously markets all went down in the fourth quarter and we had some freeze ups if you will in high yield first time in like 10 years but i m curious how you all think the markets functioned in general in other words things went down spreads widened out there was lots of fear but it felt like the plumbing was working but i don t want to put words in your mouth jamie dimon and half the people werenâ t even here the last two weeks in december marianne lake thatâ s right the plumbing was working we didnâ t see any sort of technology issues we didnâ t see any volumes that can be coped with while i said that there was a lack of debt to markets and liquidity thatâ s typically the case when you have one way trends in the market and there are people similarly situated so i would say they relatively functioned well but challenging operator our next question is from andrew lim of sociã tã gã nã rale andrew lim i just had a follow on question from the vesting high yield mark s question you seem to be getting the impression that there werenâ t really much in the way of marks is that because youâ ve got very strong hedging strategies in place and that the decline in ficc revenues mainly was due to lower volumes jamie dimon there were no marks marianne lake there were no marks in our business right now we have for the vast majority we have good cushion and we expect to be able to a clear and price through market and anything that even border line itâ s completely not material jamie dimon i think there are few marks if you look at what happened to flex pricing like mid december when things were the worst yes some of these things were very close to the end of their flex pricing and that means they are very close to have you some kind of mark of course since then the spreads have come come back 40 marianne lake right andrew lim interesting thanks and then my follow up question is that obviously that capital markets had a tough time but you are wholesale lending the growth has accelerated quite nicely do you get the impression that corporates had a general shift to seek borrowing from banks such as yourselves because they were shut out of the market marianne lake i mean there was an uptick at the end of the year you saw it in the industry data we saw it in our spot data for us in fact it was largely driven by one investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter but there was a little bit of an uptick and a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing and the balance sheet but nothing i would call nothing that i would call unusual or a trend we didn t have to take down things that would otherwise not play in the market operator the next question is from matt o connor of deutsche bank matt o connor good morning i wanted to circle back on the expense flexibility i think in your base case you re pretty clear that you re targeting positive operating leverage and moving down the efficiency ratio to the mid 50s but what is some of the expense flexibility and where would it come from if the revenues slide i think in 2018 you accelerated some technology spend given tax reform you ve been opening branches some of that stuff obviously can t be pulled back but you always talk about some areas of flexibility so maybe what are those and if you could kind of size or help quantify some of the flexibility you have that d be helpful marianne lake yes so i would say first of all that you saw that from 2013 through â 16 we had a pretty structural expense reduction program associated with simplifying our businesses so in terms of the low hanging fruit and things like that we would say largely thatâ s been harvested we are always looking to generate core operating efficiencies so that we can absorb growth and when we are investing in technology and data one of the reasons to do it customer satisfaction product innovation aside is efficiency so we are seeing some of that come through weâ ll continue to drive that down jamie dimon but the efficiencies and the investments are all in the number that marianne gives you when she says up 5 marianne lake thatâ s right the way i would say it is that we continue to drive for expense discipline but as long as you feel as we do that the decision criteria that we use to determine the investments we re making which we think are strategically important for long term growth of the company and the profitability of the company supporting clients if those are good decisions for long term growth while we could obviously make changes we would not look to do that and so marketing expense for example is one area where you would say there s pretty sizeable and immediate flexibility nevertheless when we invest in marketing we re driving new accounts and engage customers that drive long term growth so we invested through the cycle we think it sort of differentiates our long term performance and we d like to continue to do that 2019 over â 18 you wouldn t expect to see necessarily the same clip up that you saw last year we did accelerate investments in â 18 and so more of the growth will be revenue related but still decent investments as the opportunity is still good to do that matt o connor okay that s helpful and then just on a sidebar here on the reserve build as we think about credit quality are we just in the period now where we should assume kind of some reserve build consistent with loan growth each quarter or was this just a quarter where you had a couple of the lumpiness that really drove i guess what i m getting at is last quarter you had modeled i guess what i m getting at is like it s are we at the point where like just a couple of lumpy loans was going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just maybe it s a bit unusual still marianne lake so first of all i d sort of point out that in the cost base we hopefully continue to grow healthy mid single digits the seasonality there is seasonality to card balances and losses and so you typically see reserve builds in the second half of the year that s what we saw this year and actually a little bit lower year on year than last and in the wholesale space you re going to see some things will be a bit lumpier and episodic given the nature of the loans that we have i wouldn t necessarily say that we expect to see a trend from significant reserves but we ve been factored by recoveries and releases over the course of the last couple of years partly or in large part at least earlier releasing reserves we took on energy when the energy went through the downturn so we ll have some downgrades we might have some releases i would net net think that as we grow we would build but not this proportionally weâ re obviously at a best point in the cycle so jamie mentioned it earlier to the degree that we have the flexibility weâ re making sure that we are reserved accordingly operator our next question comes from saul martinez of ubs saul martinez a lot of talk on macroeconomics and the policy backdrop in volatile markets but as you mentioned earlier you guys are in a pretty unique position and that you have pretty consistent dialogue with a lot of economic agents whether itâ s corporate governments institutional investors and whatnot but just a sense of what your clients are saying what are they concerned about is there any concern on your part that some of these issues have sort of a self fulfilling effect and that it does end up leading to actions that precipitate a downturn or recession marianne lake i think that we would look to the sort of macroeconomic data which is still generally supportive and so i think should be good but for sure investments is not immune to external factors and so manufacturing data has been a little weaker i would say capex is sluggish on sales around global growth government shutdown and trade are not particularly help uncertainty is not good to anyone so there is no doubt that as things continue if there is a level of anxiety and uncertainty itâ s just not constructive for confidence and confidence that gets stronger or less strong market i wouldnâ t say that i think itâ s clear and present but i think we should be extremely careful because sentiment particularly consumer sentiment will be incredible important and right now itâ s good sentiment in consumer and we just got back some sentiment from i hope small middle market companies that while not at their high but still very high saul martinez that s helpful if i could just ask about loan growth and is it just a more broad question about your ability to continue to outpace the industry and i suspect weâ ll get more color at investor day but just want to get your sense of the sustainability of growth and you mentioned on the commercial side you maybe scale back a little bit maybe weâ re late cycle but where do you feel like you can continue to outgrow the industry where do you feel like maybe it s time to scale back on risk a little bit marianne lake so i think itâ s and incredibly nuance question because in general home lending has a challenging market backdrop for us itâ s tale of two cities weâ re doing quite well and gaining a bit of share in the kind of retail purchase market and weâ re holding the pricing discipline corresponding and leading share there so there is a challenging market backdrop card was doing well at and itâ s sort factor of all things we talked about investments in digital product rewards all of the above so we would like to believe that we will continue to hold our own there and auto is extremely competitive we play in prime super prime space and weâ re seeing competition from people who have different economic drivers in our sight credit unions and captives and so weâ re willing to lose share to maintain returns there you bifurcate c i weâ re growing in line weâ re best in the industry in our expansion markets where weâ ve been making the investments where weâ ve been adding specialized industry coverage and we would like to see that because of the investments weâ re making but in mature markets weâ re again being pretty prudent i wonâ t call it tightening but being very selective and commercial real estate particularly construction lending yes weâ re tightening weâ re being very cautious about new deals and selective about it so it isnâ t the case anymore that we would say weâ re seeking to grow although we ever were loan growth is an outcome of number of factors mainly the strategic dialog with our companies but also the environment weâ re in and itâ s extremely nuance and in many of our businesses weâ re going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point jamie dimon so maybe iâ ll just reemphasize that we tell our management that we have no problem seeing loans books shrink weâ re not going to be sitting here ever in our live to say and you got to grow the loan book you got to show loan growth remember warren buffett used to say in the insurance business and sometime itâ s true in the loan business youâ re better off the sales force go play golf than there to make new loans weâ re not going to be stupid and the other thing you have to always keep in mind itâ s not the loan itâ s the relationships you look at in total so when it comes to middle market or all these other things are reasons that we stay in a business knowing there is going to be a cycle and we are not going to be children on this cycle we know that losses are going to go up operator our next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy graseck hi good morning are we playing golf all day yet or is that still far away jamie dimon credit is pristine mortgage credit is pristine middle market is pristine underwriting has been pretty good other than a few little pockets that marianne has mentioned we saw people stretching in auto we saw some stretching in and weâ re not going to self fund credit card but little bit people are stretching in that and leverage lending weâ re not worried about all loan book i think you can have a logical conversation but there is kind of a nonbank loan book but thatâ s not our concern and it is what it is at the timeâ marianne lake and i think where businesses are notably a little bit less relationship driven so think about kind of no new relationship commercial term lending real estate banking mortgage to a lesser degree also we are seeing we are losing or seeking share where it makes sense to do it jamie dimon yes and competition we mentioned this before itâ s back everywhere and thatâ s a good thing for america and that means the pricing is little tough and you have compete betsy graseck yes so we are still off the golf course all right thatâ s good just wanted to understand a little bit more on the expense side i know it was even with the weather you guys put out a 14 rotce which is obviously best in class the question is on the expenses there is flexibility there but yet i know youâ ve guided to up single digits in 1q â 19 based on the prior conversation it seems like 1q might be in aberration of mid single digits or should i take that thatâ s kind of the run rate you are expecting for the full year so why would 1q be a little bit different i guess is really the question marianne lake yes so i wouldnâ t fully annualize the first quarter but think about weâ ve added bankers and advisors across our businesses so youâ re going to get annualization impact particularly first quarter to first quarter we have added more and more as the year progressed similarly something like auto lease where we grew our auto lease business revenues and expenses strongly in 2018 and that will be in our run rate in the first quarter so front office auto lease some of the technology investments we have making the annualization of those will be more pronounced first quarter to first quarter than fourth quarter to fourth quarter because many of them are in our run rate in the fourth quarter and then outside of that there is a bit more in real estate as we sort of execute on our head office strategy and then marketing foundation completion those things there is going to be timing so the first quarter will be higher i wouldnâ t annualize it we are going to see nicely growth year over year much more because of revenue growth than the corporate investment of both year on year not the same level as last year and we will obviously give you a lot more detail and insights and thoughts on ranges and everything at investor day clearly operator our next question is from brian kleinhanzl of kbw brian kleinhanzl just a quick question on the balance sheet iâ m if you gave us already but just walk through the idea of lowering down the deposit with banks and kind of moving into repo what you saw in the quarter and then kind of is that just something that was temporary thatâ s expected to reverse in the first quarter marianne lake yes so itâ s fair to say that money market rates traded above ioer throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter and so through the quarter and that year end we will able to take advantage of the market opportunity to move out of cash into cash alternatives things reverse repos and short duration assets and so for us it was yield enhancing opportunity to redeploy cash and a mix change rather than adding duration and that continues to be the case into the first quarter it contributed to our nim expansion in fourth quarter we continue to have a bit of that mix shift in the first quarter and itâ s a market opportunity brian kleinhanzl and then a separate question on i know itâ s not a big revenue driver anymore but within mortgage banking you had a negative gain on sale in the quarter could you just give us some color there what drove a negative gain on sale marianne lake yes so in the quarter and as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet we actually did a sale of conforming loans to gse of about 5 billion and the impact of that was perhaps a loss on the sale of the portfolio given that they d been originated at lower rates so as rates are higher the fair value of the loan is lower against that if you were to look at the rest of the p l you ll see a benefit in net interest income because the interest rate risk of that has been transferred to the treasury department so it s geography it s a loss on the sale of a portfolio against which there s funding breakage in nii just so that you know when we our mortgage loan with rwa 50 versus security at 20 with better liquidity value we did reinvest some of those proceeds in mortgage backed securities in treasury so we will earn that back over time net for the company operator our next question is from steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak hey good morning so i wanted to start with just a bigger picture question on credit and the impact of normalization certainly the near term guidance sounds quite encouraging jamie you did make a comment recently at investor conference talking about how the banking industry is over earning on credit not particularly a controversial remark but in the past you guided to a medium term loss rate blended basis of roughly 65 bps that does contemplate continued loan losses in commercial and just given that weâ re late cycle i was hoping you can maybe speak to your expectation for what a normalized credit loss rate is for jpmorgan given your current mix and where that might differ from your medium term loss guidance jamie dimon so we re not talking quarter over quarter weâ re just taking in general trendsâ steven chubak i m talking in bigger picture jamie dimon so marianne has shown year to year we consider it normalized losses and for years we ve been doing better than that in credit card middle market large corporate mortgage has come back down to a very low number and at one point it s going to go up and so i m not we re not telling you what s going to happen next quarter right now it looks like itâ s kind of steady state but at one point we will not be surprised see it go up i don t know if it could be second quarter third quarter fourth quarter and i don t know if weâ re relate cycle we don t exactly know where we re in the cycle and so we just wonâ t be surprised to see it go up and the number if we look at it by product we re looking at a total that can actually may vary against the total marianne lake i think i hate to say this because i know that you don t want to wait a few weeks but we ll have a more complete conversation about kind of range of total outcomes on credit at investor day but we when we gave our medium term simulation we said listen we did a 17 return on tangible common equity in 2018 and our medium term guidance is for 17 we under earned against our guidance in other parts of the cycle maybe weâ ll over earn against it but nii and repo bags are higher and credit is benign and at some point we would expect both of those things to normalize but we would continue to see solid growth in all of our drivers so we don t know when it will be and actually don t see anything that i know you say in the second third or fourth quarter there s no indication that it s in any of those quarters but we ll have a more comprehensive discussion at investor day about range of total outcomes steven chubak we re looking forward to that and just one follow up for me on the ib outlook marianne i was hoping i could unpack to some of your comments around the how the ib backlog you cited that as being quite strong but just looking at the individual businesses for m a ecm dcm especially given some the economic pressures outside the u s what informs your outlook across each of those marianne lake yes so i would say that first of all we did see given the conditions in the fourth quarter a number of deals that got pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter particularly in ecm and dcm in m a there was a bit more balance so every deal that got pushed or stopped there were more that came to take its place but as a result as we go into the first quarter pipelines across the board are elevated relative to last year and pretty strong and at the end of the day we talked about earlier confidence is still high companies are still motivated to drive growth and so the environment should be constructive for continued m a technology healthcare biotech innovation technology innovation momentum in ecm that we ve been benefiting from and the ipo pipeline should continue market dependent and notwithstanding december actually a sort of lower outlook for rates in the u s should broadly be a tailwind for fixed income in the first quarter the first half so the second half of the year i think is going to be determined by how things shape up over the next several months but looking into january again if the market remains generally constructive we should see tailwinds across the businesses jamie dimon i think potential backlogs generally you want them high because thatâ s good but theyâ re all like an accordion too they come and go so thatâ s not a forecast for the future that youâ d definitely get those revenues they could get delayed particularly things like ipo that youâ ve already seen i just want to point out the shout out to the folks in the investment bank our market share went up in europe asia latin america and united states last year thatâ s what we really look at when we look at the business marianne lake 60 basis points full year jamie dimon 60 basis points all year and first time ever it went in all four major in markets operator our next question is from marty mosby of vining sparks marty mosby jamie i was glad that you mentioned that we don t know the red end of the cycle because that s kind of just assume because of that lapse of time but not really the economic factors and then the other piece of this is when you look at losses they tend to be good until they go into recession then they are bad there is no just kind of normalization so the question about a normal rate of loss that we really have two dichotomous answers we have a good answer which is when weâ re expanding and the economy is stable and we have a bad answer or recession it s kind of one or the other just want to see what you thought about that jamie dimon youâ re exactly right at one point youâ re going to over and at one point youâ re going to under run and we try to when we look at the business we kind of try to price through that so weâ re trying to earn fair returns through the cycle and i totally agree with you we know itâ s going to they are going to change at one point and we try to do a better job underwriting too but we do work hard and make sure we underwrite other people as best we can marty mosby which then limits the volatility when you go into that bad period which is what you want to do you underwrite to make sure you re defending against that cycle jamie dimon exactly and the other one you have is the reserves you put them up you take them down so our total reserve is what 14 billion but at one point they were 30 so we went from in the great recession went from 7 to 30 back to 14 and i call it income paper it doesnâ t mean advantages but when you go into that recession your losses go up any reserves have to go up and weâ re completely aware of that marianne lake although i think we have to say for obvious reason that we wouldnâ t expect any near term recession if there is one to anything like it did before and even if it did given the credit quality of the portfolio performance will be not only absolutely better but we think strong on a relative basis jamie dimon other than if you look at the consumer that 13 trillion that s outstanding other than student which is fundamentally owned by the government the more stuff that s been written is prime so back to 10 trillion it is much better than what it was in â 07 and i think credit card i forgot the exact numbers much more prime than was in â 07 i think order is about the same but order actually outperformed more prime and outperformed in the great recession i think people in general have done a better job underwriting middle market and leveraged up than it did last time i think if you start a recession soon going into it the credit portfolio is much stronger than last time marty mosby and the follow up question to that is we talked about auto and some of those other places where you saw some of that deterioration what our model showing is that actually the discipline and the reaction time to that deterioration is much quicker than when we saw the one to four family cycled the last time where you saw deterioration but growth just kept going we had so many banks jump in and say look weâ ve already pulled back on auto lending we pulled back on multifamily there have already been places where youâ ve seen that discipline so that discipline in itself put the governor on economic growth which is why we re having less growth or slower growth but yet it also creates a like you said a stronger portfolio for that eventual downturn jamie dimon i agree with that lack of discipline we see is in student and a little bit in small commercial real estate operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy can you guys there has been a lot of talk about leveraged loans and how this time around everything seems to be underwritten better are there any tangible statistics that you can share with us or maybe on investor day you might do show us that yes the leveraged loan portfolio for you guys in particular is much healthier than maybe â 06 â 07 and then second on this leverage loan issue outside the banking industry what are some of the indirect hits that you and maybe some of your peers may experience none from the direct hit of the leverage loan but for some of the craziness that s going on outside the banking industry jamie dimon yes so can i just give a big picture of this i think 1 7 trillion of leveraged loans okay so term a is about half of that these are very rough numbers okay most of it with banks and obviously safer than term b a big chunk over i think 60 or 70 of the term b is with nonbanks and so if you look at your at banking system if you look at the leverage lending bridge book in â 07 it was over 400 billion today s itâ s number like 80 in â 07 there were commitments and no flex and everyone has plenty of flex now so we look at covenants so itâ s kind of covenants but thereâ s flex and there is a whole bunch of stuff in there so it is far far far sounder today even these clos you look to underwrite the clos they are far better underwritten with more equity more sub debt and more mezzanine stuff like that and go to shadow banks they do things like differently a lot of those folks are quite bright they know what they re doing someone is going to get hurt there and the issue there is in the next recession because the and remember most of the major banks donâ t fund a lot of that we arenâ t taking huge indirect exposure to that by funding some of the nonbanks and i think the issue there is for the marketplace itâ s going to be when you have a recession the lender will not be there so a lot of these borrowers will be stranded so thatâ s not thatâ s an opportunity or risk or something like that but itâ s not i wouldnâ t put it in the systemic category again if you go back to â 07 we it emerged in â 07 there was 1 trillion of bad mortgages that were kind of all over the place the clos sibs there are no sibs the clos are much smaller the leverage lending book is much smaller book capital liquidity is much higher so it is nothing like â 07 you will have a recession it just wonâ t be like you had last time affecting the banking system it will affect the banking system we are little bit canaries in the coal mine we are not immune to what goes in the economy but it wonâ t be anything like you saw last time for most of the larger banks gerard cassidy no i agree with that and do you think janet yellen and other federal reserve officials comments about leveraged lending is more directed to the exposure outside the banking industry than inside the banking industry jamie dimon yes i do marianne lake yes jamie dimon yes again i donâ t think they were saying itâ s huge and systemic theyâ re saying itâ s something that you should keep an eye on i think that the regulatory do keep an eye on that gerard cassidy and then just to pivot on deposit question obviously noninterest bearing deposits are tough to keep as rates are going higher can you guys give us some color on the non interest bearing deposits there is obviously a small decline what parts of the business you re seeing there and the fedâ s unwind of its balance sheet how much of an impact do you think that might be having on the non interest bearing deposits marianne lake so the migration into product from noninterest to interest bearing is predominantly or largely exclusively a wholesale thing at this point there is not enough rate benefit in the interest bearing savings to drive into product migration definitely some growth outlook in cds given pricing but itâ s wholesale right now and itâ s mainly rate related and not balance sheet in terms of the fed unwind jamie dimon can i just make a comment about interest rates and the balance sheet of fed so the interest rate is one thing but the balance sheet of fed obviously is causing changes in the flow of funds itâ s causing changes in that banks now have options other than reserves at the central bank because the two year and three year bond yields for corporate government bond is much higher some people are preferring to own that because they think it would be paid better than corporate risk so changing the whole bunch of fund flows concerns people but iâ d say itâ s part and process of normalization operator our next question is from ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin there were couple of fed or regulatory documents out in late december one is codifying the three year burning of stated seasonal impacts and another one where they are pushing out till â 22 on their own implementation of cecl accounting in the supervisory stress test i was just wondering just any takeaways you had from reading that and any hopes you might have for just as we get toward some finalization of which way cecl goes and how it looks aspirations around that and how that interacts with ccar and such jamie dimon before marianne answers that question i just want to do a shout out to jefferies because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year ken usdin iâ ll pass that along jamie marianne lake following that itâ s hard to follow i would say that we ve been pretty clear about the fact that our biggest concern around cecl was properly understanding not just for us but regulators to properly understand the implications for capital not only in benign but in stressed scenarios and what the implications of the outcomes that it could have on the willingness of people to extend credit particularly as cycles age and with the outlook for volatilities to increase so having a transition is obviously helpful you should imagine that we would likely avail ourselves of that opportunity that is what it is for me the question that needs to be clarified is if we are to include the impact of cecl in company run stress test but the federal reserve is not going to include it in the stress test we need to kind of understand the insight between those two things particularly if that might coincide with a turn in the cycle in actual fact so i think we re looking for continued clarity from the regulators about what exactly that means if we re embedding these assumptions into our stress tests and our results sooner than they are how do we think about the implications of that on our distribution plans and capital outlooks and you know importantly if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans i do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics secular change that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential business and we should worry about that jamie dimon it ll be a big number for like credit card so if you put 3 now on when you build the loan book by 100 the number would be 6 some number in the future will be much higher so i do think particularly smaller banks will react fairly dramatically how they run their loan books through that marianne lake so our view is that more on that needs to be done in the industry about what this looks like i hope that what was meant by we should include it in company run stress test is for us to collectively learn and for the regulators to have the time to respond to that but remember 2022 considering all the discussion we ve had on this call about the cycle how long the cycle is when there s a turn in the cycle and we could actually face a stress before that and so it s great that they are waiting a bit but it might all be a bit of an academic point depending on what happens actually ken usdin yes that s a fair point and jamie you ve also said in the past that you guys lend on accounting don t lend on accounting and lend on economic but there s this kind of challenge to that that marianne just mentioned about the unintended consequences and so it would be interesting to see that if there is in fact the point where banks don t lean in as you just mentioned marianne jamie dimon they will change marianne lake yes and we have the luxury or the flexibility of being able to say that we can continue to lend based upon the underlying economics but someone who has a differently situated balance sheet and return profile may not be able to do that ken usdin okay thanks for the color operator our next question is from mike mayo of wells fargo securities mike mayo a follow up on the net interest margin two sides to the question one is commercial loan pricing i guess it s been kind of brutal youâ ve had the bdcs private equity firms loan funds all computing has there been any let up with some of the dislocation the capital markets late in the year and the other side retail deposit betas marianne you thought they would get a lot worse i don t think it s been as bad as you thought what was your retail deposit beta and what do you still expect jamie dimon before marianne answers that can i just go back to the cyclical stuff it s not just cecl a lot of things that have been built and since the crisis were really good there was more pro cyclicality built into it and so you re going to see the next downturn that we have a far more pro cyclical accounting liquidity and rules and rules capital and stuff like that which we don t know the full effect of that but if i was a regulator i would be very cautious about constantly building pro cyclicality into the system and i gave you the example it s our loan books they re going from 7 to 30 or whatever they went to back to 14 it will affect how people respond to in the downturns and it will cause people to pullback much quicker than maybe in the past in total marianne lake okay so just on your question so corporate loan spreads i would say we did see sort of pretty brutal grinding down in corporate spread but over the last actually couple of quarters we saw them find a bit of an equilibrium and stabilize at levels so while i would say itâ s still true to say that there is a lot of competition at least in the space in which weâ re operating weâ re seeing spread at relatively stable levels in the corporate space and honestly i donâ t remember saying that i thought we would see an acceleration that was dramatic in retail betas in the short term obviously at some point when the when we have this level of rates and the spread between market rates and rates paid get to a certain level and if normalization continues we would expect to see repo flags catch up but we have not seen that yet outside of cds in retail phase right now mike mayo and the way you calculate it what was your retail deposit beta this quarter and how does that compare to the past marianne lake so in checking and savings and lead savings itâ s nothing in cds itâ s something but around to a very small number operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy just a quick follow up marianne have your investment bankers on the front lines passed on any concerns about the government shutdown there is reports that the sec is not open and is that slowing down the investment banking business and your thoughts on that marianne lake yes so i would say that weâ ve been we benefited from the fact that year end and into the early part of january and holiday season have a light calendar typically in january for ipos in particular but for sure if we donâ t see the ability to get approvals from sec on ipos and to a lesser extent some of the m a deals that need approvals from government agencies it will be problematic in the ability to see those activity levels play out and fees be realized so itâ s one of many things that would behoove us to end this sooner rather than later operator and we have no further questions at this time jamie dimon thank you operator this concludes todayâ s conference call you may now disconnect

jpm earnings call for the period ending december 31 2018 jpmorgan chase co jpm 0 92 q4 2018 earnings conference call 8 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants see all our earnings call transcripts prepared remarks operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chase s fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please standby at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chase s chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer marianne lake ms lake please go ahead marianne lake chief financial officer thank you operator good morning everyone i m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation starting on page one the firm reported fourth quarter net income of 7 1 billion and eps of 1 98 on revenue of nearly 27 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 14 market impacts aside underlying business drivers remain solid including core loan and deposit growth consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season capital market activity and with credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses for the full year 2018 the firm reported revenue of 111 5 billion and net income of 32 5 billion both clear records even adjusting for the impact of tax reform and so we re entering 2019 with good momentum across our businesses turning to page two and some more detail about our fourth quarter results revenue of 26 8 billion was up 1 1 billion or 4 year on year driven by net interest income nii was up 1 2 billion or 9 on higher rates and on loan and deposit growth non interest revenue was down slightly with lower market levels impacting asset wealth management fees and private equity losses being offset by higher card fees and auto lease growth in ccb expense of 15 7 billion was up 6 year on year the increase relates to investments we re making in technology marketing real estate and front office as well as revenue related costs including growth in auto this was partially offset by a reduction in fdic fees as we had hoped the incremental surcharge was eliminated effective at the end of the third quarter and this is a benefit of a little over 200 million for the quarter across our businesses credit trends remain favorable across both consumer and wholesale credit cost of 1 5 billion were up 240 million year on year driven by changes in reserves in consumer we built reserves of 150 million in card on loan growth in wholesale over the last several quarters we have seen net reserve releases and recoveries however this quarter we had about 200 million of credit costs the gain largely reserve builds on select c i client downgrades driven by a handful of names across multiple sectors while we are constantly looking at a granular level foreshadows these downgrades are idiosyncratic and do not reflect signs of deterioration in our portfolios the outlook for credit as we see it remains positive shifting to the full year results on page three we reported net income for the year of 32 5 billion our return on tangible common equity of 17 and eps of 9 a share net income was a record for the firm as well as to each of our businesses even excluding tax reform revenue of 111 5 billion was also a record and was up nearly 7 billion or 7 year on year 4 3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and card margin expansion being offset by lower market nii non interest revenue was up 2 5 billion or 5 driven by cib markets and growth in consumer being offset by private equity losses and the impact of spread widening on sba we ended the year with adjusted expense of 63 3 billion up 6 which brings our overhead ratio to 57 for the year even as we continued to make very significant investments across the franchise and although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth results given tax reform adjusted for this or looking on a gaap basis we delivered nearly 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the year and well over 100 basis points for the full quarter on credit the environment remains favorable throughout 2018 credit costs were 4 9 billion down 8 driven by lower net reserve builds in consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sale moving on to page four and balance sheet and capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of 12 flat to last quarter risk weighted assets decreased with loan growth more than offset by derivatives counterparty and trading rwa given a combination in seasonality market conditions and model enhancements our net payout ratio for the quarter exceeded 100 and we repurchased 5 7 billion of shares moving to consumer community banking on page five ccb generated net income of 4 billion and an roe of 30 for the fourth quarter and for the year nearly 15 billion of net income and an roe of 28 customer satisfaction remains near all time high across our businesses for the quarter core loans were up 5 year on year driven by home lending up 8 card up 6 and business banking up 5 deposits grew 3 growth continues to slow given the rising rates environment but importantly we believe we continue to outpace the industry of note this quarter we opened the first 10 branches in our expansion markets including d c boston and philadelphia and although it s clearly early reception in the market and the performance of the new branches have been strong despite volatile market client investment assets was still up 3 and we saw record net new money flows for the year card sales were up 10 debit sales up 11 and merchant processing volumes up 17 reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season and in keeping with our focus on digital everything of note active mobile customers were up 3 million users or 11 year on year revenue of 13 7 billion was up 13 consumer business banking revenue was up 18 on higher deposit nii driven by margin expansion home lending revenue was down 8 driven by lower net production revenue in a low volume highly competitive environment and of note while not a material driver of overall expense revenue headwinds here were offset by lower net production expense and card merchant services auto revenue was up 14 driven by higher card nii on both loan growth and margin expansion lower cost net acquisition costs principally sapphire reserves and higher auto lease volumes card revenue rate was 11 6 for the quarter and 11 27 for the year as expected expense of 7 1 billion was up 6 driven by investments in technology and marketing and auto lease depreciation partially offset by lower fdic charges and other expense efficiencies on credit net charge offs were 18 million as modestly higher charge offs in cards were more than offset by lower charge offs in auto and home lending charge off rates were down year on year across all portfolios economic indicators remain upbeat and given the breadth and depth of our franchise we have a pretty good parameter from everything we see the us consumer remains very healthy now turning to page six on the corporate investment bank cib reported net income of 2 billion and an roe of 10 on revenue of 7 2 billion for the fourth quarter and for the year net income of nearly 12 billion and an roe of 16 in banking it was a record year for both total fees and advisory fees we went number one in global ib fee for the 10th consecutive year gaining share across all regions fourth quarter ib revenue of 1 7 billion was up 3 we saw continued momentum in advisory with fees up 38 driven by the closing of several large transactions for the year we ranked number two in wallet gaining share equity underwriting fees were down 4 but significantly outperforming the market we ranked number one for the year and the quarter and so our leadership positions across all products globally with particular strength in ipos as well as in the technology and healthcare sectors and debt underwriting fees were down 19 versus the strong prior year and better than the market we maintained our number one rank for the year and continued to hold strong lead left positions in high yield bonds and leveraged loans moving to market total revenue was 3 2 billion down 6 reported and down 11 adjusted for the impact of tax reform and slight in of margin loan loss last year a confluence of factors throughout the quarter including trade concerns around global growth in corporate earnings fears of a more mortgage fare as well as other negative headlines caused spikes in volatility which were amplified by markets by assets and liquidity and although we saw a decent client flow rates rallied spreads widened and energy prices fell significantly all against general market condition that was anticipating a stronger end to the year as a result fixed income markets in particular were challenging with revenue down 18 adjusted weaker performance across rates credit rating and commodities was partially offset by good momentum in emerging markets equities revenue was up 2 adjusted a solid end to a record year prime continued to do well but we saw clients deleveraging over the course of the quarter and cash and derivatives are solid in a tougher environment treasury services revenue was 1 2 billion up 13 driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates but also benefiting from fee growth on higher volumes security services revenue was 1 billion up 1 underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit credit adjustments other was a loss of 243 million reflecting higher funding spreads on our derivatives finally expense of 4 7 billion was up slightly with continued investments in technology and bankers and volume related transaction costs partially offset by lower fdic charges and lower performance based compensation the comp to revenue ratio for the quarter and for the year was 28 moving to commercial banking on page seven the commercial bank reported net income of 1 billion and an roe of 20 for the fourth quarter and for the year 4 billion of net income and an roe of 20 revenue of 2 3 billion for the quarter was down 2 as the prior year included a tax reform related benefits excluding its revenue was up 3 driven by higher deposit nii gross ib revenue of 600 million was down 1 year on year but up 4 sequentially on a strong underlying flow of activity particularly in m a full year ib revenue was a record 2 5 billion up 4 on strong activity across segments in particular middle market banking which was up 8 deposit balances were up 1 sequentially as client cash positions are seasonally highest toward year end although down 7 year on year as we continue to see migration of non operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives we believe we are retaining a significant portion of these flows expense of 845 million was down 7 year on year as the prior year included 100 million of impairment on leased assets excluding this expense was up 5 driven by continued investments in the business in banker coverage as well as in technology and product initiatives loans were up 2 year on year and flat sequentially c i loans were up 1 reflecting a decline in our tax exempted portfolio given tax reform adjusting for this we would have been up 4 which is still below the industry as we focus on client selection pricing and credit discipline but keep in mind in areas where we have chosen to grow such as in our expansion markets we are growing at or above industry benchmarks cre loans were up 2 also below the industry as we have proactively slowed our growth due to where we are in cycle through continued structural and pricing discipline and targeted selection of new deals underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs of 106 million including higher loan loss reserves largely due to select client downgrades moving on to asset wealth management on page eight asset wealth management reported net income of 604 million with a pre tax margin of 23 and an roe of 26 for the fourth quarter and for the year net income was nearly 3 billion pre tax margin of 26 and an roe of 31 revenue of 3 4 billion for the quarter was down 5 year on year with the impact of current market levels driving lower investment valuations and management fees as well as to a lesser extent lower performance fees these were partially offset by strong banking results and the cumulative impact of net inflows expense of 2 6 billion was flat as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance based compensation and lower revenue driven external fees for the quarter we saw a net long term outflows of 3 billion with strength in fixed income more than offset by outflows from equity and multi asset products additionally we had net liquidity inflows of 21 billion for the tenth consecutive year we saw net long term inflows of 25 billion this year driven predominantly by multi asset and in addition saw 31 billion of net liquidity inflow this year asset from the management of 2 trillion and overall client assets at 2 7 trillion were both down 2 as the impact at market levels more than offset the benefit of net inflows deposits were flat sequentially and down 7 year on year reflecting migration into investments and we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows finally we had record loan balances up 13 with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending moving to page nine and corporate corporate reported a net loss of 577 million treasury and cio net income of 175 million was up year on year primarily driven by higher rates other corporate saw a net loss of 752 million including on a pre tax basis funding our foundation for corporate philanthropy 200 million this quarter flat year on year and including a 150 million of markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments market related the remainder is driven by tax related items totaling a little over 300 million and within this are two notable components the first is regular weighted tax reserve and second represents small differences between the effective tax rate for each of our businesses and that for the overall company as we close the year so therefore there is an offset across our businesses our full year effective tax rate was just a little over 20 in line with guidance moving to page 10 and outlook we will give you more full year outlook and sensitivity information at the investor day as always however for now i did want to provide some color and reminders about the first quarter net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates on growth but quarter over quarter will be negatively impacted by day count and we expect the first quarter nii to be relatively flat sequentially while it is too early clearly to give guidance on fee revenues it s also fair to say that this quarter markets feel calmer and more positive and capital markets pipelines are strong so if the environment remains supportive we would expect normal seasonal strength in the first quarter but i will remind you that the first quarter of 2018 included a 500 million accounting write off as well as broad strength in performance expect expense to be up mid single digits year on year obviously market dependent primarily annualization effects and finally as i said we expect credit to remain favorable across products so to close while the market in the fourth quarter were more challenging we should not leave sight of the fact that 2018 was a strong year indeed a record for revenues net income and eps both reported and adjusted for tax reform fundamental economic data remains supportive of continued growth and we re generally constructive on the outlook for 2019 we have good momentum coming into the year and the company and each of our businesses are very well positioned with that operator we can open up the line for q a questions and answers operator our first question is from erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning marianne lake chief financial officer good morning erika erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst so the way bank s stocks have performed clearly investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near term and of course credit which you addressed i m wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected if the overhead ratio of 57 that you posted in 2017 and 2018 is something that you could continue to level off to or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when we re thinking about the overhead ratio marianne lake chief financial officer yeah so i would say a couple of things the first is just to remind you that 2017 and 2018 i would look at a gaap rather than a managed basis because of the adjustments to our revenues from tax reform but that said we have while we don t set expense targets nor do we set overhead ratio targets we have given you some outlook that would suggest that we continue to believe that a combination of revenue growth and expense discipline notwithstanding the investments that we ve been making we should see our overhead ratios continue to be stable to trending down to the kind of mid 50 s or 55 ish obviously the timing of that will depend on rates and markets and everything else so we would expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage on higher nii on growth if nothing else and continued solid growth in fees clearly in any one quarter you can have pluses and minuses that can be market dependent but generally over time we would still expect those trends erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you for that and just as a follow up question the market is also thinking that the last rate hike from the fed was december and i m wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if december was indeed the last rate hike for sometime marianne lake chief financial officer so i would say first of all just to say that the question mark about whether that s a pause or a stop is it the end of a cycle we don t think so we think the outlook for growth in the economy is still strong the consumer is still strong and healthy and we re expecting to still see maybe slower but still global growth going forward having said that just as a general matter you ve seen through our earnings at risk as we have put more and more of the benefit at past rate hikes in our run rate each incremental hike from here has while still positive significantly lower sort of incremental nii drive and that the front end skew is a lower percentage so it s not nothing so clearly lower front end rates or lower long end of the curve or a flatter curve all other things would be modestly negative but against that you kind of pointed out the potential for this to lead to lower or slower reprice and so as the fed pauses it is fair to say there could be an offset from lower reprice as people digest the data and understand whether this is a pause or no we would still look at we delivered 4 3 billion of nii growth in 2018 we ll still benefit in 2019 from the annualization effects of the higher rates we ve already had as well as solid growth so while you can t expect 2019 over 2018 to be at that level it would still be strong nii growth year on year james dimon chairman and chief executive officer i would just add the why is equally if not more important than the what so if you if it is a pause because you re going to go into recession you re going to reduce rates that obviously is very different than if it s a pause the economy is strong in their wage rates you know which one you would choose marianne lake chief financial officer right and this is where the end of a cycle it s no cycle we ve ever seen before so in that scenario if term loans and fund rates are at 2 5 no 4 4 5 5 5 plus i think we ve never seen that movie before but that s not our central case and by the way the house fee the research fee would still be to see incremental hikes this year if not in the first half in the second operator our next question is from jim mitchell of buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning maybe a question on the card business there s been chatter about sort of pulling back on rewards to kind of focus more on profitability i guess how do you think about the strategy in cards right now and can that i think the revenue yield in the card business was up 7 bps to 11 57 can that go higher from here as you maybe pull back on rewards marianne lake chief financial officer yeah i would say that when we think about the product continually have in the constructs rewards is a very important part of driving engaged relationships with our customers customers are very attuned to it and are looking for value in the product value and simplicity and ease of use are the three things in the products that we deliver and so for us engaged relationships drive profitability this is a still a very profitable business and so while we ll always make adjustments to our offerings it s not the case that we are looking at meaningful pull back pull back in rewards and if you think about things like sapphire banking where we re looking to bring the impact of our products together we re continuing to offer rewards based incentives to drive engagement with our customers so we think it s a solid strategy a business that already has good returns it s fair to say that we ve seen a lot of competitive response and competitive products in the marketplace that are driving high rewards offerings too and we ve not seen that lower our ability to net acquire new accounts so we feel great about the value proposition the simplicity and the compelling products that we have jim mitchell buckingham research analyst okay so we think we about marianne lake chief financial officer that s already a very profitable business jim mitchell buckingham research analyst right and so we think about still seeing decent growth how do we think about card losses specifically this year you seem pretty optimistic on credit should we still expect some seasoning or do you think the macro trends are that positive that we hold steady how do you think about credit in cards marianne lake chief financial officer so i think the macro trends are definitely positive so they are creating tailwinds but it s also true we talked about the fact that if you go back to 2014 2015 that we had expanded our credit books we had expanded it intentionally at higher risk adjusted margins but over the course of the last couple of years as we ve experienced outperformance we ve done sort of surgical risk pullbacks and we ve amended our collection strategy all of which have led to a charge off rate for the fourth quarter in 2018 that s down slightly year on year and for the year that s at 310 basis points which is reasonably meaningfully below our expectations even as late as the end of last year so we feel great that that kind of loss trend at that 310 basis points maybe a little bit higher is something we should look forward to at least into 2019 and it will be helped by a supportive macro environment and we are seeing if you unpick all of our trends you see the phenomenon of three vintages you d see the mature vintages that continue to be stable to grinding lower in terms of delinquencies and loss rates you see the older expansion vintages that have passed their peak delinquencies and are trending to a more stable low level and then you do have obviously with new acquisitions a cohort that are still seasoning that will continue but net net we re expecting a relatively stable loss rate that leveled similar to 2018 operator our next question is from saul martinez of ubs marianne lake chief financial officer hey saul operator and i m sorry his line has disconnected our next question is from john mcdonald of bernstein marianne lake chief financial officer hey john john mcdonald bernstein analyst hi good morning good morning marianne just wondering on the markets commentary obviously super early in the quarter but you mentioned things feeling better can you just talk about seasonality there but also just what feels better so far and then also in the fourth quarter what you saw in leverage lending market how much did you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and hung deals a little bit of color there would be helpful marianne lake chief financial officer sure okay so i would say that obviously the fourth quarter was challenging and there was a lot of market moves a big sort of broad set off and at that point there were elevated concerns around trade global growth data it was causing concerns there were concerns that the fed was going to continue to be hawkish and not necessarily as responsive to some of the things the market was worried about so there were a lot of negativity we think too much negativity priced into the fourth quarter and it started to change a bit when we saw the first really strong unemployment print which reminded people that there s a very long distance between 3 growth and a contraction so yes we could see slower growth but still growth in the us and across the globe a slightly more constructive narrative on trade and that continues to broadly progress we hope and believe in a positive direction a more dovish outlook from the fed the potential for that to be pauses in rates all being relatively supportive and the fact that a lot of people were on the sidelines through the fourth quarter and investor appetite is out there for good value where it can be found so i would say just early days in the first quarter there are still obviously risks to the outlook and any of those things could go in both direction but so far things just feel a little bit more positive and that s constructive and therefore you would hope to see normal seasonal strength in january on leveraged loans look sort of just start diving into the sort of potential for that to be hung bridges it s true that there was a significant market correction where the spreads widening across high yield bonds and leveraged loans in the fourth quarter clearly stepping back while the industry leverage finance commitments are up they are materially down from before the crisis and very different so credit fundamentals look pretty good having said that and by the way we paused on a lot of deals in the fourth quarter we ve maintained sort of protection in terms of flex pricing and flex protections and as a result the vast majority of our bridge book has still got a decent cushion and that s not to say that there is no deals that have the potential for there to be net losses after fees but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter i would also say that coming back to the first quarter that actually the market could be quite constructive for fixed income into the first quarter given a more dovish fed supporting corporate margin corporate default rates is going to stay pretty low and we do have time so none of the deals that we have need to be booked to market in a hurry and the market is moving in a positive direction john mcdonald bernstein analyst got it thanks very much operator our next question is from al alevizakos of hsbc al alevizakos hsbc analyst hi thank you for taking my question i again want to focus a bit on the market s performance you pretty much mentioned like weakness across the board in credit in fx in rates which i assume like it s the case first of all i want a bit of an outlook on how you think rates will perform now that volatility has picked up and more importantly you mentioned strength in emerging markets can i ask whether that was primarily in asia or latam thank you very much marianne lake chief financial officer so it s no good ever comes of talking about how we think things are going to pan out in the first quarter other than just the general comments i ve already made which is the environment should be more constructive and we are expecting decent volatility in client activity and we ll see how that pans out with respect to emerging markets latin america was a big piece but asia too al alevizakos hsbc analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from mike mayo of wells fargo securities marianne lake chief financial officer hey mike mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi can you hear me marianne lake chief financial officer yes mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst i guess i m a little torn between the year and the quarter so i ll just ask it to jamie jamie it seems like you guys are very happy with the year with all the record revenues and earnings but the fourth quarter are you happy with the fourth quarter given expenses credit fees james dimon chairman and chief executive officer i am fully happy with it the franchise is strong we re investing in new products and services but we re not immune from the weather volumes and volatility we re not immune from market prices and assets going up or down and i like the loans up 6 and assets up sub 10 long term flow is up i like the fact that credit card spend is up 10 merchant processing is up 17 shares in almost every business market shares have gone up that s what i look at i really don t pay that much attention to being busted a little bit by the fact that volumes are low in the last three weeks of december i honestly couldn t care less and i look at more like in equities we ve gained share and we re now bumping up to number one those folks have done a great job of course cash derivatives prime broker et cetera and fixed income we ve maintained our share and we re adding products and services around the world and we don t know marianne lake chief financial officer and even gained share james dimon chairman and chief executive officer we don t know what s going to happen next quarter and i don t care marianne lake chief financial officer and we take the same position like we had strong first half of the year and we said loan may continue but it may not and one quarter doesn t make a trend and so we don t really react to that sort of micro even though it was driven by the macro the real underlying business drivers continue to be strong and even in those businesses we are holding leadership positions and gaining share and so there is two parts and things will continue to move forward in a constructive manner mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst well as a follow up let s talk about the weather so the weather is lousy at the end of the year and jamie you were just appointed to your third year as chairman of the business roundtable so in that role what are you doing to help jpmorgan and i guess the other banks in terms of china the government shutdown immigration some of these headline issues that marianne talked about having hurt the cib in the fourth quarter james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yeah so december is terrible but if you look at january you have half of it back genuine spreads and markets and stuff like that and as brt i don t do anything to benefit jpmorgan that s about public policy that s good for the growth of american total and it s very specifically stayed away from doing about banks there but the brt does take up trade and we are supportive of the fact there are serious issues with china we d like to see the trade deal gets done it looks to us like they re marching along at least to this march 1st deadline date that they ll have enough will be done to kind of get an extension and hopefully complete the deal we would like to see immigration reform so proper border security allowing people who have advanced degrees to stay here having the doctors stay here having more merit based immigration and having some path to citizenship that is the brt position we want more innovation we d like to reduce regulations at the local and federal level to stop small business formation so if you look at the brt there are 10 verticals around it and we try to do things that are good for the growth of america and bad policy can slow down the growth of america as i pointed out over and over it takes 12 years to get the permits to build the bridge i mean and it took us 8 years to put a man in the moon it is time that we reform ourselves and not blame anybody else for our own lack of that we don t have kids getting out of school of educations whether you get jobs that our innovation slow down the government r d spending is down i always think it s look at yourself looking to do better and there s plenty this country could do better to help growth over the long run it s not about helping it next quarter operator our next question is from glenn schorr of evercore isi glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi there marianne lake chief financial officer good morning glenn glenn schorr evercore isi analyst good morning a follow up on john s question earlier on leveraged lending on slide 24 you see the balance on loans held for sale go from like 6 5 billion to 15 billion i heard your comments on marks i m assuming that that is just a disruption and you go back toward your normal level that s in the pipes and progress but i just want to make sure that i m not making that wrong assumption marianne lake chief financial officer yes we re not expecting anything to be elevated glenn schorr evercore isi analyst okay cool and james dimon chairman and chief executive officer that number goes up or down all the time just based on episodic what is cleared out of the books there s nothing on a number that we re afraid of glenn schorr evercore isi analyst understood curious on the credit on the couple of marks in c i i m just curious on how much of that is internal versus external rating agency and i guess it s a feel for the underlying fundamentals so how do you know we should treat that as idiosyncratic as you call marianne lake chief financial officer yes so it s internal and it s like five names four sectors we know the specifics it is situationally specific remember just to give you some context for those who can drive the dollar value regular way in any quarter given the size of our portfolio we might downgrade and upgrade hundreds of individual names based upon the circumstances and so when we say that we re looking at this and saying that things are idiosyncratic it s not just looking at the five situations that drive the biggest dollar value it s also looking at the hundreds of downgrades and the hundreds of upgrades and seeing if there s any trends or net worrying signs there and honestly not now and so if anything marginally we had more upgrades but it s just there s nothing to see right now in our portfolios and we re looking glenn schorr evercore isi analyst okay appreciate that james dimon chairman and chief executive officer we look for reasons to put up reserves marianne lake chief financial officer yes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer not to take them down marianne lake chief financial officer only the paranoids survive we are more paranoid than you are james dimon chairman and chief executive officer right glenn schorr evercore isi analyst last one obviously markets all went down in the fourth quarter and we had some freeze ups if you will in high yield first time in like 10 years but i m curious how you all think the markets functioned in general in other words things went down spreads widened out there was lots of fear but it felt like the plumbing was working but i don t want to put words in your mouth marianne lake chief financial officer yes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and half the people weren t even here the last two weeks in december marianne lake chief financial officer that s right the plumbing was working we didn t see any sort of algo or technology issues we didn t see any volumes that can be coped with while i said that there was a little bit of a lack of debt for the markets and liquidity that s typically the case when you have one way trends in a market and a lot of people similarly situated so i would say that relatively functioned well but challenging operator our next question is from andrew lim of societe generale andrew lim societe generale analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions i just had a follow on question from the vesting high yield marks question i mean you seem to getting impression that there weren t really much in the way of marks is that because you got very strong hedging strategies in place and that the decline in ficc revenues mainly was due to the lower volumes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer there were no marks marianne lake chief financial officer there were no marks in our bridge book right now we have for the vast majority we have good cushion and we expect to be able to clearing price through the market and for anything that s even borderline it s completely not material james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and i think some of the field did have a few marks marianne lake chief financial officer yeah james dimon chairman and chief executive officer if you look at what happened to flex pricing like mid december when things were at their worst yeah some of these things were very close to the end of their flex pricing and that means they re very close to having some kind of mark of course since then the spreads have kind of come back 40 marianne lake chief financial officer right andrew lim societe generale analyst interesting thanks and then my follow up question is that also mean the capital markets had a tough time but your wholesale lending the grids accelerated quite nicely and do you get the impression that corporates had a general shift to seek borrowing from banks such as yourselves because they were shut out of the market marianne lake chief financial officer i mean there was an uptick at the end of the year you saw in the industry data we saw it in our spot data for us in fact it was largely driven by one investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter but there was a little bit of an uptick a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing on the balance sheet but nothing i would call james dimon chairman and chief executive officer inaudible marianne lake chief financial officer no nothing that i would call unusual or a trend we didn t have to take down things that would have otherwise not cleared the market operator our next question is from matt o connor of deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning i want to circle back on the expense flexibility i think in your base case you re pretty clear that you re targeting positive operating leverage and moving down the efficiency ratio to the mid 50 s but what is some of the expense flexibility and where would it come from if the revenue is light i think in 2018 you accelerated some of the technology spend given tax reform you ve been opening branches some of that stuff obviously can t be pulled back but you always talk about some areas of flexibility so maybe what are those and if you could kind of size or help quantify some the flexibility you have that would be helpful thank you marianne lake chief financial officer yeah so i would say first of all that you saw that from 2013 through 2016 we had a pretty structural expense reduction program associated with simplifying our businesses so in terms of the low hanging fruit and things like that we would say largely that s been harvested we are always looking to generate core operating efficiencies so that we can absorb growth and when we are investing in technology and data one of the reasons to do it customer satisfaction product innovation aside is for efficiency so we are seeing some that come through we ll continue to drive that down james dimon chairman and chief executive officer but the efficiencies and the investments are all in the number that marianne gives and when she says up 5 marianne lake chief financial officer that s right james dimon chairman and chief executive officer roughly mid digits for marianne lake chief financial officer and so the way i would the way i would say it is that we continue to drive for expense discipline but as long as you feel as we do that the decision criteria that we use to determine the investments we re making which we think are strategically important for the long term growth of the company and the profitability of the company supporting our clients if those are good decisions for long term growth while we could obviously make changes we would not look to do that and so marketing expense for example is one area where you would say there s pretty sizable and immediate flexibility nevertheless when we invest in marketing we re driving new accounts and engage customers that drive long term growth so we invested through the cycle we think it sort of differentiates our long term performance and we d like to continue to do that 2019 over 2018 you wouldn t expect to see necessarily the same clip ups that you saw last year we did accelerate investments in 2018 and so more of the growth will be revenue related but still decent investments and the opportunity is still good to do that matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay that s helpful and then just on a sidebar here on the reserve bill as we think about credit quality are we just in the period now where we should assume kind of some reserve build consistent with loan growth each quarter or was this just a quarter where you had a couple of the lumpiness that really drove it i guess what i m getting at is last quarter you had james dimon chairman and chief executive officer we had pretty good model for it marianne lake chief financial officer sorry keep going matt o connor deutsche bank analyst i guess what i m getting at is like it s are we at the point where like just a couple lumpy loans is going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just maybe this is a bit unusual still marianne lake chief financial officer so first of all i just want to sort of point out that in the cards space we hopefully continue to grow healthy mid single digits there s the seasonality to cards balances and losses so you typically see reserve builds in the second half of the year that s what we saw this year and actually a little bit lower year on year than last and in the wholesale space you re going to see some things will be a bit lumpier and episodic given the nature of the loans that we have i wouldn t necessarily say that we expect to see a trend of some significant reserves but we ve been flatted by recoveries and releases over the course of the last couple of years partly or in large part at least earlier releasing reserves we took on energy when the energy went through the downturn and so we ll have some downgrades we might have some releases i would net net think that as we grow we would build but not disproportionately and we re arguably at the best point in the cycle so jamie mentioned earlier to the degree that we have the flexibility we re making sure that we re reserved accordingly operator our next question comes from saul martinez of ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hey good morning sorry about earlier i think i need to figure out how to use my phone multiple speakers no comment there lot of talk on macroeconomics and the policy backdrop in volatile markets but as you mentioned earlier you guys are in a pretty unique position in that you have pretty consistent dialog with a lot of economic agents whether it s corporates governments institutional investors and whatnot but just a sense of what your clients are saying what are they concerned about is there any concern on your part that some of these issues have sort of a self fulfilling effect in that it does end up leading to actions that precipitate a downturn or a recession marianne lake chief financial officer so i mean i think that we would look to the sort of macroeconomic data which is still generally supportive and say things should be good but for sure the sentiment is not immune to external factors and so manufacturing data has been a little weaker i would say capex is sluggish on let s say is around global growth government shutdown trades are not particularly helpful uncertainly is not good for anyone so there s no doubt that as things continue if there s an level of anxiety and uncertainty if it s not constructive for confidence and confidence to get stronger or less strong market so no i wouldn t say i think it s clear and present danger but i think we should be extremely careful because sentiment particularly consumer sentiment will be incredibly important and right now it s to good right sentiment in consumer and we just got back some sentiment from a whole bunch of our middle market companies that well neither are at their highs are still very high saul martinez ubs analyst right okay that s helpful if i could just ask about loan growth and just a more broad question about your ability to continue to outpace the industry and i suspect we ll get more color at investor day but just want to get your sense of the sustainability of growth and you mentioned on the commercial side maybe you scaled back a little bit maybe we re late cycle but where do you feel like you can continue to outgrow the industry where do you feel like maybe it s time to scale back on risk a little bit marianne lake chief financial officer okay so i mean i think it s incredibly nuance question because in general home lending has a challenging market backdrop for us it s tale of two cities we re doing quite well and gaining a bit of share in the kind of retail purchase market and we re holding sort of pricing discipline in correspond and losing share there so there s a challenging market backdrop card was doing well at and it s a factor of all things we talked about our investments in digital product rewards all of the above so we would like to believe that we ll continue to hold our own there auto is extremely competitive we play in prime super prime space and we re seeing competition from people who have different economic drivers in our sight credit unions and captives and so we re willing to lose share to maintain returns there you bifurcate c i we re growing in line or better than the industry in our expansion markets where we ve been making the investments where we ve been adding specialized industry coverage and we d like to see that because of the investments we re making but in mature markets where again being pretty prudent i wouldn t call it tightening but being very selective commercial real estate particularly construction lending yeah we are tightening we are being very cautious about new deals and selective about them so it isn t the case anymore that we would say we re seeking to grow although we ever were loan growth is an outcome of a number of factors may need a strategic dialog with our companies but also the environment we re in and it s extremely nuanced and in many of our businesses we re going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point james dimon chairman and chief executive officer so let me just reemphasize that we tell our management that we have no problem seeing loan books shrink marianne lake chief financial officer correct james dimon chairman and chief executive officer we are not going to be sitting here ever in our lives and say you got to grow the loan book you got to show loan growth remember warren buffett used to say in insurance business sometimes during the little business you re better off with the sales force go play golf in order to make new loans we are not going to be stupid and the other thing you have to always keep in mind is not the loan it s the relationship if you look at in total and so when it comes to middle market or all these other things there are reasons that we stay in a business knowing there s going to be a cycle and we re not going to be children when there s a cycle we know the losses are going to go up operator our next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning marianne lake chief financial officer good morning betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst are we playing golf all day yet or is that still far away james dimon chairman and chief executive officer credit is pristine mortgage credit is pristine middle market is pristine underwriting standard has been pretty good other than a few little pockets that marianne has mentioned but we saw people stretching in auto we saw some stretching and we re not in the subprime credit card but a little bit or few stretching that in leveraged lending we re not worried about our loan book i think you can have a logical conversation with kind of the non bank loan book but that s not our concern and it is what it is at the time so marianne lake chief financial officer and i think where businesses are notably a little bit less relationship driven i think about kind of low loan new relationships commercial term lending real estate banking mortgage to a lesser degree auto we are seeing we are losing or ceding share where it makes sense to do it james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and competition there we ve done this before is back everywhere and that s a good thing for america that means the pricing is a little tough and that you have to compete betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst yes so we re still off the golf course all right that s good just wanted to understand a little bit more on the expense side i know it was a even with the weather you guys put out a 14 rotce which is obviously best in class the question is on the expenses there s flexibility there but yet i know you ve got it to up single digits in 1q 2019 based on the prior conversation it seems like 1q might be an aberration of mid single digits or should i take that that s kind of the run rate you re expecting for the full year so why would 1q be a little bit different i guess is really the question marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i wouldn t fully annualize the first quarter but think about we ve added bankers and advisors across our businesses so you re going to get some annualization impact particularly first quarter into first quarter we had added more and more as the year progressed similarly something like auto lease where we grew our auto lease business revenues and expenses strongly in 2018 and that will be in our run rate in the first quarter so front office auto lease some of the technology investments we ve been making the annualization of those will be more pronounced first quarter to first quarter than fourth quarter to fourth quarter because many of them were in our run rate in the fourth quarter and then outside of that there s a bit more in real estate as we sort of execute on our head office strategy and then marketing foundation completion those things there are going to be timing so the first quarter will be higher i wouldn t annualize it we are going to see likely growth year over year much more because of revenue growth than because of investments at both year on year not the same level as the last year and we ll obviously give you a lot more detail and insights and thoughts on ranges and everything at investor day clearly operator our next question is from brian kleinhanzl of kbw brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst hi good morning marianne lake chief financial officer good morning brian brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst hi marianne just a quick question on the balance sheet i m sorry if you gave this already but can you kind of walk through the idea of lowering down the deposit with banks and kind of moving into repo what you saw in the quarter and then kind of is that just something that was temporary that s expected to reverse in the first quarter thanks marianne lake chief financial officer yeah so i mean it s fair to say that money market rates traded above ioer throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter and so through the quarter and that year end we were able to take advantage of the market opportunity to move out of cash into cash alternatives thinking of reverse repos and short duration assets and so for us it was yield enhancing opportunity to redeploy cash and a mix change rather than adding duration and that continues to be the case into the first quarter it contributed to our nim expansion in the fourth quarter we continue to have a bit of that mix shift in the first quarter and it s a market opportunity brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay and then a separate question i know it s not a big revenue driver anymore but within the mortgage banking you had a negative gain on sale in the quarter if you can just give us some color there what drove a negative gain on sale marianne lake chief financial officer yeah so in the quarter as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet we actually did a sale of conforming loans to the gses of about 5 billion the impact of that was to have a loss on the sale of the portfolio given that they ve been originated at lower rates so as rates are higher the fair value of the loans is lower against that if you were to look at the rest of the p l you ll see a benefit in net interest income because the interest rate risk of that has been transferred to the treasury department so it s geography it s is a loss on the sale of a portfolio against which there s funding breakage in nii just so that you know when we our mortgage loan with rwa at 50 versus a security at 20 with better liquidity value we did reinvest some of those proceeds in mortgage backed securities in treasury so we ll earn that back over time net to the company operator our next question is from steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hey good morning so wanted to start with just a bigger picture question on credit and the impact of normalization certainly the near term guidance sounds quite encouraging jamie you did make a comment recently at an investor conference talking about how the banking industry is over earning on credit not particularly a controversial remark but in the past you guided to a medium term loss rate blended basis of roughly 65 bps that does contemplate continued loan losses in commercial and just given that we re late cycle i was hoping you can maybe speak to your expectation for what a normalized credit loss rate is for jpmorgan given your current mix and where that might differ from your medium term loss guidance james dimon chairman and chief executive officer so we re not talking quarter over quarter we re just talking in general trends steven chubak wolfe research analyst i m talking bigger picture james dimon chairman and chief executive officer right so marianne has shown year to year what are consider normalized losses and for years we ve been doing better than that in credit card middle market large corporate mortgage has come back down to a very low number and at one point it is going to go up so i m not we re telling you what s going to happen next quarter right now it looks like it s kind of steady state but at one point we will not be surprised to see it go up i don t know if it could be second quarter or third quarter or fourth quarter and i don t know if we re late cycle we don t exactly know where we re in the cycle and so we just won t be surprised to see it go up in the number we look at it by product we don t look at it in a total as it can actually the number may vary against the total marianne lake chief financial officer no no and i think i hate to say this because i know that you don t want to wait a few weeks but we ll have a more complete conversation about kind of range of plausible outcomes on credit at investor day but when we gave our medium term simulation we said listen we did a 17 return on tangible common equity in 2019 and our medium term guidance is for 17 we ve under earned against our guidance in other parts of the cycle maybe we will over earn against it but nii and refi flags are higher and credit is benign and at some point we would expect those things to normalize but we would continue to see solid growth in all of our drivers so we don t know when it will be and actually we don t see anything that things i know you said is it second third or fourth quarter there s no indication that it s in any of those quarters but we ll have a more comprehensive discussion at investor day about range of plausible outcomes steven chubak wolfe research analyst all right looking forward to that and just one follow up for me on the ib outlook marianne i was hoping i could unpack just some of your comments around the how the ib backlog you cited that as being quite strong but just looking at the individual businesses for m a ecm dcm especially given some of the economic pressures outside the us what informs your outlook across each of those marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i would say that first of all we did see given the conditions in the fourth quarter a number of deals that got pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter particularly in ecm and dcm in m a it was a little bit more balanced for every deal that got pushed or stopped there there were more that came to take its place but as a result now as we go into the first quarter pipelines across the board are elevated relative to last year are pretty strong and at the end of the day we talked about earlier confidence is still high companies are still motivated to drive growth and so the environment should be constructive for continued m a technology healthcare the biotech innovation technology innovation momentum in ecm that we ve been benefiting from and the ipo pipeline should continue market dependent and notwithstanding december actually a sort of lower outlook for rates in the us should broadly be a tailwind for fixed income in the first quarter in the first half so the second half of the year i think is going to be determined by how things shape up over the next several months but looking into january again if the market remains generally constructive we should see tailwinds across the businesses james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and i think the intentional backlogs generally you want them high because that s good but they re all like an accordion too they come and go so that s not a forecast for the future that you d definitely get those revenues then you get delayed particularly things like ipos that you ve already seen and the other thing i d just want to point out is a shout out to the folks in the investment bank our market share went up in europe asia latin america and the united states last year that s what we really look at when we look at the business marianne lake chief financial officer 60 basis points full year approx james dimon chairman and chief executive officer 60 basis points full year and first time ever it went up in all four major markets operator our next question is from marty mosby of vining sparks marianne lake chief financial officer hi marty marty mosby vining sparks analyst good morning jamie i m glad that you mentioned that we don t know the red in of the cycle because that s kind of just assumed because of the lapse of time but not really the economic factors and then the other piece of this is when you look at losses they tend to be good until they go into recession then they re bad there s no just kind of normalization so the question about a normal rate of loss that we really have two dichotomous answers we have a good answer which is when we re expanding and the economy is stable and we have a bad answer one our recession it s kind of one or the other just wanted to see what you thought about that james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yeah you re exactly right at one point you re going to over earn and one point you re going to under earn and we try to when we look at the business we kind of try to price through that so we try to earn fair returns through the cycle and i totally agree with you we know it s going to they re going to change at one point and we try to do a better job underwriting too by the way we re not we do work hard and make sure we out underwrite other people as best we can marty mosby vining sparks analyst what s then the limits of volatility when you go into that bad period which is what you want to do you underwrite make sure you re defending against that cycle james dimon chairman and chief executive officer exactly and the other one you have is the reserves you put them up you take them down so our total reserves what 14 billion marianne lake chief financial officer yes 14 billion and a bit james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yeah but at one point they were 30 billion so we went from in the great recession we went from 7 billion to 30 billion back to 14 billion and i call it income paper marianne lake chief financial officer right james dimon chairman and chief executive officer it doesn t mean anything it s just right so when you go into that recession your losses go up any reserves have to go up and we re completely aware of that marianne lake chief financial officer although i think we could say for obvious reasons that we wouldn t expect any near term recession if there is one to look anything like it did before and even if it did given the credit quality of the portfolios performance will be not only absolutely better but we think strong on a relative basis james dimon chairman and chief executive officer so other than if you look at the consumer that 13 trillion that s outstanding other than student which is fundamentally own by the government the mortgage stuff that s been written is prime so it s back to 10 trillion but it s much better than what it was in 2007 and i think credit card i forgot the exact numbers it s much more prime than it was in 2007 i think orders are about the same but order actually outperformed in the marianne lake chief financial officer there s more prime james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yes more prime and outperformed in the great recession i think people in general has done a better job underwriting middle market and leverage stuff than it did last time so i think you don t need if you start a recession soon going into it their credit portfolio is much stronger than last time marty mosby vining sparks analyst and the follow up question to that is we talked about auto and some of those other places where you saw some of that deterioration what our models showing is that actually the discipline and the reaction time to that deterioration is much quicker than when we saw the one to four family cycle in the last time where you saw deterioration but growth just kept going we ve had so many banks jump in and say look we ve already pulled back on auto lending or we pulled back on multi family there s already been places where you ve seen that discipline so that discipline in itself puts a governor on economic growth which is why we re having less growth or slower growth but yet it also creates a like you said a stronger portfolio for that eventual downturn james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and i agree with you the lack of discipline we see is in student and a little bit in small commercial real estate operator our next question is from i m sorry marianne lake chief financial officer no keep going operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning marianne marianne lake chief financial officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst can you guys there s been a lot of talk about leveraged loans and how this time around everything seems to be underwritten better are there any tangible statistics that you can share with us or maybe on investor day you might to show us that yes the leveraged loan portfolio for you guys in particular is much healthier than maybe 2006 2007 and then second on this leveraged loan issue outside the banking industry what are some of the indirect hits that you and maybe some of your peers may experience none from the direct hit of a leveraged loan but for some of the craziness that s going on outside the banking industry james dimon chairman and chief executive officer so can i just give the big picture i think 1 7 trillion of leveraged loans ok so term a is about half of that these are very rough numbers ok most of which were banks and obviously safer than term b a big chunk over i think 60 or 70 of the term b is with non banks and so if you look at the banking system if you look at the leveraged lending rich book in 2007 it was over 400 billion today it s a number like 80 billion in 2007 there were commitments in no flex almost everyone has plenty of flex now so when you look at covenants there is kind of covenants but there s flex and there is a whole bunch of other stuff in there so it is far far far sounded today even these clos you look to underwrite the two clos they are far better underwritten with more equity more sub debt more mezzanine stuff like that and now go to the shadow banks they do things slightly differently a lot of those folks are they re quite bright they kind of know what they re doing someone s going to get hurt there and the issue there in the next recession isn t going to be what the loss and remember most of the major banks don t fund a lot of that we aren t taking huge indirect exposure to that by funding some of the non banks and i think the issue there is for the marketplace is going to be when you have a real recession the lender will not be there so lot of these borrowers will be stranded and so that and that s not that s an opportunity or a risk or something like that but it s not i wouldn t put it in the systemic category gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst and do you think that james dimon chairman and chief executive officer by the way again if you go back to 2007 it emerged in 2007 there was 1 trillion of bad mortgages that were kind of all over the place the clos sibs there are no sibs the clos are much smaller the leveraged lending book is a much smaller book capital liquidity is much higher so it is nothing like 2007 you will have a recession it just won t be like you had last time affecting the banking system it will affect the banking system we are little bit canaries in the coal mine we are not immune to what goes on in the economy but it won t be anything like you saw last time for most of the larger banks gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst no i would agree with that and do you think janet yellen and other federal reserve officials comments about leveraged lending is more directed to the exposure outside of the banking industry than inside the banking industry james dimon chairman and chief executive officer yes i do marianne lake chief financial officer yes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and again i don t think they were saying it s huge and systemic they re saying it s something they should keep an eye on and i think that the regulatory do keep an eye on that gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst right and then just a pivot on a deposit question obviously non interest bearing deposits are tough to keep as rates are going higher can you guys give us some color on the non interest bearing deposits there was obviously a small decline what parts of the business you re seeing that and the fed s unwind of its balance sheet how much of an impact do you think that might be having on the non interest bearing deposits marianne lake chief financial officer so the migration into product from non interest to interest bearing is predominantly or largely exclusively a wholesale thing at this point there is not enough rate benefit in the interest bearing savings to drive into product migration definitely some growth outlook in cds given pricing but it s wholesale right now and it s mainly rate related and not balance sheet related in terms of the fed unwind james dimon chairman and chief executive officer can i just make a comment about interest rates and the balance sheet of fed so the interest rate is one thing but the balance sheet of fed obviously is causing changes in the flow of funds it s causing changes in the banks now have options other than reserves at the central bank because the two year and three year bond yields for corporate government bond is much higher some people are preferring to own that because they think they d be paid better than corporate risk so changing the whole bunch of fund flows which concerns people but i d say it s part and process of normalization marianne lake chief financial officer yes operator our next question is from ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin analyst hi thanks marianne lake chief financial officer hi ken ken usdin analyst hi good morning there were couple of fed or regulatory documents out in late december one is codifying the three year burning of stated cecl impacts and then another one where they are pushing out till 2022 on their own implementation of cecl accounting in the supervisory stress test i was just wondering just any takeaways you had from reading that and any hopes you might have for just as we get toward some finalization of which way cecl goes and how it looks aspirations around that and how that interacts with ccar and such james dimon chairman and chief executive officer before marianne answers that question i just want to do a shout out to jefferies because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year ken usdin analyst i ll pass that along jamie marianne lake chief financial officer and following that it s hard to follow i would say that we ve been pretty clear about the fact that our biggest concern around cecl was like properly understanding not just for us but regulators to properly understand the implications for capital not only in benign but in stressed scenarios and what the implications of the outcome that it could have on the willingness of people to extend credit particularly as cycles age and with the outlook for volatilities to increase so having a transition is obviously helpful you should imagine that we would likely avail ourselves of that opportunity that is what it is for me the question that needs to be clarified is if we are to include the impact of cecl in company run stress test but the federal reserve is not going to include it in the stress test we need to kind of understand the insight between those two things particularly if that might coincide with a turn in the cycle in actual fact so i think we re looking for continued clarity from the regulators about what exactly that means if we re embedding these assumptions into our stress tests and our results sooner than they are how do we think about the implications of that on our distribution plans and capital outlooks and importantly if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans i do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics conceptually don t change that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential volatility and we should worry about that james dimon chairman and chief executive officer and it ll be a big number for like credit card so if you put on 3 now on when you build the loan book by 100 the number would be 6 some number in the future will be much higher so i do think particularly smaller banks will react fairly dramatically on how they run their loan books to do that marianne lake chief financial officer so our view is that more on that just needs to be done in the industry about what this looks like i hope that what was meant by we should include it in company run stress test is for us to collectively learn and for the regulators to have the time to respond to that but remember 2022 considering all the discussion we ve had on this call about the cycle how long the cycle is when there s a turn in the cycle i mean we could actually face a stress before that and so it s great that they are waiting a bit but it might all be a bit of an academic point depending on what happens actually ken usdin analyst yeah that s a fair point and jamie you ve also said in the past that you guys lend on accounting right don t lend on accounting and lend on economic right but there s this kind of challenge to that that marianne just mentioned about the unintended consequences and so it would be interesting to see that if there is in fact a point where banks don t lean in as you just mentioned marianne marianne lake chief financial officer yes james dimon chairman and chief executive officer they will change marianne lake chief financial officer yes and we have the luxury or the flexibility of being able to say that we can continue to lend based upon the underlying economics but someone who has a differently situated balance sheet and return profile may not be able to do that ken usdin analyst okay thanks for the color operator our next question is from mike mayo of wells fargo securities marianne lake chief financial officer hey mike mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi a follow up on the net interest margin two sides to the question one is commercial loan pricing i guess it s been kind of brutal you ve had the bdcs private equity firms loan funds all competing has there been any let up with some of the dislocation the capital markets late in the year and the other side retail deposit betas marianne you thought they would get a lot worse i don t think it s been as bad as you thought what was your retail deposit beta and what do you still expect james dimon chairman and chief executive officer before marianne answers that can i just go back to the cyclical stuff one of the issue it s not just cecl a lot of things that have been built and since the crisis were really good but there was more pro cyclicality built into it and so you re going to see the next downturn that we have a far more pro cyclical accounting liquidity and rules capital rules and stuff like that which we don t know the full effect of that but if i was a regulator i d be very cautious about constantly building pro cyclicality into the system and i gave you the example is our loan loss is going from 7 billion to 30 billion or whatever they went to back to 14 billion it will affect how people respond to in the downturns and it will cause people to pullback much quicker than maybe in the past in total marianne lake chief financial officer okay so just on your question so corporate loan spreads i would say we did see sort of pretty brutal grinding down in corporate loan spreads but over the last actually couple of quarters we saw them find a bit of an equilibrium and stabilize at levels so while i would say it s still true to say that there is a lot of competition at least in the space in which we re operating we re seeing spreads at relatively stable levels in the corporate space and honestly i don t remember saying that i thought we would see an acceleration that was dramatic in retail betas in the short term i mean obviously at some point when we have this level of rates and the spread between market rates and rates paid get to a certain level and if normalization continues we would expect to see reprice lags sort of catch up but we have not seen that yet outside of cds in retail space right now mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and the way you calculate it what was your retail deposit beta this quarter and how does that compare to the past marianne lake chief financial officer so in checking and savings and lead savings it s nothing in cds it s something but around to a very small number mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you marianne lake chief financial officer thanks mike operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you just a quick follow up marianne have your investment bankers on the front lines passed on any concerns about the government shutdown there s been reports that the sec is not open and is that slowing down the investment banking business and your thoughts on that please marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i would say that we ve been we benefited from the fact that year end and into the early part of january and holiday season have a light calendar typically in january for ipos in particular but for sure if we don t see the ability to get approvals from sec on ipos and to a lesser extent some of the m a deals that need approvals from government agencies it will be problematic in the ability to see those activity levels play out and fees be realized so it s one of many things that would behoove us to end this sooner rather than later gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you operator and we have no further questions at this time marianne lake chief financial officer thanks very much james dimon chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect duration

photo by for decades neoliberal globalisation has been one of the left s foremost targets the international monetary fund the world bank and the world trade organisation are regularly denounced as enthusiastic proponents of the washington consensus which champions free trade financial liberalisation tax cuts and privatisation around the world historically many socialists have viewed the european union as an ally of such institutions the canadian economists sam gindin and leo panitch for instance regard the eu project as part of the continuing integration of european and american capitalism in the 1975 referendum on uk membership of the european economic community jeremy corbyn and his mentor tony benn opposed the eec as an obstacle to the socialist transformation of the uk and yet in recent years many self described progressives have come to view the eu as a benign force in global affairs the brexit referendum reopened a long dormant question whose side is the eu really on from one perspective friedrich hayek the intellectual godfather of neoliberal economics heavily influenced the creation of what became the european single market with its cardinal commitment to the free movement of goods services labour and capital the eu s trade policy is also rooted in free market principles although the protectionist common agricultural policy has had a disastrous effect on farmers in the global south by dumping artificially cheap produce in their markets in spite of this many of the most fervent brexiteers such as the conservative mep daniel hannan are also unashamed neoliberals and the eu s commitment to protecting the environment promoting workers rights and tackling tax avoidance has led many on the left to argue that it is one of the strongest challengers to

communications thank you close what the prevalence of euroscepticism on both the socialist left and the neoliberal right shows above all is that the eu s institutions act to reinforce the status quo in the era before the 2008 financial crisis many regarded this as a virtue capitalism francis fukuyama and others argued had unambiguously triumphed in the battle of ideas the eu s role was to constrain the worst excesses of the free market benevolent european social democracy contrasted with its extractive anglo american cousin was seen as the future of progressive politics yet history was far from over the financial crisis exposed the so called great moderation the era of consistent economic growth and low inflation as little more than a speculative bubble and reopened the terrain of ideological debate in the context of austerity wage stagnation and the end of asset price inflation socialist transformation is once again a genuine possibility europe s social democratic model is under threat as vacillating centre left parties fail to adapt to the realities of the post crash era opening the way for the rise of the far right today the radical left in the uk the us and france is calling not for social democracy but for democratic socialism for me the former means the taxation and regulation of private enterprise while the latter means the democratic ownership of most large corporations and financial institutions in other words the former entails a compromise between capital and labour while the latter entails a confrontation there is no doubt where the loyalties of the european commission and council the two executive bodies of the eu would lie in such a confrontation european politicians and bureaucrats would side with capital just as they did when the french socialist president françois mitterrand was forced to retreat from his interventionist economic programme by the bond markets in 1983 there are many legitimate questions about how a left wing exit lexit from the eu would take place whether the labour party could maintain sufficient domestic support and whether withdrawal would further aid the far right but the essence of the case for lexit is that it is not possible to implement socialism without a confrontation with capital and its representatives in institutions such as the eu far from advocating socialism in one country then lexit supporters aspire to construct an alternative international order related

percent had a fixed interest rate this compares to cash and debt levels equal to 150 million and 2 364 million respectively in the third quarter of 2018 cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was 146 million compared to 70 million for the same period in 2017 reflecting the increased profitability of the business and improved working capital management capital expenditures were 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 19 million in the same period last year financial guidance for fiscal year 2019 the company anticipates adjusted eps of 3 15 to 3 45 and adjusted ebitda of 465 to 485 million full year organic revenue growth is expected to be 3 to 5 percent compared with 2018 with net revenue growth of approximately 1 to 2 percent including an estimated unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 2 to 3 percent the company s core tax rate excluding the impact of discrete items is expected to be between 26 and 29 percent h b fuller expects to invest approximately 100 million in capital items in 2019 in 2019 we will focus on driving solid organic revenue growth and margin improvement achieving our committed cost and revenue synergies and delivering 200 million of debt repayment engineering adhesives will continue to grow into a larger and more profitable part of our business in 2019 and going forward owens said in terms of guidance sensitivity we are projecting a continued strong us dollar and china weakness along with relatively neutral raw material prices outside of china in 2019 raw material demand and prices are currently declining in china and that trend may expand to the rest of the world if tariff and trade disputes persist if raw material demand and prices start to decline in the rest of the world our second half 2019 margins could be favorably impacted resulting in eps and ebitda above the midpoint of our guidance range owens continued we estimate that currency fluctuations and china impacted our 2019 guidance by approximately 40 million versus our original long term forecast adjusting for these factors our underlying ebitda growth rates in 2018 and 2019 are in line with our original forecast of about 10 to 12 percent and we anticipate annual ebitda growth in this range through 2020 these factors impact the time to achieve our 600 million ebitda target by about a year we remain on track to meet or exceed our commitment of 600 million in debt paydown by the end of 2020 as a result of strong profit performance high cash flow conversion rates and our focused capital management programs this guidance excludes approximately 15 to 20 million of pre tax expenses required to integrate the royal business and other businesses acquired in 2017 and between 6 and 8 million of pre tax expenses

via zerohedge it is natural that we measure things by a familiar yardstick the problem is that being so biased or lazy we can be deceived take gold popular belief has it that gold prices have not performed especially well despite some egregious geopolitical and economic factors well measured in 72 currencies gold is at or within a few percentage points of being at an all time high for people in those countries not on the list are the british pound the swiss franc the euro and chinese yuan but we are not far off in all of those currencies too only in usd does gold lag and not all of us live in the us using the dollar gold price as most of us do has disguised what is actually quite a powerful bull market if my memory serves me right we saw the same phenomenon a stealth rally in minor currencies ahead of the last major gold bull run in dollars in the late 1990 s arguably this may be a very good leading indicator faulty yardsticks also takes us onto wealth management measuring our net worth in local currencies we might be rather pleased with ourselves smug even however we chose to ignore the fact that the yardstick is not a constant it is shrinking and sometimes really quite fast it s the natural corrosive effect of inflation knowing this governments give us a gauge for yardstick shrinkage to use such as rpi or cpi to reassure you that the shrinkage is minimal and then lie about it there are alternatives in the us the chapwood index is highly regarded as it reflects the true cost of living increase plainly and simply the index shows that incomes can t keep up with expenses and it explains why people increasingly have to turn to the government for entitlements to bail them out the basis of the index is fullly open to scrutiny and if correct suggests americans have been losing roughly 10 of their wealth each year since 2014 half of it gone this compares with the official government figure of 1 9 ronald reagan called inflation the thief in the night and it is built for times just as this it gives the appearance of being wealthy maintaining high nominal values while eroding your actual position which manifests itself in far higher costs on the other side we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us interestingly gold has seen an average year on year gain of about 10 compounded since 2000 off setting those real losses which reaffirms in our mind that it continues as a reliable yardstick against which to measure costs or indeed wealth in short gold has maintained what economists call purchasing power parity for millenia so not only is it an excellent yardstick its actually quite a useful thing to own especially if you fear wealth erosion if you haven t already read this you must see jastram s golden constant many crises invariably start with stealth inflation and then follows currency weakness so gold gets expensive and then it blows out significantly higher in your local currency then you realise that the lifeboat has sailed the choo choo train has left the station for the unprotected your backstop plan to protect your wealth by buying gold when i need it has just failed you are now trapped with a dissolving currency and every financial escape route looks too expensive and so it goes ask anyone in one of those 72 countries see below where gold is starting to look expensive in short insurance is best bought before you think you need it boring but true __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ross norman sharps pixley london

officer thanks jason and good morning everyone thank you for joining us i have a few prepared remarks before our cfo mark mccollom shares the details of our financial performance and discusses our 2019 outlook when he concludes we will open the phone line for questions overall it was another solid year for our company as we hit a record level of net income our net income surpassed 200 million for the first time in our history our financial results in 2018 reflected continued progress in executing our growth strategies and the benefit of multiple interest rate increases by the federal reserve our average loan portfolio increased 3 8 year over year which was in line with our 2018 outlook and was driven by growth in most of our loan portfolios and spread across our footprint average commercial loan growth lag to average consumer and mortgage loan growth year over year our commercial loan growth was impacted by higher prepayments lower line utilization and slowing originations as the learning environment remained extremely competitive throughout 2018 however loan growth accelerated toward the end of the fourth quarter and as a result period end loan balances increased 241 million linked quarter we continue to grow in philadelphia and baltimore both markets have a team of commercial and consumer lenders serving the markets to help us take advantage of what we view as tremendous long term growth opportunities in philadelphia we opened a mortgage loan production office in may of 2018 and have plans to open another lpo in camden new jersey later this year we opened a full service branch in the beginning of january and have two more targeted to open by the end of the first quarter in baltimore we opened a mortgage loan production office in january and have plans to open full service branch offices in 2019 and beyond moving to credit overall asset quality continues to be relatively stable despite an uptick in non performing loans provision for credit losses and net charge offs we had a large commercial relationship moved to non performing during the quarter excluding this relationship non performing loans would have declined linked quarter the provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was driven primarily by this one relationship and to a lesser extent by growth in the loan portfolio the increase in net charge offs was related to a handful of credits in unrelated industries as we ve mentioned in the past we are mindful of where we are in the economic cycle and are continuing to assess and analyze the loan portfolio for signs of weakness or stress we believe the uptick in these credit metrics this quarter is not suggested by a broader portfolio or macro trends turning to fees excluding a litigation settlement and security gains in 2017 non interest income increased by less than 1 year over year and was consistent with our revised 2018 outlook that we provided in the second quarter of 2018 our commercial loan interest rate swap and sba businesses were the biggest drivers of slowing growth in non interest income our commercial loan interest rate swap business tends to track with commercial originations which were down year over year in addition evolving consumer behaviors and preferences continue to put pressure on non interest income particularly overdraft fees on a positive note our investment management and trust services income grew at a nice pace year over year due to both overall market performance and our continued asset gathering focus brokerage revenue grew 8 year over year and continues to be one of our fastest growing segments in the business recently we had the opportunity to broaden our reach to serve additional clients in central pennsylvania by purchasing a wealth management business located in altoona pennsylvania adding approximately 250 million of assets under management and administration to our brokerage platform we continue to work at organic and inorganic opportunities to grow our investment management and trust business we saw notable increases in debit and credit card income also merchant fees which reflected continued customer growth and usage non interest expenses increased 3 9 year over year it was slightly higher than our 2018 outlook excluding amortization of a tax credit investment in the fourth quarter of 2018 our non interest expenses increased 3 year over year which was in line with our 2018 outlook our efficiency ratio improved year over year the efficiency ratio for 2018 was 63 8 within our goal of 60 to 65 and it reached its lowest level since 2013 expense management is a top priority and we continually look for ways to make our organization more efficient while continuing to invest in our company to support a larger organization that can benefit from economies of scale opportunities exist to become more efficient as we continue to optimize our delivery channels upgrade our origination and servicing platforms consolidate our bank charters and access our bsa aml orders since 2012 we ve consolidated 33 branches or approximately 12 of our branch network and we have plans to consolidate eight more branches by the end of the first quarter we incurred approximately 930 000 of expenses in the fourth quarter related to these planned branch consolidations we believe there will be more opportunities to optimize our branch network over time as we continue to react to changing customer preferences and behaviors strategically the deployment of capital for the enhancement of long term shareholder value remains one of our highest priorities in 2018 we increased our quarterly common dividend by 0 01 to 0 12 paid a 0 04 special dividend in the fourth quarter to date we ve repurchased approximately 100 million of common stock in all we distributed nearly 90 of our net income to shareholders in 2018 we have approximately 5 million left in our current share repurchase program which is authorized through december 31 2019 on the corporate front we had several milestones during the year first as you saw in our 8 k filing last night i m happy to announce that the bsa aml consent orders issued to our subsidiary bank at maryland were terminated this follows the terminations in 2017 and 2018 of the consent orders issued to four of our other subsidiary banks with respect to the remaining bsa aml consent order we are confident that we are progressing toward achieving a similar resolution once that order is terminated we can fully pursue our strategic priority of consolidating our subsidiary banks into our flagship bank fulton bank second toward that end in october of last year we consolidated our subsidiary banks fnb bank and swineford national bank into our largest banking subsidiary fulton bank that consolidation went well and we are finalizing plans for the consolidation of the remaining subsidiary banks into fulton bank and now i d like to turn the call over to mark to discuss our financial results in more detail mark mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks phil and good morning to everyone on the call and unless i note otherwise the quarterly comparisons i will discuss are with the third quarter 2018 and annual comparisons are with 2017 starting on slide six earnings per diluted share this quarter were 0 33 or net income of 58 1 million fourth quarter earnings in comparison to the third quarter reflect an increase in net interest income and a decrease in income taxes however this positive comparison was more than offset by the impact of a higher provision for credit losses lower non interest income and higher non interest expense and we ll step through each of these components in a moment moving to slide seven our net interest income in the fourth quarter improved by 2 8 million or 2 linked quarter driven by a 2 basis point expansion in our net interest margin to 3 44 and a 230 million or 1 increase in our average interest earning assets in the fourth quarter our interest earning asset yields grew 9 basis points principally driven by 10 basis point increase in average loan yields on the funding side deposit cost increased 9 basis points but short and long term borrowing costs remained fairly stable our overall cost of funds increased 8 basis points which was slightly lower than the yield increase on average interest earning assets the 25 basis point fed funds rate increases in each quarter of 2018 coupled with the increases we ve seen in our interest bearing deposit rates have resulted in a year to date deposit beta of approximately 28 this is slightly higher than the 25 year to date deposit beta through september 30th but it s still in line with our previous expectations we anticipate that our net interest margin in the first quarter of 2019 should follow the macro themes of the last few quarters and that we ll benefit from the december fed funds rate increase but we also expect to see rising deposit betas our balance sheet remains asset sensitive as 43 or approximately 6 9 million 6 9 billion of our own portfolio is variable 35 is adjustable and 22 is fixed rate of our loans that are either variable or adjustable the two most relevant indices are prime and one month libor which account for 33 and 30 of our total loan portfolio respectively the 2 basis point increase in our net interest margin from last quarter was within the range we provided in our updated outlook during the third quarter of 2018 average loans increased linked quarter by 103 million or 0 7 while ending loans increased at a faster rate 241 million linked quarter or 1 5 average deposits grew 446 million or 2 8 linked quarter this increase was seen principally in money market accounts for both consumer and commercial customers for the year our net interest income increased 55 million or 9 6 from 2017 driven by a 3 4 increase in average interest earning assets and a 12 basis point increase in our net interest margin yields on earning assets increased 29 basis points while our costs of funds increased at a lower rate of 18 basis points the increase in interest earning asset yields was realized principally in loans we saw a 31 basis point increase the increase in cost of funds was driven primarily by our deposits turning to credit on slide eight in 2018 the provision for credit losses increased 23 6 million from 2017 this increase included a 36 8 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2018 related to a customer fraud excluding this our provision for credit losses would have decreased 13 2 million from 2017 reflecting relatively stable credit conditions and this year over year decrease is inclusive of our higher provision for credit losses that we saw in the fourth quarter of this year for the fourth quarter our provision for credit losses did increase at a higher rate than previous periods to 8 2 million primarily driven by one commercial relationship that has shown signs of weakness and was placed on non accrual status despite remaining current in its payments as of year end net charge offs for the year as a percent of average loans were 34 basis points compared to 12 basis points in 2017 adjusting for a 33 9 million charge off related to the customer fraud net charge offs for the year would have been 12 basis points unchanged from 2017 for the quarter net charge offs on an annualized basis were 17 basis points as compared to 8 basis points in the third quarter of 2018 with the increase attributable to a handful of credits and i believe it was 5 in unrelated industries non performing loans at december 31 2018 increased 4 9 million or 3 7 in comparison to year end 2017 non performing loans as a percentage of the total loans increased slightly to 86 basis points as compared to 85 basis points at the end of last year in comparison to the third quarter non performing loans increased 19 6 million attributable to the aforementioned commercial relationship excluding this one relationship remaining of our non performing loans declined approximately 15 million linked quarter the allowance for credit losses to loans at december 31 2018 was 1 05 a 7 basis point decrease from 2017 and unchanged from the third quarter of 2018 the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio as a percent of non performing loans decreased to 121 at year end 2018 as compared to 131 in year end 2017 and 140 at the end of the third quarter moving to slide nine non interest income excluding securities gains decreased 1 5 million or 3 in comparison to the third quarter of 2018 this decrease resulted mainly from lower commercial loan interest rate swap fees and lower merchant fee income for the year non interest income excluding securities gains decreased 3 4 million from 2017 in part because 2017 non interest income included a 5 1 million gain from a favorable settlement of litigation matter during 2018 our investment management and trust services income grew 2 9 million or 6 merchant fee revenues increased 1 6 million or 9 and credit card income increased approximately 1 million or 8 these increases were partially offset by lower commercial loan interest rate swap fees sba gains and overdraft fees mortgage banking income was down 900 000 year over year mainly due to a gain recognized in 2017 upon a reversal of a mortgage servicing rights allowance of 1 3 million mortgage sale gains were flat as the 14 increase in volumes during 2018 was offset by lower spreads on gain on sale moving to slide 10 our non interest expenses increased 5 3 million in the fourth quarter included in this our expenses were inflated by 4 9 million of tax credit investment amortization for a certain investment which generated a corresponding income tax benefit during the quarter adjusting for this item our operating expenses increased only 372 000 linked quarter the other expense category increased 2 4 million linked quarter due to costs associated with brands consolidation expected to occur in the first quarter of 2019 which phil mentioned earlier as well as higher other real estate owned expenses this increase was largely offset by our 1 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses driven by lower incentive compensation expense for the year non interest expense increased 20 5 million or 3 9 excluding the aforementioned tax credit investment amortization non interest expenses were up 15 6 million or 3 salaries and benefits expense was most of this year over year increase increasing by 13 1 million we also absorbed 3 6 million of charter consolidation costs during the year as we continue to simplify our franchise and unify our brand income tax expense decreased 3 million linked quarter due to the tax credits associated with the aforementioned tax credit investment and lower pre tax income absent this tax credit realization in the fourth quarter our effective tax rate would have been 14 6 just slightly above our guidance range for the year income tax expense decreased 38 1 million mainly due to our federal tax reform which lowered the statutory federal income tax rate slide 11 displays our profitability and capital levels over the past four years we continue to see increases in both our returns on average assets and returns on tangible equity over the periods presented as phil mentioned to date we have repurchased approximately 100 million of our common stock completing the existing 50 million repurchase plan which had 31 5 million remaining at the beginning of the quarter we have also repurchased 70 million under our new 75 million plan which was approved during the fourth quarter a total of 6 4 million shares have been repurchased at an average cost of approximately 15 88 per share as a result of these share repurchases our tangible common equity ratio decreased from 8 83 at september to 8 52 at year end we remain well capitalized with significant capital cushions to both regulatory guidelines and on more stringent internal thresholds lastly we would like to provide our initial guidance for 2019 which is shown on page 12 we are expecting average annual loan and deposit growth rates to be in the low to mid single digit range we expect our net interest income to increase year over year in a mid to high single digit range we expect our net interest margin to grow 0 to 3 basis points per quarter during 2019 our margin is influenced by number of factors including our loan and deposit mix loan and deposit betas and overall interest rate levels we expect our non interest income to increase year over year in a low to mid single digit range excluding all remaining charter consolidation costs we expect our non interest expense to increase year over year in a low single digit range our provision for credit losses will reflect changes in the asset quality measures as well as the pace of long growth and economic factors among other factors given this inherent volatility we would expect our provision for credit losses in 2019 to be between 3 million and 8 million per quarter we expect our effective tax rate to be between 13 and 16 our capital level should remain consistent with december 31 2018 and our capital will be utilized to support growth and to provide appropriate returns to our shareholders and with that i ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions sydney go ahead questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from austin nicholas from stephens inc you may proceed with your question austin nicholas stephens inc analyst hey guys philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer good morning austin mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning austin austin nicholas stephens inc analyst good morning guys could you maybe talk about what kind of assumptions for fed rate hike moves are embedded in that 0 to 3 basis points a quarter guide and maybe what drives you to the high end versus the low end there philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure good morning austin it s in our assumptions we assume an increase in june and we assume one in december of 2019 the one in december of 2019 obviously has very little impact on 2019 the one in june we actually ran our forecast internally with and without it and if we assume 0 rate increases it would impact our internal forecast by about 2 basis points so said another way whether we see these rate increases or not we think we re still comfortable with the guidance of 0 to 3 basis points per quarter austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay that s very helpful and then maybe just on the expense guidance i guess does that include the i guess the cost saves from the eight branches that are expected to close this quarter and then additionally is that excluding the tax credit amortization expense or is that including that number philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer no it includes the tax credit amortization the tax credits that occurred this quarter a lot of our tax credits are either low income housing tax credits or they re new markets tax credits which are amortized when you get that benefit and the amortization is over multiple years the credit we realized in the fourth quarter is an energy credit where it s a one time credit and a one time expense so going forward what you should expect to see next year as us getting back a little bit below even what the current run rate is expect about 1 3 million to 1 4 million per quarter in 2019 in that tax credit amortization that number is included in that expense guidance that we give and also included an added expense guidance is we generated this year between the third and the fourth quarter about 1 3 million of cost related to a branch closer that happened well we closed two in the fourth quarter eight coming here in the first quarter there s going to be some additional costs on that in next year which are in our expense guidance but then there s also going to be savings related to that and the earn back on those branch closures in terms of the one time cost versus the savings less than one year that s about 10 months for the earn back austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay and then maybe just one last one i think that you spoke about the kind of the provisioning for that specific credit this quarter and i believe it was in the agribusiness kind of vertical i guess could you maybe speak about that overall the overall agriculture portfolio and how you are thinking it i think in past quarters it s been brought up as stressed but that delinquencies have more or less stabilized to kind of declined and if i look at your c i or your commercial delinquencies they continue to come down so maybe any commentary on your comfort of that on that portfolio outside of the kind of downgrade that you saw this quarter philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we think it s still stabilizing you exclude discredit and delinquencies in our ag portfolio actually would have been down for the quarter and so i think we continue to watch it closely but are pretty comfortable with it austin nicholas stephens inc analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our following question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is now open chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst hey good morning philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer hi chris chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst question on the buyback the slide deck suggested capital levels at the levels through the next year you ve got a sub of about 5 million left is it fair to assume that you re not looking to come back to the buyback given where stocks are trading or could you be fairly aggressive in the fourth quarter i m just trying to get a sense of whether the expectation is that you ll go back to the board and ask for more or is this kind of it for now philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so chris we talk with our board every quarter about the uses of capital and you know it s possible that we could put another plan in place as we go through the year i think a lot will depend on our growth than other opportunities that we might see chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst and then on the kind of alternative uses so you ve got another one of that might use lifted can you speak to kind of desire to do a deal in 2019 your stock has held up on a relative basis a little bit better than peers and just kind of interested if deals would be kind of climbing the ranks of priority for 19 philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer well we still have orders against the holding company in our subsidiary bank lafayette ambassador so until they go away our deals still aren t possible but if the right strategic deal came along after those were lifted and it would work from a financial standpoint we would have interest chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay great and then maybe a last one if i could on credit your understanding in the second quarter was kind of an idiosyncratic event and this quarter you had the inflow and i m wondering why it seems like you ve set a reasonably high bar for yourself for 2019 on the provision and just given the concerns that are kind of permeating in the market from a credit economy wondering wondering why it seems to be a little bit of an aggressive guide on the provision maybe you could speak to your confidence in what you re seeing that we may not be able to see from the outside thanks philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so overall our we do not see softening in our overall portfolio and this past quarter even with that one large credit we were would have been very close to this guidance so we have confidence that the range that we gave should hold up for now anyway chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay thanks a lot i appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from joe gladue from merion capital group your line is open joe gladue merion capital group analyst good morning philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer hi joe mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer hi joe joe gladue merion capital group analyst let me just follow up on one of the earlier questions on the interest rate expectations you talked about the what you re expecting toward rate hikes but i was just wondering what your thoughts are on the slope of the yield curve and how that might be affecting your investment portfolio strategy and such philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah i wouldn t say it s having a lot of impact on our investment portfolio strategy we have i mean our investment portfolio july s cash flow is around 23 million to 25 million a month and i mean we continue our investment portfolio is not used for earnings i mean our investment portfolio is there for liquidity and so with the size of that portfolio i would say that we re going to continue to buy relatively conservative mortgage backs and the cmos and occasional municipal investments as we have in the past and but we re also have paid our a pretty wide inflection point there where we see the yield on investments sort of rolling off versus the investments that we are buying on i mean there is obviously a significant yield pickup on that joe gladue merion capital group analyst okay and just wondering i guess you did mention earlier in the prepared remarks about the higher prepayments just wondering if you could quantify that a little bit what you saw in the fourth quarter that you can technical difficulty philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure we had highlighted each of the past in the second quarter and third quarter where we had emphasized that our prepayments specifically in our commercial business we re about a 100 million higher in 2q and 3q relative to what we saw on the first quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter the numbers were 80 million higher than what we saw in the second and third quarter so you take from the beginning of the year to now our prepayments have actually increased in the commercial space by 160 million now when you then look at our overall growth we had in the fourth quarter what it means is that we had a solid really solid quarter relative to the last three linked quarters for commercial originations but we continue to see very high prepayment activity amortization in just kind of normal loan book that s relatively flat that s somewhere in the 650 million per quarter range but the prepayments have accelerated joe gladue merion capital group analyst all right thank you that s it for me operator thank you our following question comes from russell gunther with davidson your line is now open russell gunther d a davidson analyst hey good morning guys philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer hi russell russell gunther d a davidson analyst i wanted to follow up on some of the expense comments earlier you made the remark that you had about 3 6 million in charter consolidation expense recognized in 2018 do you guys have a sense for what that could look like as you look ahead to 2019 philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah we do and i believe we even said maybe on the last call we have said that we expected to be somewhere in the range of 2 million to 3 million per quarter and the timing of that is likely going to be heavier in the second and third quarter of next year we would hope by the time we re into the fourth quarter of next year we should see those charter consolidation costs behind us russell gunther d a davidson analyst okay i appreciate that mark and then you had also said earlier that as part of some of the efficiency initiatives you would see you mentioned the consolidation of the bank charters and kind of exiting the bsa aml orders so how should we think about what would fall to the bottom line between incremental charter consolidation expense and then some of those efficiencies you had talked about earlier mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we have again we continue to look at a whole bunch of different ways to make ourselves more efficient obviously we just announced between two this quarter and eight in the first quarter 10 store closings but we re also announcing that in the selected markets where we see good market opportunities growing branches as well so on a net basis you ll continue to see us shrink in markets that aren t as desirable or where we have too many branches for changing customer preferences but you re going to see us open branches in markets where we see a market opportunity as we ve mentioned in prior calls much of the consolidation in our company despite running a separate bank charters we ve had a largely consolidated back office for some time and while we see there have been still be some incremental savings as we get further past the charter consolidations and the bsa orders we re not quantifying that as a hard dollar number at this time i think but certainly the expectation is for a long term positive operating leverage and with that we are really pleased with where we brought our efficiency ratio to for both this year and for the fourth quarter but we re certainly aiming for further improvements in that going forward russell gunther d a davidson analyst okay i appreciate that and then a last one for me was just on circling back to the agribusiness credit is there any kind of further detail you could share on the specific credit why that would why even with that you still feel ok with the rest of the portfolio and then should the current government shutdown kind of continue to carry on for a longer period of time does that potentially change your view or add any risk in that portfolio mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer so i don t think we want to provide any more specifics in regard to the one credit but overall on the ag portfolio we spend a lot of time analyzing it looking for trends and it s definitely stabilized in any trend that we see in that portfolio is positive as compared to a negative the shutdown on the government has had impact on for us with our sba lending and it has some impact in the mortgage area but to date we have not seen any impact in the agricultural portfolio russell gunther d a davidson analyst okay thank you so i mean sorry to sneak one more in here please on the loan growth outlook the low to mid single digits on average how do you expect that kind of mix to look should we expect sort of similar drivers to 2018 or as you look out this year any particular loan buckets showing more strength than others mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think you are going to see the same type of growth rates on the consumer side and then i would say on the commercial side we don t have quite as much confidence and exactly what s going to happen so if that strengthens a little i think we ll be more to the high end of the guidance and if it doesn t we ll be more in the middle to the low end russell gunther d a davidson analyst okay thanks very much guys operator thank you our next question comes from matt schultheis with boenning your line is now open matthew schultheis boenning scattergood inc analyst hi good morning philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer good morning mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning matt matthew schultheis boenning scattergood inc analyst so just a quick follow up to russell s question regarding the government shutdown aside from ag or sba have you seen any customer request particularly on the retail side regarding delinquency or any sort of reach out from the mortgage borrowers in maryland or virginia to sort of work with them as they are furloughed or any increase in early stage delinquencies philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so we put a program in place for any of our customers that are impacted by the shutdown so we do have a on our credit card we ve worked with our provider there and we have card specials at 0 for a period of months we will offer a unsecured line of credit at 0 for up to three months we re going to allow deferment of payments on consumer loans and we re offering some relief on the overdraft protection to date we have not seen any weakness and have had have not had a lot of inquiries into those programs matthew schultheis boenning scattergood inc analyst okay thanks for that and just i know you don t want to give a lot of detail on this particular credit so i understand that you may not answer this but i m obligated to ask was there a did this sort of come to the surface through any change to your policies and procedures regarding loan review following the fraud or was this something more borrower specific mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer no it was borrower specific and it s been a credit that we ve been watching for some time matthew schultheis boenning scattergood inc analyst okay thank you for your time today operator thank you our following question comes from matthew breese with piper jaffray your line is now open matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst good morning everybody philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer good morning mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst just to follow that thread there just curious what was the total size of the relationship that went sideways this quarter how long have you had that relationship and was the nature what was the nature of the agribusiness was it poultry or dairy or other philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer well we re not going to get into any more specifics in regards to the credit for confidentiality reasons but the size of the credit was about 35 million and three or four years is how long we ve had that credit and yeah matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst was is it a syndicated loan or were you the only bank involved philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer we re the only bank matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst okay and i guess the other thing that was surprising or i wanted to learn more about was the increase in non performing for the leases the 19 million increase and i wanted the percent for philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so approximately half of that credit is a c i loan and the half are leases so the increase that you see in the leasing category is related to that credit matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst right right and following that thread there was very little or not a huge increase in lease charge offs so can you help me just get comfortable with the size of the npa increase versus the lack of any charge off there and so when you looked at the collateral how did you get comfortable with that outcome philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so we looked at the collateral in that credit and we do not if the credit would continue to go south which we re certainly are hopeful that it does we don t see a large charge off and we didn t think it was appropriate to charge anything off at this time matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst okay the last one on this subject was aside from the government shutdown there were some other things trade related this year that could impact the ag business did that play a role here the farm bill only got passed later in the year than expected that would be one thing i was thinking philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer i would say no it s the easy answer to that question matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst okay and then changing subject a little bit the tax rate guide 13 to 16 seems a little high versus what we saw this year could you just give me an idea of what would end you up on the low end versus the high end is there anything in there that s tied to some of the new jersey s state tax laws that you might have a firmer grasp as of now philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah there s a little bit of that in there but that s really de minimis i mean what it really comes down to is the post federal tax reform we ve historically been having investors and participants in low income housing tax credit transactions post tax reform we ve capped that portfolio a little bit and that s why you ve seen the glide path from 16 to 17 to 18 to 19 the amortization absent is kind of one solar credit transaction that happened in the fourth quarter you have seen the glide path downward in the amortization on these tax credit deals so it s really as simple as matthew when you have a constant level of tax preference items but you expect to see your pre tax earnings going higher every year that s going to increase your effective tax rate so that s the reason matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst okay understood can you share with us any of your early findings from ccil and then as a follow up to that i know there s going to be some reliance on quantitative versus qualitative factors to get to your true up reserve can you just help us better understand some of the qualitative factors that you ll use and to what extent you ll use them to come to that true up reserve level philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer we are we and i think the whole industry is not really disclosing a lot yet other than to tell you that we ve been working very very hard on internally on it we are fully confident of our ability to comply with the new standard in the first quarter of 2020 and that we are again working very very hard on model development and our methodologies throughout 2018 and if we get to a point that we think it s appropriate to disclose we will certainly make a disclosure at that time but until then i can just assure you that we are spending a lot of time and effort and energy around this and have a great team work matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst understood just last one for me is on the branch closing effort it sounded like there s more to go there beyond first quarter of 2019 as we think about potential branch closure costs and the expense run rate is that baked into your guidance mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer it is it is yes so the two in the fourth quarter and the eight in the first quarter both the cost savings as well as the one time costs are baked into the guidance we give matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst understood that s all i had thank you for taking my questions mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yep thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst well thanks for the follow up mark i just want to make sure i got those expense i know you got a lot of questions about it the branch consolidation and the conversion costs what i guess what an aggregatable should we expect in 2019 i understand that the low single digit growth rate off of 2018 but what s can you just talk about for any reason second and third quarter having but what s the total amount because i would imagine some of these are kind of deemed one time philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah total amount we have 3 6 million of charter consolidation cost in 2018 in 2019 we think that that number could be you know 4 million to 5 million higher so you can be somewhere in the 7 million to 9 million range the majority of that we anticipate would be in the second and third quarters and then in terms of the branch consolidation costs we expensed 1 3 million of that in 2018 related to either branches that closed in 2018 or branches to close in 2019 because once you reach that trigger point you start accelerating leasehold amortizations and such there s going to be another 1 6 million that we re not carving out that s just that s in our run rate on expenses 1 6 million in 2019 related to those branch closures but then we anticipate that the earn back from that the total so there is 2 9 million to cost the annualized savings on those we think should be 3 5 million so an earn back of about 9 or 10 months chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay i appreciate that and then just in terms of the size just a follow up on the credit can you remind us the size like the internal limits on credits i mean the 35 million is a little bit higher than i would ve thought on a stand alone basis as opposed to like a club deal but could you remind us kind of internal limits on single relationship that you have in place mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah our internal limit is 55 million and we i think that s a pretty conservative number chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay and so in terms of credits of this size of 30 million to 40 million i mean are we talking a couple of handfuls or is it more than that in terms of just some granularity mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer couple of handfuls chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay all right thanks a lot for the color i appreciate it operator thank you i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to the phil wenger for closing remarks philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer well thank you all for joining us today we hope you ll be able to be with us when we

chairman and chief executive officer thanks jason and good morning everyone thank you for joining us i have a few prepared remarks before our cfo mark mccollom shares the details of our financial performance and discusses our 2019 outlook when he concludes we will open the phone line for questions overall it was another solid year for our company as we hit a record level of net income our net income surpassed 200 million for the first time in our history our financial results in 2018 reflected continued progress in executing our growth strategies and the benefit of multiple interest rate increases by the federal reserve our average loan portfolio increased 3 8 year over year which was in line with our 2018 outlook and was driven by growth in most of our loan portfolios and spread across our footprint average commercial loan growth lag to average consumer and mortgage loan growth year over year our commercial loan growth was impacted by higher prepayments lower line utilization and slowing originations as the learning environment remained extremely competitive throughout 2018 however loan growth accelerated toward the end of the fourth quarter and as a result period end loan balances increased 241 million linked quarter we continue to grow in philadelphia and baltimore both markets have a team of commercial and consumer lenders serving the markets to help us take advantage of what we view as tremendous long term growth opportunities in philadelphia we opened a mortgage loan production office in may of 2018 and have plans to open another lpo in camden new jersey later this year we opened a full service branch in the beginning of january and have two more targeted to open by the end of the first quarter in baltimore we opened a mortgage loan production office in january and have plans to open full service branch offices in 2019 and beyond moving to credit overall asset quality continues to be relatively stable despite an uptick in non performing loans provision for credit losses and net charge offs we had a large commercial relationship moved to non performing during the quarter excluding this relationship non performing loans would have declined linked quarter the provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was driven primarily by this one relationship and to a lesser extent by growth in the loan portfolio the increase in net charge offs was related to a handful of credits in unrelated industries as we ve mentioned in the past we are mindful of where we are in the economic cycle and are continuing to assess and analyze the loan portfolio for signs of weakness or stress we believe the uptick in these credit metrics this quarter is not suggested by a broader portfolio or macro trends turning to fees excluding a litigation settlement and security gains in 2017 non interest income increased by less than 1 year over year and was consistent with our revised 2018 outlook that we provided in the second quarter of 2018 our commercial loan interest rate swap and sba businesses were the biggest drivers of slowing growth in non interest income our commercial loan interest rate swap business tends to track with commercial originations which were down year over year in addition evolving consumer behaviors and preferences continue to put pressure on non interest income particularly overdraft fees on a positive note our investment management and trust services income grew at a nice pace year over year due to both overall market performance and our continued asset gathering focus brokerage revenue grew 8 year over year and continues to be one of our fastest growing segments in the business recently we had the opportunity to broaden our reach to serve additional clients in central pennsylvania by purchasing a wealth management business located in altoona pennsylvania adding approximately 250 million of assets under management and administration to our brokerage platform we continue to work at organic and inorganic opportunities to grow our investment management and trust business we saw notable increases in debit and credit card income also merchant fees which reflected continued customer growth and usage non interest expenses increased 3 9 year over year it was slightly higher than our 2018 outlook excluding amortization of a tax credit investment in the fourth quarter of 2018 our non interest expenses increased 3 year over year which was in line with our 2018 outlook our efficiency ratio improved year over year the efficiency ratio for 2018 was 63 8 within our goal of 60 to 65 and it reached its lowest level since 2013 expense management is a top priority and we continually look for ways to make our organization more efficient while continuing to invest in our company to support a larger organization that can benefit from economies of scale opportunities exist to become more efficient as we continue to optimize our delivery channels upgrade our origination and servicing platforms consolidate our bank charters and access our bsa aml orders since 2012 we ve consolidated 33 branches or approximately 12 of our branch network and we have plans to consolidate eight more branches by the end of the first quarter we incurred approximately 930 000 of expenses in the fourth quarter related to these planned branch consolidations we believe there will be more opportunities to optimize our branch network over time as we continue to react to changing customer preferences and behaviors strategically the deployment of capital for the enhancement of long term shareholder value remains one of our highest priorities in 2018 we increased our quarterly common dividend by 0 01 to 0 12 paid a 0 04 special dividend in the fourth quarter to date we ve repurchased approximately 100 million of common stock in all we distributed nearly 90 of our net income to shareholders in 2018 we have approximately 5 million left in our current share repurchase program which is authorized through december 31 2019 on the corporate front we had several milestones during the year first as you saw in our 8 k filing last night i m happy to announce that the bsa aml consent orders issued to our subsidiary bank at maryland were terminated this follows the terminations in 2017 and 2018 of the consent orders issued to four of our other subsidiary banks with respect to the remaining bsa aml consent order we are confident that we are progressing toward achieving a similar resolution once that order is terminated we can fully pursue our strategic priority of consolidating our subsidiary banks into our flagship bank fulton bank second toward that end in october of last year we consolidated our subsidiary banks fnb bank and swineford national bank into our largest banking subsidiary fulton bank that consolidation went well and we are finalizing plans for the consolidation of the remaining subsidiary banks into fulton bank and now i d like to turn the call over to mark to discuss our financial results in more detail mark mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks phil and good morning to everyone on the call and unless i note otherwise the quarterly comparisons i will discuss are with the third quarter 2018 and annual comparisons are with 2017 starting on slide six earnings per diluted share this quarter were 0 33 or net income of 58 1 million fourth quarter earnings in comparison to the third quarter reflect an increase in net interest income and a decrease in income taxes however this positive comparison was more than offset by the impact of a higher provision for credit losses lower non interest income and higher non interest expense and we ll step through each of these components in a moment moving to slide seven our net interest income in the fourth quarter improved by 2 8 million or 2 linked quarter driven by a 2 basis point expansion in our net interest margin to 3 44 and a 230 million or 1 increase in our average interest earning assets in the fourth quarter our interest earning asset yields grew 9 basis points principally driven by 10 basis point increase in average loan yields on the funding side deposit cost increased 9 basis points but short and long term borrowing costs remained fairly stable our overall cost of funds increased 8 basis points which was slightly lower than the yield increase on average interest earning assets the 25 basis point fed funds rate increases in each quarter of 2018 coupled with the increases we ve seen in our interest bearing deposit rates have resulted in a year to date deposit beta of approximately 28 this is slightly higher than the 25 year to date deposit beta through september 30th but it s still in line with our previous expectations we anticipate that our net interest margin in the first quarter of 2019 should follow the macro themes of the last few quarters and that we ll benefit from the december fed funds rate increase but we also expect to see rising deposit betas our balance sheet remains asset sensitive as 43 or approximately 6 9 million 6 9 billion of our own portfolio is variable 35 is adjustable and 22 is fixed rate of our loans that are either variable or adjustable the two most relevant indices are prime and one month libor which account for 33 and 30 of our total loan portfolio respectively the 2 basis point increase in our net interest margin from last quarter was within the range we provided in our updated outlook during the third quarter of 2018 average loans increased linked quarter by 103 million or 0 7 while ending loans increased at a faster rate 241 million linked quarter or 1 5 average deposits grew 446 million or 2 8 linked quarter this increase was seen principally in money market accounts for both consumer and commercial customers for the year our net interest income increased 55 million or 9 6 from 2017 driven by a 3 4 increase in average interest earning assets and a 12 basis point increase in our net interest margin yields on earning assets increased 29 basis points while our costs of funds increased at a lower rate of 18 basis points the increase in interest earning asset yields was realized principally in loans we saw a 31 basis point increase the increase in cost of funds was driven primarily by our deposits turning to credit on slide eight in 2018 the provision for credit losses increased 23 6 million from 2017 this increase included a 36 8 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2018 related to a customer fraud excluding this our provision for credit losses would have decreased 13 2 million from 2017 reflecting relatively stable credit conditions and this year over year decrease is inclusive of our higher provision for credit losses that we saw in the fourth quarter of this year for the fourth quarter our provision for credit losses did increase at a higher rate than previous periods to 8 2 million primarily driven by one commercial relationship that has shown signs of weakness and was placed on non accrual status despite remaining current in its payments as of year end net charge offs for the year as a percent of average loans were 34 basis points compared to 12 basis points in 2017 adjusting for a 33 9 million charge off related to the customer fraud net charge offs for the year would have been 12 basis points unchanged from 2017 for the quarter net charge offs on an annualized basis were 17 basis points as compared to 8 basis points in the third quarter of 2018 with the increase attributable to a handful of credits and i believe it was 5 in unrelated industries non performing loans at december 31 2018 increased 4 9 million or 3 7 in comparison to year end 2017 non performing loans as a percentage of the total loans increased slightly to 86 basis points as compared to 85 basis points at the end of last year in comparison to the third quarter non performing loans increased 19 6 million attributable to the aforementioned commercial relationship excluding this one relationship remaining of our non performing loans declined approximately 15 million linked quarter the allowance for credit losses to loans at december 31 2018 was 1 05 a 7 basis point decrease from 2017 and unchanged from the third quarter of 2018 the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio as a percent of non performing loans decreased to 121 at year end 2018 as compared to 131 in year end 2017 and 140 at the end of the third quarter moving to slide nine non interest income excluding securities gains decreased 1 5 million or 3 in comparison to the third quarter of 2018 this decrease resulted mainly from lower commercial loan interest rate swap fees and lower merchant fee income for the year non interest income excluding securities gains decreased 3 4 million from 2017 in part because 2017 non interest income included a 5 1 million gain from a favorable settlement of litigation matter during 2018 our investment management and trust services income grew 2 9 million or 6 merchant fee revenues increased 1 6 million or 9 and credit card income increased approximately 1 million or 8 these increases were partially offset by lower commercial loan interest rate swap fees sba gains and overdraft fees mortgage banking income was down 900 000 year over year mainly due to a gain recognized in 2017 upon a reversal of a mortgage servicing rights allowance of 1 3 million mortgage sale gains were flat as the 14 increase in volumes during 2018 was offset by lower spreads on gain on sale moving to slide 10 our non interest expenses increased 5 3 million in the fourth quarter included in this our expenses were inflated by 4 9 million of tax credit investment amortization for a certain investment which generated a corresponding income tax benefit during the quarter adjusting for this item our operating expenses increased only 372 000 linked quarter the other expense category increased 2 4 million linked quarter due to costs associated with brands consolidation expected to occur in the first quarter of 2019 which phil mentioned earlier as well as higher other real estate owned expenses this increase was largely offset by our 1 million decrease in salary and benefits expenses driven by lower incentive compensation expense for the year non interest expense increased 20 5 million or 3 9 excluding the aforementioned tax credit investment amortization non interest expenses were up 15 6 million or 3 salaries and benefits expense was most of this year over year increase increasing by 13 1 million we also absorbed 3 6 million of charter consolidation costs during the year as we continue to simplify our franchise and unify our brand income tax expense decreased 3 million linked quarter due to the tax credits associated with the aforementioned tax credit investment and lower pre tax income absent this tax credit realization in the fourth quarter our effective tax rate would have been 14 6 just slightly above our guidance range for the year income tax expense decreased 38 1 million mainly due to our federal tax reform which lowered the statutory federal income tax rate slide 11 displays our profitability and capital levels over the past four years we continue to see increases in both our returns on average assets and returns on tangible equity over the periods presented as phil mentioned to date we have repurchased approximately 100 million of our common stock completing the existing 50 million repurchase plan which had 31 5 million remaining at the beginning of the quarter we have also repurchased 70 million under our new 75 million plan which was approved during the fourth quarter a total of 6 4 million shares have been repurchased at an average cost of approximately 15 88 per share as a result of these share repurchases our tangible common equity ratio decreased from 8 83 at september to 8 52 at year end we remain well capitalized with significant capital cushions to both regulatory guidelines and on more stringent internal thresholds lastly we would like to provide our initial guidance for 2019 which is shown on page 12 we are expecting average annual loan and deposit growth rates to be in the low to mid single digit range we expect our net interest income to increase year over year in a mid to high single digit range we expect our net interest margin to grow 0 to 3 basis points per quarter during 2019 our margin is influenced by number of factors including our loan and deposit mix loan and deposit betas and overall interest rate levels we expect our non interest income to increase year over year in a low to mid single digit range excluding all remaining charter consolidation costs we expect our non interest expense to increase year over year in a low single digit range our provision for credit losses will reflect changes in the asset quality measures as well as the pace of long growth and economic factors among other factors given this inherent volatility we would expect our provision for credit losses in 2019 to be between 3 million and 8 million per quarter we expect our effective tax rate to be between 13 and 16 our capital level should remain consistent with december 31 2018 and our capital will be utilized to support growth and to provide appropriate returns to our shareholders and with that i ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions sydney go ahead questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from austin nicholas from stephens inc you may proceed with your question austin nicholas stephens inc analyst hey guys philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer good morning austin mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning austin austin nicholas stephens inc analyst good morning guys could you maybe talk about what kind of assumptions for fed rate hike moves are embedded in that 0 to 3 basis points a quarter guide and maybe what drives you to the high end versus the low end there philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure good morning austin it s in our assumptions we assume an increase in june and we assume one in december of 2019 the one in december of 2019 obviously has very little impact on 2019 the one in june we actually ran our forecast internally with and without it and if we assume 0 rate increases it would impact our internal forecast by about 2 basis points so said another way whether we see these rate increases or not we think we re still comfortable with the guidance of 0 to 3 basis points per quarter austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay that s very helpful and then maybe just on the expense guidance i guess does that include the i guess the cost saves from the eight branches that are expected to close this quarter and then additionally is that excluding the tax credit amortization expense or is that including that number philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer no it includes the tax credit amortization the tax credits that occurred this quarter a lot of our tax credits are either low income housing tax credits or they re new markets tax credits which are amortized when you get that benefit and the amortization is over multiple years the credit we realized in the fourth quarter is an energy credit where it s a one time credit and a one time expense so going forward what you should expect to see next year as us getting back a little bit below even what the current run rate is expect about 1 3 million to 1 4 million per quarter in 2019 in that tax credit amortization that number is included in that expense guidance that we give and also included an added expense guidance is we generated this year between the third and the fourth quarter about 1 3 million of cost related to a branch closer that happened well we closed two in the fourth quarter eight coming here in the first quarter there s going to be some additional costs on that in next year which are in our expense guidance but then there s also going to be savings related to that and the earn back on those branch closures in terms of the one time cost versus the savings less than one year that s about 10 months for the earn back austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay and then maybe just one last one i think that you spoke about the kind of the provisioning for that specific credit this quarter and i believe it was in the agribusiness kind of vertical i guess could you maybe speak about that overall the overall agriculture portfolio and how you are thinking it i think in past quarters it s been brought up as stressed but that delinquencies have more or less stabilized to kind of declined and if i look at your c i or your commercial delinquencies they continue to come down so maybe any commentary on your comfort of that on that portfolio outside of the kind of downgrade that you saw this quarter philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we think it s still stabilizing you exclude discredit and delinquencies in our ag portfolio actually would have been down for the quarter and so i think we continue to watch it closely but are pretty comfortable with it austin nicholas stephens inc analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our following question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is now open chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst hey good morning philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer hi chris chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst question on the buyback the slide deck suggested capital levels at the levels through the next year you ve got a sub of about 5 million left is it fair to assume that you re not looking to come back to the buyback given where stocks are trading or could you be fairly aggressive in the fourth quarter i m just trying to get a sense of whether the expectation is that you ll go back to the board and ask for more or is this kind of it for now philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so chris we talk with our board every quarter about the uses of capital and you know it s possible that we could put another plan in place as we go through the year i think a lot will depend on our growth than other opportunities that we might see chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst and then on the kind of alternative uses so you ve got another one of that might use lifted can you speak to kind of desire to do a deal in 2019 your stock has held up on a relative basis a little bit better than peers and just kind of interested if deals would be kind of climbing the ranks of priority for 19 philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer well we still have orders against the holding company in our subsidiary bank lafayette ambassador so until they go away our deals still aren t possible but if the right strategic deal came along after those were lifted and it would work from a financial standpoint we would have interest chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay great and then maybe a last one if i could on credit your understanding in the second quarter was kind of an idiosyncratic event and this quarter you had the inflow and i m wondering why it seems like you ve set a reasonably high bar for yourself for 2019 on the provision and just given the concerns that are kind of permeating in the market from a credit economy wondering wondering why it seems to be a little bit of an aggressive guide on the provision maybe you could speak to your confidence in what you re seeing that we may not be able to see from the outside thanks philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so overall our we do not see softening in our overall portfolio and this past quarter even with that one large credit we were would have been very close to this guidance so we have confidence that the range that we gave should hold up for now anyway chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay thanks a lot i appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from joe gladue from merion capital group your line is open joe gladue merion capital group analyst good morning philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer hi joe mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer hi joe joe gladue merion capital group analyst let me just follow up on one of the earlier questions on the interest rate expectations you talked about the what you re expecting toward rate hikes but i was just wondering what your thoughts are on the slope of the yield curve and how that might be affecting your investment portfolio strategy and such philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah i wouldn t say it s having a lot of impact on our investment portfolio strategy we have i mean our investment portfolio july s cash flow is around 23 million to 25 million a month and i mean we continue our investment portfolio is not used for earnings i mean our investment portfolio is there for liquidity and so with the size of that portfolio i would say that we re going to continue to buy relatively conservative mortgage backs and the cmos and occasional municipal investments as we have in the past and but we re also have paid our a pretty wide inflection point there where we see the yield on investments sort of rolling off versus the investments that we are buying on i mean there is obviously a significant yield pickup on that joe gladue merion capital group analyst okay and just wondering i guess you did mention earlier in the prepared remarks about the higher prepayments just wondering if you could quantify that a little bit what you saw in the fourth quarter that you can technical difficulty philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure we had highlighted each of the past in the second quarter and third quarter where we had emphasized that our prepayments specifically in our commercial business we re about a 100 million higher in 2q and 3q relative to what we saw on the first quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter the numbers were 80 million higher than what we saw in the second and third quarter so you take from the beginning of the year to now our prepayments have actually increased in the commercial space by 160 million now when you then look at our overall growth we had in the fourth quarter what it means is that we had a solid really solid quarter relative to the last three linked quarters for commercial originations but we continue to see very high prepayment activity amortization in just kind of normal loan book that s relatively flat that s somewhere in the 650 million per quarter range but the prepayments have accelerated joe gladue merion capital group analyst all right thank you that s it for me operator thank you our following question comes from russell gunther with davidson your line is now open russell gunther d a davidson analyst hey good morning guys philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer hi russell russell gunther d a davidson analyst i wanted to follow up on some of the expense comments earlier you made the remark that you had about 3 6 million in charter consolidation expense recognized in 2018 do you guys have a sense for what that could look like as you look ahead to 2019 philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah we do and i believe we even said maybe on the last call we have said that we expected to be somewhere in the range of 2 million to 3 million per quarter and the timing of that is likely going to be heavier in the second and third quarter of next year we would hope by the time we re into the fourth quarter of next year we should see those charter consolidation costs behind us russell gunther d a davidson analyst okay i appreciate that mark and then you had also said earlier that as part of some of the efficiency initiatives you would see you mentioned the consolidation of the bank charters and kind of exiting the bsa aml orders so how should we think about what would fall to the bottom line between incremental charter consolidation expense and then some of those efficiencies you had talked about earlier mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we have again we continue to look at a whole bunch of different ways to make ourselves more efficient obviously we just announced between two this quarter and eight in the first quarter 10 store closings but we re also announcing that in the selected markets where we see good market opportunities growing branches as well so on a net basis you ll continue to see us shrink in markets that aren t as desirable or where we have too many branches for changing customer preferences but you re going to see us open branches in markets where we see a market opportunity as we ve mentioned in prior calls much of the consolidation in our company despite running a separate bank charters we ve had a largely consolidated back office for some time and while we see there have been still be some incremental savings as we get further past the charter consolidations and the bsa orders we re not quantifying that as a hard dollar number at this time i think but certainly the expectation is for a long term positive operating leverage and with that we are really pleased with where we brought our efficiency ratio to for both this year and for the fourth quarter but we re certainly aiming for further improvements in that going forward russell gunther d a davidson analyst okay i appreciate that and then a last one for me was just on circling back to the agribusiness credit is there any kind of further detail you could share on the specific credit why that would why even with that you still feel ok with the rest of the portfolio and then should the current government shutdown kind of continue to carry on for a longer period of time does that potentially change your view or add any risk in that portfolio mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer so i don t think we want to provide any more specifics in regard to the one credit but overall on the ag portfolio we spend a lot of time analyzing it looking for trends and it s definitely stabilized in any trend that we see in that portfolio is positive as compared to a negative the shutdown on the government has had impact on for us with our sba lending and it has some impact in the mortgage area but to date we have not seen any impact in the agricultural portfolio russell gunther d a davidson analyst okay thank you so i mean sorry to sneak one more in here please on the loan growth outlook the low to mid single digits on average how do you expect that kind of mix to look should we expect sort of similar drivers to 2018 or as you look out this year any particular loan buckets showing more strength than others mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think you are going to see the same type of growth rates on the consumer side and then i would say on the commercial side we don t have quite as much confidence and exactly what s going to happen so if that strengthens a little i think we ll be more to the high end of the guidance and if it doesn t we ll be more in the middle to the low end russell gunther d a davidson analyst okay thanks very much guys operator thank you our next question comes from matt schultheis with boenning your line is now open matthew schultheis boenning scattergood inc analyst hi good morning philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer good morning mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning matt matthew schultheis boenning scattergood inc analyst so just a quick follow up to russell s question regarding the government shutdown aside from ag or sba have you seen any customer request particularly on the retail side regarding delinquency or any sort of reach out from the mortgage borrowers in maryland or virginia to sort of work with them as they are furloughed or any increase in early stage delinquencies philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so we put a program in place for any of our customers that are impacted by the shutdown so we do have a on our credit card we ve worked with our provider there and we have card specials at 0 for a period of months we will offer a unsecured line of credit at 0 for up to three months we re going to allow deferment of payments on consumer loans and we re offering some relief on the overdraft protection to date we have not seen any weakness and have had have not had a lot of inquiries into those programs matthew schultheis boenning scattergood inc analyst okay thanks for that and just i know you don t want to give a lot of detail on this particular credit so i understand that you may not answer this but i m obligated to ask was there a did this sort of come to the surface through any change to your policies and procedures regarding loan review following the fraud or was this something more borrower specific mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer no it was borrower specific and it s been a credit that we ve been watching for some time matthew schultheis boenning scattergood inc analyst okay thank you for your time today operator thank you our following question comes from matthew breese with piper jaffray your line is now open matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst good morning everybody philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer good morning mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst just to follow that thread there just curious what was the total size of the relationship that went sideways this quarter how long have you had that relationship and was the nature what was the nature of the agribusiness was it poultry or dairy or other philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer well we re not going to get into any more specifics in regards to the credit for confidentiality reasons but the size of the credit was about 35 million and three or four years is how long we ve had that credit and yeah matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst was is it a syndicated loan or were you the only bank involved philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer we re the only bank matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst okay and i guess the other thing that was surprising or i wanted to learn more about was the increase in non performing for the leases the 19 million increase and i wanted the percent for philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so approximately half of that credit is a c i loan and the half are leases so the increase that you see in the leasing category is related to that credit matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst right right and following that thread there was very little or not a huge increase in lease charge offs so can you help me just get comfortable with the size of the npa increase versus the lack of any charge off there and so when you looked at the collateral how did you get comfortable with that outcome philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer so we looked at the collateral in that credit and we do not if the credit would continue to go south which we re certainly are hopeful that it does we don t see a large charge off and we didn t think it was appropriate to charge anything off at this time matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst okay the last one on this subject was aside from the government shutdown there were some other things trade related this year that could impact the ag business did that play a role here the farm bill only got passed later in the year than expected that would be one thing i was thinking philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer i would say no it s the easy answer to that question matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst okay and then changing subject a little bit the tax rate guide 13 to 16 seems a little high versus what we saw this year could you just give me an idea of what would end you up on the low end versus the high end is there anything in there that s tied to some of the new jersey s state tax laws that you might have a firmer grasp as of now philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah there s a little bit of that in there but that s really de minimis i mean what it really comes down to is the post federal tax reform we ve historically been having investors and participants in low income housing tax credit transactions post tax reform we ve capped that portfolio a little bit and that s why you ve seen the glide path from 16 to 17 to 18 to 19 the amortization absent is kind of one solar credit transaction that happened in the fourth quarter you have seen the glide path downward in the amortization on these tax credit deals so it s really as simple as matthew when you have a constant level of tax preference items but you expect to see your pre tax earnings going higher every year that s going to increase your effective tax rate so that s the reason matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst okay understood can you share with us any of your early findings from ccil and then as a follow up to that i know there s going to be some reliance on quantitative versus qualitative factors to get to your true up reserve can you just help us better understand some of the qualitative factors that you ll use and to what extent you ll use them to come to that true up reserve level philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer we are we and i think the whole industry is not really disclosing a lot yet other than to tell you that we ve been working very very hard on internally on it we are fully confident of our ability to comply with the new standard in the first quarter of 2020 and that we are again working very very hard on model development and our methodologies throughout 2018 and if we get to a point that we think it s appropriate to disclose we will certainly make a disclosure at that time but until then i can just assure you that we are spending a lot of time and effort and energy around this and have a great team work matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst understood just last one for me is on the branch closing effort it sounded like there s more to go there beyond first quarter of 2019 as we think about potential branch closure costs and the expense run rate is that baked into your guidance mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer it is it is yes so the two in the fourth quarter and the eight in the first quarter both the cost savings as well as the one time costs are baked into the guidance we give matthew breese piper jaffray co analyst understood that s all i had thank you for taking my questions mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yep thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst well thanks for the follow up mark i just want to make sure i got those expense i know you got a lot of questions about it the branch consolidation and the conversion costs what i guess what an aggregatable should we expect in 2019 i understand that the low single digit growth rate off of 2018 but what s can you just talk about for any reason second and third quarter having but what s the total amount because i would imagine some of these are kind of deemed one time philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer yeah total amount we have 3 6 million of charter consolidation cost in 2018 in 2019 we think that that number could be you know 4 million to 5 million higher so you can be somewhere in the 7 million to 9 million range the majority of that we anticipate would be in the second and third quarters and then in terms of the branch consolidation costs we expensed 1 3 million of that in 2018 related to either branches that closed in 2018 or branches to close in 2019 because once you reach that trigger point you start accelerating leasehold amortizations and such there s going to be another 1 6 million that we re not carving out that s just that s in our run rate on expenses 1 6 million in 2019 related to those branch closures but then we anticipate that the earn back from that the total so there is 2 9 million to cost the annualized savings on those we think should be 3 5 million so an earn back of about 9 or 10 months chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay i appreciate that and then just in terms of the size just a follow up on the credit can you remind us the size like the internal limits on credits i mean the 35 million is a little bit higher than i would ve thought on a stand alone basis as opposed to like a club deal but could you remind us kind of internal limits on single relationship that you have in place mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah our internal limit is 55 million and we i think that s a pretty conservative number chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay and so in terms of credits of this size of 30 million to 40 million i mean are we talking a couple of handfuls or is it more than that in terms of just some granularity mark mccollom senior executive vice president and chief financial officer couple of handfuls chris mcgratty keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay all right thanks a lot for the color i appreciate it operator thank you i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to the phil wenger for closing remarks philip wenger chairman and chief executive officer well thank you all for joining us today we hope you ll be

from the brexit referendum of 2016 to the us general elections the same year and from the recent yellow vest protest in france to the forming of rightwing and leftwing governments in europe and latin america the systemic crisis of capitalism has made its way from north america to europe and other parts of the world no one knows how long the crisis is going to last and how extensive or profound its impact will be to the political and economic order of the world this is what people often call the world of enormous uncertainty this is what president xi jinping has reminded us time and again that our world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century so what is the origin of this crisis and how deeply will it affect china us relations when talking about the profound changes unseen in a century we should look at the hard fact that since the dawn of the 21st century and in the last decade in particular capitalism as a political and economic system and as an ideology has suffered a series of big blows clashes between capital and labor have intensified and emerged as the principal contradiction in capitalist societies american scholar francis fukuyama pointed out years ago that the country s political system had entered a state of decay in his recent book identity politics he described donald trump not only as the product of such decay but also the catalyst to the process it is the systemic decay in his view that gives rise to populism similar to the populist tsunami that put franklin d roosevelt in the white house in 1932 and influenced american politics for two generations thereafter the serious gravity of the crisis can be illustrated in two ways on the one hand with identity politics dominating the election centered politics political parties in the us have ceased making policies in accordance with national or even partisan considerations which leads to vetocracy that gridlocks the normal functioning of government on the other hand with the wealth gap widening as owners of capital and new technologies keep the bulk of resources under their control income stops growing the labor to gdp ratio dwindles and society slides further down the road of disunity as a 2016 poll found more than half of american youth no longer supported capitalism the great moderation that lasted several decades has come to an end and capitalist societies in general will enter a new period characterized by turmoil transformation and adjustment according to the economist as of 1997 a high degree of monopoly prevailed inside the us making up 10 of the us economy and the top four companies of each industry took up two thirds of the market share the monopoly of capital led to a staggering extra profit totaling 660 billion over two thirds of which going to us based corporations and one third to technology companies such as google and facebook the crisis of capitalism first and foremost threatens global economic growth the capitalist model of development is in trouble many countries introduced structural reforms after the 2008 financial tsunami to address their mounting institutional and cyclical difficulties resulting in widespread slowdown rising protectionism and sometimes trade wars caused by sentiments like america first china and the us now face an unpredictable future on trade which casts a dark shadow over the world economy capital s profit seeking instinct also stokes financial risks and asset bubbles the u s dollar as the principal international reserve currency simultaneously is neglected on its latter role the u s monetary policy differs greatly from those of other major countries these have lead to serious distortions to the direction of global trade and investment the new tech revolution galvanizes capital flow to new technologies thus depressing labor earnings in manufacturing jobs technological advancement while enhancing overall productivity cuts demands for employment in the traditional manufacturing sector the unpredictable capital flow makes commodity prices particularly those of crude oil fluctuate violently having a major impact on resource based economies and greater economic uncertainty for resource consuming countries secondly the crisis of capitalism undermines existing international system and systems of global governance put in place by the capitalist countries themselves the plight of the world trade organization is a case in point thanks to rising populism many countries have embraced identity politics realigned their interest groups and given free rein to political extremism and tribalism from britain where citizens face a tough choice on brexit to hungary italy mexico brazil and france where populism has risen to the level of national will popular sentiments against globalization immigrants and free trade are still on the rise globalization and rule based global governance is severely tested people s ability to address climate change wild fluctuation of energy prices rising financial risks and other global challenges is also handicapped what happened to president macron not only means a more volatile france but also a more ominous future for europe s integration and the euro s sustainability if brexit turns out to be a hard one it will do immeasurable damage to british and european economies as well as to the health of the global financial system the rule based global governance system whose unimpeded operation is badly needed in our world today is nonetheless caught in the middle of a struggle between two powerful forces namely the force of globalization that promotes multilateralism and global order and the force of anti globalization that indulges in unilateralism while putting one s selfish interests above everything else the struggle has already left the global governance system fragmented and disorganized denying it the ability to effectively address and respond to major international challenges what s more the systemic crisis in major western countries has weakened their ability to reach needed consensus for cooperation resulting in a prolonged state of no governance or no effective governance a worsening external environment at the global level and increased difficulty for many countries to meet their domestic agendas how will the crisis of capitalism particularly the systemic decay of us capitalism affect china us relations after all china us relations play such a pivotal role in the shaping of international relations in the 21st century first china us relations are in need of readjustment which will make them even more uncertain since us capitalism has entered an extended period of turmoil and overhaul the government is more inclined to play hardball in dealing with other countries and since the us has already defined china as a strategic competitor the two countries will also take an extended period to feel out each other strategically the telephone conversation by the two heads of state towards the end of 2018 was an important step in promoting progress in bilateral trade negotiations rhetoric from the two sides sounds more upbeat but many still draw conclusions from vice president mike pence s october speech that the ongoing brawl in china us relations meant more than just trade friction perhaps it is the beginning of a cold war still some likened china us relations to the pre wwi world convinced that the thucydides trap is inevitable ancient greek historian thucydides blamed the peloponnesian war on athens rise and the fear it caused in the spartans in reality history cannot repeat itself and such comparisons can only misguide the evolution of china us relations as we know them reflects nothing more than international changes since wwii particularly the shifting dynamics of the global system second us capitalism has entered a new period characterized by a combination of financial capital and technology monopoly it cannot resolve the inherent contradiction between capital and labor resulting in convoluted problems that include the widening wealth gap disintegration of the social fabric and growing opposition between the elite and broad sections of people china on the other hand has leapfrogged in development over the decades by acting within the existing international system and taking full advantage of globalization the success of the chinese path has increased the strategic anxiety of the us and dampened its self confidence it is quite logical for the us to go out looking for foes or adversaries to rally troops and restore morale therefore future china us relations will witness more ups and downs third though the problems in china us relations are significant it does not mean that the two countries are destined to fall into the thucydides trap the highly integrated interests and interdependence from globalization have brought the two countries closely together china commits to reform opening up and peaceful development and the us desires to address its problems from capitalism the us may borrow a page from china s success story when it comes to reducing poverty closing the wealth gap and bringing about greater fairness in society how could it be feasible for the us to decouple from china as mr pence advocated how many american constituencies can he bring on his bandwagon will state governments get along with the federal government can extreme conservatives convince americans from other social strata and backgrounds of their argument the cold war is long gone building an iron curtain around china and preventing it from integrating into the world can only be a pipedream as far as china us relations are concerned we should be neither blindly optimistic nor overly pessimistic bilateral trade is about to hit 600 billion some 350 000 chinese students are studying in the us and every year over 3 million chinese tourists visit the us a recently conducted survey by pew shows that 38 of americans think favorably about china slightly lower than the 44 figure of 2017 when trade friction just got started and the 40 figure of 2012 what is more numbers recorded amongst young americans are noticeably higher as far as global governance is concerned both china and the us face global challenges maintaining the rule based global governance and rebuilding a new multilateral regime including a trade system will be elusive without their cooperation in future the success in fulfilling such big jobs as wto reform building asian and world security architecture and reconstructing world order largely depend on the level of strategic interaction between china and the us and their policy alternatives this writer is convinced that the two countries are capable of replacing the current pattern of cooperating competitors with one of cooperation of competitors

as well as 10 million for accelerated leach pad construction and process infrastructure to accommodate the higher ore tonnes mined and to provide additional operating flexibility regarding leach cycles construction of a leach pad is expected to be accelerated to the second half of 2019 from 2020 capitalized stripping is expected to total 20 million with the majority incurred through the first three quarters of the year exploration expenditures totaling 7 5 million re focuses to mackay valmy and basalt with the goals of adding mineral reserves and defining additional mineral resources within these areas having completed the red dot exploration program in 2018 we intend to complete geotechnical drilling and engineering of the red dot mineral resources with the objective of evaluating the potential for red dot mineral reserves by mid 2019 at the seabee gold operation we expect to continue executing our plan of increasing mining and milling rates and to deliver another record gold production year in 2019 the plan includes investment of 7 million in underground mining equipment to increase capacity and reliability with higher tonnes mined and demonstrated milling infrastructure capacity cash costs are expected to remain low at between 525 and 555 per payable gold ounce sold due to continued exploration success at seabee we are embarking on an expansion to

requirements of the sec set out in sec industry guide 7 consequently mineral reserves and mineral resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic u s reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the sec under sec standards mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made in addition the sec s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute reserves by u s standards in documents filed with the sec u s investors should understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility moreover the requirements of ni 43 101 for identification of reserves are also not the same as

china s central bank injected a record 83 billion into the country s financial system on wednesday seeking to avoid a cash crunch that would put further pressure on the weakening economy china s policymakers are pledging to step up stimulus measures this year and do more to protect jobs as economic growth cools to 28 year lows but a raft of measures last year from big rail projects to tax cuts seem to have had little impact so far with recent data suggesting activity is cooling more quickly than expected the news is clear the economy needs help said trinh nguyen senior economist for emerging asia at natixis in hong kong wednesday s open market operation the bank s largest net single day injection on record came a day after china s state planner central bank and finance ministry all offered reassurances to investors signaling more spending and other types of policy support but shockingly weak december trade data released earlier this week along with shrinking factory activity are stirring speculation over whether more rapid and aggressive policy measures are needed to turn the world s second largest economy around authorities now agree the economy needs more decisive support and today s large injection reflects that nguyen added the people s bank of china pboc said wednesday s injection was aimed at ensuring there are ample funds in the financial system which is facing strains as tax payments peak in mid january and as demand for cash picks up ahead of the lunar new year holidays starting in early february the banking system s overall liquidity is falling rapidly it said in a statement while sizable injections are common this time of year ahead of the long holidays the addition was much heftier than usual and follows a large cut in banks reserve ratios announced this month which will free up a total of 116 billion for new bank lending the first stage a 50 basis point cut came into effect on tuesday an equal sized cut is scheduled for jan 25 the move also came a day after money supply data showed several of china s key credit gauges continue to languish around record lows despite government efforts to channel more funds to cash starved companies and lower their financing costs while authorities have urged banks to keep lending to struggling firms and even dangled incentives banks are wary of bad loans after a long regulatory crackdown on riskier lending many businesses facing slowing sales are in no mood to make the fresh investments that beijing is counting on new medium and long term corporate loans last month fell to less than half of average december levels nomura noted more help on the way chinese officials have repeatedly pledged more support for the economy while vowing they will not resort to flood like stimulus that beijing has unleashed in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt asked if the pboc needed to cut benchmark interest rates a pboc deputy said on tuesday that existing policy measures should be improved analysts at ocbc said the comments suggest the pboc is willing to give existing measures time to work and is in no rush to switch to more aggressive tactics at this point i have never seen such huge amounts of reverse repos the central bank is making its attitude known said a trader at a brokerage house in shanghai it s saying don t question my determination to stabilize market expectations the trader said markets appear to agree that policymakers will stick with modest measures for some time yet chinese stocks and money market rates sensitive to hints of policy shifts were little changed on wednesday the seven day repo rate a closely watched measure of liquidity was 2 6142 percent on wednesday afternoon slightly lower than the previous day s close while the pboc s net injection is big it s little versus what a rate cut would release which is what people in the market are watching for said ken cheung senior asian fx strategist at mizuho in hong kong weakest growth in 3 decades in a rare encouraging sign home prices remained buoyant in december suggesting that at least some of beijing s efforts at support are beginning to have an effect construction also appears to be slowly picking up as regulators fast track approvals of more infrastructure projects but analysts agree steps so far will take some time to percolate through the

about these picks stock advisor returns as of november 14 2018 brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter results and 2018 results before paul walks you through some of the details of the latest quarter i wanted to review what our 200 000 teammates produced for you in 2018 this year and in fact this quarter were continuing examples of how our shareholder model works for you so let s start on slide 2 we grew the top line a little better than the economy we managed costs and risks well we invested heavily in our leading capabilities and in our teammates and that benefited all of you as we returned almost all of our earnings to you looking at full year results we reported record earnings for our company of 28 billion after tax or 2 61 per share revenue grew a little better than gdp at 3 and when discussing the growth rate over 2017 we re increasing 2017 baseline as shown to add back the charges taken to the tax act last year our client base has expanded and in our key business our market leadership positions continued to improve deposits and loans within our business segments grew a little better than the economy we managed expenses well and hit our target for 2018 which we established a few years ago in fact our expenses were down 2 for the year and that helped achieve 6 operating leverage we also believe we managed risk well as net charge offs remain at decade lows driving these elements allowed us to grow pre tax earnings at 15 and we used our capital to reduce shares and that allowed us to grow eps faster than the earnings growth rate and importantly we believe the same focus on responsible growth and the laser focus on controlling what we can allows us to continue to improve results for 2019 as you can see on slide 3 every line of business contributed to our growth and earned well above our company s cost of capital and each line of business had superior efficiency through a focus on operating leverage i put three years on this page so you can see the improvement across the business for multiple years this is not a recent phenomenon and will continue in 2019 we expect to continue to drive incremental improvement in these businesses as we take advantage of our very strong franchise and continued investments in digitalization and operating efficiency as well as our relationship management capacity and core products and services let me give you a few examples in our consumer banking after a decade of simplifying our products reviewing our focus on primary accounts transforming our delivery network and driving deeper relationships for our customers we have seen net new checking accounts growing and those are growing with the same strong core attributes as our existing book savings accounts and credit cards have seen the same progress in our merrill edge investment assets we had a 21 year over year increase in funded brokerage assets and 25 billion of net client flows in merrill lynch we grew net relationships four times faster in 2018 than 2017 we saw a record number of our experienced 1 million and 5 million producers in the financial advisor population in our u s trust team we grew households by 9 last year andy sieg and katy knox who have been recently added to my management team are driving continued success in these businesses our commercial and business banking continues to build relationships net new relationship additions increased 32 for global commercial banking our middle market business and 28 for business banking comparing 2018 to 2017 and when you go on the institutional investor side of the house through our investments in the business and increased balance sheet commitment to our clients we are seeing an expansion of our prime brokerage business and as a result we had a record revenue year in our equities business in the fourth quarter alone we added 70 new clients for our equities team as you turn to slide 4 one of the drivers of an expansion in our client base is the fruit of multiple years of continuous improvement in our franchise these investments have improved the capabilities and processes used to serve our customers and we ve added this talent and these capabilities without net expense growth to enable this investment we have driven a culture of expense management that has reduced costs significantly over the past nine years while increasing our customer service scores and capabilities this has led to a 30 billion annual reduction in our expense base since 2010 the team has done great work for you here accomplishing significant savings to the bottom line and at the same time industry leading investment levels in technology physical platform and talent we face the same inflationary cost challenges everybody faces increases wage increases real estate cost increases more investment everything that we face and we still hit our 2018 expense target of approximately 53 billion and as paul will reiterate in a bit we expect those expenses to remain in that neighborhood for 2019 and 2020 and this year our efficiency ratio was at 58 these expense reductions and increased revenue have resulted in substantial operating leverage now take a look at slide 5 16 consecutive quarters of operating leverage every quarter for four straight years even in periods of revenue decline we were able to reduce expenses even more during that four year period we have invested 12 million in new technology initiatives retooled every single atm in the company rehabbed 1 500 branches built hundreds of new branches added new administrative facilities and added relationship management sales teammates and we ve also shared success with our teammates our shared success program we announced at the end of 17 we also continued at the end of 18 the two programs combined added over 1 billion to all but the top 5 of our team in annual compensation if you go to the next slide slide 6 one of the things that helped us deliver these earnings and growth has been the net increase in net interest income over the last several years once in a while i get asked by you did you capture the value of the rate curve normalizing that you told us you would the simple answer is yes and you can see it here but we delivered more than that on slide 6 you see the improvement in nii every year since 2015 nii is up 8 billion in the past four years what we often miss here it wasn t solely driven by higher rates it was driven by our business model the business model drives strong core deposit growth coupled with strong pricing discipline but it s also not just about the positives driving core nii takes good core loan growth as well and we have seen growth in loans across the business this continues to strongly help nii growth so you can see these on the right hand side average deposits grew more than 150 billion after the past four years at a 4 compound annual growth rate loans in our business grew 140 billion or 6 cagr over the same four years the specific point to demonstrate this we have grown consumer checking balances at bank of america for 40 quarters in a row a stat our consumer team would be proud of and by the way that was 200 billion in core checking of balances added across that decade so as we look forward into 2019 and consider the debate of whether nii can grow if short term rate increases stop or slow we will drive what we control with loan and deposit growth and even in an unchanged rate environment that should produce more nii one of the other areas for improvement has been a continuingly increasing amount of capital we ve been able to return to you our shareholders take a look at slide 7 as we ve increased earnings we ve also increased the return of those earnings in the form of both increased dividends as well as share repurchases this quarter we crossed an important milestone for our team fully diluted shares moved under 10 billion with more than 1 4 billion shares lower than the peak in 2013 and the lowest since 2009 it s the same great company it has more earnings more capital but 14 less shares than the peak and we see much more head so we strive to deliver what we control more customers more activities from those customers whether it s loans whether it s deposits whether it s assets under management whether it s underwriting fees whether it s trading revenue we continue to drive what we control and we control the risk and expenses and we do this while driving our competitive advantage through increasing investments in people technology and physical platform what does that sound like it sounds like another year of driving responsible growth now before i ask paul to dive in the quarter i wanted to give you we all are facing a perceived change in the operating environment with predictions in the year ahead reflecting a range of outcomes from gdp growth in the mid 2s to lower growth to recession i wanted to give you two perspectives one from our research team and the second from what we see in our client base let s first focus on the views of our research team one of the best there is the united states economy the largest in the world grew at the highest rate in a decade with a long recovery in 2018 we still have low inflation rising wages low unemployment and despite the increases in rates interest rates remain at all time lows our research team predicts economic growth to be lower in 2019 than it was in 2018 as do the general economic community however it is true these estimates still point to solid growth for 2019 our research team has global gdp growth at 3 5 and the research team has the u s gdp growth at 2 5 which is higher than any but one year in the last seven but the second view is through our customers and this strongly support a solid growth view in our consumer business we processed in 2018 more than 2 8 trillion in consumer payments and cash consumption that s a large sample of the u s gdp that data shows that the consumer spending was 8 5 higher for all of 2018 than 2017 that growth rate remains solid in december and january even as comparables are increasing due to strong growth in the end of 17 and early 18 we also see a lot of credit flows as one of the larger commercial and consumer lenders in the united states those flows are solid reflecting customer confidence responsible borrowing and lending we talk to a lot of clients we survey a lot of clients we monitor their asset quality and we ve seen it remain strong as net loss ratios are at record lows we see no problems in the near term horizon and expect charge offs to remain around 1 billion or so for the rest of 19 we also see this company s business as healthy making more money and continuing to invest our small business clients remain optimistic our most recent survey shows that the geopolitical climate however affects all of this it provides a backdrop of obdurate uncertainty trade wars government shutdown china slowdown e u slowdown brexit you name it both here and abroad impact people s economic growth outlook we are mindful of those potential impacts but we see in the u s strong indications of continued growth due to the benefits we have here in our economy so given the slowdown predicted it does not enervate us it invigorates us we look forward to continuing to produce strong results in 2019 by driving responsible growth with that let me turn it over to paul paul m donofrio chief financial officer thanks brian i m starting on slide 8 and referring to the highlights on slide 9 as well bank of america reported net income of 7 3 billion or 0 70 per diluted share as you recall q4 17 included significant charges for the tax act all the year over year results i will review adjust for those charges on that adjusted basis comparing q4 18 to q4 17 we grew revenue 6 pre tax earnings 22 net income by 39 and with the 6 reduction in shares eps by 49 this growth was driven by 7 operating leverage and strong asset quality the effective tax rate of 16 for the quarter included a net tax benefit of approximately 200 million related to a few items the benefit was driven by updated tax cut and with respect to the tax act and international earnings this benefit was partially offset by charges related to a variety of other tax matters year over year return on assets and equity improved significantly turning to the balance sheet on slide 10 overall compared to the end of q3 the balance sheet grew 16 billion driven by commercial loan growth liquidity remains strong with average global liquidity sources of 544 billion and all liquidity metrics remain well above requirements long term debt declined 5 billion with maturities outpacing issuances we are comfortably in compliance with the tlac rules that became effective in january especially in light of the recent reduction in our method 1 gsib given our robust funding levels we expect our parent debt issuances in 2019 will likely be less than maturities total shareholder equity increased 3 billion from q3 as aoci benefited from increases in the value of our afs debt securities given the decline in loan and rates we returned 95 of net income available to common or 6 7 billion through the combination of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter turning to regulatory metrics our cet1 standardized ratio improved 22 basis points to 11 6 from q3 and remains well above our 9 5 requirement the improvement was driven by the increase in aoci that i just mentioned combined with a modest decline in rwa rwa decline was driven by lower global markets rwa and the sale of non core consumer loans which offset the impact of loan growth across the businesses looking at deposits on slide 11 overall average deposits grew 4 year over year a decline in non interest bearing deposits was isolated to mix shifts in global banking given the interest rate environment while interest bearing grew across every segment consumer banking deposits grew 3 as non interest bearing and low interest checking which account for over half of consumer banking s deposits grew 7 while the aggregate of money market accounts savings and cds were flat gwim also grew deposits 3 year over year gwim s deposit balances benefited from market volatilities as customers moved from investments to cash we also simplified client account structures for clients which moved funds from off balance sheet sweep accounts to deposits global banking deposits continued to grow well up 9 year over year reflecting the investments we ve made in client facing bankers and global treasury services capabilities also as mentioned earlier in global banking we saw expected rotation from non interest bearing to interest bearing deposits turning to slide 12 total loans on an average basis were 934 billion total loan growth continued to be impacted by the runoff and sales of non core consumer real estate loans near the end of the quarter and similar to last quarter we sold a potential of mostly non core consumer real estate loans with a book value of 5 billion recording a small gain focusing on loans and our business segments they were up 25 billion or 3 year over year consumer loans grew 4 year over year led by mortgage and to a lesser degree consumer credit card commercial loans grew 2 year over year as you think about starting loan levels for the new year note that toward the end of the quarter we originated several large primary investment grade financings which resulted in loans ending the quarter 13 billion higher than the average for the quarter while we would not call this a trend we were pleased with the late quarter growth turning to slide 13 net interest income on a gaap non fte was 12 3 billion or 12 5 billion on an fte basis compared with q4 17 gaap nii was up 842 million or 7 the improvement was driven by the value over deposits as interest rates rose as well as loan and deposit growth and was partially offset by higher funding costs in global markets and lower loan spreads on a linked quarter basis gaap nii was up 434 million linked quarter growth reflects the benefit of the september rate hike loan and deposit growth and lower long term debt expense net interest yield of 2 48 improved 9 basis points year over year and 6 basis points linked quarter strong improvement in our core banking activities was partially offset by the impact of lower yielding global markets assets including our global markets segment which primarily reflects our trading related assets nii from core banking activities grew almost 1 billion year over year or 9 the net interest yield on that same basis crossed 3 and is up 14 basis points year over year driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs average rate paid on interest bearing deposits of 67 basis points rose 12 basis points from q3 and is up 56 basis points versus q4 15 which was the beginning of this fed rate hike cycle turning to asset sensitivity as of 12 31 an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates above the forward curve is estimated to increase nii by 2 7 billion over the subsequent 12 months the decrease since the end of september reflects the continued shift in global banking deposits to interest bearing as well as modestly higher global banking passthrough rates note that the short end represents approximately 75 of this sensitivity as you look forward to 2019 keep in mind q1 has two less days of interest accrual which will negatively impact nii by about 200 million turning to expenses on slide 14 we finished the year with another solid quarter of expense management compared to q4 17 non interest expense of 13 1 billion was down 1 continuing our quarterly string of year over year improvements on a linked quarter basis expenses were flat as lower fdi insurance costs were offset by a couple of increases first we increased marketing in a few areas including an investment to reposition our brand and second in october we announced another shared success bonus covering 95 of our teammates despite these late year investments we reported full year expenses in line with our target which was established in the middle of 2016 and our efficiency ratio improved to 58 as we look ahead to 2019 we believe our full year expenses should approximate the 2018 expense level this expense level includes approximately 1 billion for increased spending in the aggregate in several areas normal yearly merit healthcare benefits primary from inflation marketing and the previously announced new investment initiative spending in technology as well as expansion and modernization of financial centers on a full year basis we believe we should be able to offset these investments through lower fdic insurance and other efficiencies with respect to q1 note that expenses seasonally increase compared to q4 in addition to any increase related to seasonal revenue in q1 we anticipate that q1 expense will be higher than q4 18 by approximately 500 million due to seasonal personnel costs mostly payroll tax we expect expenses should trend lower than q1 through the remaining quarters of 2019 turning to asset quality on slide 15 asset quality continued to perform very well total net charge offs were 924 million lower than both the prior quarter and the year ago quarter the net charge off ratio declined to 39 basis points as losses declined while loans grew provision expense of 905 million more closely matched losses this quarter as we had a modest 19 million net reserve release on slide 16 we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios the only thing i would note here is with respect to consumer seasoning drove credit card losses modestly higher but the loss ratio remained below 3 okay turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 17 q4 finished a strong year generating 12 billion in full year earnings in q4 earnings grew 52 year over year to 3 3 billion we created more than 1 000 bases of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 10 while expenses were held flat the all in cost of running the deposits franchise was 159 basis points this quarter which includes both the cost of deposits at 152 basis points and the average rate paid of 7 basis points this total cost ratio declined from 165 basis points in q4 17 the efficiency ratio improved nearly 500 basis points year over year to 45 credit costs showed a modest increase but remained low as we reviewed earlier we grew consumer banking deposits 3 year over year and the percentage of checking accounts that are now the primary account of a household increased to 91 consumer payments increased 7 year over year lending was also solid growing 5 year over year and merrill edge brokerage assets at the end of the quarter were up 9 billion versus year end 2017 as a 16 billion decline driven by market valuations masked strong client flows of 25 billion for the full year and customer activity in the quarter remained solid across all major product categories turning to slide 18 you can see that 10 revenue growth was driven by nii as we realized the value of our deposits through our focus on relationship deepening you will also note non interest income improved year over year from account growth and higher levels of consumer spending we experienced modest improvement in card income and service charges as discussed previously to promote relationship deepening we reduced certain fees and we provide rewards and offer discounts when customers do more with us this may reduce fees but overall it drives revenue growth especially nii we believe this approach to customers combined with our leading capabilities has produced superior deposit growth relative to the industry average we also believe it is driving customer satisfaction improvement which is at an all time high and given expense declines it s important to note the significant platform enhancements accomplished in the second half of 2018 we expanded in 26 new and existing markets in 2018 that included opening 81 new centers and renovating more than 500 all our financial centers are now equipped with wi fi turning to digital trends on slide 19 just a couple of things to highlight mobile users continued to grow crossing over 26 million we processed more than 2 5 trillion in total payments in 2018 and we saw digital as a percentage of all payments continue to grow in 2018 lowering costs reducing errors and improving customer convenience mobile and atm now account for more than three quarters of deposit transactions and mobile with all its benefits for our customers and our shareholders is now approaching half of all digital sales turning to global wealth and investment management on slide 20 gwim produced another quarter of strong results delivering client flows totaling 35 billion one of the best quarters of client flows in the company s history which is partially due to growth in net new households net income of more than 1 billion was the best quarter ever for this segment growing 42 year over year pre tax income was up 18 and our pre tax margin improved to nearly 29 the business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage growing revenue 7 while holding expense growth to 2 revenue included solid growth in nii and non interest income overcoming some of the negative impacts of a decline in the financial markets early in the quarter asset management fees were up 3 versus q4 17 driven by a solid year of aum flows but were mitigated by a decline in brokerage fees revenue also included a roughly 100 billion benefit from the sale of a non core asset associated with index sub licensing it s important to note as you look at 2019 that the december drop in equity markets doesn t actually impact aum fees until q1 19 due to the one month lag in the determination of fees for assets under management moving to slide 21 trends reflected strong client engagement in merrill lynch and u s trusts strong household growth and continued near record low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the 35 billion in overall client flows this quarter aum outflows in the quarter reflected market volatility which impacted some clients preferences versus cash and deposits at the same time we had 17 billion of positive brokerage flows which is a record we saw many of our new households begin their investing relationship with us through a new brokerage account on the banking side we had deposit flows of 21 billion as some investors increased their allocation of cash and ending loan balances grew 3 billion turning to slide 22 global banking earned 2 1 billion and generated a 20 return on allocated capital global banking achieved several records this quarter across revenue net income loan levels and deposit levels earnings were up 25 from q4 17 driven by operating leverage and tax rate benefits revenue of 5 1 billion and pre tax earnings of 2 8 billion were both up modestly year over year but this growth is understated given the impact of the tax act on tax advantaged investments in q4 18 versus q4 17 revenue was led by 4 growth in nii from strong deposit growth and higher rates but was offset by the small decline in investment banking fees the business created operating leverage as expense declined 2 versus q4 17 efficiency savings and lower deposit insurance costs more than offset continued investment in the business looking at trends on slide 23 and comparing to q4 last year since we already covered loan and deposits i ll start with ib fees ib fees of 1 3 billion for the overall firm decreased 5 year over year for context note the overall industry fee pools declined 13 from last year compared to q4 17 modestly improved m a fees only partially offset a decline in underwriting fees given the significant weakness in financing fee pools as corporations and other participants assessed significant market volatility late in the quarter switching to global markets on slide 24 i will talk about the results excluding dva global markets produced roughly 450 million of earnings in a tough quarter where market volatility increased and credit spreads widened ficc and equity financial performance diverged with equity achieving record revenue overall revenue declined 10 compared to q4 17 while expenses declined 3 q4 17 revenue included a small gain from the sale of a non core asset sales and trading declined 6 year over year to 2 5 billion ficc declined 15 while equities grew 11 ficc s lower revenue was due to weakness in credit and mortgage markets and lower client activity in credit products on the other hand equities benefited market volatility led to increased client activity producing revenue and improvements in both derivatives and in client financing activities where have been recently investing on slide 25 i would just point out the chart on the bottom left which shows at roughly 13 billion in full year revenues the relative stability of trading and sales over the past three years it also shows the stability and benefit that comes from a full and diverse set of client solutions as growth in equity revenue has made up for the decline in ficc revenue on slide 26 we show all other which reported net income of 279 million comparisons against the prior year are impacted by the charges in q4 17 associated with the tax act which reduced revenue by 946 million and increased tax expense by 1 9 billion as i mentioned earlier q4 18 included a 200 million net tax benefit expenses improved 71 million year over year okay let me close with a couple of thoughts q4 was a solid finish to a record year of earnings we controlled our costs well and invested in the future asset quality remains excellent our balance sheet is strong and we returned more earnings to shareholders and while the market may now believe interest rate hikes have stopped we believe we can grow net interest income without rate hikes assuming modest levels of loan and deposit growth with regard to things that are more in our control because of all the hard work our employees are doing to eliminate duplicative work and root out inefficiencies we expect expense in 2019 to be roughly the same as 2018 and as brian said we also don t expect any meaningful change in net charge offs in 2019 based on our years of responsible growth and our view of the credit horizon so we enter 2019 positively with a strong balance sheet and market share in businesses that positions us well for better earnings again in 2019 thanks for listening and with that let s open it up for questions questions and answers operator and at this time if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your touchtone telephone you may withdraw your question at any time by pressing once again 1 we ll take our first question from john mcdonald with bernstein please go ahead john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst hi good morning i was wondering on the loan growth front what you saw this quarter in terms of demand trends you mentioned in commercial you saw the late quarter pickup i m wondering if you attribute that to capital markets weakening but underneath that how s the core commercial demand and overall how are you feeling about loan growth prospects heading into 2019 you still thinking about gdp gdp plus a little bit as you think about responsible growth in 19 paul m donofrio chief financial officer we did see some late quarter pickup in loans in global banking i m not sure i can attribute it to the shutdown that we saw in the quarter in parts of the debt markets from a bond perspective but i wouldn t be surprised if some of that pickup was from that in terms of loan growth in our consumer and gwim segments loan growth really continues to be solid and well within our expectations as i said consumer grew 5 year over year gwim grew 4 which importantly is better than economic growth in global banking loan growth in q4 was more subdued but that s also more consistent with industry data year over year loans grew 2 i guess i would say that we think there are at least two factors impacting corporate clients first tax reform has increased cash flow and repatriation has also increased cash available for debt paydowns but having said all of that our near term expectations for loan growth are unchanged we still expect total loan growth to be in the low single digits and growth in our business segments should be at mid single digits maybe depending on economic growth on the low end of mid single digits but we still think we can achieve mid single digits john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst okay great and paul just to follow up in terms of deposit pricing what are your baseline expectations you ve been able to hold deposit pricing very nicely while growing what are your baseline expectations for deposit pricing if the fed does slow and just to clarify your nii outlook as you go into the first quarter what kind of offsets might you have to the day count headwind in terms of deposit growth and pricing paul m donofrio chief financial officer let s start with nii outlook for q1 the december rate hike and loan and deposit growth are clearly tailwinds and we just think they ll be offset by two less trading days that s the best perspective i can give you in terms of where do rates go from here look i think bank of america and indeed the rest of the industry really haven t increased deposit pricing on traditional bank accounts appreciably and again as we ve said many times at least for bank of america we deliver a lot of value to depositors between transparency convenience safety mobile banking online banking our nationwide network of financial centers the rewards we give our clients the advice and counsel all that value i think has helped us keep deposit rates relatively flat in traditional retail accounts but again we have been raising rates on accounts in gwim and in global banking so we pass a lot of value through in the form of higher deposits to those clients at some point the broader retail rates will rise we just don t know when so i think we re just going to have to wait and see john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst okay thanks operator and we ll take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo wells fargo securities managing director hi can you elaborate more on the checking deposit balance growth over the last year it s up 7 8 and i really want to get to the why brian i know you always say it s because you have good team members and everything else but how much of that growth is due to mobile banking and digital banking and of that component how much would be due to millennials brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer so mike to put in perspective i think we had 20 odd billion of fourth quarter 17 to fourth quarter 18 checking account growth in consumer as i said earlier we have been in a decade long repurposing that business including focus on primary accounts so we re 91 primary accounts the accounts we add are accretive and solid the average balance per account continues to grow that satisfaction in that business has hit an all time high across the board in terms of customer delight so it s good performance and strong performance but the key among all that is basically we are net growing checking accounts a few hundred thousand a year for the last couple years which we hadn t been for the last eight or nine years as we repositioned the old product lines and did all the consolidations even sold some branches as you re well aware to go to your question on millennials there are 50 million households in consumer 36 million digital households 26 million mobile households there are not enough millennials to meet those statistics so this is a broad based change going on and whether it s people 80 years old 70 years old 60 years old the way people use the capabilities that we have built for them is across the board so any technology adoption people often attribute it to millennials but when you think about that kind of penetration of digital practice and 1 5 billion logins a quarter 77 of the checks deposited not at the branch i e through atms and mobile deposit you just don t have enough millennials to go around so this is a broad based trend that we ve been driving and over the 10 years i talked about earlier we had 6 100 branches we have 4 200 branches we have grown checking balances there just aren t enough millennials to make that happen so it s a broad based thing i ll give you this quarter we crossed 5 million zelle users 5 million erica users now remember erica s not even a year old and 5 million preferred rewards customers who have brought their total relationship to get the benefits that is what s driving the checking growth because you get if you bring all your relationships through the reward programs we have that are integrated across all products not just card products that provides a good benefit and so it s tremendous operating leverage as paul mentioned some of the statistics and costs it s tremendous client delight it s tremendous capability tremendous efficiency and it s broad based millennials would score higher on something like erica but that would be expected long term it ll be broadly adopted in the franchise mike mayo wells fargo securities managing director great one follow up if i could i ve asked this before but what is your market share of digital banking users or at least how much of that checking account growth over the last year is due to digital banking brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer it s always hard to our market share in consumer deposits we think is around 13 15 depending on what you calculate mike and it s growing and if you look in the top 30 40 markets that we play in across the country you can see that if you just follow the fdic data you can see our deposit base continuing to grow so would it skew a little bit that way sure because younger people are opening up the relationships i d say that if you look at it the mobile adoption just to give you a sense millennials are about 80 plus gen x is 72 and boomers are 50 plus so it s across the board mike mayo wells fargo securities managing director that s helpful thank you operator our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr evercore isi managing director thanks so the roa and the rotc came in well above where i think a lot of us might have thought a few years ago so i know credit s going to pick up someday but i heard you loud and clear that the economy is good credit you expect flat expenses you expect flat and you ve seen some modest growth all that points toward while you shrink share count it s a lot better profitability so i m just looking for your thoughts around where are the bounds of where roa and rotc can go because we re good and uncharted territory here brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer i m not sure i d agree i agree with everything you said until the very last part glenn when you said good and uncharted the roas are solid if you think about it 100 basis points in a quarter those are getting to numbers which are solid performance to rotc so because of tax reform those all moved up we ve moved that up to a higher level now and you re seeing us run at a rate which we d expect to continue with the economy growing a couple percent if the economy shrinks or something that s a different question we sort of think that this model all the things you cited in the opening to your question is the model which is grow in a faster economy keep the expenses flat keep the credit risk in check and drive that operating leverage and bring the share count down so you re saying what we re doing and i m just not sure the returns will incrementally move up there was a fundamental resetting obviously through not only the operating performance but the tax reform but now they ll grind forward a little bit but they ll be in that range 14 16 return on tangible common equity and maybe move up higher than that on a given quarter but i think we re in a solid place right now glenn schorr evercore isi managing director i appreciate it maybe one question on markets ficc particularly i ll overgeneralize there too spreads widen out and the market does what it does volatility becomes bad for a little while when it happens quickly in fixed income as we saw i know it s early but spreads have tightened liquidity has improved markets are dethawing directionally can you recoup what was lost without putting numbers on it if markets normalize in other words in the old days the opposite would happen spreads tighten up flows pick up and you can have great market environments has anything changed from the past brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer i think the simple way to put it it s all of two weeks into the quarter or whatever is that we ve seen the normal progression that you see from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and it s solid out there right now and the equities business is stronger as we referenced earlier but all the pieces you had are all pieces of it but overall our trading revenue has been fairly consistent every year it came out of every quarter and every year differently but it s basically been 13 odd billion year after year with a total range of maybe 500 700 million just to give you a sense i don t have the numbers right in front of me so the model is a moving model so there s not a lot of markdowns markup stuff which you d have seen more in 08 09 all the stuff is marked and moving through at 100 miles an hour there s no storage going on we ve seen the recovery and the activity of clients that s good news and you ve probably seen it with your clients and that s been good so you ve seen that pick up but we ve gotta get through some things in the atmosphere out there to make sure that sustains for the quarter glenn schorr evercore isi managing director okay tiny little follow up on that is the average trading assets picked up the last couple of years your capital base improved you put up good results so the bar is going down while it s going is there anything in that pickup in the trading related assets that was just year end parking as opposed to just bigger brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer remember we the team in equities they had to retool a lot of the platform put a lot of technology in about 24 months ago tom montag and the team said they re ready to start really pushing our capabilities out in the market and as i said earlier we got 70 new clients in the fourth quarter in our equities business so the balance sheet growth has been in support of the equities business and remember it s very low risk and very low rwa but that s been fairly consistent build over time it ll ebb and flow a little bit by market values because of the way it works but it s really because the equities business the investments we made in technologies and capabilities have now turned out into providing balance sheet capacity and capability of the prime brokerage business glenn schorr evercore isi managing director perfect thank you operator we ll take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy graseck morgan stanley managing director hi good morning a couple questions one is just a question on how you expect to be managing in the event that the downside happens so what if some of the negative things pan out and revenues come in a little bit lighter can you talk through where you have expense leverage if you have any or do you keep the expenses flat in a tougher environment brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer assuming an environment of gdp decline is i think what the base of your question is you would obviously probably see a market decline that would bring incentive related compensation down that instantaneously happens frankly if we re not earning as much that s obviously an outcome so there d be those types of things we could always choose not to invest but i think if you looked at what we re investing in you d say keep going honestly as a shareholder it d be the better answer for the company because the technology investments allow us to take long term expenses down and things like that so there s always leverage you can pull but that s the business model we ve been operating for many years now has been to constantly be pulling those levers with time it allows you to manage the company much more carefully and allows attrition to be your friend in terms of head count but the key is to just keep driving the operating leverage so if revenues flatten you ve gotta get the expenses down a little bit to make it all work and keep it positive and we re focused on it so we ll see what happens you have to have what the constituent parts of the backdrop are but mechanically some of the expenses come down just due to pure revenue related incentives betsy graseck morgan stanley managing director got it so even if the revenue environment is a little weaker you think you can generate positive operating leverage brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer well we ve been able to do it if you go back and look at that chart on quarterly operating leverage it has come in quarters where revenue fell and that s the key it may not be as big in other words the net operating leverage but the culture we built in this company to operating excellence and simplify and improve and the idea generation we went through 4 200 ideas over the last four or five years we re continuing to generate them with looking through every single process and taking apart mapping and understanding the data flows how we can automate it and it s very incremental these are not huge spend 1 billion and see if it works when you add them all up we do spend 1 billion but it s a bunch of small projects so those are always moving down into our benefit as we move through it and so i think if you look at that operating leverage yeah if revenues were flat because of whatever s going on out there we should be able to manage expenses underneath it betsy graseck morgan stanley managing director and then could you speak a little bit to the investment spend that you re making in the investment bank and in particular in which geographies you re really looking to increase your market share brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer i think the u s being the biggest fee pool by far as people talk about it we continue to do that we feel pretty good about the team we have in asia in europe we re going to add some there but the real key is to cover deeper in the client base outside the united states we cover the largest companies in the world largest investors in the world inside the united states because of the nature of our business we cover from small businesses all the way through the largest companies and the piece that we probably gave up coverage on that we gotta go back in is sort of the upper end of the middle market and a broader base so we re adding resources middle market investment bankers that work with alastair borthwick s team on matthew koder s team working with them to drive it we re adding more coverage deeper in the industry groups and so it s a broadening out of the u s in north america that ll be the biggest explicit build you ll see but a lot of this is just filling in the cracks and making sure that we ve got that coverage really owned in the united states from the smallest company to the largest company for all their capital markets needs and m a needs and outside it s really picking our industries and our fine tuning which we ve done betsy graseck morgan stanley managing director okay thank you operator we ll take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak wolfe research executive director hi good morning i wanted to start off with a question on capital return capital ratios ended the year flat versus 4q 17 standard ended at an impressive 11 6 i think it s fair to say that you re currently operating with substantial levels of excess capital and just given your strong track record in the stress test as we look to benchmark against how much capital return you could support or what you re sufficiently comfortable with you did 96 i think that was the number that was cited in the prepared remarks are you in a position at this point especially given some of the recent decline in the share price to take full advantage and maybe exceed 100 payout in the coming stress test cycle paul m donofrio chief financial officer well let me start off with a couple level setting points we clearly as everyone has seen have been growing our capital return to shareholders consistently for many years now so that s one point we increased our dividend 25 last year we increased our buybacks by 8 billion and last year when you put it all together based upon what we submitted we were at a little over 100 payout ratio if you look at our ccar results which you alluded to we did have a significant cushion using the fed s results considering the severity of last year s scenario and as you point out our own capital cushion we would hope expect to have room to at a minimum sustain that payout ratio if not increase it but we ve got to see the scenario first that s the one caveat steven chubak wolfe research executive director understood just one follow up on some of the remarks relating to tlac increased issuance of tlac eligible debt while this is maybe an underappreciated fact it s been a substantial dampener of nii expansion over the last few years and paul show me you can update us on where that ratio sits today and whether there s a target level that you re thinking about i m just trying to gauge what the opportunity is to optimize that tlac ratio how we can think about the potential benefit from replacing that with cheaper deposit funding paul m donofrio chief financial officer we re not disclosing what our tlac ratio is but i will say that as we sit here today we have a comfortable cushion and as you also heard in my prepared remarks the debt issuances this year are likely going to be less than maturities steven chubak wolfe research executive director okay looking forward to more updates in the future just one final follow up from me on credit loss expectations brian you made an interesting remark at a conference recently in december noting that you expect through the cycle loss expectations to come in well below 90 basis points but at the same time didn t really commit to an explicit level or expectation and given the late cycle rhetoric the focus on particularly from long onlys with longer horizons as to what through the cycle loss expectations might be and all the balance sheet cleansing you ve accomplished i was wondering if you could maybe provide us with some sort of benchmark or target expectation that we can compare you guys against versus peers just given many have provided at least medium term or through the cycle loss expectations already brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer earlier i said what i expected for 19 charge offs in the range of where they are now the point that i think we were talking about at the conference is around the construction of the portfolio what they were last cycle versus this cycle for us we had 250 billion of unsecured consumer credit card and other types of unsecured debt so just sheer volume that is completely different and that took frankly a lot of work to get us repositioned to where we have it so just using that example and if you look at charge offs go back in 2010 i think there are 30 odd billion in the years and a big part of it was credit card and related unsecured debt restructured credit card loans that was due to the fact in the mid 2000s with the best data analytics and the best underwriting team in the business we were underwriting with a 5 charge off expectation and a good economy and it turned out to be a bad economy and it turned out to be a consumer led problem and that led to much higher charge offs you can then run that same story through home equities and other things and so if you look at the size of the consumer book it s much smaller then you flip it over and talk about the quality underwriting so now our expectations are 3 5 4 charge off rate in a 7 8 unemployment type levels versus 5 6 before and moving on beyond there so you ve got both a rate and a volume question on home equity and unsecured consumer credit that is much different and then you go to mortgage same story then you flip over to commercial credit and we ve always had wonderful commercial credit experience go back to the late 90s through the fallen angel crisis go back through the last crisis we underwrite commercial credit better than anybody in the business and yet we still have balance there and you see the array of risk is across the board we ve managed the limits at the industry level at the country level and all that stuff so we expect the outcome to be even better than it was last time there and we watch the snic and all the different things that give us that comfort but the real asset test is look at the stress test if you look at the stress test and say under that scenario with no preparation and no ability to change during the nine quarters if you look at card if i remember right of the top of my head i think the total charge offs for the nine quarters are around 11 12 something like that if you de annualize that you think of that under that scenario of unemployment going from 4 ish to the pace it goes up and you end up with about 5 per year that just shows you the difference in the underlying quality but it was a conscious effort to give up a lot of revenue to get the company more balanced so that through a crisis it would perform completely different all that i m not going to give you a target because i don t have a scenario i m giving that target but it ll be much better than the last time steven chubak wolfe research executive director despite no explicit target very helpful color so thank you brian for taking my questions and all the insights operator our next question is from matt o connor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt o connor deutsche bank managing director good morning i was wondering if you could talk about your thoughts on managing interest rate risk given the drop in most parts of the curve lowered expectations for future short hikes and maybe specifically the securities book is it worth reinvesting proceeds into securities or do you keep it shorter hoping for a backup in rates paul m donofrio chief financial officer first thing to think about as we look at that securities book we re always balancing earnings against capital and liquidity that s a dynamic process that happens daily certainly weekly we don t take any credit risk in that investment portfolio that s the other thing i always like to stress when we talk about it so we look at it and we re always sort of trying to figure out whether we should do a little bit more of this or a little bit less of that if you look at this quarter by the way we have a little bit less sitting at the fed because we did some overnight very high quality reverse repo because the yields were just higher so yeah we re looking at it we look at it all the time matt o connor deutsche bank managing director and from a nim percent perspective i realize there s some puts and takes specifically with the trading book but in a stable rate environment you did mention you could grow the net interest income dollars can you get stability in the nim should we really think about it as nii being driven by balance sheet or is there some risk that the nim erodes a little bit in the stable rate environment paul m donofrio chief financial officer we look at it if you look at q1 i would expect nim to edge up a little bit driven by loan growth funded by low cost deposits longer term nim is really going to depend on the forward curve and our ability to lag deposit rate paid matt o connor deutsche bank managing director okay and then just separately if i could squeeze it in did you guys comment on the tax rate for 2019 sorry if i missed that paul m donofrio chief financial officer i don t think we did actually we re expecting an effective tax rate for 2019 of approximately 19 absent unusual items matt o connor deutsche bank managing director okay thank you operator our next question is from jim mitchell with buckingham research please go ahead james mitchell buckingham research analyst good morning maybe you could just talk a little bit about leverage winding risk how you think about it how you manage it obviously that s been a big topic lately given the freezing of the markets in december in particular just your thoughts from here around your own book and the industry paul m donofrio chief financial officer sure so the first thing i would say is we re staying focused and have been focused on responsible growth so we re maintaining our underwriting standards and we re staying within and have now for years stayed within our portfolio limits our exposure to leveraged lending is primarily through underwriting and distributing leveraged loans we have very little for example cll exposure at the company because as i just pointed out we don t hold that kind of risk in our investment portfolio having said that leveraged finance is a very important part of our franchise and if it s done well it supports economic growth our leveraged finance franchise does well over 1 billion so nothing s really changed for us if you re going to be in this business if you re going to be a leader in this business as we are you ve got to be there when the market s good and when the market s not and we are but doing it our way sticking to our standards james mitchell buckingham research analyst how do you manage size any thoughts have you taken down the amount you re willing to put on the balance sheet at least in the short term or how do we think about how you manage today versus what you did a year ago brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer as i said earlier in response to another question we re in the moving business not the storage business as risk goes so we have limits for the transitory process of doing the underwritings we mark them move them out and it s gone and so this is not how much as paul said we make lots of commercial credit available to our clients but in the underwriting part of the business which is what you re talking about it all goes out the door it s not a hold business james mitchell buckingham research analyst okay that s helpful and maybe just a question on cecl any thoughts on the impact and given some of the pushback do you see any parts of it changing just your thoughts on cecl paul m donofrio chief financial officer sure so in terms of the impact we re not at the point yet where we re providing an estimate we have made a ton of progress on our efforts toward adoption however there s still a lot of things that need to be finalized before we re ready to talk about impacts i would point out that we re not overly concerned at this point and it certainly is not going to change how we re going to serve our clients having said that we may see an increase in allowance upon adoption maybe maybe not it s ultimately going to depend on the economic outlook and credit conditions as of the adoption date in 1 1 2020 the only other issue out there is the double count in ccar and how it s going to affect capital and with respect to that i think the regulators and us are thinking about a lot of things but the only two i would point out is we just need to understand the implications on capital and how it affects the willingness of banks to extend credit as i said before i don t think it s going to change how we operate our company if cecl is in the company run stress test but not in the fed s what are the implications of that there are still a lot of things to work out here between now and i think that s why they delayed the implementation of cecl in the stress test until 2022 i think james mitchell buckingham research analyst okay great thanks for your thoughts operator our next question is from saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez ubs investment bank managing director hi good morning everybody most of my questions have been asked but i ll just follow up i guess on the earlier question on your ability what a fed pause would mean for your nim and i think you mentioned paul that it really depends on the forward curve and the ability to lag on deposit rates but on that point how much of a risk do you see of a lag effect on deposit rates specifically on retail deposit rates which really haven t moved much in this rate tightening cycle how much of a risk do you see that in an environment where we pause the economy s still doing ok but we do see a lagged effect and you start to see a bit more deposit cost pressure on the retail side than maybe we ve seen up until now paul m donofrio chief financial officer if i ve got it right it was two fed rates three years ago three two years ago and four last year something like that so if you just noodle in and look at the different movement from the end of 17 to the end of 18 given think of it as a lag basis what was embedded in it just isn t a lot of movement because they re checking accounts and checking accounts never have high interest rates on them and half of them are non interest bearing so they don t have any interest rate on them it really comes down to who the customer is how they use the cash is it transactional cash is it investment cash either short term or long term and each business line is different but in the consumer business what is driving our deposit growth is the 20 billion from fourth quarter 17 to fourth quarter 18 in checking balance growth which will always be tremendously advantaged from the perspective you re coming at it which is a funding basis and as they grow and we don t feel there s not a lot of pressure because half of it is non interest bearing accounts you can just go back and look at the pricing across time in these businesses and see what s happened if you look at it and i think you ll feel that we should be able to consistently drive that in the rate sensitive side i e where it s investment cash the rates have moved up substantially already and we re growing those balances so we tell our team to price to grow deposits 3 4 i e better than the economy and they ve got to achieve that balance and they ve done a great job saul martinez ubs investment bank managing director that s helpful you may also just another question you made the point that the equity market downturn in december will hit fees in the first quarter and we can obviously do our own calculations of the roll forward in the asset values but is there any way to size up what the magnitude of the downturn in the fourth quarter in the markets could mean for fees in that sense paul m donofrio chief financial officer it s a good question i hesitate to give you a number because the revenue is based upon a lot of different things besides just what the level of the markets are i think it would be misleading to come up with a number just based upon the markets to everybody on this call so maybe if you call back in lee and his team can help you think through what the issues are more broadly but we re not going to give a number today saul martinez ubs investment bank managing director okay that s fair enough thanks a lot i appreciate it lee mcentire senior vice president investor relations okay i think that s all do we have one more question operator yes we do have one final question from brian kleinhanzl please go ahead your line is open brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods managing director great thanks for taking my questions i hear you on the net charge off guidance for 2019 relative to 2018 but how are you thinking about reserve builds reserve releases were 500 million this quarter do you still think you ll be able to release reserves at that pace next year as well paul m donofrio chief financial officer just to run through it for everybody we think that provision we think credit is going to continue to perform well hopefully everybody heard that on the call and we would expect provision to roughly match net charge offs depending on loan growth you heard us talk about what we re expecting for net charge offs the releases are coming down you saw they were 19 million this quarter you re going to see our provision much more closely match net charge offs going forward because we ve seen a lot of improvement in that consumer real estate portfolio so that s the best guidance i can give you brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods managing director okay and then just one follow up on credit we ve seen the commercial npls pick up this quarter and it s been a pretty steady downward trend in those since 2016 is it just because of the market conditions or can you give a little bit more color there as to why the uptick in this quarter thanks paul m donofrio chief financial officer sure at 22 basis points npls as a percentage of loans is basically at an historic low here there was an increase in the quarter driven by a couple of names that were downgraded if you look at reservable criticized exposure it continued to fall in the quarter so again we don t see anything suggesting a broad based decline in the overall credit quality brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods managing director okay thanks for taking my questions brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer okay i think that s all the questions thank you for joining us again we had a strong solid quarter and 2018 was a strong year for this company with record earnings as we look forward into 2019 as i said earlier the predictions of potential slowdown in the economy don t enervate us they invigorate us we built this company to operate in that setting we ll continue to drive responsible growth and we look forward to talking to you next quarter operator this will conclude today s program thanks for your

by winni zhou and andrew galbraith shanghai reuters china s central bank injected a record 83 billion into the country s financial system on wednesday seeking to avoid a cash crunch that would put further pressure on the weakening economy china s policymakers are pledging to step up stimulus measures this year and do more to protect jobs as economic growth cools to 28 year lows but a raft of measures last year from big rail projects to tax cuts seem to have had little impact so far with recent data suggesting activity is cooling more quickly than expected the news is clear the economy needs help said trinh nguyen senior economist for emerging asia at natixis in hong kong wednesday s open market operation the bank s largest net single day injection on record came a day after china s state planner central bank and finance ministry all offered reassurances to investors signalling more spending and other types of policy support but shockingly weak december trade data released earlier this week along with shrinking factory activity are stirring speculation over whether more rapid and aggressive policy measures are needed to turn the world s second largest economy around authorities now agree the economy needs more decisive support and today s large injection reflects that nguyen added the people s bank of china pboc said wednesday s injection was aimed at ensuring there are ample funds in the financial system which is facing strains as tax payments peak in mid january and as demand for cash picks up ahead of the lunar new year holidays starting in early february the banking system s overall liquidity is falling rapidly it said in a statement while sizable injections are common this time of year ahead of the long holidays the addition was much heftier than usual and follows a large cut in banks reserve ratios announced this month which will free up a total of 116 billion for new bank lending the first stage a 50 basis point cut came into effect on tuesday an equal sized cut is scheduled for jan 25 the move also came a day after money supply data showed several of china s key credit gauges continue to languish around record lows despite government efforts to channel more funds to cash starved companies and lower their financing costs while authorities have urged banks to keep lending to struggling firms and even dangled incentives banks are wary of bad loans after a long regulatory crackdown on riskier lending many businesses facing slowing sales are in no mood to make the fresh investments that beijing is counting on new medium and long term corporate loans last month fell to less than half of average december levels nomura noted more help on the way chinese officials have repeatedly pledged more support for the economy while vowing they will not resort to flood like stimulus that beijing has unleashed in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt asked if the pboc needed to cut benchmark interest rates a pboc deputy said on tuesday that existing policy measures should be improved analysts at ocbc said the comments suggest the pboc is willing to give existing measures time to work and is in no rush to switch to more aggressive tactics at this point i have never seen such huge amounts of reverse repos the central bank is making its attitude known said a trader at a brokerage house in shanghai it s saying don t question my determination to stabilise market expectations the trader said markets appear to agree that policymakers will stick with modest measures for some time yet chinese stocks and money market rates sensitive to hints of policy shifts were little changed on wednesday the seven day repo rate a closely watched measure of liquidity was 2 6142 percent on wednesday afternoon slightly lower than the previous day s close while the pboc s net injection is big it s little versus what a rate cut would release which is what people in the market are watching for said ken cheung senior asian fx strategist at mizuho in hong kong weakest growth in 3 decades in a rare encouraging sign home prices remained buoyant in december suggesting that at least some of beijing s efforts at support are beginning to have an effect construction also appears to be slowly picking up as regulators fast track approvals of more infrastructure projects but analysts agree steps so far will take some time to percolate through the broader economy with most not expecting activity to convincingly bottom out until summer on monday china is expected to report the economy grew 6 6 percent in 2018 cooling from 6 9 percent the previous year and the slowest rate of expansion the country has seen in 28 years the pace is expected to slow further to around 6 2 percent this year some analysts in house models suggesting activity is already much weaker than official data suggests darkening the picture further hopes are dimming once again that china will be able to reach a trade deal with the united states in current negotiations u s tariffs have increasingly weighed on chinese exports in recent months disrupting its supply chains and dragging down

forward looking statements please refer to either our earnings release documents our website or our sec filings with that take it away brian more from the motley fool brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter results and 2018 results before paul walks you through some of the details of the latest quarter i wanted to review what our 200 000 teammates produced for you in 2018 this year and in fact this quarter were continuing examples of how our shareholder model works for you so let s start on slide 2 we grew the top line a little better than the economy we managed costs and risks well we invested heavily in our leading capabilities and in our teammates and that benefited all of you as we returned almost all of our earnings to you looking at full year results we reported record earnings for our company of 28 billion after tax or 2 61 per share revenue grew a little better than gdp at 3 and when discussing the growth rate over 2017 we re increasing 2017 baseline as shown to add back the charges taken to the tax act last year our client base has expanded and in our key business our market leadership positions continued to improve deposits and loans within our business segments grew a little better than the economy we managed expenses well and hit our target for 2018 which we established a few years ago in fact our expenses were down 2 for the year and that helped achieve 6 operating leverage we also believe we managed risk well as net charge offs remain at decade lows driving these elements allowed us to grow pre tax earnings at 15 and we used our capital to reduce shares and that allowed us to grow eps faster than the earnings growth rate and importantly we believe the same focus on responsible growth and the laser focus on controlling what we can allows us to continue to improve results for 2019 as you can see on slide 3 every line of business contributed to our growth and earned well above our company s cost of capital and each line of business had superior efficiency through a focus on operating leverage i put three years on this page so you can see the improvement across the business for multiple years this is not a recent phenomenon and will continue in 2019 we expect to continue to drive incremental improvement in these businesses as we take advantage of our very strong franchise and continued investments in digitalization and operating efficiency as well as our relationship management capacity and core products and services let me give you a few examples in our consumer banking after a decade of simplifying our products reviewing our focus on primary accounts transforming our delivery network and driving deeper relationships for our customers we have seen net new checking accounts growing and those are growing with the same strong core attributes as our existing book savings accounts and credit cards have seen the same progress in our merrill edge investment assets we had a 21 year over year increase in funded brokerage assets and 25 billion of net client flows in merrill lynch we grew net relationships four times faster in 2018 than 2017 we saw a record number of our experienced 1 million and 5 million producers in the financial advisor population in our u s trust team we grew households by 9 last year andy sieg and katy knox who have been recently added to my management team are driving continued success in these businesses our commercial and business banking continues to build relationships net new relationship additions increased 32 for global commercial banking our middle market business and 28 for business banking comparing 2018 to 2017 and when you go on the institutional investor side of the house through our investments in the business and increased balance sheet commitment to our clients we are seeing an expansion of our prime brokerage business and as a result we had a record revenue year in our equities business in the fourth quarter alone we added 70 new clients for our equities team as you turn to slide 4 one of the drivers of an expansion in our client base is the fruit of multiple years of continuous improvement in our franchise these investments have improved the capabilities and processes used to serve our customers and we ve added this talent and these capabilities without net expense growth to enable this investment we have driven a culture of expense management that has reduced costs significantly over the past nine years while increasing our customer service scores and capabilities this has led to a 30 billion annual reduction in our expense base since 2010 the team has done great work for you here accomplishing significant savings to the bottom line and at the same time industry leading investment levels in technology physical platform and talent we face the same inflationary cost challenges everybody faces increases wage increases real estate cost increases more investment everything that we face and we still hit our 2018 expense target of approximately 53 billion and as paul will reiterate in a bit we expect those expenses to remain in that neighborhood for 2019 and 2020 and this year our efficiency ratio was at 58 these expense reductions and increased revenue have resulted in substantial operating leverage now take a look at slide 5 16 consecutive quarters of operating leverage every quarter for four straight years even in periods of revenue decline we were able to reduce expenses even more during that four year period we have invested 12 million in new technology initiatives retooled every single atm in the company rehabbed 1 500 branches built hundreds of new branches added new administrative facilities and added relationship management sales teammates and we ve also shared success with our teammates our shared success program we announced at the end of 17 we also continued at the end of 18 the two programs combined added over 1 billion to all but the top 5 of our team in annual compensation if you go to the next slide slide 6 one of the things that helped us deliver these earnings and growth has been the net increase in net interest income over the last several years once in a while i get asked by you did you capture the value of the rate curve normalizing that you told us you would the simple answer is yes and you can see it here but we delivered more than that on slide 6 you see the improvement in nii every year since 2015 nii is up 8 billion in the past four years what we often miss here it wasn t solely driven by higher rates it was driven by our business model the business model drives strong core deposit growth coupled with strong pricing discipline but it s also not just about the positives driving core nii takes good core loan growth as well and we have seen growth in loans across the business this continues to strongly help nii growth so you can see these on the right hand side average deposits grew more than 150 billion after the past four years at a 4 compound annual growth rate loans in our business grew 140 billion or 6 cagr over the same four years the specific point to demonstrate this we have grown consumer checking balances at bank of america for 40 quarters in a row a stat our consumer team would be proud of and by the way that was 200 billion in core checking of balances added across that decade so as we look forward into 2019 and consider the debate of whether nii can grow if short term rate increases stop or slow we will drive what we control with loan and deposit growth and even in an unchanged rate environment that should produce more nii one of the other areas for improvement has been a continuingly increasing amount of capital we ve been able to return to you our shareholders take a look at slide 7 as we ve increased earnings we ve also increased the return of those earnings in the form of both increased dividends as well as share repurchases this quarter we crossed an important milestone for our team fully diluted shares moved under 10 billion with more than 1 4 billion shares lower than the peak in 2013 and the lowest since 2009 it s the same great company it has more earnings more capital but 14 less shares than the peak and we see much more head so we strive to deliver what we control more customers more activities from those customers whether it s loans whether it s deposits whether it s assets under management whether it s underwriting fees whether it s trading revenue we continue to drive what we control and we control the risk and expenses and we do this while driving our competitive advantage through increasing investments in people technology and physical platform what does that sound like it sounds like another year of driving responsible growth now before i ask paul to dive in the quarter i wanted to give you we all are facing a perceived change in the operating environment with predictions in the year ahead reflecting a range of outcomes from gdp growth in the mid 2s to lower growth to recession i wanted to give you two perspectives one from our research team and the second from what we see in our client base let s first focus on the views of our research team one of the best there is the united states economy the largest in the world grew at the highest rate in a decade with a long recovery in 2018 we still have low inflation rising wages low unemployment and despite the increases in rates interest rates remain at all time lows our research team predicts economic growth to be lower in 2019 than it was in 2018 as do the general economic community however it is true these estimates still point to solid growth for 2019 our research team has global gdp growth at 3 5 and the research team has the u s gdp growth at 2 5 which is higher than any but one year in the last seven but the second view is through our customers and this strongly support a solid growth view in our consumer business we processed in 2018 more than 2 8 trillion in consumer payments and cash consumption that s a large sample of the u s gdp that data shows that the consumer spending was 8 5 higher for all of 2018 than 2017 that growth rate remains solid in december and january even as comparables are increasing due to strong growth in the end of 17 and early 18 we also see a lot of credit flows as one of the larger commercial and consumer lenders in the united states those flows are solid reflecting customer confidence responsible borrowing and lending we talk to a lot of clients we survey a lot of clients we monitor their asset quality and we ve seen it remain strong as net loss ratios are at record lows we see no problems in the near term horizon and expect charge offs to remain around 1 billion or so for the rest of 19 we also see this company s business as healthy making more money and continuing to invest our small business clients remain optimistic our most recent survey shows that the geopolitical climate however affects all of this it provides a backdrop of obdurate uncertainty trade wars government shutdown china slowdown e u slowdown brexit you name it both here and abroad impact people s economic growth outlook we are mindful of those potential impacts but we see in the u s strong indications of continued growth due to the benefits we have here in our economy so given the slowdown predicted it does not enervate us it invigorates us we look forward to continuing to produce strong results in 2019 by driving responsible growth with that let me turn it over to paul paul m donofrio chief financial officer thanks brian i m starting on slide 8 and referring to the highlights on slide 9 as well bank of america reported net income of 7 3 billion or 0 70 per diluted share as you recall q4 17 included significant charges for the tax act all the year over year results i will review adjust for those charges on that adjusted basis comparing q4 18 to q4 17 we grew revenue 6 pre tax earnings 22 net income by 39 and with the 6 reduction in shares eps by 49 this growth was driven by 7 operating leverage and strong asset quality the effective tax rate of 16 for the quarter included a net tax benefit of approximately 200 million related to a few items the benefit was driven by updated tax cut and with respect to the tax act and international earnings this benefit was partially offset by charges related to a variety of other tax matters year over year return on assets and equity improved significantly turning to the balance sheet on slide 10 overall compared to the end of q3 the balance sheet grew 16 billion driven by commercial loan growth liquidity remains strong with average global liquidity sources of 544 billion and all liquidity metrics remain well above requirements long term debt declined 5 billion with maturities outpacing issuances we are comfortably in compliance with the tlac rules that became effective in january especially in light of the recent reduction in our method 1 gsib given our robust funding levels we expect our parent debt issuances in 2019 will likely be less than maturities total shareholder equity increased 3 billion from q3 as aoci benefited from increases in the value of our afs debt securities given the decline in loan and rates we returned 95 of net income available to common or 6 7 billion through the combination of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter turning to regulatory metrics our cet1 standardized ratio improved 22 basis points to 11 6 from q3 and remains well above our 9 5 requirement the improvement was driven by the increase in aoci that i just mentioned combined with a modest decline in rwa rwa decline was driven by lower global markets rwa and the sale of non core consumer loans which offset the impact of loan growth across the businesses looking at deposits on slide 11 overall average deposits grew 4 year over year a decline in non interest bearing deposits was isolated to mix shifts in global banking given the interest rate environment while interest bearing grew across every segment consumer banking deposits grew 3 as non interest bearing and low interest checking which account for over half of consumer banking s deposits grew 7 while the aggregate of money market accounts savings and cds were flat gwim also grew deposits 3 year over year gwim s deposit balances benefited from market volatilities as customers moved from investments to cash we also simplified client account structures for clients which moved funds from off balance sheet sweep accounts to deposits global banking deposits continued to grow well up 9 year over year reflecting the investments we ve made in client facing bankers and global treasury services capabilities also as mentioned earlier in global banking we saw expected rotation from non interest bearing to interest bearing deposits turning to slide 12 total loans on an average basis were 934 billion total loan growth continued to be impacted by the runoff and sales of non core consumer real estate loans near the end of the quarter and similar to last quarter we sold a potential of mostly non core consumer real estate loans with a book value of 5 billion recording a small gain focusing on loans and our business segments they were up 25 billion or 3 year over year consumer loans grew 4 year over year led by mortgage and to a lesser degree consumer credit card commercial loans grew 2 year over year as you think about starting loan levels for the new year note that toward the end of the quarter we originated several large primary investment grade financings which resulted in loans ending the quarter 13 billion higher than the average for the quarter while we would not call this a trend we were pleased with the late quarter growth turning to slide 13 net interest income on a gaap non fte was 12 3 billion or 12 5 billion on an fte basis compared with q4 17 gaap nii was up 842 million or 7 the improvement was driven by the value over deposits as interest rates rose as well as loan and deposit growth and was partially offset by higher funding costs in global markets and lower loan spreads on a linked quarter basis gaap nii was up 434 million linked quarter growth reflects the benefit of the september rate hike loan and deposit growth and lower long term debt expense net interest yield of 2 48 improved 9 basis points year over year and 6 basis points linked quarter strong improvement in our core banking activities was partially offset by the impact of lower yielding global markets assets including our global markets segment which primarily reflects our trading related assets nii from core banking activities grew almost 1 billion year over year or 9 the net interest yield on that same basis crossed 3 and is up 14 basis points year over year driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs average rate paid on interest bearing deposits of 67 basis points rose 12 basis points from q3 and is up 56 basis points versus q4 15 which was the beginning of this fed rate hike cycle turning to asset sensitivity as of 12 31 an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates above the forward curve is estimated to increase nii by 2 7 billion over the subsequent 12 months the decrease since the end of september reflects the continued shift in global banking deposits to interest bearing as well as modestly higher global banking passthrough rates note that the short end represents approximately 75 of this sensitivity as you look forward to 2019 keep in mind q1 has two less days of interest accrual which will negatively impact nii by about 200 million turning to expenses on slide 14 we finished the year with another solid quarter of expense management compared to q4 17 non interest expense of 13 1 billion was down 1 continuing our quarterly string of year over year improvements on a linked quarter basis expenses were flat as lower fdi insurance costs were offset by a couple of increases first we increased marketing in a few areas including an investment to reposition our brand and second in october we announced another shared success bonus covering 95 of our teammates despite these late year investments we reported full year expenses in line with our target which was established in the middle of 2016 and our efficiency ratio improved to 58 as we look ahead to 2019 we believe our full year expenses should approximate the 2018 expense level this expense level includes approximately 1 billion for increased spending in the aggregate in several areas normal yearly merit healthcare benefits primary from inflation marketing and the previously announced new investment initiative spending in technology as well as expansion and modernization of financial centers on a full year basis we believe we should be able to offset these investments through lower fdic insurance and other efficiencies with respect to q1 note that expenses seasonally increase compared to q4 in addition to any increase related to seasonal revenue in q1 we anticipate that q1 expense will be higher than q4 18 by approximately 500 million due to seasonal personnel costs mostly payroll tax we expect expenses should trend lower than q1 through the remaining quarters of 2019 turning to asset quality on slide 15 asset quality continued to perform very well total net charge offs were 924 million lower than both the prior quarter and the year ago quarter the net charge off ratio declined to 39 basis points as losses declined while loans grew provision expense of 905 million more closely matched losses this quarter as we had a modest 19 million net reserve release on slide 16 we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios the only thing i would note here is with respect to consumer seasoning drove credit card losses modestly higher but the loss ratio remained below 3 okay turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 17 q4 finished a strong year generating 12 billion in full year earnings in q4 earnings grew 52 year over year to 3 3 billion we created more than 1 000 bases of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 10 while expenses were held flat the all in cost of running the deposits franchise was 159 basis points this quarter which includes both the cost of deposits at 152 basis points and the average rate paid of 7 basis points this total cost ratio declined from 165 basis points in q4 17 the efficiency ratio improved nearly 500 basis points year over year to 45 credit costs showed a modest increase but remained low as we reviewed earlier we grew consumer banking deposits 3 year over year and the percentage of checking accounts that are now the primary account of a household increased to 91 consumer payments increased 7 year over year lending was also solid growing 5 year over year and merrill edge brokerage assets at the end of the quarter were up 9 billion versus year end 2017 as a 16 billion decline driven by market valuations masked strong client flows of 25 billion for the full year and customer activity in the quarter remained solid across all major product categories turning to slide 18 you can see that 10 revenue growth was driven by nii as we realized the value of our deposits through our focus on relationship deepening you will also note non interest income improved year over year from account growth and higher levels of consumer spending we experienced modest improvement in card income and service charges as discussed previously to promote relationship deepening we reduced certain fees and we provide rewards and offer discounts when customers do more with us this may reduce fees but overall it drives revenue growth especially nii we believe this approach to customers combined with our leading capabilities has produced superior deposit growth relative to the industry average we also believe it is driving customer satisfaction improvement which is at an all time high and given expense declines it s important to note the significant platform enhancements accomplished in the second half of 2018 we expanded in 26 new and existing markets in 2018 that included opening 81 new centers and renovating more than 500 all our financial centers are now equipped with wi fi turning to digital trends on slide 19 just a couple of things to highlight mobile users continued to grow crossing over 26 million we processed more than 2 5 trillion in total payments in 2018 and we saw digital as a percentage of all payments continue to grow in 2018 lowering costs reducing errors and improving customer convenience mobile and atm now account for more than three quarters of deposit transactions and mobile with all its benefits for our customers and our shareholders is now approaching half of all digital sales turning to global wealth and investment management on slide 20 gwim produced another quarter of strong results delivering client flows totaling 35 billion one of the best quarters of client flows in the company s history which is partially due to growth in net new households net income of more than 1 billion was the best quarter ever for this segment growing 42 year over year pre tax income was up 18 and our pre tax margin improved to nearly 29 the business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage growing revenue 7 while holding expense growth to 2 revenue included solid growth in nii and non interest income overcoming some of the negative impacts of a decline in the financial markets early in the quarter asset management fees were up 3 versus q4 17 driven by a solid year of aum flows but were mitigated by a decline in brokerage fees revenue also included a roughly 100 billion benefit from the sale of a non core asset associated with index sub licensing it s important to note as you look at 2019 that the december drop in equity markets doesn t actually impact aum fees until q1 19 due to the one month lag in the determination of fees for assets under management moving to slide 21 trends reflected strong client engagement in merrill lynch and u s trusts strong household growth and continued near record low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the 35 billion in overall client flows this quarter aum outflows in the quarter reflected market volatility which impacted some clients preferences versus cash and deposits at the same time we had 17 billion of positive brokerage flows which is a record we saw many of our new households begin their investing relationship with us through a new brokerage account on the banking side we had deposit flows of 21 billion as some investors increased their allocation of cash and ending loan balances grew 3 billion turning to slide 22 global banking earned 2 1 billion and generated a 20 return on allocated capital global banking achieved several records this quarter across revenue net income loan levels and deposit levels earnings were up 25 from q4 17 driven by operating leverage and tax rate benefits revenue of 5 1 billion and pre tax earnings of 2 8 billion were both up modestly year over year but this growth is understated given the impact of the tax act on tax advantaged investments in q4 18 versus q4 17 revenue was led by 4 growth in nii from strong deposit growth and higher rates but was offset by the small decline in investment banking fees the business created operating leverage as expense declined 2 versus q4 17 efficiency savings and lower deposit insurance costs more than offset continued investment in the business looking at trends on slide 23 and comparing to q4 last year since we already covered loan and deposits i ll start with ib fees ib fees of 1 3 billion for the overall firm decreased 5 year over year for context note the overall industry fee pools declined 13 from last year compared to q4 17 modestly improved m a fees only partially offset a decline in underwriting fees given the significant weakness in financing fee pools as corporations and other participants assessed significant market volatility late in the quarter switching to global markets on slide 24 i will talk about the results excluding dva global markets produced roughly 450 million of earnings in a tough quarter where market volatility increased and credit spreads widened ficc and equity financial performance diverged with equity achieving record revenue overall revenue declined 10 compared to q4 17 while expenses declined 3 q4 17 revenue included a small gain from the sale of a non core asset sales and trading declined 6 year over year to 2 5 billion ficc declined 15 while equities grew 11 ficc s lower revenue was due to weakness in credit and mortgage markets and lower client activity in credit products on the other hand equities benefited market volatility led to increased client activity producing revenue and improvements in both derivatives and in client financing activities where have been recently investing on slide 25 i would just point out the chart on the bottom left which shows at roughly 13 billion in full year revenues the relative stability of trading and sales over the past three years it also shows the stability and benefit that comes from a full and diverse set of client solutions as growth in equity revenue has made up for the decline in ficc revenue on slide 26 we show all other which reported net income of 279 million comparisons against the prior year are impacted by the charges in q4 17 associated with the tax act which reduced revenue by 946 million and increased tax expense by 1 9 billion as i mentioned earlier q4 18 included a 200 million net tax benefit expenses improved 71 million year over year okay let me close with a couple of thoughts q4 was a solid finish to a record year of earnings we controlled our costs well and invested in the future asset quality remains excellent our balance sheet is strong and we returned more earnings to shareholders and while the market may now believe interest rate hikes have stopped we believe we can grow net interest income without rate hikes assuming modest levels of loan and deposit growth with regard to things that are more in our control because of all the hard work our employees are doing to eliminate duplicative work and root out inefficiencies we expect expense in 2019 to be roughly the same as 2018 and as brian said we also don t expect any meaningful change in net charge offs in 2019 based on our years of responsible growth and our view of the credit horizon so we enter 2019 positively with a strong balance sheet and market share in businesses that positions us well for better earnings again in 2019 thanks for listening and with that let s open it up for questions questions and answers operator and at this time if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your touchtone telephone you may withdraw your question at any time by pressing once again 1 we ll take our first question from john mcdonald with bernstein please go ahead john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst hi good morning i was wondering on the loan growth front what you saw this quarter in terms of demand trends you mentioned in commercial you saw the late quarter pickup i m wondering if you attribute that to capital markets weakening but underneath that how s the core commercial demand and overall how are you feeling about loan growth prospects heading into 2019 you still thinking about gdp gdp plus a little bit as you think about responsible growth in 19 paul m donofrio chief financial officer we did see some late quarter pickup in loans in global banking i m not sure i can attribute it to the shutdown that we saw in the quarter in parts of the debt markets from a bond perspective but i wouldn t be surprised if some of that pickup was from that in terms of loan growth in our consumer and gwim segments loan growth really continues to be solid and well within our expectations as i said consumer grew 5 year over year gwim grew 4 which importantly is better than economic growth in global banking loan growth in q4 was more subdued but that s also more consistent with industry data year over year loans grew 2 i guess i would say that we think there are at least two factors impacting corporate clients first tax reform has increased cash flow and repatriation has also increased cash available for debt paydowns but having said all of that our near term expectations for loan growth are unchanged we still expect total loan growth to be in the low single digits and growth in our business segments should be at mid single digits maybe depending on economic growth on the low end of mid single digits but we still think we can achieve mid single digits john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst okay great and paul just to follow up in terms of deposit pricing what are your baseline expectations you ve been able to hold deposit pricing very nicely while growing what are your baseline expectations for deposit pricing if the fed does slow and just to clarify your nii outlook as you go into the first quarter what kind of offsets might you have to the day count headwind in terms of deposit growth and pricing paul m donofrio chief financial officer let s start with nii outlook for q1 the december rate hike and loan and deposit growth are clearly tailwinds and we just think they ll be offset by two less trading days that s the best perspective i can give you in terms of where do rates go from here look i think bank of america and indeed the rest of the industry really haven t increased deposit pricing on traditional bank accounts appreciably and again as we ve said many times at least for bank of america we deliver a lot of value to depositors between transparency convenience safety mobile banking online banking our nationwide network of financial centers the rewards we give our clients the advice and counsel all that value i think has helped us keep deposit rates relatively flat in traditional retail accounts but again we have been raising rates on accounts in gwim and in global banking so we pass a lot of value through in the form of higher deposits to those clients at some point the broader retail rates will rise we just don t know when so i think we re just going to have to wait and see john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst okay thanks operator and we ll take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo wells fargo securities managing director hi can you elaborate more on the checking deposit balance growth over the last year it s up 7 8 and i really want to get to the why brian i know you always say it s because you have good team members and everything else but how much of that growth is due to mobile banking and digital banking and of that component how much would be due to millennials brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer so mike to put in perspective i think we had 20 odd billion of fourth quarter 17 to fourth quarter 18 checking account growth in consumer as i said earlier we have been in a decade long repurposing that business including focus on primary accounts so we re 91 primary accounts the accounts we add are accretive and solid the average balance per account continues to grow that satisfaction in that business has hit an all time high across the board in terms of customer delight so it s good performance and strong performance but the key among all that is basically we are net growing checking accounts a few hundred thousand a year for the last couple years which we hadn t been for the last eight or nine years as we repositioned the old product lines and did all the consolidations even sold some branches as you re well aware to go to your question on millennials there are 50 million households in consumer 36 million digital households 26 million mobile households there are not enough millennials to meet those statistics so this is a broad based change going on and whether it s people 80 years old 70 years old 60 years old the way people use the capabilities that we have built for them is across the board so any technology adoption people often attribute it to millennials but when you think about that kind of penetration of digital practice and 1 5 billion logins a quarter 77 of the checks deposited not at the branch i e through atms and mobile deposit you just don t have enough millennials to go around so this is a broad based trend that we ve been driving and over the 10 years i talked about earlier we had 6 100 branches we have 4 200 branches we have grown checking balances there just aren t enough millennials to make that happen so it s a broad based thing i ll give you this quarter we crossed 5 million zelle users 5 million erica users now remember erica s not even a year old and 5 million preferred rewards customers who have brought their total relationship to get the benefits that is what s driving the checking growth because you get if you bring all your relationships through the reward programs we have that are integrated across all products not just card products that provides a good benefit and so it s tremendous operating leverage as paul mentioned some of the statistics and costs it s tremendous client delight it s tremendous capability tremendous efficiency and it s broad based millennials would score higher on something like erica but that would be expected long term it ll be broadly adopted in the franchise mike mayo wells fargo securities managing director great one follow up if i could i ve asked this before but what is your market share of digital banking users or at least how much of that checking account growth over the last year is due to digital banking brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer it s always hard to our market share in consumer deposits we think is around 13 15 depending on what you calculate mike and it s growing and if you look in the top 30 40 markets that we play in across the country you can see that if you just follow the fdic data you can see our deposit base continuing to grow so would it skew a little bit that way sure because younger people are opening up the relationships i d say that if you look at it the mobile adoption just to give you a sense millennials are about 80 plus gen x is 72 and boomers are 50 plus so it s across the board mike mayo wells fargo securities managing director that s helpful thank you operator our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr evercore isi managing director thanks so the roa and the rotc came in well above where i think a lot of us might have thought a few years ago so i know credit s going to pick up someday but i heard you loud and clear that the economy is good credit you expect flat expenses you expect flat and you ve seen some modest growth all that points toward while you shrink share count it s a lot better profitability so i m just looking for your thoughts around where are the bounds of where roa and rotc can go because we re good and uncharted territory here brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer i m not sure i d agree i agree with everything you said until the very last part glenn when you said good and uncharted the roas are solid if you think about it 100 basis points in a quarter those are getting to numbers which are solid performance to rotc so because of tax reform those all moved up we ve moved that up to a higher level now and you re seeing us run at a rate which we d expect to continue with the economy growing a couple percent if the economy shrinks or something that s a different question we sort of think that this model all the things you cited in the opening to your question is the model which is grow in a faster economy keep the expenses flat keep the credit risk in check and drive that operating leverage and bring the share count down so you re saying what we re doing and i m just not sure the returns will incrementally move up there was a fundamental resetting obviously through not only the operating performance but the tax reform but now they ll grind forward a little bit but they ll be in that range 14 16 return on tangible common equity and maybe move up higher than that on a given quarter but i think we re in a solid place right now glenn schorr evercore isi managing director i appreciate it maybe one question on markets ficc particularly i ll overgeneralize there too spreads widen out and the market does what it does volatility becomes bad for a little while when it happens quickly in fixed income as we saw i know it s early but spreads have tightened liquidity has improved markets are dethawing directionally can you recoup what was lost without putting numbers on it if markets normalize in other words in the old days the opposite would happen spreads tighten up flows pick up and you can have great market environments has anything changed from the past brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer i think the simple way to put it it s all of two weeks into the quarter or whatever is that we ve seen the normal progression that you see from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and it s solid out there right now and the equities business is stronger as we referenced earlier but all the pieces you had are all pieces of it but overall our trading revenue has been fairly consistent every year it came out of every quarter and every year differently but it s basically been 13 odd billion year after year with a total range of maybe 500 700 million just to give you a sense i don t have the numbers right in front of me so the model is a moving model so there s not a lot of markdowns markup stuff which you d have seen more in 08 09 all the stuff is marked and moving through at 100 miles an hour there s no storage going on we ve seen the recovery and the activity of clients that s good news and you ve probably seen it with your clients and that s been good so you ve seen that pick up but we ve gotta get through some things in the atmosphere out there to make sure that sustains for the quarter glenn schorr evercore isi managing director okay tiny little follow up on that is the average trading assets picked up the last couple of years your capital base improved you put up good results so the bar is going down while it s going is there anything in that pickup in the trading related assets that was just year end parking as opposed to just bigger brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer remember we the team in equities they had to retool a lot of the platform put a lot of technology in about 24 months ago tom montag and the team said they re ready to start really pushing our capabilities out in the market and as i said earlier we got 70 new clients in the fourth quarter in our equities business so the balance sheet growth has been in support of the equities business and remember it s very low risk and very low rwa but that s been fairly consistent build over time it ll ebb and flow a little bit by market values because of the way it works but it s really because the equities business the investments we made in technologies and capabilities have now turned out into providing balance sheet capacity and capability of the prime brokerage business glenn schorr evercore isi managing director perfect thank you operator we ll take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy graseck morgan stanley managing director hi good morning a couple questions one is just a question on how you expect to be managing in the event that the downside happens so what if some of the negative things pan out and revenues come in a little bit lighter can you talk through where you have expense leverage if you have any or do you keep the expenses flat in a tougher environment brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer assuming an environment of gdp decline is i think what the base of your question is you would obviously probably see a market decline that would bring incentive related compensation down that instantaneously happens frankly if we re not earning as much that s obviously an outcome so there d be those types of things we could always choose not to invest but i think if you looked at what we re investing in you d say keep going honestly as a shareholder it d be the better answer for the company because the technology investments allow us to take long term expenses down and things like that so there s always leverage you can pull but that s the business model we ve been operating for many years now has been to constantly be pulling those levers with time it allows you to manage the company much more carefully and allows attrition to be your friend in terms of head count but the key is to just keep driving the operating leverage so if revenues flatten you ve gotta get the expenses down a little bit to make it all work and keep it positive and we re focused on it so we ll see what happens you have to have what the constituent parts of the backdrop are but mechanically some of the expenses come down just due to pure revenue related incentives betsy graseck morgan stanley managing director got it so even if the revenue environment is a little weaker you think you can generate positive operating leverage brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer well we ve been able to do it if you go back and look at that chart on quarterly operating leverage it has come in quarters where revenue fell and that s the key it may not be as big in other words the net operating leverage but the culture we built in this company to operating excellence and simplify and improve and the idea generation we went through 4 200 ideas over the last four or five years we re continuing to generate them with looking through every single process and taking apart mapping and understanding the data flows how we can automate it and it s very incremental these are not huge spend 1 billion and see if it works when you add them all up we do spend 1 billion but it s a bunch of small projects so those are always moving down into our benefit as we move through it and so i think if you look at that operating leverage yeah if revenues were flat because of whatever s going on out there we should be able to manage expenses underneath it betsy graseck morgan stanley managing director and then could you speak a little bit to the investment spend that you re making in the investment bank and in particular in which geographies you re really looking to increase your market share brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer i think the u s being the biggest fee pool by far as people talk about it we continue to do that we feel pretty good about the team we have in asia in europe we re going to add some there but the real key is to cover deeper in the client base outside the united states we cover the largest companies in the world largest investors in the world inside the united states because of the nature of our business we cover from small businesses all the way through the largest companies and the piece that we probably gave up coverage on that we gotta go back in is sort of the upper end of the middle market and a broader base so we re adding resources middle market investment bankers that work with alastair borthwick s team on matthew koder s team working with them to drive it we re adding more coverage deeper in the industry groups and so it s a broadening out of the u s in north america that ll be the biggest explicit build you ll see but a lot of this is just filling in the cracks and making sure that we ve got that coverage really owned in the united states from the smallest company to the largest company for all their capital markets needs and m a needs and outside it s really picking our industries and our fine tuning which we ve done betsy graseck morgan stanley managing director okay thank you operator we ll take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak wolfe research executive director hi good morning i wanted to start off with a question on capital return capital ratios ended the year flat versus 4q 17 standard ended at an impressive 11 6 i think it s fair to say that you re currently operating with substantial levels of excess capital and just given your strong track record in the stress test as we look to benchmark against how much capital return you could support or what you re sufficiently comfortable with you did 96 i think that was the number that was cited in the prepared remarks are you in a position at this point especially given some of the recent decline in the share price to take full advantage and maybe exceed 100 payout in the coming stress test cycle paul m donofrio chief financial officer well let me start off with a couple level setting points we clearly as everyone has seen have been growing our capital return to shareholders consistently for many years now so that s one point we increased our dividend 25 last year we increased our buybacks by 8 billion and last year when you put it all together based upon what we submitted we were at a little over 100 payout ratio if you look at our ccar results which you alluded to we did have a significant cushion using the fed s results considering the severity of last year s scenario and as you point out our own capital cushion we would hope expect to have room to at a minimum sustain that payout ratio if not increase it but we ve got to see the scenario first that s the one caveat steven chubak wolfe research executive director understood just one follow up on some of the remarks relating to tlac increased issuance of tlac eligible debt while this is maybe an underappreciated fact it s been a substantial dampener of nii expansion over the last few years and paul show me you can update us on where that ratio sits today and whether there s a target level that you re thinking about i m just trying to gauge what the opportunity is to optimize that tlac ratio how we can think about the potential benefit from replacing that with cheaper deposit funding paul m donofrio chief financial officer we re not disclosing what our tlac ratio is but i will say that as we sit here today we have a comfortable cushion and as you also heard in my prepared remarks the debt issuances this year are likely going to be less than maturities steven chubak wolfe research executive director okay looking forward to more updates in the future just one final follow up from me on credit loss expectations brian you made an interesting remark at a conference recently in december noting that you expect through the cycle loss expectations to come in well below 90 basis points but at the same time didn t really commit to an explicit level or expectation and given the late cycle rhetoric the focus on particularly from long onlys with longer horizons as to what through the cycle loss expectations might be and all the balance sheet cleansing you ve accomplished i was wondering if you could maybe provide us with some sort of benchmark or target expectation that we can compare you guys against versus peers just given many have provided at least medium term or through the cycle loss expectations already brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer earlier i said what i expected for 19 charge offs in the range of where they are now the point that i think we were talking about at the conference is around the construction of the portfolio what they were last cycle versus this cycle for us we had 250 billion of unsecured consumer credit card and other types of unsecured debt so just sheer volume that is completely different and that took frankly a lot of work to get us repositioned to where we have it so just using that example and if you look at charge offs go back in 2010 i think there are 30 odd billion in the years and a big part of it was credit card and related unsecured debt restructured credit card loans that was due to the fact in the mid 2000s with the best data analytics and the best underwriting team in the business we were underwriting with a 5 charge off expectation and a good economy and it turned out to be a bad economy and it turned out to be a consumer led problem and that led to much higher charge offs you can then run that same story through home equities and other things and so if you look at the size of the consumer book it s much smaller then you flip it over and talk about the quality underwriting so now our expectations are 3 5 4 charge off rate in a 7 8 unemployment type levels versus 5 6 before and moving on beyond there so you ve got both a rate and a volume question on home equity and unsecured consumer credit that is much different and then you go to mortgage same story then you flip over to commercial credit and we ve always had wonderful commercial credit experience go back to the late 90s through the fallen angel crisis go back through the last crisis we underwrite commercial credit better than anybody in the business and yet we still have balance there and you see the array of risk is across the board we ve managed the limits at the industry level at the country level and all that stuff so we expect the outcome to be even better than it was last time there and we watch the snic and all the different things that give us that comfort but the real asset test is look at the stress test if you look at the stress test and say under that scenario with no preparation and no ability to change during the nine quarters if you look at card if i remember right of the top of my head i think the total charge offs for the nine quarters are around 11 12 something like that if you de annualize that you think of that under that scenario of unemployment going from 4 ish to the pace it goes up and you end up with about 5 per year that just shows you the difference in the underlying quality but it was a conscious effort to give up a lot of revenue to get the company more balanced so that through a crisis it would perform completely different all that i m not going to give you a target because i don t have a scenario i m giving that target but it ll be much better than the last time steven chubak wolfe research executive director despite no explicit target very helpful color so thank you brian for taking my questions and all the insights operator our next question is from matt o connor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt o connor deutsche bank managing director good morning i was wondering if you could talk about your thoughts on managing interest rate risk given the drop in most parts of the curve lowered expectations for future short hikes and maybe specifically the securities book is it worth reinvesting proceeds into securities or do you keep it shorter hoping for a backup in rates paul m donofrio chief financial officer first thing to think about as we look at that securities book we re always balancing earnings against capital and liquidity that s a dynamic process that happens daily certainly weekly we don t take any credit risk in that investment portfolio that s the other thing i always like to stress when we talk about it so we look at it and we re always sort of trying to figure out whether we should do a little bit more of this or a little bit less of that if you look at this quarter by the way we have a little bit less sitting at the fed because we did some overnight very high quality reverse repo because the yields were just higher so yeah we re looking at it we look at it all the time matt o connor deutsche bank managing director and from a nim percent perspective i realize there s some puts and takes specifically with the trading book but in a stable rate environment you did mention you could grow the net interest income dollars can you get stability in the nim should we really think about it as nii being driven by balance sheet or is there some risk that the nim erodes a little bit in the stable rate environment paul m donofrio chief financial officer we look at it if you look at q1 i would expect nim to edge up a little bit driven by loan growth funded by low cost deposits longer term nim is really going to depend on the forward curve and our ability to lag deposit rate paid matt o connor deutsche bank managing director okay and then just separately if i could squeeze it in did you guys comment on the tax rate for 2019 sorry if i missed that paul m donofrio chief financial officer i don t think we did actually we re expecting an effective tax rate for 2019 of approximately 19 absent unusual items matt o connor deutsche bank managing director okay thank you operator our next question is from jim mitchell with buckingham research please go ahead james mitchell buckingham research analyst good morning maybe you could just talk a little bit about leverage winding risk how you think about it how you manage it obviously that s been a big topic lately given the freezing of the markets in december in particular just your thoughts from here around your own book and the industry paul m donofrio chief financial officer sure so the first thing i would say is we re staying focused and have been focused on responsible growth so we re maintaining our underwriting standards and we re staying within and have now for years stayed within our portfolio limits our exposure to leveraged lending is primarily through underwriting and distributing leveraged loans we have very little for example cll exposure at the company because as i just pointed out we don t hold that kind of risk in our investment portfolio having said that leveraged finance is a very important part of our franchise and if it s done well it supports economic growth our leveraged finance franchise does well over 1 billion so nothing s really changed for us if you re going to be in this business if you re going to be a leader in this business as we are you ve got to be there when the market s good and when the market s not and we are but doing it our way sticking to our standards james mitchell buckingham research analyst how do you manage size any thoughts have you taken down the amount you re willing to put on the balance sheet at least in the short term or how do we think about how you manage today versus what you did a year ago brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer as i said earlier in response to another question we re in the moving business not the storage business as risk goes so we have limits for the transitory process of doing the underwritings we mark them move them out and it s gone and so this is not how much as paul said we make lots of commercial credit available to our clients but in the underwriting part of the business which is what you re talking about it all goes out the door it s not a hold business james mitchell buckingham research analyst okay that s helpful and maybe just a question on cecl any thoughts on the impact and given some of the pushback do you see any parts of it changing just your thoughts on cecl paul m donofrio chief financial officer sure so in terms of the impact we re not at the point yet where we re providing an estimate we have made a ton of progress on our efforts toward adoption however there s still a lot of things that need to be finalized before we re ready to talk about impacts i would point out that we re not overly concerned at this point and it certainly is not going to change how we re going to serve our clients having said that we may see an increase in allowance upon adoption maybe maybe not it s ultimately going to depend on the economic outlook and credit conditions as of the adoption date in 1 1 2020 the only other issue out there is the double count in ccar and how it s going to affect capital and with respect to that i think the regulators and us are thinking about a lot of things but the only two i would point out is we just need to understand the implications on capital and how it affects the willingness of banks to extend credit as i said before i don t think it s going to change how we operate our company if cecl is in the company run stress test but not in the fed s what are the implications of that there are still a lot of things to work out here between now and i think that s why they delayed the implementation of cecl in the stress test until 2022 i think james mitchell buckingham research analyst okay great thanks for your thoughts operator our next question is from saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez ubs investment bank managing director hi good morning everybody most of my questions have been asked but i ll just follow up i guess on the earlier question on your ability what a fed pause would mean for your nim and i think you mentioned paul that it really depends on the forward curve and the ability to lag on deposit rates but on that point how much of a risk do you see of a lag effect on deposit rates specifically on retail deposit rates which really haven t moved much in this rate tightening cycle how much of a risk do you see that in an environment where we pause the economy s still doing ok but we do see a lagged effect and you start to see a bit more deposit cost pressure on the retail side than maybe we ve seen up until now paul m donofrio chief financial officer if i ve got it right it was two fed rates three years ago three two years ago and four last year something like that so if you just noodle in and look at the different movement from the end of 17 to the end of 18 given think of it as a lag basis what was embedded in it just isn t a lot of movement because they re checking accounts and checking accounts never have high interest rates on them and half of them are non interest bearing so they don t have any interest rate on them it really comes down to who the customer is how they use the cash is it transactional cash is it investment cash either short term or long term and each business line is different but in the consumer business what is driving our deposit growth is the 20 billion from fourth quarter 17 to fourth quarter 18 in checking balance growth which will always be tremendously advantaged from the perspective you re coming at it which is a funding basis and as they grow and we don t feel there s not a lot of pressure because half of it is non interest bearing accounts you can just go back and look at the pricing across time in these businesses and see what s happened if you look at it and i think you ll feel that we should be able to consistently drive that in the rate sensitive side i e where it s investment cash the rates have moved up substantially already and we re growing those balances so we tell our team to price to grow deposits 3 4 i e better than the economy and they ve got to achieve that balance and they ve done a great job saul martinez ubs investment bank managing director that s helpful you may also just another question you made the point that the equity market downturn in december will hit fees in the first quarter and we can obviously do our own calculations of the roll forward in the asset values but is there any way to size up what the magnitude of the downturn in the fourth quarter in the markets could mean for fees in that sense paul m donofrio chief financial officer it s a good question i hesitate to give you a number because the revenue is based upon a lot of different things besides just what the level of the markets are i think it would be misleading to come up with a number just based upon the markets to everybody on this call so maybe if you call back in lee and his team can help you think through what the issues are more broadly but we re not going to give a number today saul martinez ubs investment bank managing director okay that s fair enough thanks a lot i appreciate it lee mcentire senior vice president investor relations okay i think that s all do we have one more question operator yes we do have one final question from brian kleinhanzl please go ahead your line is open brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods managing director great thanks for taking my questions i hear you on the net charge off guidance for 2019 relative to 2018 but how are you thinking about reserve builds reserve releases were 500 million this quarter do you still think you ll be able to release reserves at that pace next year as well paul m donofrio chief financial officer just to run through it for everybody we think that provision we think credit is going to continue to perform well hopefully everybody heard that on the call and we would expect provision to roughly match net charge offs depending on loan growth you heard us talk about what we re expecting for net charge offs the releases are coming down you saw they were 19 million this quarter you re going to see our provision much more closely match net charge offs going forward because we ve seen a lot of improvement in that consumer real estate portfolio so that s the best guidance i can give you brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods managing director okay and then just one follow up on credit we ve seen the commercial npls pick up this quarter and it s been a pretty steady downward trend in those since 2016 is it just because of the market conditions or can you give a little bit more color there as to why the uptick in this quarter thanks paul m donofrio chief financial officer sure at 22 basis points npls as a percentage of loans is basically at an historic low here there was an increase in the quarter driven by a couple of names that were downgraded if you look at reservable criticized exposure it continued to fall in the quarter so again we don t see anything suggesting a broad based decline in the overall credit quality brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods managing director okay thanks for taking my questions brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer okay i think that s all the questions thank you for joining us again we had a strong solid quarter and 2018 was a strong year for this company with record earnings as we look forward into 2019 as i said earlier the predictions of potential slowdown in the economy don t enervate us they invigorate us we built this company to operate in that setting we ll continue to drive responsible growth and we look forward to talking to you next quarter operator this will conclude today s program thanks for your participation you may now disconnect have a great day duration 73 minutes call participants lee mcentire senior vice president investor relations brian moynihan chairman and chief executive officer paul m donofrio chief financial officer john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst mike mayo wells fargo securities

by neil hartnell tribune business editor nhartnell tribunemedia net the deputy prime minister yesterday slammed false rumours of a 35 percent currency devaluation and second vat hike as unpatriotic for threatening the bahamas economic stability kp turnquest moving rapidly to dispel social media speculation that had gone viral blasted the spread of such claims as very irresponsible given that they could shake the confidence of both consumers and bahamian businesses in the economy s prospects he warned that it could also cause concern internationally given that it may be picked up by foreign investors and companies conducting business with the bahamas as well as the likes of the international monetary fund imf moody s and standard poor s s p with the latter two constantly monitoring this nation s creditworthiness and ability to pay its bills voicing concerns over the potential damage to the bahamas reputation mr turnquest said the situation was not a very good reflection on us as a people and expressed hope that the rumours were not ignited by political mischief he urged bahamians to apply more scepticism and critical analysis to social media postings rather than immediately accepting them as fact or gospel truth and starting to spread them themselves mr turnquest and the ministry of finance were forced to assert that the bahamian dollar is under zero threat of devalaution as even attorneys were asking tribune business whether the claims relating to this and another vat hike were true alarmist social media messages seen by tribune business under the banner breaking news warned the financial crisis will hit by march 2019 the bahamian dollar will be devalued to 65 cents to every us dollar the vat will increase to 15 18 percent by march 2019 the government is not being truthful at all we need help another referred to the upcoming increase in vat to 15 18 percent that the government has planned for us on july 1 hitting back mr turnquest told tribune business it s very irresponsible of people to be floating these kind of false rumours as they tend to shake the confidence of the general public who are unsure whether they are true or not it does also have the potential to cause concern to international parties it is very unpatriotic very damaging to our reputation and certainly not a very good reflection on us as a people or the body politic i m hopeful politics is not behind it admonishing bahamians to be responsible mr turnquest said persons could support the political party of their choice aggressively without resorting to sparking and fuelling claims that could potentially undermine the economy it s unfortunately gone viral he told tribune business of the devaluation and vat hike chatter and it s unfortunate we had to respond to it we watched it for a couple of days hoping it would peter out but it continues to have legs people are asking about it so it s important to respond to it and dispel that rumour once and for all given the ability of these words and postings to fly around the world people need to be more responsible in putting out this kind of nonsense calling on bahamians to analyse social media postings more carefully mr turnquest added it s very unfortunate that people are somewhat gullible to these things now with what s app it allows the most uninformed of us to be a newsmaker so it s incumbent upon all of us to take a second look at the story and question the reasonableness of it before taking it to hearty and spreading them ourselves mr turnquest said he believed reasonable people would immediately see there was no truthfulness to the devaluation and vat hike claims but enough of us were reading and circulating it to force the ministry of finance to clear the air and prevent any actual economic word the d word devaluation is among those dreaded most by bahamians because it means the bahamian dollar will have lost its one one parity exchange rate with the us dollar online purchases and florida shopping trips would immediately become more expensive import costs will rise and inflation increases leading to a drop in living standards for all vat is feared almost as much especially since the 60 percent rate hike to 12 percent in last year s budget is still fresh in everyone s mind that too has cut purchasing power for many bahamians and the combination of the two was likely to spark concern among all who read the post the ministry of finance rebutting these fears in its own statement sought to scotch the devaluation claim by pointing out that the central bank foreign currency reserves that underpin the one one us dollar peg currently exceed 1bn and are likely to be further boosted by a strong winter tourism season it also pointed out that the government s fiscal strategy report released in november 2018 had ruled out the need for any further vat rate increases over the next three years prior to the general election the bahamian dollar is under zero threat of devaluation the ministry of finance asserted the foreign exchange reserves at the central bank that underpin the value of the bahamian dollar are at a very healthy level topping the 1bn mark this is fuelled by the current strong performance of the tourism sector from which the country earns the bulk of its foreign currency as for vat it pointed to the fiscal strategy report which said last november the government is of the view that no further increases in the vat rate will be entertained over the balance of its current mandate whether that specific position may change if revenue continues to underperform and deficit reduction targets set by the fiscal responsibility act are missed could be questioned by some still the ministry of finance blasted the combined devaluation vat hike claims as completely fictitious and wholly untrue adding that they stemmed from an unknown source the ministry decries the malicious use of false information and the unwarranted concerns such untruths can cause throughout the country it added the ministry encouraged persons to check with informed sources whenever they encounter noteworthy information entering the public domain for the first time

ramp up at westwood and increased production at rosbel following two years of record output at essakane we expect production to be lower than 2018 due to lower availability of high grade zones

published tuesday 15 january 2019 print disqus graceland updates by stewart thomson 1 some analysts believe china could deliver 2 trillion yuan 296 21 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects cnbc news jan 15 2019 2 china s economy is likely to grow in the 6 2 6 5 range for 2019 and the stimulus is inflationary while that growth is the slowest pace in almost thirty years it s still head and shoulders above the horrifying meltdown in growth that the united states is likely about to experience 3 please click here now goldman is predicting a meltdown in us earnings growth from 20 in 2018 to just 3 to 6 for 2019 4 goldman s heavyweight analysts are also predicting that us gdp growth melts towards 1 by the third quarter of this year this while morgan stanley is predicting an earnings recession 5 germany s economy is already slipping towards 1 gdp growth and eu earnings are unlikely to grow more 5 in 2019 6 interestingly most big bank economists are predicting an uptick in inflation will accompany the slide in western earnings and gdp growth clearly all roads lead to gold 7 on that note please click here now double click to enlarge gold continues to perform remarkably well at a time when a substantial pullback would be expected 8 conspiracy buffs are waiting for the banksters to smash the gold price where is the smash well it doesn t exist all that s happening is mild consolidation 9 a pullback to key fibonacci retracement lines in the 1250 1260 area would be healthy but even that may not happen current technical action indicates a very healthy gold market 10 please click here now gold has raced to an all time high against the australian dollar there s a loose triangle pattern in play the target of that pattern is well above 2000 11 it s very important for gold stock enthusiasts to make some effort to own at least a few australian gold stocks that trade on australian markets many of these stocks have been in powerful uptrends for years and are likely in a new acceleration phase 12 gold is also doing well against the british pound and the cbone canadian dollar most of the world s gold stocks trade on the canadian stock market and a lot of them are beginning to show good technical action 13 please click here now double click to enlarge the paint is barely dry on the barrick rangold merger and now newmont is buying goldcorp 14 when mergers or takeovers happen i like to see the new entity prove itself technically with momentum in the case of barrick gold nyse i ve suggested that investors need to see a weekly close of 14 for that to happen 15 for newmont i need to see a weekly close of 36 that would suggest institutional money managers are endorsing the new entity once that happens i would be a buyer of every dollar of price weakness in the stock 16 both barrick and newmont are key gdx components i m impressed with the relative strength of gdx in the face of the softness in both those stocks 17 please click here now double click to enlarge while gdx should pull back to about 20 from the current price zone the technical action is superb 18 note the fade in volume as price drifts sideways in the 21 50 resistance area that s extremely positive eager accumulators should be buyers of every ten cents of price weakness between 21 and 20 19 once the current consolidation ends i m anticipating a surge to the 23 price area on strengthening volume 20 goldman s influential gold market analyst jeff currie has a new 1425 target for gold in 2019 that s an important number because most gold and silver miners have made a significant effort to reduce their aisc all in sustaining cost numbers 21 a gold price in the 1400 area would turn many of these companies into cash cows and do so at a time when most companies in america face an earnings and revenue meltdown 22 an institutional stampede into gold stocks in this new and emerging situation is not a pipedream it s becoming more of a probable event than just a potential scenario 23 please click here now double click to enlarge my weekly gold chart shows that 1300 resistance is merely a pitstop on the road to the inverse h s bottom neckline at about 1392 24 if goldman s 1425 target price is achieved in 2019 it would mean gold has traded well above the neckline ushering in a new target zone of about 1750 that 1750 price would turn most gold miners into not just cash cows but cash cow superstars thanks cheers st stewart thomson graceland updates note

the slowdown in economic activity has also exerted pressure on prices accelerating a decline in both factory gate and consumer inflation and causing concern that the producer price index might turn negative in the first quarter of 2019 that would create anguish for the industrial sector reminiscent of the deflationary period from 2012 to 2015 the latest economic numbers show few comforting signs with the manufacturing purchasing managers index at its weakest since february 2016 and industrial profit growth turning negative for the first time in three years the chinese economy is confronting formidable headwinds china s current three year economic cycle measured in nominal gdp growth is coming to an end and the question is how hard the landing will be domestic woes aside dark clouds still loom externally true the recent news about the trade talks has been mostly positive but vice ministerial meetings concluded without concrete signs that the two sides are reaching a deal what is less clear is how much washington is willing to compromise to avoid an escalation of the trade conflict a major bone of contention is technology which includes problems such as intellectual property theft forced technology transfer and beijing s practice of supporting local industries at the expense of foreign competitors on issues like protecting intellectual property beijing can make tangible concessions because it is in china s interests to grow its tech industry and cultivate organic innovation effectively washington is merely nudging beijing in the right direction in areas such as forced technology transfer the national people s congress is reviewing a new law that will ban local governments from forcing foreign companies to transfer technology however implementation will be key and washington is likely to want practical reassurances from beijing with regard to enforcement whether that will be accepted is up for debate but it is a small gap to bridge the most contentious issue is china s industrial policies which are seen by the us as giving chinese firms unfair advantages over foreign competition but in the eyes of beijing it is within its rights to give policy support to emerging industries and to develop the economy such practices are common among developed and developing countries in fact the made in china 2025 strategy is widely believed to be inspired by germany s industry 4 0 plan since these long term policies are deemed important for developing china s hi tech and advanced manufacturing industries beijing may be less willing to offer tangible concessions this means the white house will have to soften its stance to make a deal possible this is at the crux of the negotiations given the market gyrations and signs of a slowdown in the us economy it appears that trump is keen to settle the trade war with china but letting beijing off the hook without pushing for fundamental changes may not appease the hawkish members of the president s inner circle hence a resolution is not yet a done deal and investors should keep their guard up in the coming weeks all in all the fundamental conditions in the chinese economy will probably get worse before they get better a silver lining in all this is that the policy cycle has turned and will turn more pro growth in the months ahead recent weeks saw the introduction of a raft of policy easing measures including tax reductions for individuals higher issuance quotas for local government bonds the introduction of the targeted medium term lending facility and cuts in the reserve requirement ratio for banks while monetary and fiscal policies have limitations constrained by the still tight financial regulations or the size of the budget deficit the collective easing suggests that the authorities are committed to fighting an economic downdraft notably the closed door central economic work conference late last year emphasised the importance of six stabilities starting with employment the policy easing measures are expected to stabilise economic growth at around 6 1 per cent in the second half of the year for the economy 2019 is set to be more challenging than 2018 but for the market since a lot of negative fundamental news has already been priced in the proactive policy management and the prospective end of the trade war may offer some scope for a rebound instead of running scared from deteriorating fundamentals investors should take a nimble approach to investing in china aidan yao is senior emerging asia economist at axa investment managers this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as amid economic slowdown window is open for investors
china plans to lower taxes step up spending and provide ample financing to private and small enterprise in order to help partially neutralize the country s worst slowdown since the global financial crisis the people s bank of china is confident it can keep the value of china s currency the yuan steady while maintaining a stable but flexible monetary policy zhu hexin the vice governor recently unveiled to reporters the bank s plans for 2019 that were set by top leaders at an annual meeting in december zhu also said that the focus is on enhancement and efficiency the yuan also known as the renminbi or people s money sank to its lowest rate in 10 years of 6 9756 per dollar at the end of october coming close to breaking the level of seven to the greenback it has strengthened since then to about 6 7580 per dollar a further slide in the yuan could fuel u s complaints about beijing s currency controls it also might prompt potentially destabilizing outflows of capital which would raise borrowing costs and limit the efforts to shore up growth it s a balancing act that requires just enough spending and access to credit to support businesses without setting off inflation and driving asset prices dangerously higher zhu said the central bank would keep monetary policy sound forward looking flexible and pertinent at the present time it s still unclear if these tactics will be enough to keep manufacturing on stable and smooth as beijing and washington work to resolve their trade disputes trump and chinese president xi jinping agreed on dec 1 to postpone additional tariff hikes by 90 days while they negotiated even so the penalties of up to 25 already imposed on billions of dollars of each other s goods remain in place raising the cost for american and chinese buyers of soybeans medical equipment and other goods what are china s financial plans for 2019 the plans for 2019 outlined tuesday included specific measures such as raising the maximum income levels for tax exempt companies and individuals and reducing the tax rate the government also plans to begin construction of several major projects and promote settlement of rural migrants in cities slash bureaucratic and anti competitive red tape cut energy consumption and open more business areas in order to become more appealing to foreign investors said lian weiliang vice chairman of the national development and reform commission china s planning agency xu hongcai an assistant minister of finance said the scale of tax reductions for the year would be about 1 3 trillion yuan 190 billion china s communist leaders have been trying during the past years to guide the economy toward a more sustainable mode of growth by reducing reliance on massive investments in infrastructure and on export manufacturing and expanding the services sector and private consumption

as mark twain never said it ain t what you don t know that gets you into trouble it s what you think you know for sure that just ain t so over the course of this year and next the biggest economic risks will emerge in those areas where investors think recent patterns are unlikely to change they will include a growth recession in china a rise in global long term real interest rates and a crescendo of populist economic policies that undermine the credibility of central bank independence resulting in higher interest rates on safe advanced country government bonds a significant chinese slowdown may already be unfolding us president donald trump s trade war has shaken confidence but this is only a downward shove to an economy that was already slowing as it makes the transition from export and investment led growth to more sustainable domestic consumption led growth how much the chinese economy will slow is an open question but given the inherent contradiction between an ever more centralized party led political system and the need for a more decentralized consumer led economic system long term growth could fall quite dramatically unfortunately the option of avoiding the transition to consumer led growth and continuing to promote exports and real estate investment is not very attractive either china is already a dominant global exporter and there is neither market space nor political tolerance to allow it to maintain its previous pace of export expansion bolstering growth through investment particularly in residential real estate which accounts for the lion s share of chinese construction output is also ever more challenging downward pressure on prices especially outside tier 1 cities is making it increasingly difficult to induce families to invest an even larger share of their wealth into housing although china may be much better positioned than any western economy to socialize losses that hit the banking sector a sharp contraction in housing prices and construction could prove extremely painful to absorb any significant growth recession in china would hit the rest of asia hard along with commodity exporting developing and emerging economies nor would europe and especially germany be spared although the us is less dependent on china the trauma to financial markets and politically sensitive exports would make a chinese slowdown much more painful than us leaders seem to realize a less likely but even more traumatic outside risk would materialize if after many years of trend decline global long term real interest rates reversed course and rose significantly i am not speaking merely of a significant over tightening by the us federal reserve in 2019 this would be problematic but it would mainly affect short term real interest rates and in principle could be reversed in time the far more serious risk is a shock to very long term real interest rates which are lower than at any point during the modern era except for the period of financial repression after world war ii when markets were much less developed than today while a sustained rise in the long term real interest rate is a low probability event it is far from impossible although there are many explanations of the long term trend decline some factors could be temporary and it is difficult to establish the magnitude of different possible effects empirically one factor that could cause global rates to rise on the benign side would be a spurt in productivity for example if the so called fourth industrial revolution starts to affect growth much faster than is currently anticipated this would of course be good overall for the global economy but it might greatly strain lagging regions and groups but upward pressure on global rates could stem from a less benign factor a sharp trend decline in asian growth for example from a long term slowdown in china that causes the region s long standing external surpluses to swing into deficits but perhaps the most likely cause of higher global real interest is the explosion of populism across much of the world to the extent that populists can overturn the market friendly economic policies of the past several decades they may sow doubt in global markets about just how safe advanced country debt really is this could raise risk premia and interest rates and if governments were slow to adjust budget deficits would rise markets would doubt governments even more and events could spiral most economists agree that today s lower long term interest rates allow advanced economies to sustain significantly more debt than they might otherwise but the notion that additional debt is a free lunch is foolish high debt levels make it more difficult for governments to respond aggressively to shocks the inability to respond aggressively to a financial crisis a cyber attack a pandemic or a trade war significantly heightens the risk of long term stagnation and is an important explanation of why most serious academic studies find that very high debt levels are associated with slower long term growth if policymakers rely too much on debt as opposed to higher taxation on the wealthy in order to pursue progressive policies that redistribute income it is easy to imagine markets coming to doubt that countries will grow their way out of very high debt levels investors skepticism could well push up interest rates to uncomfortable levels of course there are many other risks to global growth including ever increasing political chaos in the united states a messy brexit italy s shaky banks and heightened geopolitical tensions but these outside risks do not make the outlook for global growth necessarily grim the baseline scenario for the us is still strong growth europe s growth could be above trend as well as it continues its long slow recovery from the debt crisis at the beginning of the decade and china s economy has been proving doubters wrong for many years so 2019 could turn out to be another year of solid global growth unfortunately it is likely to be a nerve wracking one as well project syndicate

new york cnn business smaller us based companies that do most of their business in america were supposed to hold up better than the giants of the dow and s p 500 at a time when there are concerns about a shaky global economy and us trade tension with china but the russell 2000 an index that focuses on small us stocks has fallen nearly 15 since the start of last october while the dow and s p 500 are each down about 10 over the past few months that s despite the fact that multinationals in the dow and s p 500 like apple aapl intel intc boeing ba and nike nke have significant exposure to china and europe what gives chris gaffney president of world markets at tiaa bank said investors jumped to the wrong conclusion about how smaller us companies would fare in light of weaker demand from china and other international markets small stocks may not be protected from a trade war after all even though many of them may not export products to china they make supplies for companies that do he said this whole notion that the united states can go it alone is a myth in the 21st century hyper connected global economy in a globalized world there is no isolation said raoul pal founder of the global macro investor advisory firm and ceo of financial media site real vision pal noted that heavy debt loads for big us companies like general electric ge gm gm and ford f won t help smaller companies that need to borrow money for expansion as more us giants get downgraded by the credit ratings agencies it will be tougher for small firms to get loans the weakening of the corporate bond market will be a problem for everyone pal said it could freeze credit for smaller companies the recent pullback in the value of the us dollar isn t helping either smaller us companies benefit when the dollar is stronger since it makes imported goods more expensive than those made in america but the us dollar index which tracks the value of the greenback against the euro yen and other major currencies has fallen 1 5 since mid november many expect the dollar to weaken further as well since there are growing hopes that the federal reserve may stop raising interest rates a series of rate hikes last year helped boost the dollar in the first place there s also the simple fact that smaller us stocks are riskier than big household names james ragan director of wealth management research with d a davidson said one reason why the russell 2000 has underperformed the broader market lately is that they are far more expensive according to data from birinyi associates the russell 2000 is trading at nearly 21 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compared to just 15 times the estimates for the dow and s p 500 ragan noted that smaller companies may not be the best place to hide with fears of slowing economic growth rising so it s only natural for investors to dump smaller stocks that have more room to fall if there is a prolonged downturn

josh rauh the public pension nightmare for california will only worsen unless serious reforms are adopted a hoover scholar says joshua rauh a senior fellow at the hoover institution and a professor of finance at the stanford graduate school of business suggests that governments in california need to either offer more modest pension benefits and fund those much more conservatively or start putting public employees into defined contribution plans an economist rauh studies corporate investment business taxation government pension liabilities and investment management he recently wrote about california s pension situation for a hoover institution white paper and discussed the subject in a policyed video rauh was recently interviewed about the issue how critical is the pension situation in california rauh the gap between what public pension funds in california have saved up for public employee pensions and the value of what is owed to public employees is 769 billion or more than 60 000 per california household it is as though each household is carrying around a credit card balance of 60 000 that is growing each year at some point in the future the government will make us pay because the public employee pensions must be paid how will the government make us pay either through higher taxes or through the cutting of core public services think about the essential public services that citizens pay for through taxes and fees like safety and education going forward we ll have fewer resources available to pay for those actual services because taxpayer money will increasingly be burdened with paying the pensions of the people who performed those jobs in the past another way to see the problem is that as of now around 10 percent of all public revenue generated in the state of california and its municipalities goes to fund public employee pensions that sounds like a lot but the real problem is that even this amount is not adequate to stabilize the 60 000 per household debt to the public employees a contribution rate that would keep the debt from rising would amount to more than 21 percent of every dollar of public revenue generated within the state of california why are assumptions about future pension returns often highly uncertain rauh they used to be much more certain because pension funds used to invest primarily in safe securities such as government bonds us treasury bonds in the 1990s could generate 6 7 percent per year returns with a high degree of safety now they generate less than 3 percent per year state and local governments have responded to this change over time by shifting their asset allocation increasingly to riskier securities the stock market for one but also alternative assets such as private equity venture capital real estate and hedge funds overall around 75 percent of every dollar in public pension fund portfolios is invested in one of these risky asset classes while the pension funds typically assume they re going to earn around 7 5 percent per year in these investments the fact is that the returns that might be earned on these securities are highly uncertain even over long periods of time some people say everything will be fine the stock market and professional investors always do well enough over the long term that s not what the principles of finance say we know that in eras where the stock market has done well it is because those returns were compensation for risk for the possibility of bad outcomes that we got lucky and avoided right now pension funds are taking a great deal of risk in order to keep their return targets up there s no guarantee that it will go well and in fact the funds are more likely to fall substantially short of their targets than to achieve them what should the state and other entities in california do to realistically solve and reform their pension problems rauh realistically is a difficult word because this problem is so blocked by political special interests and public employee unions that said i like to think about what i would advise a friend who has racked up 60 000 of credit card debt that keeps growing every year because he s investing in risky assets that aren t generating the returns he s hoping for i would tell my friend that the first thing he needs to do is stop the behavior that is leading to the growth in the credit card debt in this case that behavior is promising public employees pensions without setting aside sufficient funds to pay for them and hoping that the stock market or private equity investments will bail everyone out that has to stop so on a forward looking basis governments need to either begin promising more modest pension benefits that they fund much more conservatively or failing that they need to put public employees into defined contribution plans which are more like the benefits private economy employees have this won t make the 769 billion debt go away but it will stop it from growing and for a state like california it is the explosive growth of this debt that should be more frightening than its absolute level is pension reform under way or being considered in california rauh our previous governor jerry brown knew that pensions were a big problem in 2011 the first year of his second turn as governor he proposed a 12 point pension overhaul the california state legislature passed some of these points particularly those that affect new hires these new members of the workforce will face higher retirement ages and there will be more sharing of costs between them and their municipal employers unfortunately the true pension costs are far higher than the costs as reflected in current budgets which is the part that would be shared it s like my offering to share costs with you in advance of your taking me out to dinner at a very fine restaurant but my contribution is based only on the expected cost of a hamburger at a fast food joint other points in governor brown s plan were passed but are currently being litigated such as the limitations against pension spiking the practice under which some public employees artificially inflate compensation in the years before retirement in order to set themselves up for a higher lifetime payment on the taxpayer dime believe it or not many public employees assert that they have a right to such practices these employees contend that the body of precedent informally called the california rule gives public employees a right to whatever benefit was available to them on their initial day of employment including the right to manipulate the compensation that determines their lifetime pension benefit recent appeals court decisions have upheld employees right to spike but the california supreme court has now taken up the issue while these attempts are better than nothing they fall far short of what is needed to stop the looming fiscal crisis that faces the state media contacts clifton b parker hoover institution 650 498 5204 cbparker

president chief executive officer thanks bryan and good morning everybody today we reported full year 2018 result with net income of 5 3 billion or 10 71 per diluted common share this strong year for pnc was capped by another solid quarter you saw that we reported fourth quarter net income of 1 4 billion or 2 75 per diluted share we grew loans deposits and net interest income in the quarter and we controlled expenses and while our provision increased reflecting loan growth and rob will talk more about this in a second credit quality remained very strong for the quarter non interest income for the quarter was down but largely due to asset management revenue driven by lower earnings from our equity investment blackrock and the decline includes a charge that flows through to pnc related to blackrock s restructuring charge that you i m sure you saw on their call this morning pulling back to look at the year 2018 was successful for pnc and i want to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work as well as our clients for their ongoing trust in us for the full year we achieved record total revenue non interest income and sorry net interest income and non interest income were up and we generated positive operating leverage for the year we continue to manage expenses well even as we invested pretty heavily into our businesses and our people improved is even improving our efficiency ratio through the year we grew loans and deposits and expanded the reach of our franchise both through our middle market expansion you saw we moved into an in 18 into denver houston and nashville but also to our successful launch of our national digital retail strategy finally we returned 4 4 billion in capital to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends and by the way since we began repurchasing shares in 2014 we ve returned more than 16 billion in total capital through dividends and share repurchases and our total share count has actually decreased 14 from 533 million to 457 million shares as we entered 19 despite the recent market volatility yield curve inversion political and trade tension we don t think we re headed toward a recession consumer confidence remains high and it s going to provide support for consumer spending which accounts as you know for over 65 of domestic gdp both services and manufacturing surveys remain at expansionary levels although admittedly after recent highs in our corporate clients as we talked to remain largely bullish of course all of this could change if for example the government shutdown persists for a longer period of time where disagreements with china on trade are sorted out and the impact currently being felt by large multinational starts to trickle down to the broader economy we don t think that s going to be the case instead we see an economy growing at over 2 5 and healthy loan demand as the repricing of the risk in the capital markets drives business back to the banks in this environment we believe we can continue to establish new customer relationships particularly as we keep broadening the reach of our brand we also believe we can deepen relationships with our existing clients by delivering a superior banking and investing experience alongside the innovative products we ve been bringing to market to help our customers achieve their financial goals furthermore we ll continue the path of risk and expense management that has enabled us to perform through the cycle creating long term value for our investors through time we ve got a lot of opportunities in front of us to grow the company responsibly simply by continuing to execute on our strategic priorities in 19 and we are excited about the year ahead with that i m going to turn it over to rob who s going to run you through the results in more detail and share our guidance for this year and then we ll be happy to answer any questions rob robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer great thanks bill and good morning everyone as bill just mentioned we reported full year net income of 5 3 billion or 10 71 per diluted common share and fourth quarter net income was 1 4 billion or 2 75 per diluted common share our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average basis total loans grew 2 6 billion or 1 to 226 billion in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4 8 billion or 2 investment securities of 82 1 billion increased 1 4 billion or 2 linked quarter and 7 9 billion or 11 compared to the same quarter a year ago purchases were primarily u s treasuries and residential mortgage backed securities our cash balances at the fed averaged 16 4 billion for the fourth quarter down 2 4 billion linked quarter and 8 9 billion year over year spot cash balances at the fed were 10 5 billion at december 31 as we opportunistically invested cash and resale agreements at year end deposits were up 2 on both a linked quarter and year over year basis as of december 31 2018 our basel iii common equity tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9 6 up from 9 3 at september 30th for the full year 2018 we returned 4 4 billion of capital to shareholders this represented a 22 increase over the prior year and was comprised of 1 6 billion in common dividends and 2 8 billion in share repurchases which included repurchases under our recently increased authorization our return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 1 4 our return on average common equity was 11 83 and our return on tangible common equity was 15 09 our tangible book value was 75 42 per common share as of december 31st an increase of 3 compared to september 30th slide 5 shows our loans and deposits in more detail average loans grew 2 6 billion or 1 linked quarter and 4 8 billion or 2 compared to the fourth quarter last year average commercial lending balances increased 2 3 billion linked quarter this reflects an increase in multifamily agency warehouse lending corporate banking business credit and equipment finance business if we think about our cnib loan portfolio in three categories secured lending commercial real estate and traditional cash flow our growth continues to be driven by the secured lending business which comprises approximately a third of our portfolio during the fourth quarter the secured lending businesses which we define as asset backed equipment finance and business credit grew 4 linked quarter and 12 year over year the second category commercial real estate excluding our multifamily agency warehouse lending declined approximately 1 and the third category traditional cash flow balances were relatively flat on the consumer side balances increased by approximately 300 million linked quarter and 1 1 billion year over year this was the sixth consecutive quarter that our average consumer portfolio grew we had growth in residential mortgage credit card auto and unsecured installment loans while home equity in education lending continued to decline deposits increased 4 billion or 2 to 267 billion in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter growth was largely in commercial deposits related to typical seasonality and as expected was primarily in interest bearing accounts consumer deposits remained stable lilnked quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago total deposits increased by 5 billion or 2 reflecting growth in both consumer and commercial balances our overall cumulative commercial beta increased in the fourth quarter driven by both commercial and consumer the cumulative commercial beta is effectively at our stated level and our cumulative consumer beta increased 1 from the third quarter to 14 and remains below our stated level of 38 as you can see on slide 6 full year 2018 revenue was a record 17 1 billion up 803 million or 5 net interest income increased by 613 million or 7 and non interest income grew by 190 million or 3 reflecting higher interest rates in overall business growth as a reminder 2017 non interest expense included significant items totaling approximately 500 million excluding these items full year non interest expense increased reflecting deliberate investment in our businesses technology and people for the fourth quarter expenses decline linked quarter by 31 million or 1 full year provision of 408 million decreased by 33 million compared to 2017 and provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter increased 60 million to 148 million now let s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail turning to slide 7 full year 2018 net interest income was 9 7 billion a record for pnc net interest income for 2018 increased 613 million or 7 compared with 2017 as higher earning asset yields and balances were partially offset by higher funding costs our net interest margin increased in 2018 to 2 97 up 10 basis points compared to 2017 for the fourth quarter our net interest margin was 2 96 a decline of 3 basis points linked quarter the 3 basis point decline was due to a fourth quarter refinement of the calculation of average other interest earning assets which resulted from automating certain operational processes during the quarter as a result average other interest earning assets increased by an immaterial amount and net interest income was unaffected impacting nim accordingly turning to slide 8 full year non interest income was up 190 million or 3 and included a 32 million decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter importantly we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across our franchise and those efforts helped to drive record fee income in 2018 of 6 2 billion taking a more detailed look at the performance in each of our fee categories asset management fees declined 117 million or 6 for the full year 2017 included a 254 million flow through benefit from tax legislation as a result of our equity investment in blackrock excluding this benefit asset management fees were up 137 million or 8 however on a linked quarter basis asset management fees declined 58 million driven by 47 million in lower earnings from pnc s investment in blackrock including a 10 million flow through impact related to the blackrock s recently announced restructuring charge pnc s asset management fees also decline linked quarter primarily driven by lower average equity market consumer services fees grew 87 million or 6 for the full year driven by higher debit card activity brokerage fees and credit card activity net of rewards compared to the third quarter concerned consumer services fees increased by 10 million or 3 corporate services fees increased to 107 million or 6 for the full year reflecting higher treasury management and m a advisory fees linked quarter corporate services fees grew by 3 million or 1 including higher loan syndication fees residential mortgage non interest income declined in both full year and linked quarter comparisons as volumes and margins remain challenged the linked quarter decline was driven by a 19 million negative adjustment for residential mortgage servicing rights valuation in the fourth quarter compared with no adjustment in the third quarter service charges on deposits increased 3 both linked quarter and full year reflecting increased customer activity and product enhancements finally other non interest income was 325 million for the fourth quarter and included a 42 million benefit from visa derivative adjustments primarily related to the change in visa share price during the quarter turning to slide 9 our full year 2018 expenses were 10 3 billion compared to 10 4 billion in 2017 as i previously mentioned 2017 included approximately 500 million of significant items impacting the year over year comparison taking a look at the fourth quarter expenses declined 31 million or 1 compared with the third quarter lower personnel expense and the elimination of the 36 million quarterly fdic surcharge assessment more than offset seasonal increases in occupancy and equipment and higher digital marketing expense our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 59 and 60 for the full year 2018 the lowest in several years expense management continues to be a focus for us and we remain disciplined in our overall approach as you know we had a 2018 goal of 250 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal for 2019 we ve increased our annual cip target by 50 million to 300 million our credit quality metrics are presented on slide 10 and remained strong full year provision for loan losses totaled 408 million down from 441 million in 2017 net charge offs also declined from 457 million in 2017 to 420 million in 2018 for 2018 reserves to total loans declined slightly to 1 16 from 1 18 on a linked quarter basis provision increase 60 million in the fourth quarter due to growth in both commercial and consumer loans as well as the impact of a handful of specific loan reserves in the commercial portfolio as we ve highlighted in the past given the absolute low levels of provision relative to the size of the loan portfolios we re likely to experience some volatility quarter over quarter as the timing of specific reserves or specific releases is not uniform but does tend to level out when viewed on a full year basis importantly we re not we re not seeing any broad trends within these specific reserves that would indicate potentially significant deterioration non performing loans were down 171 million or 9 compared to december 31st 2017 with declines in both commercial and consumer loans and year over year total delinquencies were down 35 million or 2 as you can see on the slide these credit metrics have continued to improve over the last 5 years to very low levels in summary pnc reported a successful 2018 and we re well positioned for 2019 looking ahead to the rest of the year we expect continued steady growth in gdp we now expect one increase of 25 basis points in short term interest rates this year occurring in september based on these assumptions our full year 2019 guidance compared to full year 2018 results is as follows we expect loan growth to be in the range of 3 to 4 we expect revenue growth in the upper end of the low single digit range we expect expense growth in the lower end of the low single digit range and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17 based on this guidance we believe we will continue to deliver positive operating leverage in 2019 looking at the first quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter 2018 results we expect loans to be stable we expect total net interest income to be stable reflecting two fewer days in the quarter we expect fee income to be down low single digits we expect other non interest income to be between 275 million and 325 million excluding excluding net securities and visa activity we expect expenses to be stable and we expect provision to be between 125 million and 175 million and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of john mcdonald with bernstein please proceed with your question john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst hi good morning guys i m just wondering if you could drill down a little bit in terms of what you re seeing in terms of credit quality understanding obviously we re coming of a really good credit performance over the last couple of years for you and the industry just kind of wondering what in your models drove the increase in provision this quarter and for a slightly higher rate of provisioning called for in the first quarter how much of that is driven by growth and how much by changes in credit quality or the early indicators that you see in your models robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer hey john this is rob so a couple of things on that again just to reiterate what i just said and bill mentioned credit quality is really strong by virtually every measure charge off is down npa is down delinquency is down year over year so that hasn t changed in regard to the provision for the fourth quarter i chalked that up to growth and also some of these specific names or these these handful of names that we had so when you take a look at our total 2018 provision of 400 million down year over year we re bounced on of some pretty low levels so that explains the fourth quarter of 2018 for the first quarter of 19 going forward a couple of things one again credit quality we see as good we don t see any broad trends in any asset asset categories that would suggest substantial deterioration that i mentioned but we do see growth william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer but frankly any deterioration i mean the use of word substantial but there s not you know john we had four commercial credits go npa in the fourth quarter and they were all completely idiosyncratic associated with strange things so nothing kind of based on the broader economy and and even in consumer where there s been a slight tick up in auto that s still going back to the hurricane damage there s there s really nothing there robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer no i think that s right just to complete that thought in the first quarter i do bill mentioned it commercial wise it is so low total charge offs in our commercial portfolio in 2018 were 25 million on a 150 billion portfolio so at some point that s got to come up a bit but it s gradual multiple speakers william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer the short answer to your question on the guidance for the first quarter is it just can t stand we don t see anything it just can t stay this multiple speaker that low forever so we kind of i ll tell you a slightly higher number though on the back of the fact that everybody is talking about a slightly weaker economy but we don t see anything today that says that s true john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst okay got it that s that s really helpful and in terms of the revenue outlook you ve given an outlook on revenues for 2019 upper end of low single digits so just kind of wondering what your confidence level in the revenue outlook maybe how you see it split a little bit between nii and fees and where do you end the year with good revenue momentum and tailwinds and where might the revenue outlook be a little more challenging thanks william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer sure so our guidance calls for revenue of the upper end of low single digits which is connected to our loan outlook which is 3 to 4 growth and you can sort of do the math in terms of the fee guidance being the low single digit on the lower end we do see in terms of the contribution to revenue more that growth coming from nii versus the fees but growth in the fees robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer we had absent impact of blackrock we had a great year this year on fees a lot of it in corporate services that depending what market activity is could be a little bit weaker into next year the other thing is just in the forecast we have included in effect the markets expectation on blackrock inside of our fee line so that s causing that to be somewhat subdued versus our own internal growth john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst okay and in terms of the net interest income rob you see that growing kind of in line with the loan growth got some puts and takes around the nim obviously but pretty much in line with loan growth robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes that s right john john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari evercore isi analyst good morning william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer good morning john john pancari evercore isi analyst also on the credit front the reserve came out around 116 basis points is that a fair level to to assume where it holds through the year if we don t see material change in credit and then also i know you indicated handful of commercial names that impacted the number or your expectation for provisioning here does that mean that that provision range of inaudible could come down beyond the first quarter as we move through 2019 or do you think it stays there william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer that s why we give you a range robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer that s right that s the range and they re pretty small ranges in terms of the the key word is gradual so we don t see major shifts but i think in terms of the reserve ratio i think we re adequately reserved and i see that as being fairly stable john pancari evercore isi analyst okay all right got it and then when you look at margin it was excluding the 3 basis point impact of that process change it was still flat despite still the ongoing fed hike so can you comment on your asset sensitivity here i mean what do you what type of progression does the margin have if we see your rate assumption of one hike in 19 play out you know how do we think about the margin through 19 and if the fed stops and we don t get that hike do we get some incremental expansion here in the near term or is it flat to down william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer you embedded a whole bunch of different issues into that question in terms of asset sensitivity we remain asset sensitive that could play out and will play out in niis you see in our guidance may or may not play out in nim so you re going to have to kind of separate the two and we ve never really managed the company to nim all that said the momentum that we ve had on net interest margin and the industry has had on the back of fairly predictable rate hikes is going to slow down so my best guess is our nim not our net interest income is going to bounce around current levels through the course of the year i would tell you that this quarter it doesn t change income but we had the issue on average earning assets we had some hedge ineffectiveness that went against us we had a lower swaps balance we had a whole bunch of things that have nothing to do with economics that impact that number it could have easily printed the other way so i don t think you re going to see a big pickup from us or anybody else going forward it s not related asset sensitivity it s related to just rising rates in the short end but i m not worried about that i think well as we said we ll continue to see growth in nii robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer and we don t provide nim guidance but just to reiterate bill s point of view we d expect this to be the right that where we are now this is what our current range expectations are pretty short term inaudible john pancari evercore isi analyst right okay got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning guys bryan gill director of investor relations hey gerard gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst i apologize if you touched on this as multiple conference calls going on i should know how is the competition on the c i side if you could compare it throughout 2018 did it ease up at all in the fourth quarter as the shadow of banking industry if you will going into difficulties or is it as tough as ever if you give us some color there on the c i competition william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer i think what you re going after here it is that the crack in credit spreads in the capital markets impact and offer opportunity to the banks and the answer to that is yes so what banks are willing to do on the lending side has backed off at this point in terms of where they d underwrite syndicate you ve seen some people have run into some hung deals that doesn t play into our model that much because we re not really in the leverage lending business what has happened though is the clients who are kind of i call them the 5bs so they use banks and they also use the bond markets they re coming back to banks as the price differential has kind of moved in favor of banks and the bond market has at least thus far not really opened up for them so we see that benefit as it release to head to head bank competition on a traditional bank name in middle market cash flow it s still brutal that hasn t changed so maybe the simplest way to answer the question is bank to bank competition is still fierce bank to capital market competition has moved in favor of banks gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good and then the follow up on that if you take recession off the table i don t think anybody believes we re going to have a recession in 2019 so we take that off the table and in some episodic global risk of bill ph when you guys look at your business for this year what are the risks that you re focusing in on to make sure that you re not caught by these risks earnings or revenues william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer so we actually we ve done a look at who might be impacted by tariffs both directly and trickle down and we actually have specific reserves against that inside of our credit book today but by and large we serve the domestic economy and the domestic economy you ve heard me say this before is really strong and our clients remain strong now they ultimately can be impacted obviously by the global economy and by the trickle down effect of some of the troubles the larger multinationals face because of their global economy but thus far we don t see it and at the margin if the worst case happens we won t have a any concentrated impact as it relates to industries or businesses recover we will simply be impacted as a function of the impact you d expect from a slower economy broadly defined gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst great appreciate the color thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin jefferies company analyst hi good morning thanks guys i guess question on the deposit side looks you continue to have really good overall growth and obviously the deposit cost has been going up can you just talk through just a deposit competition side and given your view of just one hike this year how does how do you anticipate the deposit competition to evolve in this presumably slower than previously anticipated rate cycle william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer it s a good question and it varies by what we re trying to do so on our national digital strategy we re playing principally against the online banks and we re all paying largely a at money market rate and i think that continues it s interesting our retail data this quarter actually was less than it was in the third quarter and that ll kind of bounce around as we go through the year but we re not seeing at least thus far massive competition for traditional deposits we continue to pull deposits from as does the industry flows from smaller banks to larger banks and i think that s rate independent that services dependent and i think that trend continues and then you have this whole overlay of the continued shrinkage of the fed and balance sheet which draws cash out of the system so there s a lot of factors in there i don t see a massive shift through 19 and the trends that we ve seen thus far through time you will see greater portions of our total deposits coming from the online channel which of course will change our beta but today it s such a small number it doesn t really impact it ken usdin jefferies company analyst yes and maybe as a follow up can you just flush out just the progress you re making on that national strategy and the type of growth that you re seeing from the new markets and the new endeavor robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes we re sure on the consumer side so we also have expansion markets on the commercial side but on the consumer side it s going well exceeding our expectations we ve been at it now just for over 3 months balances continue to grow across a lot of geographies and 85 of those new accounts which now are getting close to the high teens in the 10 000 18 000 range are 85 of that is new to pnc so we like overseeing so far but it s early william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer a couple of things i d say and by the way we owe you guys a lot of data on this and as soon as we get enough of a track record we ll start talking about what we re seeing in terms of activity in these accounts and stuff but a couple of things that we re seeing so far that validate some of our original thoughts one is that physical presence matters so the solution center we opened in kansas city continues to draw a disproportionate share in terms of origination versus online channel per capita and people are willing to travel they ll go do it two is that the number of virtual wallet accounts that we are opening that are being used by new customers continue to surprise at least me i think it s i don t know a third or 25 robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer by 25 yes about 25 william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer and totally new clients to pnc who are using us as their primary bank and that s quite interesting to us robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer and encouraging william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer yes and we we re gonna have to do some analysis around that to figure out what types of activity how sticky deposits are how deposit trends of these accounts move so on and so forth but so far we re pretty happy with it ken usdin jefferies company analyst all right thanks very much operator operator instructions our next question is a follow up from the line of john mcdonald with bernstein please go ahead john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst hey guys just wanted to probe a little bit on robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer you re back john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst yes i m back on the idea of operating leverage how you guys are thinking about it in terms of the linguistic gymnastics on the outlook slide revenues up higher end of low single digits that seems like it could be 3 and a lower end of single to me is like 1 to 2 so it seems like you re saying maybe 100 basis points to 200 basis points of operating leverage is that like a reasonable bogey for us to think about that you guys are kind of shooting for this year robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes that s right john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst talk about that a little bit rob robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes no that s right on so the higher end of low single digit just average put a little band around at 3 and lower and put a band around 1 william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer hey john long story short notwithstanding the performance of our share price we feel pretty good about 19 that we put it in the guidance john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst good and that obviously mathematically that should grind down your efficiency ratio if you continue to do the operating leverage robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes that s correct john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst all right thanks guys i won t circle back again william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer we did hey john along those lines we did hit a five handle on the efficiency ratio there in the fourth quarter so we re on john mcdonald sanford c bernstein analyst yes i think that s good to see the improvement i think people are kind of we re looking for hoping to get below 60 and i think commitment to continued improvement is also helpful robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes good bryan gill director of investor relations next question please operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america please go ahead erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning i just wanted to also clarify your full year outlook it looks like consensus has a 6 decline in net income expectation for blackrock in 2019 of course not yet adjusted for this morning so it sounds like the revenue momentum for 19 and positive operating leverage is actually better given that that s all coming through your revenue line is that a good interpretation of how we re thinking about blackrock versus core trends robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes and we do use the consensus numbers for blackrock erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay perfect and just a follow up to ken s question the market is also thinking that perhaps the fed is on a longer pause than the september hike that you re thinking embedding in your guide but as we think about deposit repricing particularly for money market strategy how many quarters until the last hike does deposit pricing stop catching up in your experience robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer how many quarters until the last hike william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer you mean how many quarters after the last day erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes how many quarters after the last hike william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer you know through history there s been a pretty long tail the problem today of course as you have for the first time since we ve gone through this you have a lot of online accounts at the same time as you have the fed shrinking its balance sheet so and you have smaller banks really competing on rate if they have to hold onto clients so i i don t know how that plays out i would consider guess for you but i think those are the factors that are going to impact what happens to deposit rates as we move forward i think that for banks such as ourselves our ability for our core clients to continue to lag at the margin will remain largely on the back of the services as we provide them robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer i think that s right and commercial of course erika as you know has moved so it s all about the consumer deposits erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and looking at your cet1 ratios and the potential fed proposals i m wondering if we should expect a continuation of increase in terms of buyback requests from the fed particularly given the stock prices lagged a little bit relative to peers william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer the answer is yes although remember the proposals that are out are unlikely to have any impact on this coming ccar and it s unclear in terms of the new ccar guidance how much of that will be included in this year s ccar i think they re still sorting through that but at the margin both of those things will give us increased flexibility and where otherwise by certainly at this share price to be pretty heavy on the buyback erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer and of course we haven t seen the scenarios yet so that s just speculation erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks operator our next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez ubs equities analyst hey good morning can you just give us an update on where you stand on your ccar preparation when you think when do you plan to start with parallel runs or unless you ve already done so and just when can and just any update on when do you think we can have some sort of estimate of the upfront impact robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes so we re busy working on it and making good progress we have said before it s our intention to begin parallel run here in the first half of 2019 we re on track to do that so in regard to being able to provide you with information and insight from that sometime in the second half saul martinez ubs equities analyst sometime in the second half okay fair enough thanks a lot operator our next question comes from the line of kevin barker with piper jaffray please go ahead kevin barker piper jaffray analyst good morning robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer good morning kevin kevin barker piper jaffray analyst in regards to following up on some of the credit comments there was a particular pickup in equipment lease financing on the 30 day delinquency rate is there anything in particular there you ve seen that you can expand upon robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer no yes kevin there was a tick up there and it was in the 30 day category there equipment leasing to some of those delinquencies are elevated relative to a software change that we made that created some administrative delinquencies so there s some elevation that s coming from that that s part of that otherwise it s just seasonal william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer but differently it s not really a change in credit conditions there the system is processing certain payments in a way that cause us to book them as delinquent whereas the old system didn t do that robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes administrative and we ll clear those up kevin barker piper jaffray analyst so do you make a broad administrative change in your systems to impact your calculation for nim on top of this robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer no the two are completely separate completely separate things william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer but it is totally separate things but i mean we are look we put in a completely new leasing system that has a couple bumps that are causing us you know this issue you see on delinquencies the automation inside of the balance sheet calculations is a good thing we re just automating manual processes and in the process of doing that we found a calculation difference that historically had been often a de minimis amount on the balance sheet all these things are good we re basically getting rid of manual stuff and putting a new system so we find things every time we do it kevin barker piper jaffray analyst okay and so no deterioration in credit and it s just showing that multiple speakers william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer no i mean it ll go all the way back to the beginning there s just there s nothing that we see in any of these books that is suggesting anything but the continuation of the trend we ve always hedge that with the basic notion that it just can t stay this good forever kevin barker piper jaffray analyst got it ok and then in regards to your loan growth of 3 to 4 and with commercial competition i guess easing from the non banks and potentially giving a little bit of a tailwind possibly from there absent a slowdown in the broader economy are you seeing any of the pickup in the consumer side as well given some of the changes that you ve been making over the last i d say a year or two in order to focus more on the consumer william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer that work continues and you ve seen for i don t know five or six quarters in a row robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer six quarters william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer we managed to grow consumer and we ought to be able to continue to do that despite the run off that we continue to see in home equity in our student lending i d like to think that would accelerate its you are running against a pretty big headwind in terms of those run offs but we re doing it without changing the credit risk that we are taking simply by executing on good products in getting good better penetration into our existing client base so i don t know if it accelerates but it ought to continue robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes certainly continue but in terms of our guidance with 3 to 4 we do see more growth on the commercial side than consumer but to bill s point growth in both portfolios william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer by the way some of the growth in commercial will continue to see growth as we have in our secured businesses specialty businesses absent real estate but the other thing is we are unlikely to have some of the purposeful run off we saw in 18 repeat itself in certain segments that just weren t kind of paying the freight so we feel pretty good about that number kevin barker piper jaffray analyst okay thank you very much operator next question comes from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank please go ahead deutsche bank equity research analyst yes hi this is rob on for matt i m just curious on your new expansion markets i was just curious if you can provide an update on progress you re making there just how things are tracking versus your expectations robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes it s a good report there in terms of again these are relatively new but in each one of those markets we are growing loans faster than that legacy book and then i think what we are most encouraged about is the composition of the business which is relationship oriented and i think close to half of our sales are in non credit so it is not just blind participation in credits what we intended to do was to build out our model in these markets so so far very good deutsche bank equity research analyst okay and then just on your liquidity position you mentioned you invested in some resale agreements at year end robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes deutsche bank equity research analyst does that correspond to the increase in other assets on a period end basis and then maybe just an update on your thinking about continued deployment from here robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes sure no it does and again that s just a year end so that was just for a short period of time going forward in terms of our liquidity no we feel good about in terms of where we are we are satisfying our current lcr obligations a north of 100 there is a proposal for us to go lower but that won t likely occur substantially in 2019 so we are good we have balances roughly in the 16 billion range of the fed we could redeploy those in other level one securities higher yielding securities and we may do that as the year plays out deutsche bank equity research analyst okay thanks robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of brian klock with keefe bruyette woods please go ahead brian p klock keefe bruyette woods inc analyst hey good morning gentlemen robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer good morning brian p klock keefe bruyette woods inc analyst i just had a quick question on you talked about some of the loan growth earlier from the line of business in a collateral type perspective i was looking at table six in your sup pack that s just on the end of period on the c i you had a pretty good growth that drove a lot of the c i growth in retail wholesale trade and then the other sort of catch all industries that was up by 2 billion sequentially is there anything that jumps out within that growth anything that s a little bit because like i said just from the fourth quarter it was much more significant than you ve seen in another quarters and was that part of what you william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer i don t have the table in front of me but if it s inclusive of our asset based lending a lot of that will come from year end inventory build for retailers that were otherwise clients but basically draw down pretty heavy as it gets ready for the christmas season brian p klock keefe bruyette woods inc analyst got you robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes i m aware of the table but there s nothing unusual there william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer i think that probably came from asset based lending and the traditional draw down on the lines as they build inventory brian p klock keefe bruyette woods inc analyst got it that s helpful and then i guess a follow up on the liquidity discussion and bill you mentioned earlier i guess obviously with the fed pulling liquidity out of the system i guess when it was on autopilot i guess we ll see if they remain on autopilot but your dda balances have been declining and like the industry had throughout the year and it seems like obviously a lot of that is in your c ib segment the retail growth in dda has been pretty good so i guess is there any visibility into like when could that stabilize or when do you think that dda runoff in the c ib might kind of abate william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer i don t know that i have any model the insight into it i think the simple notion that rates are higher than zero and have been for some period of time now has caused corporates to get smart about lazy ph money my guess is that they re already doing that they don t choose to do it 50 on the way and then wake because they re giving out money everyday so my guess is we re probably where we re going to be robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer yes and just to that point time will tell but if you take a look just on the commercial side in terms of non interest bearing accounts they did decline in the fourth quarter but they declined at a much lower rate than what we saw at the beginning of the year to your point brian p klock keefe bruyette woods inc analyst yes that s fair that s fair appreciate it thanks guys william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer thank you operator there are no further questions on the phone line turning the call william s demchak chairman president chief executive officer

unfortunately the option of avoiding the transition to consumer led growth and continuing to promote exports and real estate investment is not very attractive either china is already a dominant global exporter and there is neither market space nor political tolerance to allow it to maintain its previous pace of export expansion bolstering growth through investment particularly in residential real estate which accounts for the lion s share of chinese construction output is also ever more challenging downward pressure on prices especially outside tier 1 cities is making it increasingly difficult to induce families to invest an even larger share of their wealth into housing although china may be much better positioned than any western economy to socialise losses that hit the banking sector a sharp contraction in housing prices and construction could prove extremely painful to absorb emerging economies any significant growth recession in china would hit the rest of asia hard along with commodity exporting developing and emerging economies nor would europe and especially germany be spared although the us is less dependent on china the trauma to financial markets and politically sensitive exports would make a chinese slowdown much more painful than us leaders seem to realise a less likely but even more traumatic outside risk would materialise if after many years of trend decline global long term real interest rates reversed course and rose significantly i am not speaking merely of a significant over tightening by the us federal reserve in 2019 a significant chinese slowdown may already be unfolding qilai shen advertisement this would be problematic but it would mainly affect short term real interest rates and in principle could be reversed in time the far more serious risk is a shock to very long term real interest rates which are lower than at any point during the modern era except for the period of financial repression after world war ii when markets were much less developed than today while a sustained rise in the long term real interest rate is a low probability event it is far from impossible although there are many explanations of the long term trend decline some factors could be temporary and it is difficult to establish the magnitude of different possible effects empirically one factor that could cause global rates to rise on the benign side would be a spurt in productivity for example if the so called fourth industrial revolution starts to affect growth much faster than anticipated this would of course be good overall for the global economy but it might greatly strain lagging regions and groups but upward pressure on global rates could stem from a less benign factor a sharp trend decline in asian growth for example from a long term slowdown in china that causes the region s long standing external surpluses to swing into deficits but perhaps the most likely cause of higher global real interest is the explosion of populism across much of the world to the extent that populists can overturn the market friendly economic policies of the past several decades they may sow doubt in global markets about just how safe advanced country debt really is this could raise risk premia and interest rates and if governments were slow to adjust budget deficits would rise markets would doubt governments even more and events could spiral more debt advertisement most economists agree that today s lower long term interest rates allow advanced economies to sustain significantly more debt than they might otherwise but the notion that additional debt is a free lunch is foolish high debt levels make it more difficult for governments to respond aggressively to shocks the inability to respond aggressively to a financial crisis a cyber attack a pandemic or a trade war significantly heightens the risk of long term stagnation and is an important explanation of why most serious academic studies find that very high debt levels are associated with slower long term growth if policymakers rely too much on debt as opposed to higher taxation on the wealthy to pursue progressive policies that redistribute income it is easy to imagine markets coming to doubt that countries will grow their way out of very high debt levels investors scepticism could well push up interest rates to uncomfortable levels of course there are many other risks to global growth including ever increasing political chaos in the united states a messy brexit italy s shaky banks and heightened geopolitical tensions but these outside risks do not make the outlook for global growth necessarily grim the baseline scenario for the us is still strong growth europe s growth could be above trend as well as it continues its long slow recovery from the debt crisis at the beginning of the decade and china s economy has been proving doubters wrong for many years so 2019 could turn out to be another year of solid global growth unfortunately it is likely to be a nerve racking one as well kenneth rogoff a former chief economist of the imf is professor of economics and public policy at harvard university project syndicate

the auto industry always seems to be a predictive measure of weakness in the economy if auto sales fall we can use that to project consumer spending which represents 2 3rds of the overall economy however auto stocks have moved downward the past year despite ideal economic conditions there has been a slump in sales figures even with a boost from fleet sales especially across american automakers there are several reasons for this decline including quantitative tightening job losses heightened competition weakness overseas and the trade war the attempt at quantitative tightening higher interest rates low interest rates have been fuel to the automobile purchasing fire over the past several years people have taken advantage of cheap credit and pushed the total number of outstanding auto loans to above 1 trillion which is a 64 increase since 2010 the united states and the rest of the world are attempting to ease out of quantitative easing with the fed planning to hike interest rates two more times in 2019 as of now source fred rising interest rates will compress the ability of consumers to take out loans to purchase vehicles putting pressure on us auto sales and threatening the cheap credit that so many took advantage of when purchasing their vehicles rates are still historically extremely low but combined with other factors it has led automakers to enact plant shutdowns resulted in job losses and dampened sales forecasts driving into a thunderstorm shutting down plants cutting jobs general motors gm cut 15 of their workforce and closed three plants and two facilities back in november 2018 ford f also plans to cut 20 000 jobs in part of an 11 billion restructuring plan jaguar land rover also slashed jobs overseas it could be argued that the automakers are too big the plants that they run have the production capacity of many more vehicles than they are able to sell automakers sold 17 million new vehicles in 2018 approximately the same amount as 2017 this is the fourth straight year above 17 million vehicles and many expect that number to decline into 2019 source charlie bilello however despite maintaining sales numbers for the year the companies have been pretty beat up over the course of 2018 it s becoming difficult to retain relevance in the era of foreign automakers on us soil not to mention the advent of autonomous cars ride sharing and shifting consumer preferences fiat chrysler fcau in comparison to its other american counterparts is up 161 after dropping out of the sedan market entirely in 2016 fiat chrysler owns both the jeep and ram lines which dominate the sportier side of the suv and truck segment of the market fcau s gamble on not producing sedans anymore has seemed to pay off with the ram truck winning 2018 truck of the year ford and gm are following fcau s lead with ford planning to ax every car except for the mustang while at the same time planning to grow their lineup by three crossovers and suv models by 2023 gm had planned to stick with the sedan market but factory closures have led them to pull several of their top models out of the lineup such as the chevrolet impala and the buick lacrosse they plan to still produce the chevy malibu and more cadillac sedans in the future however sedans and small cars will still make up 30 of the overall auto market and foreign automakers are planning to capitalize on that sedans are great cars for first time drivers and they are usually cheaper to gas up and maintain suvs carry a higher profit margin but sedans still maintain a lot of relevance in the market the competition foreign automakers foreign automakers currently operate 19 plants inside the united states which enables them to avoid currency fluctuations and overseas shipping costs it has also helped bolster their market share in the us with foreign automakers accounting for more than 50 of all vehicles sold in the united states gm ford and fiat chrysler the big three now control 44 of the us market down from 74 thirty years ago toyota tm sales fell by less than half of a percent over the course of 2018 with the ever reliable toyota corolla helping bolster the company s sales the rav4 and tacoma also led the way in crossover and truck sales nissan otcpk nsany which was plagued by the arrest of former ceo and chairman carlos ghosn saw a decline of 6 6 in sales for 2018 however they had a 7 6 increase in sales for the month of december they will probably have more problems ahead as jose munoz former chief performance officer and closely tied to ghosn resigned last friday among the other foreign automakers honda hmc sales were down 2 2 and hyundai kia hymlf sales down 1 1 volkswagen otcpk vwagy sales up approximately 5 4 based on year to date november data and subaru sales were up 5 volkswagen has also entered into a global alliance with ford with ford building trucks for both companies by 2022 the alliance is interesting letting both companies focus on what they are good at and could spark similar relationships between more automakers source usa today author the demand shift sport utility vehicles consumers are also demanding suvs which has required a shift from car production cars make up 30 of the new vehicle market a decline from 43 share in 2015 car sales are expected to decline even more over the next six years composing 21 5 of the market in 2025 every nine out of ten vehicles sold in 2020 are expected to be suvs and other commercial vehicles primarily driven by cheap financing but overall vehicle sales are declining there was a big uptick in the early part of this decade but the change year over year has essentially flatlined and has been trending negative for the past three years source fred if the economy enters into a correction or even slows down auto sales will follow suit also the whole trade war puts further pressure on the industry trump attacked gm s decision to cut jobs and close plants but one of the reasons that they did so was because of higher steel and aluminum prices due to the tariffs enacted rising input costs the effect of the trade dispute if it becomes more expensive to produce vehicles the automakers will have trouble keeping up raw material prices increased by 10 over the past year which impacts production costs there is also a 10 tariff on imported aluminum steel has a 25 tariff separately due to an increase in feed costs plastic resin prices rose 31 source auto news ford and gm said that the tariffs cost them 1 billion in profits automakers normally carry long term contracts with suppliers so rapidly changing policies can be quite painful the us imported 5 5 million tons of aluminum in 2017 with domestic production totaling 740k tons the us imports 86 5 more aluminum than it makes so it would take time to adjust to not importing the product and avoiding the impact of the tariffs also the rising costs of materials have to be passed off to consumers as noted by gm s chief financial officer suvs which are more expensive in general can offset some of the costs as they tend to carry wider margins but things might change as the higher priced materials continue to work their way through the supply chain also there was a trump proposal to reduce emissions targets which could be painful in the transition into electric vehicles in europe the opposite is happening with new auto emission rules and in asia china has a massive demand for greener vehicles it is entirely necessary for automakers to continue paying attention to electric vehicles electric vehicles and tesla tsla the industry itself is evolving in the direction of electric vehicles traditional manufacturing jobs are slowly being replaced by high tech engineering careers producing an electric car does not require as many workers as a traditional car does according to dr aston bailey a professor at aston university there is also a global drive towards emission caps and creating vehicles to be more environmentally friendly the electric vehicle market currently accounts for 3 of the total passenger car market with total sales of over 2 8 million cars it is expected to grow tremendously in the coming years source national geographic then there is tesla who specializes in electric vehicles they are the first western carmaker to build a plant in china that isn t part of a joint venture in the age of tariffs and painful shipping costs it makes sense for tesla to integrate in china just as foreign car makers have done in the us tesla seems to thrive on risk and entering into china when the country seems to be on the verge of slowing down might be the best decision they ve ever made china is the world leader in electric vehicle ev sales they have rules that require carmakers to sell 30 000 or more cars a year to make fleets with increasingly higher fuel economies by 2020 and 2025 which tesla already has a head start on chinese car sales were down 4 1 in 2018 as compared to 2017 numbers after 6 months of steady declines the recent downturn in the chinese stock market and beijing s attempt to compress debt are drivers of the decline in auto sales however on the flip side electric vehicle sales are on the rise due to government subsidies and increasingly gain more market share source manufacturing net there are also boutique electric vehicle companies like sf motors and rivian among others they operate in a niche segment in a big industry and it seems that the efforts are paying off faraday future was a leader back in 2016 with their notorious bat mobile nio has already entered into china going public last year with a 6 4 billion valuation the problem that the more niche ev companies will have as compared to the big automakers is production costs tesla infamously struggles with putting enough vehicles out to market at a profitable scale so if gm ford and the other top dogs can somehow create evs efficiently and create evs that people want to buy they should be able to slide their way into a spot in this segment of the industry ford is planning to invest 11b in evs and gm is planning to produce an all electric cadillac in the future the companies are making effort in the right direction but there are still outside variables such as driverless cars and ride sharing apps that will also create barriers autonomous vehicles and uber a stanford economist tony seba predicts that 95 of all passenger miles will be autonomous by 2030 seba believes that fleets will take advantage of the ease of maintenance and manufacturing process of electric vehicles which will help get more of them on the road the timeline seems short for such a change but in hindsight a lot has happened in the past ten years with regard to vehicle innovation ridesharing and carsharing are also two forces that have popped up in recently uber uber and lyft lyft are evolving rapidly and could potentially disrupt the auto industry fancy features on vehicles do not matter to those who are just using the vehicle to get around town especially if they don t own it they just need a ride from point a to point b source wsj also from a demographic perspective younger generations are about 30 less likely to buy a car as compared to older generations low gas prices and an uptick in wages has made driving more affordable but the millennial and gen z generations have both student loan debt and increased housing costs that compress their ability to buy cars they are also more comfortable using apps like uber and lyft as a means of transportation further reducing the need for a car conclusion uncertainty within the auto industry there are definite headwinds within the auto industry there is a process of adapting to change which of course takes time automakers sometimes take too long to adapt and end up being left behind there is increasing competition political pressures and demographic shifts the companies that can maintain relevance and produce vehicles or enter partnerships that can somehow meet all the various market demands will be successful the big three are shifting their resources into suvs but are at risk in being left behind in the shift to ev foreign automakers are keeping stake in the sedan market which could prove to be worthwhile if preferences shift back to smaller vehicles tesla and other boutique ev companies are taking hold in china and other markets that have the appetite for evs the economy has experienced strong growth consumers are spending and unemployment is near all time lows however ford and gm were hit hard this year the volkswagen ford alliance is promising and the idea of more consolidation and partnerships to focus on individual economies of scale should streamline costs of production across the industry all of the auto companies ended 2018 in the red but most companies market wide did the same tesla was down the least with a 3 25 decline from january 2018 numbers ford was down the most with a 39 57 decline from january 2018 to december 2018 ford is up 12 since the beginning of 2019 more than likely bolstered from the volkswagen news most of the companies have relatively low pe ratios besides tesla and strong profitability metrics tsla leads the way in terms of revenue and ebitda growth with 62 93 and 187 46 metrics respectively fiat chrysler is poised for strong eps growth but carries a large beta at 2 03 for an automobile stock what is appealing about fcau is that it carries several european lines such as alfa romeo fiat and maserati as well as american brands such as dodge chrysler and jeep sergio marchionne the late ceo was credited with turning the company around the stock had an adjustment period after his passing but currently trades at a pe ratio of 7 08 and a tev ebitda of 2 3x which is extremely small compared to the industry and signals potential undervaluation they have strong cash flows with 6 8 more in inflows expected due to their magneti marelli sale the stock offers diversification across different economies with international as well as domestic exposure however ford is also moving in the right direction with obvious focus on electric vehicles and a willingness to collaborate with volkswagen ford carries a higher tev ebitda at 11 6x and a pe ratio of 5 96 they carry a beta of 0 67 which might be good if we enter another period of extreme market volatility
the election of u s president donald trump and a republican congress in 2016 spurred another experiment in supply side economics which should interest policy makers in ottawa and the provinces specifically congress passed a tax bill that reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent while the administration rolled back regulations that accumulated during the obama presidency republicans said these steps would stimulate business investment and economic growth which had lagged during the obama years the theory behind the tax cut and deregulation initiatives is straightforward lower taxes on corporate earnings and lower costs associated with reduced regulatory burdens should increase the after tax profitability of business investments thereby encouraging increased capital expenditures the latter in turn should lead to increased productivity and faster real economic growth the main argument against these supply side measures made by economist and new york times columnist paul krugman and others is that capital investment is relatively insensitive to corporate tax rates in other words there aren t many potential business investments worth doing with a 21 per cent profit tax that aren t worth doing with a 35 per cent tax rate the issue of the effectiveness of supply side policies is ultimately empirical in fact private sector capital spending in the united states picked up substantially after mr trump took office gross private domestic investment increased by only 3 6 per cent from 2014 to 2016 compared with an increase of almost 14 per cent from 2016 to the third quarter of 2018 this increase belies the arguments of critics such as mr krugman that the corporate tax cut resulted only in corporations buying back their own shares rather than expanding production capacity it s also quite plausible that the supply side effects of the trump tax cuts and deregulation would be even more pronounced if not for the economic uncertainty and disruptions to production supply chains caused by the administration s mercantilist tariffs and escalating trade war with china an index of trade policy uncertainty created by economists at the university of chicago increased by more than 200 per cent from 2016 to 2018 put simply investors and corporate executives making decisions about capital expenditures became much more uncertain about the likely outcome of their investment decisions after the tax cut went into effect increased uncertainty results in companies using a higher discount rate to evaluate potential investments which in turn discourages capital expenditures at the margin indeed surveys by the federal reserve bank of atlanta show that u s firms are delaying or dropping a significant percentage of previously planned capital expenditures because of increased uncertainty in the global trade environment here at home there has been much discussion about a dramatic decrease in business investment in canada relative to other developed countries in recent years concerns about a deteriorating domestic environment for capital investment have led to calls by some canadian economists and international organizations including the international monetary fund and the organization for economic co operation and development for tax reform in canada to stimulate capital expenditures an important component of any such reform would include reductions in canada s corporate tax rate which is now among the highest in the developed world clearly while canadian policy makers should avoid certain aspects of trump administration policies supply side policies such as corporate tax cuts and cutting regulatory red tape are worth emulating the trump administration s real time experiment in supply side economics has produced evidence that tax reduction and deregulation incentives work even when they are compromised by tariffs and other policies anathema to supply side proponents steven globerman is a senior fellow at the fraser institute
