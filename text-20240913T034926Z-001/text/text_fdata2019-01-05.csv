as we step into a new year the world is facing a decisive turning point the crisis of capitalism is reaching a new level one that threatens to overthrow the entire existing world order that was painfully put together after the second world war 10 years after the financial collapse of 2008 the bourgeoisie is nowhere near solving the economic crisis all the sacrifices and pain of the last 10 years have not solved the crisis but only increased the suffering impoverishment and desperation of the masses while a tiny minority of parasites have acquired obscene levels of wealth but politics in the last analysis is concentrated economics a decade ago we predicted that all the attempts of governments to restore the economic equilibrium would only serve to destroy the social and political equilibrium we see this in one country after another in europe we have the simmering brexit crisis in itself a highly destabilising element in the situation it has thrown britain into a deep crisis with no clear end in sight not long ago britain was perhaps the most politically stable country in europe now it is one of the most unstable countries a few weeks ago on channel 4 news the well known conservative political commentator matthew parris was asked if he thought that the present crisis was the most serious one in british history he answered as follows i can remember the suez crisis of 1956 that was a very serious crisis and i have since lived through other ones but always in the past no matter how deep the crisis i always had the sensation that someone somewhere had a plan clear idea of how to get out of the crisis i no longer have that feeling in just over a week s time the british prime minister theresa may will present her ill fated deal for the approval of the british parliament her chances of success resemble those of a snowball in hell but having defeated the deal so painfully put together with eu what will happen next the possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal is a finished recipe for unprecedented economic social and political chaos not just in britain but throughout europe the possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal is a finished recipe for unprecedented economic social and political chaos not just in britain but throughout europe image socialist appeal it is a measure of the complete bankruptcy of the british political establishment that such a scenario could even be contemplated but the clock is ticking and britain is running out of time whatever alternative is proposed will be disastrous the only question is the degree of the disaster the stage is set in any case for a very stormy period for britain but the crisis of europe does not end there in germany which for decades was the real motor force behind the european economy the long domination of the two major political parties the christian democrats and social democrats is on the point of collapse angela merkel giving up her position as leader of the christian democrats was merely a symptom of the underlying political tensions that are a portent of a growing social polarisation the same phenomenon can be observed in many countries in france the electoral victory of emmanuel macron was heralded as a great victory for the political centre like st george and the dragon macron miraculously came down from the clouds to slay the evil dragon of extremism of the left and right but it did not take long for the man who was widely believed to walk on water to sink beneath the stormy waves of the class struggle the absurd illusions of the political commentators who saw in this petty political narcissist a saviour not only for france but for the whole of europe evaporated like a drop of water on a hot stove the collapse of macron s popularity has been far swifter and more catastrophic than that of his unfortunate predecessor françois hollande the polls that gave him over 70 percent support at the time of his election were below 20 percent in december this dramatic turnabout was the direct result of something that was not supposed to happen the direct revolutionary action of the masses in a matter of weeks the workers and youth of france succeeded in demolishing the false image of invulnerability of the french president who was reduced to pleading with them to allow him to rule the man who boasted that he would never surrender to the street was forced to carry out a humiliating u turn in the end though that will not be enough to save him france and germany for decades the destiny of europe was decided by two countries france and germany in the beginning the french ruling class with its exaggerated sense of importance wanted to tie germany to its side providing the economic basis for a united europe while france would provide the political leadership a vain hope in the end it is economic power that decides politics not vice versa nowadays only a fool can fail to understand that it is germany and not france that decides all the fundamental questions in europe macron s ambition that he would dictate to berlin and even to washington was soon exposed as the ridiculous illusion it always was merkel s crisis will not serve to increase the power and authority of the french president who now finds himself in the unenviable position of the emperor who paraded his nakedness under the guise of a suit of new clothes even when hiding behind a gilded desk his political nakedness is clear to all the growing split between france and germany is based neither on religious principles morality philosophy or humanitarianism but on hard cash which under capitalism replaces the heart and soul as the real motor force of society under conditions of capitalist crisis there is no way that this split can be healed it threatens to provoke an existential crisis at the very heart of the european union macron displays a most touching sympathy for the problems of italy and other mediterranean nations who have regrettably fallen into debt in recent years wrapping himself in the flag of european solidarity he pleads with the eu to show humanitarianism and generosity after all did not our lord himself say and forgive us our debts macron the moderate saviour of europe proved to be an emperor in new clothes and not even a golden desk could conceal his political nakedness image révolution it is a well known fact that few pleasures in life can compare with the gentle art of spending other people s money when macron pleads for debt forgiveness he is well aware that those who must forgive are not to be found in paris but in berlin and those who pull the strings of the bundesbank are not overly keen on forgiving debts or anything else as the people of greece will willingly testify in his own country emmanuel macron the rich man s president was hellbent on carrying out a policy of deep cuts together with tax relief for the rich but macron s surrender to the gilets jaunes protesters promising a 10bn 11 4bn package will mean that france s budget deficit is set like italy s to overtake the limits allowed by the eurozone this fact goes some way to explain the different attitudes adopted by the rulers of france and germany all the factors are combining to accentuate the centrifugal tendencies aggravating the contradictions and tensions between nations that the eu was formed to prevent to add fuel to the flames we have the simmering crisis caused by the flood of refugees knocking on europe s doors this in turn has opened up new fault lines between germany and its eastern european satellites poland and hungary are in a direct confrontation with the european union over the question of immigration backed from the sidelines by the right wing government of austria in germany the reactionary anti immigrant alternative for germany afd party is gaining ground particularly in four eastern german states the stage is therefore set for a grand political drama in europe the crisis over brexit is merely the curtain raiser the federalist vision for europe has sunk without trace far from moving towards greater unity the european union is fragmenting before our very eyes new fault lines emerge the political tensions between france and germany are merely a surface expression of deep seated economic divisions between the north and south of europe recently a new block has emerged yet another fault line alongside the many other cracks that threaten the european union with a breakup some have baptised it a new hanseatic league harking back to the powerful group of merchant states around the baltic area that dominated a great part of europe s financial life in the mediaeval period a chasm has opened up between the poorer countries of southern europe and the more prosperous economies of the north denmark sweden finland estonia latvia lithuania the netherlands and ireland are relatively small countries in the broader european context but they have clubbed together to resist the claims of southern european countries on europe s budget to cover huge deficits after years of austerity cuts and terrible suffering greece has been reduced to ruin by the iron embrace of berlin and brussels nothing has been solved and the crisis has now spread to italy where the accumulated deficit amounts to 130 percent of gdp the anti eu coalition in rome approved a budget that violated the limits imposed by brussels provoking an open confrontation for the time being the cracks have been papered over but the crisis of italy remains and has far more serious implications for the eu than greece ever had when all is said and done greece is a relatively small economy on the periphery of europe by contrast italy is the third biggest economy of the eurozone the italian government hoped that by pumping money into the economy they could make it grow again but if the italian treasury had been forced to pay huge fines it would have wiped out whatever impact the extra spending might have had staring down the barrel of a gun luigi di maio the leader of the five star movement m5s and matteo salvini of the northern league saw that discretion was the better part of valour swallowed hard and threw in the towel in the end a shaky agreement was cobbled together the european commission grudgingly agreed to a compromise plan italy undertook to trim its nominal budget deficit from 2 4 percent of gdp to 2 percent the commission reluctantly agreed that the structural deficit which leaves out one off measures and cyclical effects should remain unchanged next year the solution on the table is not ideal european commission vice president valdis dombrovskis grumbled that was an understatement of genius the deal allows the commission to avoid legal action against italy provided that the measures are fully implemented that subordinate clause indicates that the clash with italy has not been resolved only delayed next year s budget did not offer solutions for the country s long term problems why did the european commission agree to an unsatisfactory deal the answer is to be found not in economics but in politics they had just allowed france s president to get away with promising up to 10bn in extra spending to quell the rebellion of the gilets jaunes yellow vests that threatened to push france s budget deficit next year well over the euro zone s limit of 3 percent of gdp they were therefore scarcely in a position to put much pressure on the italians whose projected deficit was actually below 3 percent of gdp but there were clearly other more serious considerations in an interview with corriere della sera a daily the italian prime minister giuseppe conte said he had reminded the commission that his government faced a duty to maintain social stability in italy that was a scarcely veiled threat either you stop putting pressure on us or italy will face a social explosion that will have repercussions beyond our borders the warning was not lost on the men in brussels it may be said that italy is too big to fail but one must add that it is also too big to save there is not enough money in the bundesbank to bail out ailing italian capitalism this drama has not yet been played out to the end a worldwide crisis in the 1920s trotsky predicted that the centre of world history which had already passed from the mediterranean to the atlantic would in future pass from the atlantic to the pacific that remarkable prediction is now a fact europe is falling behind america and china in the race for new artificial intelligence technologies in 2019 india will probably overtake both britain and france at least in absolute terms to become the world s fifth largest economy the future of world history will be finally decided not by europe but the pacific but this process itself is full of contradictions the fate of the world economy depends to a large extent on china which until recently was one of its main motor forces but china depends to a large extent on exports falling demand in europe and the usa has created a crisis of overproduction in steel and other key sectors of the chinese economy china s growth rate has slowed to about 6 5 percent china has now emerged as a world power that is increasingly coming into conflict with the united states image the white house though this may seem like a high figure when compared to the miserable rates of growth in europe and the usa it is alarmingly slow when compared to the past it has been generally accepted that anything less than an 8 percent growth rate for china is dangerously low since that is the rate required to keep up with the growth of its population in order to stimulate exports china has resorted to dumping large amounts of cheap steel on the world market this has led to a serious crisis of steel in europe and howls of protest from the americans in particular it is one of the main factors that led to the present trade war between the usa and china china has now emerged as a world power that is increasingly coming into conflict with the united states the trade war between these two countries is a clear manifestation of this fact nevertheless the usa still retains its dominant position in the world economy and politics the combination of rising interest rates and a soaring dollar has served to attract large amounts of speculative capital to the usa with disastrous effects for the so called emerging markets in latin america asia and the middle east their fragile economies finding themselves at the mercy of the all powerful dollar which is squeezing them aggravating indebtedness and snatching away precious investments in the last period the so called emerging economies acted as a stimulus to world economic growth now they have shuddered to a halt turkey argentina brazil and other formerly resilient economies have collapsed into recession or in the best case scenario stagnation the real face of us imperialism donald trump s slogan make america great again is a kind of imperialist manifesto the subtext of which reads as follows we will make america great again at the expense of the rest of the world behind the swaggering boastful rhetoric lies a clear threat to the rest of the world do as we say or face the consequences president trump has very little time for america s european allies whom he correctly sees as midgets compared to the gigantic power of the usa he is irritated by the pretensions of the europeans their fussing about the world stage and their ridiculous attempts to influence us foreign policy they buzz around his head like so many annoying flies and whereas previous american presidents were content to pretend to pay them some attention his instinct is to swat them hard so they will cease to bother him trump s policy in essence is not very different to that of his predecessors they also did not hesitate to use america s economic and military strength to impose its will on the rest of the world but they did so in a different way some might say with more finesse others would say rather more truthfully with extreme hypocrisy while proclaiming the virtues of democracy justice peace and humanitarianism they did not hesitate to trample underfoot every manifestation that contradicted america s real or perceived interests donald trump does exactly the same but does not bother to proclaim values in which he has absolutely no interest and which in any case play absolutely no role in the foreign policy of american imperialism or any other brand of imperialism trump has cast aside the hypocritical mask of decency to reveal the real ugly face of american imperialism for the edification of the entire world to that extent one might say that he is refreshingly honest america still remains a colossus on the world scale its economic and military power is truly vast but america s power is not unlimited its limits have been demonstrated with brutal clarity in iraq syria and afghanistan and president trump has not been slow to draw the conclusions trump s whole instinct is inclined towards isolationism a very old and honoured tradition of a certain sector of the american ruling class as we have observed he is completely uninterested in the affairs of his european allies in a moment of unaccustomed sincerity he described them as enemies as opposed to the russians who were mere rivals as a matter of fact he does not even have much time for nato and would rather see it disbanded along with the united nations nafta the world trade organisation and all other unhealthy manifestations of extra national organisations but since regrettably he has to listen to the opinions of his numerous annoying advisers he has been compelled grudgingly to accept the existence of this inconvenient military alliance while loudly demanding that his european allies put their hands in their pockets to finance it thus relieving the burden of american taxpayers whose votes are more important to him than the opinions of people in paris berlin and london trump has cast aside the hypocritical mask of decency to reveal the real ugly face of american imperialism for the edification of the entire world image flickr gage skidmore nevertheless he has decided unilaterally to withdraw american troops from the middle east this will show the europeans that he means what he says and perhaps finally force them to put their money where their mouths are a similar motivation is behind his seemingly paradoxical attitude towards vladimir putin during his presidential campaign he lost no opportunity to praise the man in the kremlin calling him a real smart guy and a man with whom one could do business these remarks did not go down well with the us military establishment nor with the hawks of the republican party and they provided his political enemies with a golden opportunity to attack him alleging russian complicity in his presidential campaign the campaign on so called russian interference in the election has rumbled on relentlessly ever since although it has generated more heat than light the idea that the victory of trump was caused by russian interference would not seem credible to a six year old child of average intelligence it is merely a reflection of the inability of the democrats to accept that the american public was utterly alienated from the existing political establishment and motivated by a deep desire for change under pressure from his adversaries trump was forced to blow hot and cold in relation to russia but his decision to withdraw from syria indicates that he has not changed his position since the election once again trump s isolationist instincts have prevailed john kelly the white house chief of staff and jim mattis secretary of defence resigned in protest but protests and resignations have had no effect on trump in the past and there is no reason to believe that this time will be any different but isolationism by no means signifies abstentionism that is rendered impossible by the unstoppable trend to unify all the disparate economies in the world into a single world market globalisation is merely an expression of a phenomenon that was already predicted by marx and engels in the communist manifesto over 150 years ago that prediction has been brilliantly borne out by the history of the world particularly over the last 50 years no country no matter how big and powerful can escape the irresistible pull of the world market all the talk about national sovereignty gaining control of our own frontiers and so on is just so much hot air the storm clouds gather hanging over the whole unstable equation like a menacing storm cloud is the imminent threat of a new world recession this is now accepted by all serious economists the question is not if it will happen only when the global economic instability is reflected in the constant gyrations of the stock markets following falls in october and stagnation in november the s p 500 slumped by 15 percent between 30 november and 24 december despite a brief recovery of 5 percent the day after christmas the index finished the year 6 percent below where it started the first trading day of 2019 showed further instability with falling stocks in asia and turbulence in europe the unexpected news of a slump in apple s sales caused a wave of alarm the company issued a warning of a sharp slowdown in china s economy and weak sales in other emerging markets this meant that revenues in the fourth quarter would undershoot expectations by up to 10 percent following soon after was news that china s manufacturing sector contracted in december which unnerved investors globally s p 500 futures dipped before wall street reopened on 3 january these feverish swings on the stock exchanges of the world are an indication of extreme nervousness and increasing worry about the future perspectives of the world economy while it is true that the movements of the stock markets do not accurately reflect the state of the real economy they nevertheless serve as a useful barometer to measure the current state of mind of investors a recent article in the economist voiced its concern but the rotten performance of stock markets last year which has been maintained at the start of this one can be traced in part to growing worry about the state of the world economy and to its two biggest economies in particular the article continues according to the economist intelligence unit eiu our sister company america will grow by 2 3 this year that is substantially down on an estimated growth rate of 2 9 for last year as the federal reserve tightens monetary policy and as the effects of last year s tax cuts ebb china s forecast growth rate is much higher at 6 3 but that is still down on its estimated 2018 performance and plenty fear worse because of the trade war with america and china s campaign to rein in debt europe presents a gloomier picture still britain which is due to leave the european union in march is forecast to grow by a tepid 1 5 france faces less uncertainty but fares no better italy a perennial economic disappointment is tipped to notch up growth of just 0 4 that makes it the seventh worst performer in the eiu s table of forecasts those below it are all forecast to contract in 2019 none more precipitously than venezuela which has been in freefall for years as one might expect the economist necessarily tries to find some crumbs of comfort pointing out that india was expected to grow at the same rate as last year 7 4 percent but as we know every silver lining has a cloud and it is not for nothing that economics is known as the dismal science with a wry sense of humour the author concludes but the economy that is expected to perform best in 2019 syria with forecast growth of 9 9 is a sobering reminder that a high number can reflect the worst of starting points there is growing alarm in the ranks of the most serious bourgeois economists this alarm is well founded the total return capital gains or losses plus dividends from the s p 500 index of leading american shares was negative for the first time in a decade matters were even worse in other markets the shanghai index fell by a quarter there is a stampede of investors from risky assets including the so called emerging markets into safer havens treasury bonds and gold outstripped stocks anticipating hard times the capitalists are now hoarding cash instead of investing in production everything suggests that when it comes the next recession will be far worse than the crisis of 2008 the main reason for this is that over the last decade the bourgeoisie has used up all the instruments that have been traditionally utilised to prevent recessions or to limit their duration and depth the capitalists have basically two weapons to hand with which to confront recession the first of these is the lowering of interest rates but in their desperate attempts to climb out of the last recession they have reduced interest rates to historically unprecedented levels typically in the region of zero the scope for further rate reductions is therefore negligible even in the usa where the federal reserve has increased rates several times over the last year or so the margin for manoeuvre is still very restricted the second weapon is to increase the amount of money in circulation through intervention by the state and central banks but here there is a problem vast amounts of money were pumped into the economy over the last decade to bail out the private banks all that has been achieved has been to transform what was originally a gigantic black hole in the spreadsheets of the banks into a gigantic black hole in the public finances everywhere they have piled up huge deficits which act as a gigantic drag on the economy the bourgeoisie is struggling to reduce the debts not increase them still further given this fact there is no way that the bourgeois can yet again plunder the state in order to drag itself out of the hole the dilemma of the bourgeois is illustrated by the fact that the european central bank announced the end of monetary stimulus quantitative easing at the very time when there are signs that the european economy is slowing but the european bourgeois obsessed with the problem of brexit and immigration seem oblivious to the danger the ecb is doing the very opposite of what is needed from a capitalist point of view all this raises serious questions about the future of the euro and ultimately the eu itself the situation on the other side of the atlantic is no better the year 2019 has been celebrated by america s political rulers by an unsightly brawl that led to the partial shutdown of the government on 22 december during a televised meeting in december with nancy pelosi and chuck schumer democratic leaders in the house and senate mr trump was heard to say i will shut down the government if i don t get my wall and he was as good as his word it is true that such shutdowns have occurred before but none have lasted as long as this this reflects a deep crisis in the whole political system with a congress controlled by the democrats bitterly hostile to the president predictably an agreement has been stitched up at the last minute but trump is threatening to veto the deal and none of the underlying contradictions have been resolved to add to the general chaos there is a continuing and bitter dispute between the president and the us federal reserve as a result of the latter s insistence in raising interest rates but while the politicians bicker about economic policy the markets are set to deliver their verdict without consulting the men in washington donald trump is a man who seems to have been lucky most of his life a lucky man tends to be a gambler since past bets have been successful why not continue gambling but history shows that for every gambler the day must come when his lucky streak runs out trump had the good fortune to enter the white house at the time when the us economy was doing pretty well he could claim the credit for things that were really none of his doing but those who supported him could not see the difference his luck held he could argue with some degree of correctness that his tax cutting measures helped to boost the economy for a time but in economics as in nature sooner or later everything turns into its opposite the short term effects of president trump s stimulus package which came into force a year ago are wearing off at a time when there are clear signs of economic slowdowns in china and europe trump s imposition of tariffs and the threat of further trade disputes act as a further deterrent to investment profit forecasts have been scaled back the nervousness of the stock markets reflects concerns about the real economy the usa is about to enter the most turbulent period in its entire history and donald s lucky streak is about to come to a bumpy end a crisis of leadership society is increasingly divided between a small group of people who control the system and the overwhelming majority who are getting poorer and are in open rebellion against the system everywhere we look we see growing discontent anger fury and a hatred of the existing order this expresses itself in different ways in different countries but everywhere we see that the masses the workers and youth are beginning to move to challenge the old order and fight against it 2018 saw an upsurge in the mass movement in many different countries iran iraq tunisia spain catalonia pakistan russia togo hungary and of course france the recent events in france provide a crushing answer to all the cynics and sceptics who doubt the ability of the working class to change society like a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky the workers and youth took to the streets and in a couple of weeks brought the government to its knees if that movement had been equipped with a serious leadership it could have brought down the government and prepared the way for a root and branch transformation of french society in the absence of a clear leadership and programme it is possible that the movement will die down for a time but the underlying contradictions remain the government of macron is like a ship that has been holed below the water level it can continue to float for a while but its days are numbered the workers and youth now feel the power of collective class action they will not be bought off by partial and temporary concessions sooner or later they will move into action again this time with a clearer vision of what is needed a militant programme to kick out a hated president and to fight for a government that will act in the interests of the working class this spontaneous movement of the masses is the prior condition for socialist revolution but in and of itself it is not sufficient to guarantee success in 1938 trotsky wrote that one could reduce the crisis of humanity to the crisis of leadership of the proletariat that statement is even more true today than when it was written the history of war gives us many examples where a big army of brave soldiers has been defeated by a far smaller force of disciplined troops led by experienced officers and the war between the classes has many points of similarity with war between nations the recent events in france provide a crushing answer to all the cynics and sceptics who doubt the ability of the working class to change society image twitter cgt the cowardly evasions and half measures of the reformists far from solving the crisis will merely impart to it an even more convulsive painful and destructive character it is the task of revolutionaries to ensure that this long and painful death agony of capitalism is cut short as soon as possible and with the least possible suffering for the working class for this to occur decisive action is necessary only the marxists are capable of providing the leadership that will guarantee such a peaceful and painless outcome from the present crisis it is true that the forces of marxism on a world scale have been thrown back for a long period by objective factors the betrayals of reformism and stalinism allowed capitalism to survive but their actions were made possible by the ability of capitalism to achieve a relative stability and to make certain concessions to the working class but this period is now at an end for decades we have been swimming against the stream just to maintain our forces intact in that period was a considerable feat but now the tide of history has begun to turn instead of swimming against the current we are beginning to swim with it all the old certainties are disappearing the old illusions are gradually being burnt out of the consciousness of the working class the masses are being forced at last to face reality they are slowly beginning to draw conclusions that is our great strength and the great weakness of capitalism and reformism our international lacks the huge financial resources of the reformist parties but in the most important field we are immeasurably stronger than any other tendency in the world we have the ideas of marxism and it is the power of ideas that can change the world we must have complete confidence in our ideas programme and perspectives and confidence in the working class the only class that can change society above all we must have confidence in ourselves for if we do not do this work nobody else will do it for us
u s review conflicting signals on employment and output nonfarm employment jumped by 312 000 in december the largest gain since february data for the prior months were also revised higher gains were broad based and there was also a huge increase in the labor force which explains why the unemployment rate rose 0 2 percentage points to 3 9 the stronger job report is a sharp contrast to december s weaker ism manufacturing survey which tumbled 5 2 points that marks the largest one month drop in more than a decade moreover the forward looking new orders index plunged 11 points signaling the factory sector is likely to slow further in coming months it s not just the financial markets losing steam the sell off in the stock market that began in early october appears to be more of a harbinger of tougher economic times than a simple overdue correction the production side of the economy has slowed considerably pulling down commodity prices and business confidence december s ism manufacturing survey tumbled 5 2 points to 54 1 the largest one month drop in more than a decade the drop in the headline index was driven primarily by an 11 point plunge in the new orders component which tumbled to just 51 1 order backlogs also declined the decline in these two leading components suggests that output and manufacturing employment are both likely to slow further in coming months while manufacturing accounts for just 12 of the economy it still accounts for the bulk of the quarterly swings in real gdp and its performance is closely watched by policymakers the latest slide is particularly disconcerting in that it is not linked to any single industry or region as we saw in the middle of the decade but is rather sharp and broad based like we have typically seen prior to the onset of a recession the top chart shows a comparison of the ism manufacturing survey and the average of the regional manufacturing surveys from the new york philadelphia richmond and dallas federal reserve banks the apparent slide in the factory sector was not evident in the employment data nonfarm employment surged by 312 000 in december and data for the prior two months were revised up by 58 000 jobs strength was broad based which lends credence to the headline number moreover manufacturing payrolls added 32 000 jobs in december and gains were broad based we suspect the december data contained some catch up elements this past fall s hurricanes hit during the september and october survey weeks and the california wildfires and unusually wet weather along much of the east coast depressed job growth the following month after not changing in november construction employment rose by 32 000 in december with most of the increase coming in heavy and civil engineering construction likely reflecting highway work all of that gain however was due to a smaller than usual non seasonally adjusted drop in jobs but even after taking this into account the stronger jobs figures and the 0 4 rise in average hourly earnings should alleviate any concerns about a more troublesome slowdown consumer spending also appears to be holding up well early reports on the holiday shopping season suggest consumers splurged a bit motor vehicle sales also came in strong with the ward s measure showing sales at a 17 5 million vehicle pace in december lower gas prices helped boost spending in both areas reconciling the weak ism report and strong employment report puts policymakers in a bit of a quandary the ism report is more of a leading indicator while the jobs figures tend to be more backward looking the fed puts a great deal of stock into the ism data and a further weakening below 50 in the next few months would provide ample support for folks inside and outside the fed that are calling for a pause in the fed s rate hikes u s outlook ism non manufacturing monday economic activity has been exceptionally strong according to the ism non manufacturing index which has come in above 60 for three consecutive months we expect to see the index end the year on a softer note however lower oil prices are likely to hit respondents in the mining industry while comments from recent reports indicated some concerns over tariffs in contrast to the ism non manufacturing index regional pmis for the service sector as well as the markit services index have rolled over the past few months a sharp miss to the downside would generate more cause for concern about a slowdown in the economy given that the non manufacturing index represents nearly 90 of u s output another elevated print however would suggests that the economy s momentum remained solid heading into the new year previous 60 7 wells fargo 58 4 consensus 59 5 nfib small business optimism tuesday like the ism indices the nfib s small business optimism index was fairly buoyant in 2018 the index has lost some ground the past couple months however as expectations for the economy and sales have moderated with the stock market having tumbled over december a further pullback in sentiment is expected while expectations for sales and profits have come down a bit the nfib survey continues to suggest a tight labor market the most commonly cited challenge of small firms has been finding qualified labor while the share of firms reporting they have at least one job hard to fill is already reported to have risen in december to a recordhigh of 39 at the same time the share of firms raising compensation hovers near all time highs signaling to the fomc further upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation previous 104 8 consensus 103 5 consumer price index friday falling gasoline prices in november left the consumer price index unchanged with gasoline prices declining further last month we expect the cpi slipped 0 1 in december we also anticipate a softer reading for core inflation 0 1 to account for some payback after a rare back to back increase in core goods prices and an above trend gain in shelter costs that said the overall trend in core inflation is expected to remain firm given that the fomc focuses on core inflation in its near term policy deliberations a downside miss on the headline is unlikely to ring alarm bells if driven by drops in energy and or food an increase in core cpi of 0 1 0 2 would be consistent with the recent trend a noticeably weaker print for the core index would suggest that inflation is not a pressing threat while an upside surprise would support the fomc s recent plans to raise rates previous 0 0 wells fargo 0 1 consensus 0 1 month over

requirement ratio for banks effectively increasing liquidity in the banking system other economic data from international economies were somewhat mixed including a subdued canadian jobs report soft eurozone inflation figures and a rebound in u k pmis politics remain in focus as well as the italy e u budget spat was largely resolved but uncertainty remains over the next steps for the brexit process and the ongoing u s china trade war fears of global economic slowdown linger economic news on the global front was somewhat mixed in the first week of the new year with concerns lingering over prospects for global economic growth china garnered attention as the official and caixin manufacturing pmis fell into contraction territory i e below 50 reigniting concerns around a sharper slowdown in the world s largest developing economy later in the week china announced that it would reduce the reserve requirement ratio rrr for major banks 100 basis points to 13 50 effectively increasing the amount of liquidity in the banking system that announcement is likely at least partly a response to weak economic data and comes after 250 basis points worth of rrr cuts in 2018 on a more positive note the official and caixin services pmis climbed higher in december and remain well above the 50 line demarcating expansion and contraction meanwhile there appears to be a great deal of anticipation around upcoming u s china trade talks scheduled to take place on january 7 8 as a reminder if the two sides do not reach a formal trade deal by march 1 president trump has threatened to raise the current 10 tariff on 200 billion worth of chinese goods to 25 economic data from the united kingdom were a bit less downbeat as the december manufacturing and services pmis recovered to 54 2 and 51 2 respectively still it is hard to get particularly optimistic regarding u k economic prospects as a resolution to the current brexit uncertainty remains elusive little progress was made in lessening that brexit uncertainty in recent weeks as parliaments in the united kingdom and european union were on holiday recess while u k prime minister theresa may is still targeting a vote on the current brexit withdrawal deal for the week of january 14 elsewhere canada s december jobs report was generally soft in tone 9 300 jobs were added over the month but mostly in part time industries while the unemployment rate stayed at 5 6 and wage growth remained low at 1 5 year overyear the bank of canada already shifted toward a more dovish stance at its meeting in mid december and is likely to remain on hold at its upcoming policy announcement next week on a more positive note italian parliament approved a final budget proposal for 2019 settling on a deficit target of 2 04 of gdp for this year after a series of revisions recommended by the european commission the key question now for the italian government will be how to allocate the limited stimulus to its various campaign promises and moreover whether the government will actually be able to achieve its narrower deficit target european data were limited this week a slowing in december eurozone cpi inflation to 1 6 year over year garnered some attention but largely confirmed the narrative that ecb rate hikes are a long way off finally brazilian president jair bolsonaro took office on january 1 and is expected to detail his reform agenda in the coming days and weeks arguably at the top of the list at least from an economic perspective is reforming brazil s pension system a key issue that has hindered consolidation in brazil s budget deficit and which is likely to pose an increasingly significant threat to the country s finances unless addressed global outlook eurozone retail sales monday 2018 was a challenging year for the eurozone economy marked by slowing growth and worsening sentiment the retail sector was no exception as total sales growth slowed to roughly 1 5 year over year toward the end of 2018 from a run rate of above 2 for most of 2017 while a change in auto emissions rules led to some volatility in the overall series sales excluding motor vehicles have also softened in recent months the weakening in consumer confidence over the course of last year does not bode particularly well for retail sales in 2019 while the services sector pmi has also fallen markedly over the past year however firming wage growth in the eurozone gives us confidence that retail sales should hold up reasonably well this year while steady employment growth should also bode well for overall consumer spending in the region previous 0 3 consensus 0 2 month over month bank of canada wednesday the bank of canada boc is likely to hold its overnight rate steady at 1 75 when it announces monetary policy next week at its latest meeting in early december the central bank sounded more cautious with regards to the domestic economic outlook in part due to the ongoing weakness in oil prices moreover it said there was more room for non inflationary growth a sign it likely felt less urgency to normalize interest rates amid that more dovish signaling market pricing for future boc rate hikes has fallen substantially in recent weeks despite more dovish boc language we still think the central bank will hike rates further in 2019 headline inflation has eased but core inflation has held relatively steady near the boc s 2 target while canadian economic growth generally remains above potential next week s policy decision could provide clues for when that next hike could be delivered previous 1 75 wells fargo 1 75 consensus 1 75 mexico cpi wednesday the bank of mexico raised its overnight rate 25 bps to 8 25 in late december its fourth 25 bps rate hike of 2018 those rate hikes coincided with another volatile year for the mexican peso which swung from gains to losses as markets considered mexico s economic and fiscal prospects under the leadership of new president andres manuel lopez obrador amlo amid all the volatility in the peso mexican cpi inflation was reasonably steady for most of last year particularly when looking at the core figure accordingly rate hikes from mexico s central bank appeared to be more defensive in nature aimed at keeping inflation expectations anchored and limiting the pass through from a weaker peso to higher inflation subsequent cpi readings will be key to watch for clues on whether the central bank will continue to raise interest rates while any further signs of disruptive economic policies under amlo s leadership could also prompt a hawkish response from central bank policymakers previous 4 7 consensus 4 8 year over year point of view interest rate watch is the fed done hiking rates in early october the u s economy was cruising along with strong growth momentum and with stock market indices sitting at or near all time highs prices of fed funds futures contracts at that time indicated that investors expected the federal open market committee fomc would raise rates 75 bps by the end of 2019 top chart three months later the economy has decelerated somewhat and financial markets have encountered a bout of volatility investors now expect that the fomc will refrain from raising rates further and that it will cut rates by 25 bps in 2020 has the high water mark for the fed funds rate for this cycle been reached already the sequential rate of real gdp growth has slowed from 4 2 in q2 2018 to 3 4 in q3 to our estimate of 2 2 in q4 and the recent widening in credit spreads and the swoon in the stock market represent a tightening in financial conditions that we discussed in more detail in a recent report although financial conditions as measured by the chicago fed s national financial conditions index have tightened in recent weeks they do not appear to be overly restrictive at present at least not in a historic context middle chart at its last policy meeting on december 19 the fomc voted unanimously to raise rates 25 bps moreover the fomc s dot plot indicates that most fomc members thought that 50 bps of further rate hikes would be appropriate in 2019 but the events of the past few weeks cast some doubt on those expectations dallas fed president kaplan said this week that he believes the fomc should pause until some of the uncertainties are resolved our most recent forecast which was compiled in early december looks for two 25 bps rate hikes in 2019 first in march and again in september bottom chart but we readily acknowledge that the risks are skewed to a longer pause in the first half of the year than we thought just a month ago we will be watching incoming data and making changes to our fed call as appropriate credit market insights tighter credit conditions ahead the end of 2018 saw a ramp up in financial market volatility with the s p 500 index falling over 10 in q4 as discussed in our interest rate watch section we have examined the recent tightening in financial conditions and possible implications for monetary policy with these trends in mind what does the recent tightening in financial conditions mean for broader credit availability for starters until recently financial conditions have actually eased even as the fomc has normalized monetary policy this relationship is indicative of the performance of the broader economy gdp growth remained solid in q3 while consumers continue to enjoy rising wages and inflation that is largely anchored at the same time loan growth remains positive with consumer loans rising nearly 4 6 year over year in november the most recent data from the senior loan officer opinion survey echo the hard data and point to banks willingness to make consumer loans continuing to rise in q3 the survey also noted that banks reported little change in their credit standards and most terms across categories of consumer loans on balance on net although financial conditions have tightened as the cost of credit has steadily increased while the fed has raised rates overall credit availability still looks relatively robust for most consumers while interest rates are also still low by historical norms topic of the week d c deadline drama in 2019 probably congress and the president were unable to reach an agreement on all 2019 appropriation bills at the end of december leading to a partial government shutdown that began on december 22 and has persisted into the new year while government shutdown drama has mostly been avoided in recent years the return of divided government means these topics could come back into focus in 2019 in a special report published this week we analyze the economic impact of the shutdown and key issues to watch in washington over the coming year given that 75 of discretionary spending has already been appropriated and passed into law top chart we see the current shutdown having only a minimal negative impact on quarterly gdp growth of 0 1 0 2 percentage points at most assuming the current impasse is resolved in the near future but the shutdown is unlikely to be the only budget issue this year the two year budget deal passed in february 2018 that set top line spending levels for fy 2018 and fy 2019 will no longer be in effect when fy 2020 begins on october 1 bottom chart this means that congress will need to determine both the total amount of funds available for 2020 appropriations as well as complete the actual appropriations process adding to already complex budget process the debt ceiling will also be reinstated on march 2 meaning that the u s treasury will be unable to issue additional debt to meet government spending needs beyond what is met by tax revenue it would then need to use extraordinary measures to meet the daily cash flow needs of the federal government until congress can agree on a new debt limit based on our analysis we expect the x date or the date by which the debt ceiling must be raised before the treasury is unable to meet all of its obligations to occur in mid to late summer creating the potential for another budget showdown later this year in sum with concerns swirling about global growth monetary policy mistakes and other recession risks a fiscal fumble from policymakers in washington is another risk to the economic outlook as 2019 progresses

the issue there has been strong bipartisan support for the united states to be a worldwide leader in addressing global food and nutrition security congressional champions are still needed particularly under the trump administration policymakers should elevate the issue within diplomatic and national security discussions invest more in nutrition better link humanitarian and agricultural development strategies renew commitments to agricultural science and scale up agricultural technologies over 90 newly elected members of congress will arrive in washington this month bringing with them new perspectives and fresh thinking on an array of issues important to their constituents they will be soon inundated with information and facing a rising tide of requests for immediate policy attention and legislative action this policy brief suggests that there are few issues more urgent and more important both at home and abroad than food security and improved nutrition why food security and improved nutrition matter more than 800 million people today go to bed hungry and billions more have diets deficient in essential vitamins and minerals or are overweight or obese 1 malnutrition in all its forms is now the major contributor to the global burden of disease and rises in hunger and food insecurity over the last few years indicate the presence of rising social and economic tensions and conflicts that threaten global stability the legislative framework for u s initiatives to address food and nutrition security is in place a farm bill guiding national action on these issues over the next four years passed during the lame duck session last month 2 the global food security act was recently reauthorized until 2023 as the framework for u s support for food security in key countries around the world 3 the challenge for the 116th congress will be to ensure effective implementation of these key pieces of legislation through bipartisan policy oversight and timely funding decisions congressional support matters it impacts the daily well being of billions of people while sustained u s investments in international development ultimately advance our country s economic development and national security interests it is not nor should it be about indiscriminately putting u s interests first some pockets of the world depend on the united states as a leader and partner to address complex global development challenges our track record speaks for itself from 2010 to 2017 u s targeted strategies and investments in inclusive agricultural growth and nutrition programming decreased poverty by 23 percent and stunting by 32 percent in areas where feed the future operated 4 numerous leaders and factors should be credited for feed the future s success from interagency coordination under the u s global food security strategy to the unflagging work of u s based and international partners who implement programs on the ground progress hasn t come easily or quickly robust results monitoring has proven that agricultural development tools can work particularly when combined with effective enabling environments and country led approaches there are few issues more urgent and more important both at home and abroad than food security and improved nutrition but now is not the time to just sit back and applaud our inspiring progress collaborative leadership or legislative victories despite targeted achievements for three years in a row global hunger has risen 5 progress to reach the un sustainable development goals are not currently on track to reverse the climbing trend of undernourishment much less to eradicate hunger by 2020 6 despite admirable global efforts like scaling up nutrition and the new alliance for food security and nutrition why does it feel like we are being pushed slowly backward down a mountain of progress protracted conflicts climate change and mass migration which are inexorably linked are primary drivers and these trends are getting worse not better why does the united states need to lead the united states has a long proud history as a leader in food security from a research humanitarian and development perspective a u s scientist later coined the father of the green revolution saved one billion lives from starvation in the 1960s through agricultural research and technology development u s tax dollars provided a record setting 8 billion in humanitarian assistance in fiscal year 2017 making the united states by far the largest single donor responding to natural and man made crises 7 and feed the future estimates that it has lifted 23 4 million people out of poverty since 2010 8 9 when the united states leads other nations follow president george w bush recognized the scourge of growing levels of hiv aids infection and with congressional support launched pepfar in 2003 as a pathbreaking bilateral commitment to hiv aids prevention and treatment president obama s decision at the 2009 g8 summit in l aquila to commit 3 5 billion in u s support for agricultural development mobilized resources more thansix times the u s commitment 10 there hasn t been the same level of political action on agriculture or nutrition for nearly a decade despite strong evidence that investments in agriculture and nutrition have a high return on investment and is an effective tool for poverty reduction 11 12 sustainable food systems made the cut as a top agenda item for the g20 meeting held in argentina in early december but the united states has clearly stepped back from a global leadership role the world needs a l aquila level moment in 2019 even though improving global food security aligns with the economic and national security interests of the trump administration there is no sign that the white house plans to emulate the kind of development leadership of the bush and obama administrations at last year s g20 summit president trump did announce 639 million in humanitarian aid to help four countries facing potential famines in addition the build act a trailblazing piece of development finance legislation was strongly supported by president trump s national security council 13 on the other hand overall funding for diplomatic and development objectives have been subject to draconian cuts in the budgets submitted by the president in 2017 and 2018 bipartisan congressional leadership has been effective in protecting the foreign assistance accounts to date but the signals for continued u s leadership on key issues economic growth and poverty reduction food security and improved nutrition and health are not positive congressional oversight and guidance are more important than ever to maintain the development leadership that the united states is known for foreign assistance is part of our moral fabric the instrumental benefits including economic returns and global stability are understood and appreciated by both political parties president trump s signature reauthorizing the global food security act for the 2018 2023 period confirms the importance of these issues and the u s role in addressing them why is the global food security act politically significant the groundbreaking global food security act of 2016 not only demonstrated sincere bipartisan u s leadership with both sides of the aisle co sponsoring and advocating for the legislation but also transformed a presidential initiative into a national strategy 14 15 signed months before the 2016 presidential election the timing of the authorization was more crucial than most could have predicted at the time it placed enduring congressional commitment behind a global food security strategy that was otherwise tied to the parting obama administration the global food security act is a reminder that enacting policy change takes serious attention over an extended period even when both republicans and democrats support the cause the act was more than a decade in the making propelled by a community of policymakers advocacy organizations and thought leaders pushing for the united states to step up among these stakeholders was a 2008 center for strategic and international studies csis task force co chaired by champions like senator bob casey d pa and now former senator richard lugar r in the task force crafted a bold bipartisan vision arguing among other policy points for the united states to create a strategic approach to global food security that connects relief development energy and trade 16 congressional oversight and guidance are more important than ever to maintain the development leadership that the united states is known for what is the current u s strategy that u s global food security strategy was submitted to congress in september 2016 as mandated by the global food security act it provides a comprehensive framework to achieve its vision of a world free from hunger malnutrition and extreme poverty replete with thriving economies nutritious diets and resilient households 17 the strategy aptly details emerging global trends from instability and conflict to urbanization and gender inequalities it meticulously outlines how to develop an efficient and inclusive agricultural growth program at the global level covering everything from building market systems and trade linkages to integrating water and sanitation investments from a technical perspective very little is missing and that may be precisely the problem the strategy is so comprehensive and broad that it lacks strategic focus from the results framework to the monitoring evaluation and learning approach the plan on paper is solid translating these strategies into activities on the ground however is much more complex at the country level how do you prioritize target commodities and communities when funding is stagnant but expectations have risen how do you effectively partner with a national government that may have a well written country strategy but remarkably low tax revenues limited capacity or inadequate political will to invest in its own people how do you integrate market led development programs with traditional humanitarian aid in areas plagued by political instability and violence what is the best way for diverse u s agencies to collaborate and combine efforts at the country level when they have numerous competing priorities and potentially conflicting missions lessons learned from csis research between 2015 and 2017 the csis global food security project traveled to three unique feed the future focus countries that represented the largest u s investments in their respective regions at the time tanzania bangladesh and guatemala during these research trips the csis team met with food and agriculture experts donors implementing partners smallholder farmers and representatives from the public and private sectors to explore the effectiveness of the feed the future strategy each country case study furnished distinct insights that csis translated into the tracking promises series which includes analytical reports short videos private roundtables public panel events and congressional briefings in addition the csis global food security project led bipartisan bicameral congressional staff delegations to senegal in 2016 and ghana in 2018 18 19 the goal was to better understand how feed the future principles are applied how the initiative s programs relate to other u s development investments and how partners and beneficiaries perceive the impacts of those programs the intention of both the csis tracking promises series and the congressional delegations was neither to provide a technical assessment of individual programs nor a comprehensive evaluation of feed the future still salient trends that policymakers should know about the initiative emerged from these research efforts and can inform sustained u s leadership moving forward while there were many key observations made over the course of our research the following four are worth highlighting development goals are futile without country commitment both the 19 feed the future focus countries as well as the current 12 selected last year under feed the future 2 0 met specific criteria considered preconditions for success by the interagency team one of these is the political will of partnering governments to take ownership of the initiative this critical criterion is hard to measure and certainly doesn t play out equally in all countries for instance bangladesh is often hailed as a model of government leadership rightfully so as it has allocated substantial resources 5 6 billion or 64 percent of the total budget to its country investment plan and crafted robust national policies to tackle hunger poverty and malnutrition 20 the un s food and agriculture organization fao found bangladesh s strategic plans so successful that it replicated them in nearly 50 other countries in comparison a lack of government ownership can make it difficult for donors or implementing partners to implement new ideas or projects sustainably in guatemala minimal domestic resource mobilization and an inadequate provision of agriculture health and nutrition services underscore the government s inability to hold up its end of the bargain 21 focus countries will often face capacity constraints at the national and local levels of government however experiences confirm that the commitment of government leadership to feed the future objectives is essential to success our experience raised an important question if a focus country government fails to fulfill its responsibility in this regard should the u s consider suspending or reducing its engagement in that country both the 19 feed the future focus countries as well as the current 12

deserve despite the dual feed the future objectives of inclusive agricultural growth and improved nutrition the allocation of funding to projects meant to achieve these shared goals does not often reflect equal prioritization compared to agricultural interventions investments that specifically target nutrition have been meager and potentially insufficient to achieve ambitious stunting reduction

little nutritional value access to finance can build resilience and change the lives of smallholders smallholder farmer livelihoods are increasingly exposed to external shocks including market volatility climate change and natural disasters building resiliency requires providing risk management tools such as promoting off farm livelihood diversification and strengthening national disaster preparedness and response mechanisms often overlooked in this equation is facilitating access to financial services microfinance institutions in feed the future target countries routinely see agriculture as risky and fail to offer financial products suitable for low income customers farmers or owners of small and medium sized enterprises when services do exist potential customers often lack access to the information they need to take advantage of them in ghana only 5 percent of commercial lending goes to agriculture and interest rates have risen as high as 42 percent in recent years 26 feed the future funded programs in ghana are addressing this at the local level through village savings and loans associations and at the national level by working directly with financial institutions access to affordable financial services paired with adequate financial education can support productive investments drive rural economic growth and mitigate the risk of shocks plausible approaches to achieve this objective could include private or public sector insurance products weather indexed lines of credit or producer collectivization and risk pooling where do we turn next there are five new roads that u s policymakers should take to maximize our investments and sustain the drive to transform global food and nutrition security raise the profile of global food security within u s diplomatic and national security strategies linkages between global food security political stability and economic prosperity have been well established from the urban food price riots in 2007 to the connections today between protracted conflicts and potential famines 27 the intelligence community has recognized the threat that global food insecurity places on u s national security interests u s military and political leaders have been vocal about the role that foreign assistance plays in the cost effective prevention of further chaos especially as it relates to the nexus between food insecurity and instability yet food and nutrition security are far from a central pillar in u s national security diplomatic or military engagements the current u s national security strategy should be lightly applauded for its emphasis on leadership in humanitarian assistance it gives support for food security and health programs that save lives and address the root cause of hunger and disease but is weak in terms of its understanding and prioritization for long term international development programs 28 investments in food and nutrition security protect u s national security and create new markets for u s goods in emerging economics two core priorities of the trump administration yet the white house has failed to strengthen global food security efforts within the state department make significant commitments at global summits or prioritize discussions within the national security council hunger and malnutrition contribute to key threats such as civil unrest and violence global food security deserves greater prominence within foreign policy debates and demands better coordination between development diplomacy and defense sectors whole of government initiatives like feed the future have proven both the effectiveness and challenges of integrating and leveraging resources across the u s government from trade policies to peace corps volunteers but it is past time to elevate efforts across diplomatic and defense departments and agencies global food security deserves greater prominence within foreign policy debates and demands better coordination between development diplomacy and defense sectors double down on nutrition we need to nourish not just feed a growing population malnutrition is a universal costly problem as the winners of this year s world food prize reminded us every country in the world is dealing with at least one form of malnutrition eighty eight percent of countries suffer from more than one form childhood stunting anemia and or overweight or obesity 29 the burden of malnutrition robs the global economy of 3 5 trillion yearly in lost productivity and health care costs one in three people globally is overweight or obese and the rate is rising faster than undernutrition is decreasing nutrition interventions can be the catalyst for tackling all the un sustainable development goals from environmental sustainability to equity and inclusion with a 16 return on every 1 invested nutrition has also proven to be one of the most cost effective development interventions despite this high return on investment and powerful multiplier effect nutrition investments by global donors are nothing short of abysmal at less than 1 percent it is no wonder that the world is not on track to meet internationally agreed upon nutrition targets 30 agricultural growth programs that focus solely on traditional staple crops which by and large provide limited nutritional value need to be rebalanced with investments in biofortification horticultural productivity and behavior change and nutrition education there is a dramatic discrepancy between theamount of fruits and vegetables the world needs and the amount produced 31 it is not enough for agriculture and food supply chain policies to be nutrition sensitive they must be nutrition driven 32 nutrition investments and indicators should continue to be woven into u s funded development programming and remain a top priority within the global food and nutrition strategy policymakers should support and expand global efforts like the scaling up nutrition movement and nutrition for growth and elevate nutrition commitments through sustained diplomatic engagement at global gatherings such as the g7 and g20 meetings in 2019 better link humanitarian responses with development strategies the surge in global hunger levels over the past three years has been driven by political instability in conflict afflicted regions and compounded by the impacts of climate change more than half of the hungriest people in the world nearly 500 out of 820 million live in countries marred by man made conflict 33 most of the countries facing pre famine conditions in 2018 like yemen south sudan or somalia don t have the economic or political stability required to meet the thoughtful criteria to become a feed the future target country linkages between political instability and food insecurity are often touted as one of the primary reasons for sustained u s investments in agricultural development yet long term food security programming can only function in stable environments if the united states wants to address the root causes of hunger and poverty its strategy must include investing in and linking up its strategies on governance and peace and reconciliation as well as recoupling humanitarian assistance with long term agricultural and nutrition programs usaid has robust and effective humanitarian programs from food for peace to those within the office of u s foreign disaster assistance that targets the world s most vulnerable populations but the nexus between emergency life saving assistance and inclusive market growth opportunities needs to be further analyzed and better operationalized the recent addition of nigeria and niger in feed the future s refreshed strategy presents a unique opportunity for usaid to align traditional food security programming with u s security interests though it is too early in the strategy implementation to assert success or failure the good news is that feed the future 2 0 s new strategic objective strengthening the resilience of communities to shocks that can lead to famine and political unrest not only lifts up resilience programming but also pushes for more strategic collaboration between humanitarian and development aid 34 furthermore the transformation of usaid includes adding resilience to the name of the bureau leading the global food security strategy and the agency has a strong center focused on resilience renew u s leadership in agricultural science while the u s government has been cutting funding for agricultural research and development r d for nearly a decade rapidly growing economies like china india and brazil have been doing the opposite china ramped up spending almost eightfold between 1990 and 2013 overtaking the united states as the biggest investor in public agricultural r d in 2008 35 the dwindling u s commitment to agricultural science has both domestic and international consequences the competitive agricultural productivity enjoyed by u s farmers is directly tied to a flood of breakthrough technologies and innovations resulting from r d investments current levels of public research are needed just to sustain current productivity levels let alone boost yields partnerships between u s scientists and international researchers can address pest and diseases not bound by national borders e g wheat stem rust and fall armyworm simultaneously safeguarding domestic agriculture against future threats and bolstering resilience and productivity around the world this is especially important in today s global agricultural challenges climate change unfamiliar pests and diseases and rising production costs to name a few good news is that feed the future innovation labs harness u s expertise by supporting collaboration between 70 top u s colleges and universities and focus country research institutions 36 investing in research partnerships like these not only advances cutting edge technology to address some of the most pressing issues facing agriculture like water scarcity or pest and disease control but also builds local capacity fosters good will and supports the next generation of agricultural scientists and researchers in partner countries one such example is u s engagement in ghana in which the university of illinois is working with partners to boost consumption of soy products to improve protein uptake among consumers and the university of california davis is helping the university of ghana to develop chicken breeds that are resistant to a highly infectious virus called newcastle disease 37 embrace and scale new technologies climate change will continue to test the capabilities of the global food system from irregular rainfall that affects smallholder productivity and migration movements to warming temperatures that create the perfect breeding ground for emerging pests supporting researchers and entrepreneurs to advance innovative technologies that allow farmers to do more with less natural resources is a requirement to adapt to the new environmental norms scaling innovations is only possible if governments foster an enabling environment that attracts private sector investment and if smallholders are provided access to affordable and practical technologies 38 community level agro dealers need to be equipped with training and finance tools to ensure that quality agricultural products like drip irrigation kits or deep placement fertilizers get into the hands of the farmers that most need them gene editing techniques like crispr which could be used to modify staple crop plants like cassava and sweet potato to increase resistance to common diseases have the potential to transform agricultural production radically with the right investors and market environment digital technologies like the hello tractor app in nigeria which empowers farmers through mechanization could grow exponentially if embraced by emerging markets innovations like cold chain storage or safe chemical sprays could revolutionize supply chains and reduce postharvest loss usaid administrator mark green s bold vision to end the need for aid begins with spurring innovation outside of the traditional development model creative initiatives like the usaid grand challenge on powering agriculture that supports clean energy ideas or programs like feed the future partnering for innovation

latin america is reaching the end of its fifth consecutive year of anemic economic growth from 2014 to 2018 annual gdp growth has averaged just 0 5 per cent slower than during the first five years of the latin american debt crisis 1981 85 and the five that followed the 1997 asian financial crisis 1998 2002 it is safe to say that latin america has suffered a lost half decade while a few small economies have achieved annual growth rates exceeding 4 per cent notably panama and the dominican republic and to a lesser extent bolivia and paraguay latin america s larger economies have struggled venezuela in particular has experienced not only the sharpest collapse of any latin american economy in history but also the most severe hyperinflation five other latin american economies have endured hyperinflation in the past then there is argentina which this year faced a currency crisis a run on the peso and double digit inflation and had to secure an international monetary fund bailout totaling more than 57 billion the largest the imf has ever disbursed to help it shore up its finances in the last five years brazil also underwent its deepest ever recession from which it is emerging very slowly mexico for its part has maintained a mediocre growth record for decades even the relatively strong performers of the past such as chile and colombia have struggled with slow economic growth over the last five years peru which stood out among the world s large and medium size economies for its robust performance in the early twenty first century has not been able to recapture strong growth the good news is that latin america s economic prospects seem to be improving though the recovery will be slow the un economic commission for latin america and the caribbean has recently projected an average growth rate of 1 7 per cent for 2019 half a percentage point less that what the imf had projected just two months ago although brazil s recovery is expected to continue growth will be constrained by the need to address fiscal imbalances whereas mexican growth will remain slow in both countries major political changes accompanying the election of new presidents are generating uncertainty the large and medium size economies that will fare the best are peru colombia and chile possibly in that order though their growth rates will remain much lower than during the commodity boom of 2004 2013 the worst performers will be argentina where the recession will continue and venezuela which shows no signs of escaping its plight anytime soon the weakness of latin america s recovery is partly a result of an unsupportive international environment growth is slowing in the major developed countries as well as in china protectionism is on the rise with the united states and china engaged in an escalating trade war the consequences of which will be transmitted to latin american primarily by means of trade diversion moreover commodity prices which began recovering in 2016 from their collapse in previous years have been falling again in recent months oil prices which increased the most sharply peaked in october and have plummeted since finally portfolio capital flows have slowed while their costs have increased owing to rising us interest rates a trend that is likely to continue and increasing risk spreads fortunately as i have previously argued there are no signs of a sudden stop in external financing which led to catastrophe during the debt crisis of the 1980s and after the 1997 asian financial crisis the solution to latin american countries economic travails lies in deep reforms though not necessarily market reforms which have a relatively poor record in generating rapid growth in recent decades in 1950 1980 when latin america experienced rapid industrialization its average growth rate was 5 5 per cent per year yet since 1990 after the debt crisis of the 1980s the region has managed just 2 8 per cent annual growth the rapid and premature deindustrialization that latin america has experienced since the 1980s is a key reason for this indeed the most significant long term slowdown has occurred in brazil and mexico the region s two largest economies and the main success stories of industrialization given this latin america should pursue reforms that support industrial manufacturing even as it continues to exploit its strong comparative advantage in natural resources an advantage that has facilitated increasingly close ties with china such reforms should include increased infrastructure investment which according to the development bank of latin america currently amounts to about half of what the region needs at a time of rapid technological change latin america also needs to invest much more in research and development unesco reports that the region currently spends only about 0 7 per cent of gdp on r d compared to 2 1 per cent in east asia and 2 4 per cent in high income oecd countries finally latin america must consolidate its regional integration processes to be sure there have been some successes especially the pacific alliance with chile colombia mexico and peru as full members central american integration has also made steady progress but the two biggest south american integration projects mercosur and the andean community have lately failed to bridge the political divisions among their members with the right approach latin america could improve its economic prospects considerably potentially avoiding another lost half decade the question is whether it will muster the political will to take the necessary steps project syndicate

have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs

going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the

far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan oil prices trump do you

gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they

tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries

was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million

does not put the president in the clear article content the mueller matter capped a week that saw trump go on an unusual tangent a sustained and bitter dressing down of the late republican senator john mccain he accused mccain of failing his fellow veterans staining public policy and trying to make trouble for him in the russia probe he widely mischaracterized mccain s record in the process a look at his claims and the facts russia investigation trump no collusion no obstruction complete and total exoneration tweet sunday trump there was no obstruction and none what so ever and it was a complete and total exoneration remarks to reporters sunday sarah sanders white house press secretary the special counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction ag barr and dag rosenstein further determined there was no obstruction the findings of the department of justice are a total and complete exoneration of the president tweet sunday the facts it was not a total vindication mueller s exact words in the report as quoted by the attorney general say otherwise while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the summary by barr notes mueller did not draw a conclusion one way or the other as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction setting out evidence for both sides and leaving the question unanswered barr wrote in the summary that ultimately he decided as attorney general that the evidence developed by muller was not sufficient to establish that trump committed obstruction of justice barr s summary also notes that mueller did not find that the trump campaign conspired or co ordinated with russia to prove a crime mueller must generally meet a standard of proving an offence beyond a reasonable doubt the summary did not clear the president of improper behaviour regarding russia but did not establish that he was involved in an underlying crime related to russian election interference mueller said in a passage from the report quoted by barr

administration the men are not known to be social friends there is certainly no evidence as trump has repeatedly suggested that they are best friends trump on the mueller report it s sort of interesting that a man out of the blue just writes a report remarks wednesday the facts mueller didn t wake up one day out of the blue and decide he wanted to write a report it s mandated under the regulation that spells out the grounds for his appointment and duties as special counsel trump on the formation of the special counsel investigation again i say a deputy because of the fact that the attorney general didn t have the courage to do it himself a deputy that s appointed appoints another man to write a report remarks wednesday to reporters at the white house the facts the attorney

campaign conspired or co ordinated with russia to prove a crime mueller must generally meet a standard of proving an offence beyond a reasonable doubt the summary did not clear the president of improper behaviour regarding russia but did not establish that he was involved in an underlying crime related to russian election interference mueller said in a passage from the report quoted by barr

greta thunberg at cop24 in poland greenpeace the world s youth have finally seen and heard enough from the deplorable political process from compromised delegates corrupted political appointees and criminal corporations who sabotage these critical international discussions the truth of our ecological crisis is not difficult to see fragile ecosystems are unraveling all around us we have been warned by scientists for two centuries by the 1972 limits to growth study william catton s 1980 book overshoot by reliable scientists and by millions of ecology activists we were warned by the 2009 naturearticle planetary boundaries showing that humanity has breached seven critical tipping points and by the 2012 nature article approaching a state shift in earth s biosphere by 22 international scientists warning of an irreversible planetary scale transition unknown in human experience and yet politicians and delegates travel around the world stay in luxury hotels and dither about our children s future as carbon emissions rise species blink from existence rivers run dry and ancient forests burn it is no wonder and a welcome sight that the world s youth have seen enough and are not impressed cop 24 un climate conference poland from wikicommons thirty years of pep talks on 12 december 2018 at the cop 24 un climate conference in katowice poland swedish student greta thunberg finally said what the politicized delegates have failed to say thunberg is a direct descendant of swedish chemist svante arrhenius who predicted global heating from carbon emissions in 1896 during this year s heat wave and wildfires in sweden thunberg gained world attention by staging a school strike outside the swedish riksdag holding a sign that read skolstrejk för klimatet school strike for climate she demanded that the swedish government reduce carbon emissions her actions inspired student strikes in over 270 cities around the world speaking on behalf of climate justice now thunberg chastised the delegates and member nations for failing to take action appropriate to the climate crisis until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible there is no hope we can t solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis we need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground thunberg pointed out that if solutions within the system are so impossible to find maybe we should change the system itself and she spoke directly to the errors and injustice of our economic system our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury it is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few she exposed the errors of convenient but false solutions that have displaced the genuine solutions to climate change and ecological collapse you only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular she said you only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake we ve had thirty years of pep talking and selling positive ideas she said in stockholm prior to departing for poland and i m sorry but it doesn t work because if it would have the emissions would have gone down by now they haven t meanwhile outside the conference 330 organizations from 129 countries presented six people s demands for climate justice beginning with keep fossil fuels in the ground and end subsidies to fossil fuel industry the youth leaders urged nations to reject false solutions techno fixes and offsetting schemes in favour of real solutions that are just feasible and essential they particularly called out corporations and rich nations who use the excuse of carbon sinks to seize indigenous land they called on the rich nations whose historical carbon emissions have caused the climate crisis to accept their fair share of climate reparation costs by honouring their green climate fund obligations finally the coalition demanded that un conferences end corporate interference and sabotage of the climate talks extraction corporations have been getting massively wealthy said sriram madhusoodanan from corporate accountability they re in these talks blocking real solutions and advancing false solutions that will continue to propagate their business model why thunberg is correct thunberg is correct about years decades of pep talks and positive ideas that have failed to reduce carbon emissions scientists have known about the threat of global heating since thunberg s ancestor arrhenius calculated the impact in the nineteenth century the modern world has been meeting about the crisis for almost forty years since the first world climate conference in geneva in 1979 since then human carbon emissions have doubled from about 5 gigatonnes of carbon per year gtc yr to 2018 s record breaking 10 88 gtc yr meanwhile co 2 concentration in the atmosphere has grown by 22 from 337 parts per million ppm in 1979 to over 412 ppm today these results represent an enormous failure on the part of world governments laser projection on the cop24 venue in poland konrad konstantynowicz greenpeace she is also correct about the unfulfilled promise of green growth a notion made popular in 2012 at the un conference on sustainable development in rio de janeiro by the world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development both dedicated to industrial growth however recent studies show that green or sustainable growth are delusions in 2018 anthropologist jason hickel reviewed recent data and wrote in foreign policythat green growth is based more on wishful thinking than on evidence a 2012 study by german resource economist monika dittrich and colleagues showed that even under optimum conditions decoupling economic growth from resource use has not occurred the united nations environment programme came to similar conclusions in 2016 and 2017 studies they predicted that by 2050 with continued growth resource use would double to 180 billion metric tons per year gt y ecological footprint data shows that a sustainable level of resource use is about 50 gt y a limit breached in 2000 studies have consistently and rigidly linked economic growth to energy in a 2012paper no way out the double bind in seeking global prosperity alongside mitigated climate change t j garrett at the university of utah performed the calculations and determined that every single dollar us dollar 1990 of global economic growth in recent decades required approximately 9 7 milliwatts of energy global co 2 emission rates wrote garrett cannot be decoupled from wealth through efficiency gains wealthy nations such as the uk and us have claimed to decouple energy use from gdp but only because they have exported energy intensive industries and now import finished goods cars computers trinkets which represent massive embedded energy based on recent data thunberg is entirely correct that green growth is a delusion pull the break finally thunberg is correct that the only paths out of our predicament require that we change the system itself global heating biodiversity loss environmental toxins nutrient cycle disruption and all other ecological challenges arise as symptoms of a single larger biophysical reality humanity is in a state of ecological overshoot there is no way to grow out of overshoot all genuine solutions to overshoot require that the species contract not grow as thunberg says it is time to face these facts to slow down and to pull the emergency brake on economic growth nowwehaveto climate march in helsinki jonne sippola greenpeace this is the reality that the climate conference delegates are too scared to voice our status quo economic system industrial capitalism requires growth to survive without endless economic growth the 250 trillion global debt to bankers and investors cannot be paid as thunberg says our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people can live in luxury the biosphere is being sacrificed so bankers can receive their interest payments to keep stock prices up and to avoid facing reality the current system is biased for the rich to get richer as multitudes suffer as the ecosystem collapses and as other species disappear economist jeremy grantham concurs in the race for our lives when he states that capitalism and mainstream economics simply cannot deal with these problems corporate sabotage of the climate talks is not new in the 1920s and 30s standard oil general motors and firestone tires acquired and sabotaged public transportation throughout north america for the purpose of replacing efficient public transport with gas guzzling cars today in nigeria ecuador canada in the arctic around the world and at these un conferences oil companies are still sabotaging the public interest for profits it gives us some measure of hope that young leaders appear to be among the few who have the courage and insight to speak the truth greta thunberg closed her short talk by announcing we have not come here to beg world leaders to care we have come here to let you know that change is coming whether you like it or not her speech stands as one of the most hopeful moments for ecological realism in recent years

economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 9 per cent last year a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 per cent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 per cent in 1984 independent economists widely expect slower growth this year as the effects of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes veterans advertisement 18 story continues below this advertisement

a doctor they are terminally ill we give them choice if you have to wait for any extended period of time you go outside you go to a local doctor we pay the bill you get yourself better go home to your family and we got it passed we got it done remarks at tank factory the facts as he does routinely trump exaggerated what s been accomplished with his expansion veterans still must wait for weeks before they can get private care outside the va system the program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside va if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles 65 kilometres to a va facility under new rules to take effect in june veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their va wait is only 20 days 28 for specialty care or their drive is only 30 minutes advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content but the expanded choice eligibility may do little to provide immediate help that s because veterans often must wait even longer for an appointment in the private sector last year then secretary david shulkin said va care is often 40 per cent better in terms of wait times compared with the private sector in 2018 34 per cent of all va appointments were with outside physicians down from 36 per cent in 2017 the va also must resolve long term financing because of congressional budget caps after the white house opposed new money to pay for the program as a result lawmakers could be forced later this year to limit the program or slash core va or other domestic programs also key to the program s success is an overhaul of va s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians a process expected to take up to 10 years va secretary robert wilkie has said full implementation of the expanded choice program is years away advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your

politics ap fact check trump s super talkative fact busting week in this jan 2 2019 photo acting secretary of the interior david bernhardt left and acting secretary of defense patrick shanahan right listen as president donald trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the white house in washington ap photo evan vucci the associated press washington ap president donald trump held forth on all manner of things this past week as he emerged from a lonely spell over the holidays he opined for more than 90 minutes to the press at the top of a cabinet meeting on the shutdown immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the nature of walls the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more he capped the week with a rose garden news conference that stretched for an hour and he s been tweeting a lot trump s accounts did not show tremendous fealty to the facts here s a sampling of what he said advertisement the wall trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall advertisement ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured advertisement trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ syria trump we had a fantastic meeting with the generals and the syria situation i mean i m the only person in the history of our country that could really decimate isis say we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out advertisement ___ afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday advertisement the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second ___ tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department advertisement customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month advertisement separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy advertisement ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended sept 30 ___ associated press writers josh boak michael

president donald trump held forth on all manner of things this past week as he emerged from a lonely spell over the holidays he opined for more than 90 minutes to the press at the top of a cabinet meeting on the shutdown immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the nature of walls the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more he capped the week with a rose garden news conference that stretched for an hour and he s been tweeting a lot trump s accounts did not show tremendous fealty to the facts here s a sampling of what he said the wall trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ syria trump we had a fantastic meeting with the generals and the syria situation i mean i m the only person in the history of our country that could really decimate isis say we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out ___ afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second ___ tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended sept 30

nwogu ifeanyi onuba and alexander okere nigerians are to brace for austere times this year again as notable economists have predicted a bleak future for the country this year saying the economy will experience weak and sluggish growth specifically they said the economy would record feeble growth of between 1 8 and two per cent this year a situation they said would make life difficult for most nigerians because the country s population was still growing at a higher rate of three per cent a cross section of the seasoned economists who spoke to saturday punch in separate interviews hinged their predictions on the country s poor economic environment and declining oil prices in the international market similarly available economic reports indicate poor economic performance for the year the price of crude oil which is expected to provide over 70 per cent of funding for the 2019 budget dropped last week to 50 per barrel approximately 10 below the country s 2019 budget benchmark of 60 per barrel a professor of economics at the olabisi onabanjo univeristy sheriffdeen tella said in 2019 the outlook is going to be bleak he hinged his prediction on nigeria s reliance on oil revenue which he said was uncertain he said what is important now is having a plan and letting the international community and local business people know where we are going in the next five or 10 years secondly we have to start looking for customers for our oil because the united states china and india are not buying our oil as it used to be we should be looking for other customers for our oil and gas we have to look at the way in which we can bring in other sectors of the economy and how to improve on them particularly the policies must be very clear and fashioned in such a way that will

plan people who want to assist us from other countries will know where to fit in and would move along with us in his assessment an economist and chief executive officer cowry asset limited johnson chukwu said the economy would continue to experience weak growth in 2019 unless there was a shift in the policy environment chukwu said in 2017 the economy grew by only 0 80 per cent in 2018 we saw a 1 95 per cent growth in the first quarter 1 5 per cent in the second quarter and 1 81 per cent in the third quarter which indicate that the economy had an average growth of 1 75 to 1 8 per cent in 2018 but the growth is still below the population growth rate which is currently close to three per cent he said with the current oil price declining the federal government would have to revise the budget by adjusting the capital expenditure due to the n4tn provided for recurrent expenditure and n2 14trn earmarked for debt service which he described as non discretionary expenses also a renowned economist and managing director chief executive officer of financial derivatives company mr bismarck rewane stated that the nigerian economy would be vulnerable to oil revenue shocks given that oil represents 80 1 per cent of total exports as a result he said economic growth would be sluggish this year he also pointed out that life expectancy would remain low given the level of investment in health care a report detailing his projections for 2019 which was released by fdc reads in part the gdp growth rate economic growth would be at 1 9 per cent currency pressures will force the cbn to act projecting a parallel rate of n375 to a dollar in the second quarter subsidies will be reduced and fuel prices will increase in third quarter external reserves accretion will slow as the cbn prioritises exchange rate stability over building buffers nigeria s inclusion in the opec output cut deal and lower prices will make revenue projections unattainable read also only idle pastors predict politicians that ll win elections mogekwu anglican bishop of asaba diocese the chief executive officer of economic associates an economic research firm dr ayo teriba also hinged the performance of the economy in 2019 on oil prices the nigerian economy will in 2019 do as well as the price of oil permits so if the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries production cut succeeds in lifting the price of oil again which will be effective in january and last for six months as it would be reviewed in april it will do the magic as it did until now also a former vice chancellor of the university of calabar and director general west african institute for financial and economic management prof akpan ekpo said nigeria recorded an average performance in comparison with how it was seven years ago we are committed to repositioning the economy economic planning minister when contacted for comments on the economic outlook for 2019 the media adviser to the minister of budget and national planning mr akpandem james referred one of our correspondents to the presentation made by his principal during the presentation of the 2019 budget the minister of budget and national planning senator udo udoma had said the government was committed to repositioning the economy on the path of higher inclusive diversified and sustainable growth economy plunged six times under buhari reports meanwhile saturday punch investigations have revealed that the nation s economy plunged at six different times in the last three and a half years under president muhammadu buhari data obtained from the national bureau of statistics and analysed by our correspondents revealed that despite recording seven increases in 38 months under buhari the economy grew at an average of 1 8 per cent compared to the average growth of five per cent the country recorded between 2011 and 2015 further analysis of the nbs data revealed that the nigerian economy as measured by the gross domestic product which is released by the nbs every quarter recorded five negative growth which partly led the country into its worst economic recession and weakest growth in 29 years in 2016 while eight positive growth recorded during the 13 quarters under review were mostly below two per cent in all the economy recorded six declines and seven marginal increases between the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2018 the analysis revealed an analysis of other major economic indicators such as the labour force statistics report which measures unemployment rate and the capital importation report which measures investment inflows also revealed volatility prices of goods and services rose seven times in 13 quarters during the period under review the country also experienced seven increases and six declines in inflation rate as revealed by an analysis of the consumer price index report data obtained from the debt management office and central bank of nigeria also showed that the naira exchange rate and national debt performed poorly although inflation rate has been coming down consecutively since the first quarter of 2017 it has not come down to the level the administration met it in the second quarter of 2015 9 2 per cent similarly 13 4 million nigerians were said to have been thrown into employment market in over three years we inherited empty treasury from jonathan says ministry of finance speaking on nigeria s macroeconomic landscape the minister of finance mrs zainab ahmed said that in 2015 when the current administration took over the affairs of the country nigeria s economy was already in decline this she noted was occasioned by a sharp drop in crude oil prices in the international market she said nigeria had always depended on crude oil for as much as 70 per cent of government revenues and 90 per cent of foreign exchange earnings as the previous administration had not built fiscal buffers and saved for the rainy days when crude prices were above a 100 per barrel it was not possible to draw on savings to spur economic growth apc spokesman lanre issa onilu declined to comment on what the administration planned to do differently to tackle the prevailing weak economic growth if re elected he referred one of our correspondents to federal ministers you may also like we used proceeds of bank robberies to buy explosives suspected boko haram commander however the pdp and other opposition parties have in their reactions stated what they would do to boost the economy if elected we ll ensure private sector driven economy job creation pdp the peoples democratic party says it is aware the economy is currently in a precarious state as a result it said the opposition party had outlined strategies and economic blueprints to improve the economy and make life better for nigerians the pdp national publicity secretary kola ologbondiyan in an interview with one of our correspondents on friday said if the party s presidential candidate atiku abubakar is elected in the next month s election his administration would encourage private sector driven economy and ensure better management of the economy through fiscal discipline and adoption of appropriate macro and micro economic policies that would boost growth and attract more investments including foreign direct investments ologbondiyan said what the pdp will do differently in the area of the economy like our candidate has said we will encourage private sector driven economy one of the reasons why nigerians are suffering is the fact that this administration does not even understand the dynamics of modern economics and it has not demonstrated capacity in good management of the economy in many ways but we have a candidate who has been the chairman of national economic council and during his tenure life was far better and we also had those who have the capacity to manage the economy well we would create environment that is enabling for private businesses to thrive these are among our strong areas of campaign also we have a vice presidential candidate who has shown great dexterity in understanding and the management of the economy as well as job creation we are going to make life better for nigerians cupp sdp apga say economy will be more than weak the coalition of united political parties the social democratic party and the all progressives grand alliance on friday agreed with economists who predicted that nigeria s economy would remain weak in 2019 in separate interviews with saturday punch they said the predictions did not come as a surprise considering the way the present administration was handling the economy the first national spokesperson for cupp imo ugochinyere said the present administration was acting blindly as far as the economy was concerned he said it the economy will be more than weak the ruling government has run out of options and acting blindly economically the post 2019 economic future will be disastrous and the country will likely be heading to poverty inspired violence and crisis the sdp s national publicity secretary alfa mohammed said we are not surprised what do you expect from a government that has no economic team or road map what do you expect from a government that proposes to spend n2 031trn on capital expenditure n2 14trn for debt service n4 04trn as recurrent expenditure out of a total n8 83trn budget what do you expect from a government that has engaged in massive cash sharing to voters on the streets and markets on eve of election in guise of free loan

a cabinet meeting on the shutdown immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the nature of walls the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more he capped the week with a rose garden news conference that stretched for an hour and he s been tweeting a lot trump s accounts did not show tremendous fealty to the facts here s a sampling of what he said the wall trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier advertisement advertisement ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall advertisement advertisement ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall advertisement advertisement the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ advertisement advertisement syria trump we had a fantastic meeting with the generals and the syria situation i mean i m the only person in the history of our country that could really decimate isis say we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ advertisement advertisement trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out ___ advertisement advertisement afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 advertisement advertisement ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday advertisement advertisement trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies

not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would

as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate

reading or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story washington ap president donald trump held forth on all manner of things this past week as he emerged from a lonely spell over the holidays he opined for more than 90 minutes to the press at the top of a cabinet meeting on the shutdown immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the nature of walls the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more he capped the week with a rose garden news conference that stretched for an hour and he s been tweeting a lot trump s accounts did not show tremendous fealty to the facts here s a sampling of what he said the wall trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier ___ trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers says the u s drug enforcement administration the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall ___ trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government ___ syria trump we had a fantastic meeting with the generals and the syria situation i mean i m the only person in the history of our country that could really decimate isis say we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now ___ trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out ___ afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they the soviets were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 ___ trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan ___ oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with saudi arabia which remains the biggest oil exporter as

kampala opposition lynchpin col rtd dr kizza besigye has said president museveni and his nrm government are responsible for the current problems facing the energy sector in the country in a statement issued on friday evening dr besigye said that ugandans will continue paying high power bills because of what he described as dysfunctional government systems and policies in the energy sector he said because of lack of a comprehensive energy policy for the country the government has ended up mortgaging the energy sector to foreign companies theft corruption and dysfunctional government systems and institutions in the energy sector are responsible for the power crisis in uganda mr museveni state house s hand is pervasive in all the project scandals the ugandan people are and will continue paying heavily for the mega scandals in the energy sector dr besigye said this is clearly one of the most disempowering and impoverishing failures betrayals of the museveni regime less than 5 of the population has access to electricity due to the high cost and a very tiny distribution network there s no end in sight to the power crisis in uganda unless a more accountable transparent and patriotic government takes charge he added the four time presidential candidate explained that apart from hydroelectric power and biomass uganda has vast renewable energy resources in the form of solar geothermal and wind however he said unfortunately up to now no evaluation of these resources has been done by 2011 kenya was already harnessing 280mw of geothermal power far more than the famed bujagali dam what is more kenya s geothermal output is expected to grow to 800mw by 2018 dr besigye gave an example of bujagali power project which he said it s mismanagement will forever hurt the economy te bujagali dam project was a total fiasco the epitome of nrm regime s corruption and incompetence the country will bleed from its effects for very many years the project was conceived around 1994 as a public government private partnership ppp in february 1996 government awarded and signed a contract with aes nile power ltd without competitive bidding with the project cost of 450 million as usual mr museveni was central in negotiating the deal the contract included a power purchase agreement ppa that committed uganda government to buy all the power to be produced at an agreed price these agreements were a tightly guarded secret between government and aes nile power ltd all efforts by civil society organisations and parliament to gain access to these agreements were rejected by government aes nile power then embarked on mobilising the necessary funding for the project meantime in december 1996 aes nile power adjusted the contract sum upwards to us 530 million to which the uganda government agreed right from the award of the contract many local and international environmental ngos presented serious concerns to the government worried about the negative impact of the project the following were their main concerns the environmental cost was too high this included the dangers of over draining lake victoria absence of a cumulative impact assessment of the cascade of dams especially since no environmental impact assessment was done for the second power project destruction of the unique cascading bujagali falls that was a national treasure for tourism among others and destruction of habitats for fish and birds with a serious impact on river nile fisheries nalubaale owen falls dam posed a potent threat to the proposed bujagali dam because its projected life span had expired and it was known to be heavily cracked a company of uk divers were contracted to assess the dam s safety but the report was kept secret if nalubaale collapsed the boulders and water released would wipe out the nearby bujagali dam down the river neglect of other sources of energy the bloated project had the effect of stifling development of viable renewable energy options lack of a cost benefit analysis generation of power at any cost cannot be uganda s pursuit some observed that bujagali dam was a costly white elephant that increased the nation s debt load and produced little power that few ugandans could afford see full statement below how museveni has sabotaged the energy sector by dr kizza besigye this write up has been prompted by repeated misinformation and blame game by mr museveni on uganda s chronic energy crisis this has been especially in an attempt to explain the very long delay in completing the bujagali dam project it s important however to look at the whole energy sector because this is the heart of a country s economic growth the sector has had major problems both at the policy and the implementation levels there was no energy policy at all between 1986 and 2002 government only depended on annual policy statements made by the minister to accompany budget estimates the renewable energy policy that encompasses our most vital resources was only made in 2007 this is the policy that deals with river dams solar biomass agriculture and forestry products underground heat geothermal wind and peat accumulation of partially decayed vegetation for 20 years there was no policy the energy policy of 2002 and the renewable energy policy 2007 are themselves significantly deficient in some parts and quite misdirected in others however i have no intention of delving into that now the power sector was fundamentally reformed and largely privatised under the electricity act 1999 before there was any form of energy policy this of course has been the standard practice of the cart pulling the horse this was the law that facilitated the government to hand over the power sector to foreign government bodies under the guise of privatisation it is noteworthy that this colossal government failure occurred at a time when there was no political opposition in parliament when for most part the president was the executive and speaker of parliament the biggest failure and sabotage of the energy sector however was in the conception misconception and implementation of power projects the subversion and corruption evidenced in this sector vividly display mr museveni and his regime s unpatriotic and perfidious intentions uganda s energy resource apart from hydroelectric power and biomass uganda has vast renewable energy resources in the form of solar geothermal and wind these also happen to be the most environmentally friendly sources of energy unfortunately up to now no evaluation of these resources has been done by 2011 kenya was already harnessing 280mw of geothermal power far more than the famed bujagali dam what is more kenya s geothermal output is expected to grow to 800mw by 2018 power projects owen falls nalubaale dam was the first power project it was commissioned progressively from 1954 to 1968 when 10 units had been installed with a total capacity of 150mw the project cost at the time was estimated at 63 million this was at a time when uganda s population was only six million over the turbulent years output of the dam collapsed from the initial 150mw to about 60mw the second power project constituted the rehabilitation of the owen falls dam up rating its capacity from the original 150mw to 180mw rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution lines and capacity building for the defunct ueb the project was approved in march 1985 and the project cost was 73 4 million this is the project that was undertaken during the first years of the nrm regime there is very little information regarding the implementation of this project save for the fact that it s reported to have been completed ten years later in 1996 the third project was initiated under the nrm regime it had three main objectives namely improving the safety of the existing owen falls dam nalubaale expanding power generation by building another dam 1km from the owen falls dam with a capacity of 102mw later changed to 200mw and capacity building for uganda electricity board ueb the planned project cost was 300 million and the project was launched in 1991 an appraisal that was undertaken before the project was started showed that there was a critical risk to the project from low water levels of lake victoria this was tragically ignored government minister hilary onek has also publically stated that he advised government about the water level risk and the advice was ignored gibbs company who designed the owen falls dam 1948 and a british aid agency kennedy and donkin all advised that the extension of the project was not economically justified because of the low water levels it s worth noting that a firm acres of canada which did the feasibility detailed engineering and construction supervision of the project didn t go through competitive bidding it was another bedroom appointment in spite of all the concerns expressed about the low lake water levels the original design of installing four turbines of 34mw each total of 102mw was changed to five turbines of 40mw each total 200mw eventually only three out of the planned five 40mw turbines were installed financed by norway due to the low water levels only two of the three installed turbines were commissioned the third is being used as a transformer for a private jinja thermal plant a company sietco from china which was potentially unqualified and had presented easily verifiable false information was awarded the tender to do the construction civil work the firm didn t have money or technical competence to do the work this was eventually terminated the re bidding process resulted in a four year delay of the project and an additional expenditure of 26 million the project was based on a plan to increase the price of electricity to levels that were clearly unrealistic for the market to bear electricity price was supposed to be doubled immediately 1991 to 4 8 cents unit to be trebled to 7 2 cents unit by january 1993 thereafter it was supposed to increase 5 per year from 1994 till a price of 15 cents unit between 1991 and 1993 the price of electricity for a typical consumer increased from shs 10 per unit to shs 86 per unit because of the changed rate and the fluctuating dollar price the government of uganda signed onto these conditions well knowing that its citizens were among the poorest human beings on earth and that power was vital for human and economic development as a result by 1994 less than 25 of all the ueb bills were paid for between 1991 and 1997 unpaid electricity bills accumulated to shs 71 billion 6 m at the time this spelt doom for ueb and provided the justification for winding it up in spite of increasing electricity prices eight times and getting government capitalization of us 40 million ueb could not meet its debt servicing under the 1999 electricity act that restructured the power sector ueb was divided into three companies for power generation there was the uganda electricity generation company limited uegcl for generating power the uganda electricity transmission company limited uetcl for transmission and the uganda electricity distribution company limited uedcl for distribution eskom a south african government company leased the asserts of uegcl for 20 years with a power purchase agreement ppa that compels the only uganda government owned company uetcl to purchase all power supplied by eskom irrespective of the lake victoria water levels eskom together with a uk company formed the company known as umeme umeme has since entered into dubious agreements with government that have already caused a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars to uganda since their takeover the net effect of the third project was the following that out of the 380mw capacity developed at nalubaale owen 180mw and kiira dams 200mw the actual power output of the two dams now managed by a foreign company is less than 100mw this means that the kiira dam investment was a disastrous waste lake victoria water levels have fallen to disastrous levels the meteoric rise in the price of electricity to levels that is unaffordable by most people an independent evaluation group of the world bank main funder carried out in 2008 concluded that the outcome of the project implemented over a 10 year period was rated as unsatisfactory the second poorest rating the winding up of ueb and handing over the strategic power sector to foreign control the low power output at nalubaale and kiira dams led to a high shortage of electricity that prompted the contracting of thermal power diesel engine generators companies this caused a further rise in the price of electricity the rise was so high that government had to subsidise consumers from taxpayers money it is estimated that government subsidy has been about 100 million per year although about 5 of the population consumes electricity this is a direct contribution to growth of poverty foreign companies that took over electricity generation and distribution sales employ experts from their countries undermining the development of domestic expertise mr museveni blames opposition mps for the country s energy problems saying they delayed the implementation of the bujagali dam project before moving on to bujagali can mr museveni or anyone in government inform ugandans who was responsible for the above disastrous developments and what action was taken on them bujagali dam project the bujagali dam project was a total fiasco the epitome of nrm regime s corruption and incompetence the country will bleed from its effects for very many years the project was conceived around 1994 as a public government private partnership ppp in february 1996 government awarded and signed a contract with aes nile power ltd without competitive bidding with the project cost of 450 million as usual mr museveni was central in negotiating the deal the contract included a power purchase agreement ppa that committed uganda government to buy all the power to be produced at an agreed price these agreements were a tightly guarded secret between government and aes nile power ltd all efforts by civil society organisations and parliament to gain access to these agreements were rejected by government aes nile power then embarked on mobilising the necessary funding for the project meantime in december 1996 aes nile power adjusted the contract sum upwards to us 530 million to which the uganda government agreed right from the award of the contract many local and international environmental ngos presented serious concerns to the government worried about the negative impact of the project the following were their main concerns the environmental cost was too high this included the dangers of over draining lake victoria absence of a cumulative impact assessment of the cascade of dams especially since no environmental impact assessment was done for the second power project destruction of the unique cascading bujagali falls that was a national treasure for tourism among others and destruction of habitats for fish and birds with a serious impact on river nile fisheries nalubaale owen falls dam posed a potent threat to the proposed bujagali dam because its projected life span had expired and it was known to be heavily cracked a company of uk divers were contracted to assess the dam s safety but the report was kept secret if nalubaale collapsed the boulders and water released would wipe out the nearby bujagali dam down the river neglect of other sources of energy the bloated project had the effect of stifling development of viable renewable energy options lack of cost benefit analysis generation of power at any cost cannot be uganda s pursuit some observed that bujagali dam was a costly white elephant that increased the nation s debt load and produced little power that few ugandans could afford the ppa between uganda and aes nile power ltd was a closely guarded secret again this made it difficult to ascertain the impact of the dam on uganda s economy it is these ngos concerns that attracted the attention and involvement of mps whom mr museveni has been aggressively and incessantly blaming for uganda s power crisis it ought to be clearly understood however that the involvement of the mps didn t at all occasion the delay of the bujagali dam project three developments caused the delay of bujagali dam namely in 2002 a corruption bribery scandal broke out where aes nile power ltd officials were alleged to have corruptly influenced government officials this led to an investigation by the us justice department based on us foreign corrupt practices act and the world bank fraud and corruption unit the world bank financing was withheld from mid 2002 pending the outcome of the corruption investigations consequently dam construction was suspended in june 2003 two construction firms on the project veidekke and skanska pulled out citing bribery and environmental controversies as the problems in uganda were ongoing aes corp the main shareholder of aes nile power developed problems leading to a drastic collapse of its share value in august 2003 aes corp announced that it was discontinuing the construction and development of aes nile power project in uganda aes wrote off 75 million that it had already invested in bujagali project in june 2002 world bank s independent investigative unit found that the bujagali project violated five operational policies of the bank in november 2002 after the suspension of the project the high court made a historic ruling which declared the ppa a public document and forced the government to make it public an independent review of the ppa between uganda government and aes nile power ltd was carried out after the forced release by prayas energy group the review determined that the project cost was inflated more than double the agreement would make the ugandan people pay 20 40 million extra per year compared to similar projects in other parts of the world the 2003 pull out of the project by aes was therefore a blessing for uganda short lived as it turned out to be bujagali dam was re bidded in 2005 a consortium led by industrial promotions services ips a holding company of the aga khan was awarded the contract ahead of three other consortia it was reported that ips lagged behind the others at the technical evaluation mr museveni and state house were again very involved in deciding the contract award the project partners ips sithe global power usa and the government set up a new company bujagali energy ltd bel to operate and run the project ips and bel signed a power purchase agreement ppa and an implementation agreement with government uegcl respectively these agreements were signed before parliament approved the government s obligation as required by law the project cost was put at 860 million the government advanced bel 90 million to kick start the project the project also inherited the 75million asserts forfeited by defunct aes nile power ltd construction work resumed in 2007 and was planned to be completed in three years the bujagali power project was inaugurated in october 2012 16 years after the initial contract was signed at the inauguration mr nazir juma the chairman of bel reported that the total project cost was 902 million the investigation by a parliamentary ad hoc committee on energy chaired by bududa south jacob oboth oboth showed that the actual cost of the dam project was 1 3 billion the committee recommended a forensic audit of the project bujagali dam even at the official 902 million is the most expensive dam in the world today construction of hydropower plants in africa and other continents cost between 1 0 1 7 per mw capacity bujagali at the officially declared project cost stands at 3 6 per mw if the parliamentary committee findings are correct this will go up to 5 2 per mw worse still whereas the installed capacity of bujagali dam is 250mw due to the low water levels that were known to obtain the actual output of the dam since inauguration has not exceeded 130mw on average the total power generated by the three dams today is just a little more than what the upgraded nalubaale owen falls dam produced yet it s ten times more expensive and the country is saddled with debts from the white elephant projects this is the latest scandal whose extent is still unfolding karuma dam project is supposed to generate 600mw of power it was conceived in the mid 1990s and has been on the drawing board since corruption allegations started even as the project was being drawn up it may be recalled that a norwegian company that had interest in getting the karuma contract allegedly paid a ugandan senior government official a 10 000 bribe karuma dam the bids for karuma dam were eventually invited in august 2010 eight major bidders were shortlisted all the others except three companies two chinese and one iranian were eliminated at the pre qualification stage immediately after this allegations of bribery started they were first published in the east african newspaper it was alleged that the contracts evaluation committee received 1 2 million from the chinese since then court injunctions official investigations court cancellation and repetition of the evaluation process have crippled the procurement process in march 2013 the igg recommended and government has accepted that the project should be re tendered nearly three years on no contractor has been selected in a daily monitor story of april 15 2013 mr museveni is reported to have informed his cabinet that some of his ministers were demanding for a 200 million bribe from a chinese firm aspiring to win the karuma power dam construction contract it has also been reported that mr museveni has now personally taken over the procurement process to fast track it yes hold your breath conclusion theft corruption and dysfunctional government systems and institutions in the energy sector are responsible for the power crisis in uganda mr museveni state house s hand is pervasive in all the project scandals the ugandan people are and will continue paying heavily for the mega scandals in the energy sector this is clearly one of the most disempowering and impoverishing failures betrayals of the museveni regime less than 5 of the population has access to electricity due to the high cost and a very tiny distribution network there s no end in sight to the power crisis in uganda unless a more accountable transparent and patriotic government takes charge what is presented here regarding the energy sector is certainly replicated in all sectors of government this is why roads in uganda are the most expensive to construct and take forever to complete yet they disintegrate in a very short time this is why uganda railways collapsed ict development is poorest in the region water dam reservoirs for dry areas of uganda remain a fantasy this is why in spite of being in government for nearly 30 years and uncountable money spent all social services are in shambles agriculture has collapsed ugandans have no national ids etc recommendations accordingly recommendations need to target the pervasive failures theft and corruption subversion and dysfunction of government and those that have colluded and abated its crimes the following measures are recommended parliament should urgently institute a formal and public inquiry into the grave and glaring cases of corruption abuse of office and misconduct in the implementation of the power projects in uganda the auditor general should carry out a forensic audit of all the power projects parliament should initiate a probe into the role of the world bank and associated institutions in supporting dubious projects that enslave ugandans to paying huge debt burdens where these lenders have acted imprudently or illegally a case should be made for non payment of their loans mps should revive the impeachment proceedings against the president under article 107 a and b they should start by drawing up the many very clear and incontrovertible charges of abuse of office and misconduct including acts of commission and omission as provided for in the constitution unless the mafia like network in government is completely purged the misery of ugandans can only intensify let all ugandans who are informed rally other citizens to say that enough is enough and to demand a better government share this facebook x whatsapp linkedin

the final jobs report of 2018 released friday boasting 312 000 jobs added in december puts the u s economy on track for another relatively strong showing in 2019 with economists predicting a slowdown coming toward the end of the year unemployment is one of the factors in the latest data influencing such predictions the unemployment rate rose to 3 9 percent in december but some economists attribute that mostly to more people entering the workforce and more people quitting their jobs a sign that they believe they can get a job and possibly higher pay elsewhere over much of next year the unemployment rate is expected to be around 3 7 percent before rising slightly in 2020 according to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia s quarterly survey of forecasters there are signs of economic headwinds the forecasters also anticipate real gdp to drop slightly from 2 9 percent to 2 7 percent before falling further to 2 1 percent in 2020 inflation is not expected to take off any time soon despite the tightened labor market core inflation will likely tick up to 2 4 percent from 2 2 percent in 2018 according to the forecast and despite the recent decline in the stock market consumer confidence remains high which economists say is a good sign that the economy will keep running at a steady pace in the near term so if things look good now why are forecasters predicting slower times ahead there are signs of economic headwinds higher interest rates economic slowdowns abroad and concerns over trade battles between the u s and other nations including china could hamper growth later in the year here are seven other factors economists are keeping an eye on wage growth average hourly wages are now 3 2 percent higher than they were a year ago rising 11 cents since last month that s significantly higher than inflation 2 2 percent experts are now cautiously optimistic about growth in the coming year wages are rising and we expect them to continue doing so said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america but keep an eye out for an impending slowdown wage pressure is helping drive the increase with a record number of job openings 7 1 million to 6 3 million unemployed people employers are starting to hire at slightly higher pay rates twenty five percent of small business owners plan to raise compensation the highest since 1989 according to the latest national federation of independent business survey this is largely in response to persistently high levels of unfilled open positions additionally workers earning minimum wage who reside in one of twenty one states or the district of columbia will automatically receive increases this year thanks to a raft of city and state legislation read more the minimum wage is increasing in these 21 states with the unemployment rate being low if you aren t getting the pay you want this is the time to switch jobs said robert frick a corporate economist with navy federal credit union that s especially true for people with unique skills and qualifications like engineers or it specialists but frick warns you might have to be willing to relocate to improve your prospects what could temper wage increases factors like the government shutdown the volatile financial market a slowing global economy and uncertainty around monetary policy mean employers may exercise caution in raising wages in fear of another economic downturn more workers coming off the sidelines the percentage of able bodied working age people who have a job or are looking for one known as the labor force participation rate rose to 63 1 percent in december that s better than it has been in recent months and near the long term average but it s significantly lower than the 67 3 percent peak seen in the 2000s the labor force participation rate went down during the great recession when people became too discouraged to look for work a higher labor force participation rate also means more people are participating in the economy and therefore generating economic growth for the nation as wages rise in 2019 more people who aren t currently trying to get hired might be encouraged to enter the labor market we think there is a probability that rising wages are going to reinvigorate the job market frick said but frick and other economists do not expect hiring to be as strong as it was in 2018 he estimates monthly job hiring could remain near 200 000 per month but then weaken toward the end of the year interest rate hikes the federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates only once or twice in 2019 fed chair jerome powell said at an economic conference friday that the central bank will be flexible when determining whether to raise interest rates in the coming year the fed uses interest rates to help keep the economy moving at a steady pace raising interest rates can keep inflation in check lowering them can give an added boost to a sluggish economy the federal reserve raised interest rates four times last year fears that the fed was raising rates too quickly in part led to a selloff in the stock market but the fed s goal is not to keep the stock market afloat it is to monitor the broader economy which is why powell has made it clear he will keep a close eye on economic indicators when making policy decisions for 2019 any more interest rate hikes in the new year would likely push credit card and auto loan interest rates higher meaning it will cost more for consumers to borrow which could button up spending while few people are likely to downsize from the suv to a compact because of interest rates greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate com said now is a good time for americans to pay off their credit cards mortgage rates mortgage rates are a different ballgame the 30 year fixed income mortgage rate which is based on the bond market has declined the past two months mcbride expects the rate to remain volatile rising above 5 25 percent before dropping sharply later in the year while every region s housing market is different in general if mortgage rates go back up it could slow the national housing market and conversely if they drop it could give it another boost corporate debt corporate debt has ballooned since the 2008 financial crisis to 9 trillion low interest rates over the past several years have made it easy for companies to borrow cheaply last month powell said the corporate debt level is not yet high enough to be alarming but he did take notice as other economists have as capital costs rise that s going to create a greater risk of business failure said brian schaitkin a senior economists at conference board schaitkin encourages businesses large and small to take those increased costs into account when determining their plans for the coming year china and the slowdown in global growth u s businesses will also have to account for what s happening overseas the world bank predicts economic growth will slow throughout much of the world as central banks pull back on some of the policies they used to prop up their economies after the 2008 financial crisis the u s trade battle with china is also complicating matters apple this week revised its earnings projections because of decreased demand in china sending stocks down other companies could soon follow suit the u s and china have a self imposed march deadline to agree how to address tariffs and other economic issues if they fail to make a deal that could create added uncertainty and hurt both chinese and u s businesses throughout 2019 companies too big too fail economists are keeping a close eye on several of the major tech companies to see how they fare with uncertainty in the global market but also how they address criticism for how they handle customer data privacy as well as geopolitical matters like foreign election interference on social media during the 08 financial crisis we saw the emergence of banks that were too big to fail now we may have companies that are in some ways too big to fail schaitkin said companies like amazon apple facebook and google play an outsized role in the u s economy in terms of retail advertising and data with their new control in the house democrats are likely to push for greater scrutiny of silicon valley in terms of antitrust enforcement data privacy and the industry s role in elections while tech executives such as google s ceo sundar pichai have signalled they are willing to work with congress increased oversight and potential regulation may introduce some uncertainty to the sector if these companies falter schaitkin said that could shake consumers and business confidence and have serious ramifications for the economy
the data reassured investors concerned about a possible recession photo ap the us economy smashed expectations for job growth friday reassuring investors concerned about a possible recession and setting off a buying frenzy on wall street a day after fears about china s slowing economy sent shock waves through global markets the dow jones industrial average shot up more than 740 points closing the day up 3 29 per cent the surge in hiring and wage growth with 312 000 new jobs in december capped off the best year of job gains since 2015 and tamped down fears of an imminent slowdown of the economy businesses typically don t add workers unless they believe they will need them for months to come and the federal reserve offered further encouragement for investors sizing up the economic outlook for 2019 the economy has good momentum federal reserve chair jerome powell told the annual meeting of the american economic association noting that the central bank will be patient about raising interest rates this year despite a brutal start to trading for the year driven by political uncertainty over the federal government shutdown and the lingering trade dispute with china the conclusion that most economists are coming to is that us growth this year will be slower than 2018 but a recession is unlikely 2018 was a very strong economy i would say we re moving from strong to something more like solid mary daly president of the san francisco fed said in an interview it s still open in my mind about whether we move from solid to moderate the us economy has a good chance of remaining healthy even as china and europe soften and markets and politics remain volatile many economists say consumers power the us economy and the expectation is that americans will continue to open their wallets and spend as long as jobs are plentiful and wages keep rising i would say the odds of a recession over the next year have to be pretty close to zero kevin hassett president donald trump s chief economist said in an interview we re carrying a lot of momentum into next year we ve built new factories and now it s time to turn them on hassett said he s confident the weakness in china and europe won t spill over into the united states apple this week slashed its sales forecasts for the first time in 15 years blaming economic deterioration in china but by hassett s calculation only 1 7 per cent of us corporate profits come from china reducing its effect on the u s economy and the problems he sees in china and europe are specific to those countries there are special circumstances that explain the european and chinese growth slowdown in europe it s brexit and italy and in china it s a credit bubble general weakness and the effect of tariffs hassett said there isn t an unexplained malady we re worried we ll catch too fed leaders pushed back against the prevailing view among some business leaders and investors that the us economy was overdue for a recession after a nearly decade long expansion saying that was not correct expansions don t die of old age i like to say they get murdered ben bernanke the former fed chair and president of the american economic association told the meeting he was emphatic that he did not see any threats lurking on the horizon and that there s an excellent chance the economy continues to grow through july breaking the record for the longest us expansion in history but he agrees growth will be lower this year it s likely the economy will grow more slowly in 2019 than 2018 this is not something that is news we ve anticipated this for a long time in december markets sold off sharply after the fed predicted two interest rate increases for 2019 wall street traders and trump think the fed shouldn t do any this year largely because of fears that the slowdown overseas would hurt the united states those worries were heightened this week after apple slashed its earnings expectations for the first time in more than 15 years and a key u s manufacturing gauge the ism manufacturing index fell by the largest amount in years but on friday the labor department reported that manufacturing added 32 000 positions in december capping off the best year for manufacturing job gains since 1997 and that workers in that sector are clocking more overtime a sign that factories continue to churn we re seeing two different economic realities right now said martha gimbel research director for the hiring lab at indeed an employment website one is the stock market which is going through something and the other is the labor market which has been chugging along apple blamed china s decelerating economy and trump s trade war for its weaker sales investors worry that other companies will also feel the pinch but so far the employment data remain strong and inflation remains mild despite concerns the tariffs would cause prices to rise unemployment has been under 4 per cent for nine months now we have inflation under control i think that s a pretty good outcome and we sure think it can continue said powell despite rising global head winds the us economy remains solid because it is relatively insulated from overseas turmoil jerome powell chairman of the us federal reserve photo bloomberg concerns remain that hiring could slow down later in 2019 but there are few if any alarm bells about jobs or wages as the new year kicks off the american economy is booming based on today s reading of the employment situation which should go a long way to reassuring nervous nellies in financial markets chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank said in a note to investors wage growth hit 3 2 per cent a year in december the fastest pace in nearly a decade and a sign of increasing competition for workers while inflation eats up some of those gains wages are growing about a percent above the cost of living for the typical american mainly because gas prices have stayed low while many cheered the strong hiring report some analysts were quick to say that it s a lagging indicator that isn t necessarily a great predictor of where the economy is headed while today s number is great to see i m not going to use it to influence my view of economic growth in 2019 which will be on a slowing trajectory said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group the consensus view is that growth will slow to about 2 5 per cent down from about 3 per cent last year but some forecasters like morgan stanley have cut their prediction to 1 7 per cent a far more dramatic decline much will depend on whether consumers remain confident or whether they follow wall street s lead and take a gloomier view the white house is about to release its latest projections and the expectation is trump will again forecast 3 per cent growth trump himself dismissed concerns about apple s slashed earnings report arguing that us companies are strong enough to get through any hiccups and that hurting the chinese economy is necessary to get more trade concessions from the nation they re going to be fine apple is a great company but i have to worry about our country trump said friday apple makes their product in china

north chief economist at euler hermes north america but keep an eye out for an impending slowdown wage pressure is helping drive the increase with a record number of job openings 7 1 million to 6 3 million unemployed people employers are starting to hire at slightly higher pay rates twenty five percent of small business owners plan to raise compensation the highest since 1989 according to the latest national federation of independent business survey this is largely in response to persistently high levels of unfilled open positions additionally workers earning minimum wage who reside in one of twenty one states or the district of columbia will automatically receive increases this year thanks to a raft of city and state legislation read more the minimum wage is increasing in these 21 states with the unemployment rate being low if you aren t getting the pay you want this is the time to switch jobs said robert frick a corporate economist with navy federal credit union that s especially true for people with unique skills and qualifications like engineers or it specialists but frick warns you might have to be willing to relocate to improve your prospects what could temper wage increases factors like the government shutdown the volatile financial market a slowing global economy and uncertainty around monetary policy mean employers may exercise caution in raising wages in fear of another economic downturn more workers coming off the sidelines the percentage of able bodied working age people who have a job or are looking for one known as the labor force participation rate rose to 63 1 percent in december that s better than it has been in recent months and near the long term average but it s significantly lower than the 67 3 percent peak seen in the 2000s the labor force participation rate went down during the great recession when people became too discouraged to look for work a higher labor force participation rate also means more people are participating in the economy and therefore generating economic growth for the nation as wages rise in 2019 more people who aren t currently trying to get hired might be encouraged to enter the labor market we think there is a probability that rising wages are going to reinvigorate the job market frick said but frick and other economists do not expect hiring to be as strong as it was in 2018 he estimates monthly job hiring could remain near 200 000 per month but then weaken toward the end of the year interest rate hikes the federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates only once or twice in 2019 fed chair jerome powell said at an economic conference friday that the central bank will be flexible when determining whether to raise interest rates in the coming year the fed uses interest rates to help keep the economy moving at a steady pace raising interest rates can keep inflation in check lowering them can give an added boost to a sluggish economy the federal reserve raised interest rates four times last year fears that the fed was raising rates too quickly in part led to a selloff in the stock market but the fed s goal is not to keep the stock market afloat it is to monitor the broader economy which is why powell has made it clear he will keep a close eye on economic indicators when making policy decisions for 2019 any more interest rate hikes in the new year would likely push credit card and auto loan interest rates higher meaning it will cost more for consumers to borrow which could button up spending while few people are likely to downsize from the suv to a compact because of interest rates greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate com said now is a good time for americans to pay off their credit cards mortgage rates mortgage rates are a different ballgame the 30 year fixed income mortgage rate which is based on the bond market has declined the past two months mcbride expects the rate to remain volatile rising above 5 25 percent before dropping sharply later in the year while every region s housing market is different in general if mortgage rates go back up it could slow the national housing market and conversely if they drop it could give it another boost corporate debt corporate debt has ballooned since the 2008 financial crisis to 9 trillion low interest rates over the past several years have made it easy for companies to borrow cheaply last month powell said the corporate debt level is not yet high enough to be alarming but he did take notice as other economists have as capital costs rise that s going to create a greater risk of business failure said brian schaitkin a senior economists at conference board schaitkin encourages businesses large and small to take those increased costs into account when determining their plans for the coming year china and the slowdown in global growth u s businesses will also have to account for what s happening overseas the world bank predicts economic growth will slow throughout much of the world as central banks pull back on some of the policies they used to prop up their economies after the 2008 financial crisis the u s trade battle with china is also complicating matters apple this week revised its earnings projections because of decreased demand in china sending stocks down other companies could soon follow suit the u s and china have a self imposed march deadline to agree how to address tariffs and other economic issues if they fail to make a deal that could create added uncertainty and hurt both chinese and u s businesses throughout 2019 companies too big too fail economists are keeping a close eye on several of the major tech companies to see how they fare with uncertainty in the global market but also how they address criticism for how they handle customer data privacy as well as geopolitical matters like foreign election interference on social media during the 08 financial crisis we saw the emergence of banks that were too big to fail now we may have companies that are in some ways too big to fail schaitkin said companies like amazon apple facebook and google play an outsized role in the u s economy in terms of retail advertising and data with their new control in the house democrats are likely to push for greater scrutiny of silicon valley in terms of antitrust enforcement data privacy and the industry s role in elections while tech executives such as google s ceo sundar pichai have signalled they are willing to work with congress increased oversight and potential regulation may introduce some uncertainty to the sector if these companies falter schaitkin said that could shake consumers and business confidence and have serious ramifications for the economy

china s slowing economy sent shock waves through global markets the dow jones industrial average shot up more than 740 points closing the day up 3 29 percent the surge in hiring and wage growth with 312 000 new jobs in december capped off the best year of job gains since 2015 and tamped down fears of an imminent slowdown of the economy businesses typically don t add workers unless they conclude they will need them for months to come and the federal reserve offered further encouragement for investors sizing up the economic outlook for 2019 the economy has good momentum federal reserve board chairman jerome h powell told the annual meeting of the american economic association noting that the central bank will be patient about raising interest rates this year advertisement despite a brutal start to trading for the year driven by political uncertainty over the federal government shutdown and the lingering trade dispute with china the conclusion that most economists are coming to is that u s growth this year will be slower than 2018 but a recession is unlikely 2018 was a very strong economy i would say we re moving from strong to something more like solid mary c daly president of the san francisco fed said in an interview it s still open in my mind about whether we move from solid to moderate the u s economy has a good chance of remaining healthy even as china and europe soften and markets and politics remain volatile many economists say consumers power the u s economy and the expectation is that americans will continue to open their wallets and spend as long as jobs are plentiful and wages keep rising advertisement i would say the odds of a recession over the next year have to be pretty close to zero kevin hassett president trump s chief economist said in an interview we re carrying a lot of momentum into next year we ve built new factories and now it s time to turn them on hassett said he is confident that the weakness in china and europe will not spill over into the united states apple this week slashed its sales forecasts for the first time in 15 years blaming economic deterioration in china but by hassett s calculation only 1 7 percent of u s corporate profits come from china reducing its effect on the u s economy and the problems he sees in china and europe are specific to those countries there are special circumstances that explain the european and chinese growth slowdown in europe it s brexit and italy and in china it s a credit bubble general weakness and the effect of tariffs hassett said there isn t an unexplained malady we re worried we ll catch too advertisement fed leaders pushed back against the prevailing view among some business leaders and investors that the u s economy was overdue for a recession after a nearly decade long expansion saying that was not correct expansions don t die of old age i like to say they get murdered ben s bernanke the former fed chairman and president of the american economic association told the meeting he was emphatic that he did not see any threats lurking on the horizon and that there s an excellent chance the economy will continue to grow through july breaking the record for the longest u s expansion in history but he agrees growth will be lower this year it s likely the economy will grow more slowly in 2019 than 2018 this is not something that is news we ve anticipated this for a long time in december markets sold off sharply after the fed predicted two interest rate increases for 2019 wall street traders and trump think that the fed should not make any this year largely because of fears that the slowdown overseas would hurt the united states those worries were heightened this week after apple slashed its earnings expectations for the first time in more than 15 years and a key u s manufacturing gauge the ism manufacturing index fell by the largest amount in years advertisement but on friday the labor department reported that manufacturing added 32 000 positions in december capping off the best year for manufacturing job gains since 1997 and that workers in that sector are clocking more overtime a sign that factories continue to churn we re seeing two different economic realities right now said martha gimbel research director for the hiring lab at indeed an employment website one is the stock market which is going through something and the other is the labor market which has been chugging along apple blamed china s decelerating economy and trump s trade war for its weaker sales investors worry that other companies will also feel the pinch but so far the employment data remain strong and inflation remains mild despite concerns the tariffs would cause prices to rise advertisement unemployment has been under 4 percent for nine months now we have inflation under control i think that s a pretty good outcome and we sure think it can continue said powell despite rising global head winds the u s economy remains solid because it is relatively insulated from overseas turmoil concerns remain that hiring could slow down later in 2019 but there are few if any alarm bells about jobs or wages as the new year kicks off the american economy is booming based on today s reading of the employment situation which should go a long way to reassuring nervous nellies in financial markets chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank said in a note to investors wage growth hit 3 2 percent a year in december the fastest pace in nearly a decade and a sign of increasing competition for workers while inflation eats up some of those gains wages are growing about a percent above the cost of living for the typical american mainly because gas prices have stayed low advertisement many cheered the strong hiring report but some analysts were quick to say that it is a lagging indicator that is not necessarily a great predictor of where the economy is headed while today s number is great to see i m not going to use it to influence my view of economic growth in 2019 which will be on a slowing trajectory said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group the consensus view is that growth will slow to about 2 5 percent down from about 3 percent last year but some forecasters including morgan stanley have cut their prediction to 1 7 percent a far more dramatic decline much will depend on whether consumers remain confident or whether they follow wall street s lead and take a gloomier view the white house is about to release its latest projections and the expectation is trump will again forecast 3 percent growth advertisement trump himself dismissed concerns about apple s slashed earnings report arguing that u s companies are strong enough to get through any hiccups and that hurting the chinese economy is necessary to get more trade concessions from the nation they re going to be fine apple is a great company but i have to worry about our country trump said friday apple makes

london a gradual rise by the japanese yen in recent weeks culminated in a dramatic overnight surge firing a warning shot for world markets and the global economy in 2019 historically outsized yen gains in short periods such as the russian default in 1998 and the global market meltdown in 2008 are a harbinger of stress for global markets market watchers say the yen s latest ascent is a sign that the global economy is set for a rocky ride ahead signs are growing that the global economy is headed for a slowdown in an environment like that the yen tends to thrive japan s large current account surplus means global markets consider it a safe haven global surveys this week showed activity in european and chinese factories are slowing and falling demand forced apple to issue a rare cut in its sales forecast sending tremors through global markets the yen s roaring higher was a sign of just how widespread concern over the health of the global economy had become said ulrich leuchtmann head of fx research at commerzbank japanese investors tend to invest a large portion of their savings overseas then bring the money home during extreme market stress driving the yen higher that outward investment pressure has only surged in recent years according to morgan stanley foreign investments in us assets has nearly doubled over the last decade to us 1 25 trillion a sign of the magnitude of the flows that could head back into the yen the dollar collapsed to as little as 104 10 yen its lowest reading since march 2018 in early asian trading before recouping some losses to stand at 107 64 yen the yen strengthened at least 1 per cent against all its g10 peers at session lows the japanese currency has gained more than 6 5 per cent in the last five trading sessions and is the best performing major currency since early december but even as evidence mounts that the global economy is struggling central banks led by the united states are signalling more interest rate increases are coming that is raising fears they may be tightening policy too much into an economic slowdown it tells you there is a lot of anxiety and nervousness and concern about a more material slowdown in the economy said bob michele chief investment officer and head of fixed income at jp morgan asset management real us interest rates adjusted for inflation are at their highest in nearly three years nominal interest rates are greater than dividend yields in us china and japan us real yields are too high productivity problems are emerging in china and the glut of global surpluses is falling exposing structural flaws in developed markets said hans redeker global head of fx strategy at morgan stanley in london unusually though this time around the surge in the yen has occurred a few months after a selloff in emerging markets last summer that suggests the bulk of japanese investment is concentrated in developed markets such as the united states between late march and early october us stocks rose by 13 per cent and the dollar gained more than 9 per cent against the yen as rate increases in the united states and trade tensions boosted the us currency sam lynton brown a currency strategist at bnp paribas in london said japanese investors typically held much of their investments in developed markets and the widening cracks in developed markets resulted in the yen s strongly exhibiting its safe haven characteristics only in recent weeks morgan stanley strategists said japanese investors have stepped up buying of riskier us assets such as equities and credit in recent weeks to capture higher yields since 2010 they have added more than us 400 billion in us assets most of it in equities they said with japan s financial market still closed for new year s holidays the latest moves have been credited to retail investors those investors generally behaved like the rest of the fx market bar exceptional circumstances said commerzbank s leuchtmann emerging market currencies such as turkey s lira and south africa s rand felt the biggest pain the lira tumbled more than 7 per cent overnight against the yen the rand dropped nearly 4 per cent investors have been nervous about both countries which rely heavily on foreign investors to plug their gaping current account deficits these dislocations demonstrate the impact of unwinding qe on market structures and it means that the truly more vulnerable markets out there need to watch their back so to speak said koon chow at ubp japanese investors who had cut back on their protection against currency moves are also expected to take advantage of reduced hedging costs and protect their overseas portfolios from further losses a move that market watchers say may be the catalyst for further gains even if the yen consolidates around these levels in the near term we think it will continue to strengthen on balance in 2019 said bnp paribas s lynton brown who expects the dollar to weaken to 100 yen by the end of the year for jane foley a currency strategist at rabobank dollar yen at 100 is an indicator of a us economy in recession reuters

on november 23 three militants of the balochistan liberation army attacked the prc consulate in karachi the latest in a series of assaults by baloch militants on prc projects and personnel in pakistan global times november 24 baloch opposition to the china pakistan economic corridor cpec is a primary motivating factor for these attacks with many balochis alleging that cpec a flagship component of china s belt and road initiative bri exploits baloch resources while only benefiting the chinese and non baloch pakistanis express tribune december 17 2015 south asian governments are becoming increasingly discontent with bri projects in august pakistan s new government expressed interest in reviewing the cpec contracts that they perceive to be over priced unnecessary or excessively in the favor of prc companies dawn september 11 similar sentiments have been expressed by the new maldivian government which is reviewing bri contracts signed during the rule of former president abdulla yameen economic times november 26 such actions raise questions as to whether south asian states might scale down or even cancel bri projects a game changer for pakistan when prc president xi jinping unveiled plans for bri in 2013 it evoked great interest in many south asian countries as former ambassador in the sri lanka ministry of foreign affairs dr john gooneratne stated in an interview with the author bri holds out the prospect of helping to bridge the significant infrastructure financing gap increase connectivity link local markets to regional and global value chains and thereby increase trade and investment in the participating countries moreover unlike western governments and financial institutions whose loans require developing countries to meet conditions for good governance democracy and human rights beijing was willing to extend significant loans for infrastructure development without these conditions the island august 11 2017 attracted by the potential benefits of bri pakistan bangladesh sri lanka the maldives and nepal joined the ambitious prc led initiative during xi s visit to islamabad in april 2015 the prc and pakistan signed agreements to establish cpec the deal was especially appealing to pakistan as its poor security situation made attracting foreign investment difficult beijing pledged funds to cpec to the tune of 46 billion which was subsequently increased to 62 billion over a 15 year period dwarfing the 7 5 billion in aid the united states had extended over a five year period to pakistan in 2009 dawn april 22 2015 cpec envisioned linking the gwadar port in pakistan s balochistan province with kashgar in china s xinjiang province through a network of highways railways oil and gas pipelines and fiber optic cables with special economic zones and energy projects to be established along the way the projects were expected to create jobs and business opportunities for locals attract foreign investment enhance energy production and boost the pakistani economy pakistan observer august 16 2017 it was widely hailed in pakistan as a game changer daily times august 30 2016 loans for infrastructure in bangladesh sri lanka and maldives much like cpec bangladesh sri lanka and maldives also sought financial support for their respective infrastructure projects in the case of bangladesh the prc was willing to finance infrastructure projects that appealed to the priorities of the bangladeshi government thereby filling a void left by reluctant western financiers bnp paribas and the norwegian government s sovereign wealth fund for instance had refused to finance the rampal coal fired power plant at khulna for environmental reasons daily star june 26 2015 the world bank cancelled a 1 2 billion credit for the padma multipurpose bridge project citing high level corruption world bank june 29 2012 in contrast according to humayun kabir former ambassador and secretary in bangladesh s ministry of foreign affairs china s focus on and assistance to infrastructure development in bangladesh aligned well with the latter s needs and priorities this attracted bangladesh to join bri in order to benefit from its economic potential similarly post war sri lanka required significant funding for infrastructure building however as dr gooneratne explains sri lanka s usual western donors were reluctant to extend support given the mahinda rajapaksa government s reluctance to carry out an examination into how the war was fought and possible human rights violations this was not the case with the prc which not only shielded the rajapaksa regime from scrutiny at international human rights forums but also extended loans without conditions under bri the prc provided loans and built a deep sea port at hambantota an international airport at mattala and a 900 megawatt coal fired power plant at norocholai the colombo port city project among others as with sri lanka former maldives president abdulla yameen also turned to beijing for financial support beijing s support of yameen s authoritarian rule in the face of strong criticism from india and the west encouraged yameen to embrace bri prior to 2011 sino maldivian relations were negligible beijing did not even have an embassy in male however during yameen s presidency maldives joined bri and entered into a free trade agreement that was overwhelmingly in beijing s favor under bri the prc extended loans and expertise to maldives for several infrastructure projects including the sinamale bridge linking male to hulhule island and a massive housing project on hulhumale counter balancing india for landlocked nepal bri was an opportunity to improve infrastructure and connectivity with world markets and more importantly reduce its dependence on india nepal s need to become less dependent on india was underscored in 2015 16 when it was believed that india gave tacit consent to impose an economic blockade that paralyzed nepal causing enormous hardship to its people this became one of the driving motivations for nepal to reach out to the prc and sign on to bri in may 2017 under bri the prc is building energy and transport infrastructure foremost among these is a railway line linking kerung in the tibet autonomous region with kathmandu and the tourist towns of pokhara and lumbini in nepal this is expected to boost nepal s trade and tourism industries the wire november 22 the outliers three south asian countries india bhutan and afghanistan are not participants in bri india s opposition to bri stems primarily from the fact that cpec runs through gilgit baltistan disputed territory that is under pakistan s control but to which india lays claim india says that it cannot be involved in an initiative that violates india s sovereignty and territorial integrity ministry of external affairs india april 5 additionally india is concerned that bri has dramatically expanded the prc s presence in the region it maintains that bri has strategic motivations and that the prc is driving south asian countries into deep debt to increase its own leverage indian express may 15 2017 india has had limited success in persuading its neighbors to avoid involvement in bri only bhutan and afghanistan have maintained their distance from the initiative geopolitical rivalries have kept bhutan and afghanistan out of bri under pressure from india bhutan does not have official diplomatic or economic relations with the prc and has yet to get involved with bri however the prc is assiduously wooing bhutan and businessmen and youth in bhutan are increasingly supportive of establishing official ties with beijing and joining bri connectivity with global markets that bri promises makes it an attractive initiative for remote and landlocked bhutan china brief april 20 2017 like bhutan land locked afghanistan could benefit from bri s connectivity with distant markets indeed pakistan and the prc are keen to include afghanistan in cpec as this would contribute to the corridor s profitability however kabul has repeatedly declared that as long as pakistan denies it overland access to india it will not allow pakistan similar access to central asian countries although afghanistan has signed a memorandum of understanding on bri with china it has yet to become a full participant in the initiative outlook afghanistan august 16 increasing caution about bri involvement south asian countries are becoming increasingly cautious about involvement in bri and its implications for the region many governments are calling for renegotiation of bri contracts sri lanka s experience with debt has become the primary cautionary example in this regard by 2015 sri lanka reportedly owed 8 billion to the prc with the hambantota port failing to attract business and colombo unable to repay its loans sri lanka ended up handing over this port and 15 000 acres of land around it to the prc on a 99 year lease in addition to over commitment of governments to bri a lack of transparency in the deals has deepened public skepticism of the benefits of involvement in bri for south asian countries in the case of sri lanka it was the secretive manner in which deals were negotiated that drew public ire there were stories of underhand money dealings that dampened the enthusiasm of the public even pakistan the prc s closest ally and south asia s biggest proponent of bri is pushing back on the initiative in 2017 when the prc introduced more restrictive conditions for funding of the 14 billion diamer bhasha dam pakistan pulled the project from cpec s ambit as it felt that the conditions were not doable and against pakistan s interests express tribune november 15 2017 more recently pakistan s new government announced that it is cutting down on loans from the prc under cpec and has reduced 2 billion in loans for rail projects dawn october 2 in contrast to other bri participants bangladesh has been cautious from the start always a conservative borrower bangladesh s loans have remained within its capacity to pay back it has drawn lessons from sri lanka s experience and has been more conscious about the risks that could emerge from over commitment to bri projects moreover dhaka is not overly dependent on the prc for support as it has managed to attract investment from india japan and others as demonstrated by the payra port project this has enabled bangladesh to deal with the prc from a position of relative strength in 2016 dhaka turned down china s offer to develop a deep sea port at sonadia in favor of japan s proposal for a deep sea port just 25 km away at matarbari which was considered to be more beneficial to bangladesh china brief june 21 2016 looking ahead sri lanka pakistan and maldives may not be as overburdened by debt as they are today had they followed bangladesh s example of cautious borrowing selective involvement in projects and rejection of economically or strategically unviable initiatives unfortunately they accepted the prc s vision as their own and embraced bri without questioning whether it was in their own long term interests the defeat of bri friendly south asian leaders in elections has been widely described as setback for the prc such interpretations gained momentum when their successors in sri lanka pakistan and the maldives promised to review contracts with the prc however subsequent events indicate that while concern over debt burdens is rising in the region the future of bri projects in south asia has not dimmed in sri lanka contracts on hambantota port and colombo port city that were renegotiated and signed by the pro west ranil wickremesinghe government ended up being more favorable to the prc than the contracts originally signed by the pro prc rajapaksa the citizen november 25 in fact the government went on to sign even more agreements for bri projects pakistan s prime minister imran khan said he would request that beijing realign cpec s goals to his government s agenda but prc authorities reportedly brushed aside his proposals to re negotiate cpec deals ipp review november 29 burdened by crippling debt bri s south asian member states are too weak to re negotiate or cancel project terms there are high costs for withdrawing from these projects in addition although the governments of india and some western nations are highly critical of bri they lack the deep pockets that the prc has to fund these projects moreover the prc s bri partners in south asia are aware that economic development could suffer without the infrastructure improvements promised by bri however while south asian countries are less optimistic about bri than they were a few years ago and continue to raise concerns over the debt burden and contract terms this cannot be interpreted yet as a major setback for the prc s ambitions so far we have seen little concrete change come from pushback on bri initiatives in south asia at least the prc seems on course to realize its global ambitions through bri dr sudha ramachandran is an independent researcher and journalist based in bangalore india she has written extensively on south asian peace

05 01 2019 listen ghana returned to constitutional rule and multi party democracy after a topsy turvy eight military regimes from 1966 to 1982 without any clear sense of direction for her political and socio economic development therefore the 1992 constitution which came into effect on january 7 1993 provided the nation a sovereign document and clear direction for organising a democratic state the country adopted a unitary republic with sovereignty residing in the people and designed to ensure probity accountability and the rule of law as well as ensuring power sharing among the three arms of government namely the executive legislative and judiciary the 1992 constitution reflected the lessons learnt from the previous constitutions of ghana including the 1957 1960 1969 and 1979 and also incorporated some provisions and institutions drawn from british and united states constitutional style flight lieutenant jerry john rawlings a retired air force pilot who for 10 years presided over the provisional national defence council pndc won the 1992 presidential elections and was subsequently sworn into office on january 7 1993 most ghanaians remember former president rawlings for his charisma championing the principles of discipline probity and accountability who led the economic recovery programme during his 10 years as the head of state under the pndc administration and eight years as the first president under the fourth republican constitutional dispensation however his critics believed he rawlings presided over a society characterised by so many human rights abuses and atrocities while freedom of expression by the media the judiciary and other members of the public were trampled upon with impunity though there were others who credited rawlings for championing media pluralism in the country and allowing the establishment of private radio and television stations after serving two terms in office president rawlings handed over political power to john agyekum kufuor on january 7 2001 former president kufuor popularly known as the gentle giant became the second president under the fourth republic after emerging victorious in the 2000 presidential polls he was sworn into office on january 7 2001 marking the first peaceful democratic transition of political power in ghana since independence in 1957 president kufuor was fondly remembered by many for his courageous decision to take ghana to the highly indebted poor country initiative which was intended to cancel the country s foreign debts restore the national economy and put it on the path of growth he introduced some programmes under the five priority areas including the pursuit of good governance modernisation of agriculture for rural development private sector development enhanced social services and vigorous infrastructure development it was during the administration of president kufuor that the private sector was touted as the engine of growth and created the private sector initiatives for cassava and palm nut plantations which was to harness the creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit of the ghanaian for wealth creation and prosperity for all president kufuor extended credit to small scale businesses and made the realisation of all inclusive government possible by appointing dr paa kwesi nduom the then member of the convention people s party cpp and alhaji inusa of the people s national convention pnc into his government he also introduced the metro mass transport system the national health insurance scheme the development of model senior high schools the school feeding programme and the livelihood empowerment against poverty leap after serving two terms in office president j a kufuor bowed out of the political scene as the constitution of ghana demanded the ghanaian electorate through the ballot box voted in professor john evans atta mills popularly known as asomdwee hene into power as the third president of the fourth republic ghanaians liked him for his godly character and humility which resonated through his speeches and relationship with his fellow ghanaians president atta mills showed his godly character by defiantly declaring to the western countries that ghana would not legalise homosexuality with his vast knowledge in taxation president atta mills introduced economic programmes and policies which reduced inflation to a single digit ensured a stable currency and increased the country s economic growth rate to 14 per cent in 2011 and ghana started producing crude oil in commercial quantities after president prof atta mills sudden demise in 2012 his vice john dramani mahama was sworn in as president and led the country into peaceful election on december 7 2012 which he eventually won president mahama who continued the policies and programmes of his predecessor steered the country to achieve some successes including infrastructural development such as construction of roads community senior high schools health facilities electrification projects and respect for the rule of law however his administration witnessed prolonged electricity crisis otherwise known as dumsor leading to the collapse of some businesses and allegations of corruption by members of his government ghanaians eventually voted against him in the 2016 general election and ushered in the nana addo dankwa akufo addo led government into office on january 7 2017 nana akufo addo came into power on the back of many juicy promises which were outlined in the npp manifesto including the one district one factory one constituency one million cedis one village one dam free senior high school policy intention to create jobs for the numerous unemployed youth stimulus package for collapsing but viable businesses protecting the public purse and fight corruption nana akufo addo reiterated his intention to fulfil those promises during his inaugural address on january 7 2017 and gave the assurance that he would not disappoint ghanaians at the 72nd session of the united nations general assembly in new york usa last year president akufo addo told the world that ghana was determined to realise her potentials and ensuring a prosperous nation he said we want to build an economy that is not dependent on charity and hand outs but we want to build an economy that looks past primary commodity and position our country in a global market place we re not disclaiming aid but we do want to discard the mind set of dependency and living on hand outs we want to build a ghana beyond aid president akufo addo named his ministers and other appointees in record time but some ghanaians lambasted the government for appointing 110 ministers which is the highest number in any of the fourth republic government the government witnessed some tough moments with some members of the ruling party the invincible forces attacking some government appointees in an act of political vigilantism which created insecurity in the country and painted a bad picture of the country in the eyes of the international community government took a bold step to clamp down on illegal small scale mining otherwise known as galamsey leading to a six month moratorium on all operations of small scale mining in view of the environmental devastation the phenomenon had caused to vegetation and water bodies the akufo addo led government rolled out its economic policy and budget statement in march 2017 which planned to stabilise the local currency reduce inflation undertake debts profiling and ensure stable macroeconomic indicators that would create conducive environment for doing business government announced some tax cuts for businesses in the budget it also rolled out its flagship free shs policy on september 13 2017 which saw government footing the bills of over 360 000 bece candidates who qualified for admission into senior high school the government also re introduced the teacher and nursing trainee allowances paperless ports programme e registration of businesses national property addressing system and e licensing of vehicles and started putting structures in place to roll out the national identification system the finance minister ken ofori atta announced in the 2018 budget in november last year that government had chalked some successes in managing the economy in 2017 with the gdp growth pegged around 7 8 per cent from 3 6 in 2016 reduction of the policy rate from 26 per cent to 20 reduction of inflation from 15 4 per cent to 11 7 per cent as of september mr ofori atta indicated that the country s debt stock had reduced from 73 per cent to gdp to 68 3 as of september 2017 the fiscal deficit which in 2016 was around 9 3 is projected around 6 3 per cent by the end of 2017 however dr eric osei assibey an economist and senior lecturer at the university of ghana told the gna that the programmes instituted by government was brilliant but the approach it was using to address graduate unemployment would be problematic in the long term he therefore urged government to expand the local economy and provide more incentives to the private sector to expand in order to absorb the unemployed graduates and add value to the country s primary commodities locally instead of exporting them abroad he said government should look at innovative ways of generating enough revenue within since budget support from donors had dwindled considerably therefore government should be more aggressive in domestic revenue mobilisation dr kwabena opuni frimpong the general secretary of the christian council of ghana also asked government to come clear on how it would ensure sustainable funding of its flagship programmes such as the free shs one constituency one million ghana cedis and the one district one dam among other promises it made in the 2016 election dr vladimir antwi danso a researcher and expert on governance issues asked government to enforce discipline in the country adding that ghanaians have high expectations and would not take any excuses from the government it is our fervent hope that the government would mobilise resources from both within and outside as well as adding value to the country s primary commodities so that ghana would work again and create the needed jobs for the teeming unemployed youth and ensure prosperity for all he said gna

reuters the yankees took over our economy in 1898 us holdings in cuba amounted to 50 million pesos in 1906 they amounted to some 160 million and in 1927 to 1 45 billion i don t believe there is another country in which economic penetration has taken place so incredibly quickly allowing the imperialists to take over our best lands all our mines our natural sources they controlled the public services the greater part of the sugar industry the most efficient industries the electricity industry the telephone service the railroads the most important businesses and the banks birsen filip birsen filip the majority of the cuban people support castro there is no effective political opposition the only foreseeable means of alienating internal support is through disenchantment and disaffection and hardship every possible means should be undertaken promptly to weaken the economic life of cuba a line of action which makes the greatest inroads in denying money and supplies to cuba to decrease monetary and real wages to bring about hunger desperation and overthrow of government cuban people are capable of establishing their own government we have never considered the possibility of discussing this we will discuss only matters that do not affect our sovereignty there is something more powerful than weapons ideas reason and the morality of cause these are things that are not born of human beings nor do they perish with an individual today cubans are commemorating the 60th anniversary of their independence on this day in 1959 the cuban revolution was successfully conducted by fidel castro s 26th of july movement and became an enduring symbol of resistance to neo colonialism capitalism and hegemony as a result cuba s corrupt and brutal dictator fulgencio batista 1901 1973 who had the full backing of the us government left the island and escaped to the dominican republic along with some of his loyal supporters spain was the first country to exercise dominion over cuba beginning in 1510 however spain s defeat at the hands of the americans in the spanish american war of 1898 did not bring about the emancipation that cubans were expecting as the island was subsequently transformed into a us neo colony in the period between the conclusion of the spanish american war in 1898 and the victory of the cuban revolution in 1959 the us exercised imperial power over cuba exploiting its natural and human resources and dictating its domestic and foreign policies when batista who was supported by washington since 1933 came to power via coup d état on march 10 1952 he and his corrupt associates immediately collaborated with washington and the american mafia to facilitate the continued exploitation cuba s resources in particular he permitted the american mafia to take control of all the casinos on the island in exchange for millions of dollars being deposited into his swiss bank account díaz briquets and pérez lópez 2006 77 meanwhile throughout the entire period when americans exercised imperial power over cuba washington used its authority to advance the interests of american corporations which ended up controlling all of the economic sectors on the island in addition to gaining ownership of the best agriculture land mines and natural resources in fact the domination of cuba at the hands of the americans was best explained by fidel castro october 10 1968 in manzanillo when he stated although batista s dictatorial and corrupt regime oppressed the cuban population violated human rights and committed countless crimes against democratic principles equality and freedom it was never criticized nor condemned by washington batista s dictatorial rule was accompanied by extreme rural poverty misery illiteracy an increase in the number of sex workers exploitation and high unemployment rates almost half of cuba s adults and 37 5 of the total population were illiterate and as much as 70 of all children did not have access to a teacher during the period of us dominance furthermore most cubans could not obtain housing or access decent healthcare services and electricity and water infrastructure were very limited these conditions exacerbated by american domination in all segments of the economy led to most cubans experiencing exploitation racism police brutality starvation and humiliation women were particularly vulnerable to exploitation as many girls from urban areas elected to serve as prostitutes for american tourists and businessmen it did not take very long for the american mafia operating on the island to realize that they could profit from this situation which eventually led to them operating almost 300 brothels in havana to supplement the money they earned from selling illegal drugs these appalling conditions inspired fidel castro and approximately 165 of his compatriots to make an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the batista dictatorship on july 26 1953 following their failed attack against the moncada military barracks near santiago de cuba castro was sentenced 15 years in prison of which he served only two years on account of a strong amnesty campaign that was organized by relatives and colleagues of the prisoners as well as opponents of the batista regime after his release castro relocated to mexico because of threats made against his life by the batista government there he organized trained and armed a new group of revolutionaries that came to be known as the 26th of july movement commemorating the date of his first attempt to overthrow the batista regime by the time the 26th of july movement was ready to attempt its overthrow of the batista regime it counted a total of 82 revolutionaries within its ranks including fidel as the main organizer camilo cienfuegos 1932 1959 raúl castro ernesto ché guevara 1928 1967 and juan almeida bosque 1927 2009 in november 1956 all 82 of these revolutionaries left mexico for cuba on a 10 day voyage aboard a yacht called granma which only had the capacity to carry 12 passengers upon arriving in cuba they advanced to the sierra maestra mountain range in order to meet up with other supporters of the revolutionary movement against the batista dictatorship however they were met by many attacks from the cuban army and only 12 of the 82 revolutionaries survived to reach sierra maestra nonetheless the survivors of the granma yacht and supporters of the revolutionary movement on the island continued the guerrilla war by organizing resistance groups in towns and cities across the island after the revolution fidel castro governed cuba first as prime minister from 1959 to 1976 then as president from 1976 until 2008 from the outset his government consistently defended and promoted anti imperialism and instituted measures aimed at ending the colonization humiliation and exploitation of cuba at the hands of the united states which included shutting down all casinos and brothels on the island marginalizing the mafia and curtailing international tourism one of the first acts of the new government was to nationalize foreign enterprises and utilities including banks and telephone companies most of which belonged to american companies additionally refineries that were controlled by american corporations such as shell and esso were nationalized and cuba signed a trade agreement to purchase oil from the soviet union the castro government also instituted a number of land and agrarian reforms including measures aimed at limiting land ownership and forbidding foreigners from purchasing or possessing land in the country in an effort to improve cuban living standards education and health care were made universally accessible to all citizens without exception the castro socialist regime also made large investments in housing construction and infrastructure improvements which included building 600 miles of roads in six months through such actions cuba earned the reputation of being the first territory free from imperialist domination in latin america and the caribbean fidel castro may 1 2003 havana american officials were unanimously opposed to the cuban revolution and the socialist reforms being implemented by the castro government viewing them as direct attacks against us interests in cuba president dwight eisenhower became furious with castro s nationalization process and anti imperialist policies and retaliated decisively eventually breaking off diplomatic relations with the island on january 3 1961 eisenhower also responded by collaborating with the mafia and approving efforts on the part of the central intelligence agency cia to overthrow cuba s socialist government which came to be known as the program of covert action against castro these efforts culminated in the invasion at the bay of pigs on april 17 1961 where approximately 1 400 cuban exiles that were trained armed and funded by the cia attacked cuba in an attempt to topple fidel castro s socialist regime although this failed invasion was executed when john f kennedy was president the cia began planning this operation in march 1959 when the eisenhower administration was still in power subsequently in 1962 the kennedy government imposed a full commercial economic and financial embargo on cuba which blocked virtually all trade between the two countries and banned u s citizens from travelling to the island since being instituted the trade embargo has been accepted as the best mechanism to reverse the socialist revolution by all of the subsequent us administrations the rationale behind the imposition of the embargo was best explained by lester d mallory former deputy assistant secretary of state on april 6 1960 in addition to the commercial economic and financial blockade the americans also employed a wide variety of other tactics aimed at destabilising and destroying cuba s socialist regime which included funding cuban exiles to organize terrorist attacks and sabotage the island s economy engaging in chemical and biological warfare imposing economic and political sanctions that inhibited cuba s ability to access credit and loans from international banks and prevented free trade and supporting cia efforts to assassinate fidel castro interestingly against the backdrop of all these attacks and efforts to reverse the revolution fidel castro consistently expressed his willingness to enter into negotiations to normalize relations with the us however he made it explicitly clear that while economic problems could be discussed communism was not on the table specifically castro may 1 1961 in havana stated that in 1991 cuba formally requested un assistance in ending the blockade since then the un general assembly has voted on a non binding resolution criticizing the ongoing impact of the embargo every year which has passed with overwhelming support on each occasion in the most recent vote held in october 2018 189 of the 193 member states comprising the general assembly voted for the non binding resolution with only the u s and israel voting against it and moldova and the ukraine abstaining in fact no more than four countries have ever voted against this resolution over its 27 year history with the u s and israel being the only two countries that have opposed it every time support for the resolution has grown steadily as evidenced by the declining number of abstentions since the initial vote as members of the general assembly including many u s allies cannot justify the devastating economic impacts of the embargo on the daily lives of the cuban people in fact a thorough investigation conducted by the american association for world healthin 1997 declared that the u s embargo of cuba has dramatically harmed the health and nutrition of large numbers of ordinary cuban citizens the u s embargo has caused a significant rise in suffering and even deaths in cuba for several decades the u s embargo has imposed significant financial burdens on the cuban health care system since 1992 the number of unmet medical needs patients going without essential drugs or doctors performing medical procedures without adequate equipment has sharply accelerated this trend is directly linked to the fact that in 1992 the u s trade embargo one of the most stringent embargoes of its kind prohibiting the sale of food and sharply restricting the sale of medicines and medical equipment was further tightened by the 1992 cuban democracy act furthermore the inter american commission on human rights also confirmed the impact of such sanctions on the human rights of the cuban people and therefore insists that the embargo be lifted with the collapse of the soviet union cuba lost its most important trade partner and the large subsidies emanating from the socialist block this led to severe shortages of basic needs including food and medication which resulted in malnutrition and a significant increase serious health problems during the special period of course the us could never pass up such a grandiose opportunity to tighten the screws further by enacting measures to strengthen its embargo against cuba with the passage of the cuban democracy act in 1992 and the helms burton act in 1996 in response to the hardships associated with the special period fidel castro s government initiated a number of quasi free market economic reforms and sought foreign investment to reinvigorate the economy which included permitting small scale private enterprises reopening the island to foreign tourism in 1993 94 and investing in biotechnology in fact the reforms implemented during the special period are the reason why many of the hotel and resort chains currently operating on the island are actually joint ventures between the cuban government and foreign companies primarily from spain and canada that would suggest that cuba has been trying to rejuvenate its socialist system since the soviet union collapsed in 1989 as opposed to abandoning its ideals in favour of capitalism navarro 2014 vandepitte 2011 in fact the world bank acknowledged that cuba s international success in the fields of education and health with social services that exceeds those of most developing countries and in certain sectors are comparable to those of the developed nations furthermore according to estimates from the united nations development program cuba ranks third in latin america on the human development index hdi more precisely according to the united nations human development report 2017 cuba s 2017 hdi of 0 777 is above the average of 0 757 for countries in the high human development group and above the average of 0 758 for countries in latin america and the caribbean in addition to its success in areas of human development cuba has also been active in providing practical foreign aid in the form of sending highly trained specialists such as teachers doctors and engineers to developing countries where they are urgently needed this is a practice for which cuba is particularly well regarded cuba also helps combat doctor shortages by providing free medical school for students from various developing countries in fact havana s latin american medical school is the largest medical school in the world producing approximately 29 000 doctors from 90 countries since 2005 the quality of the cuban health care system has been acknowledged by former us president jimmy carter who stated that of all the so called developing nations cuba has by far the best health system and their outreach program to other countries is unequalled anywhere castro s government was also well known for its commitment to the environment as demonstrated by the country s sustainable use of natural resources and its efforts to combat over consumption and global warming in 2014 cuba registered a low ecological footprintof less than 1 8 hectares per capita well below the 2 8 world average outside of the western mainstream press cuba is actually widely renowned for its commitment to peace social justice equality and humanitarian aid since its socialist revolution in 1959 nowhere else in the world did the spirit of international solidarity become so deeply rooted than in cuban fidel castro 2003 in 1963 fidel castro s government organized the committee in solidarity with vietnam laos and cambodia which sought to provide these countries with assistance during the vietnam war by sending cuban medical professionals engineers and technological advice in addition to consistently expressing solidarity with the palestinian cause fidel castro also condemned the disastrous nato led military intervention of libya that commenced in march 2011 such actions and strong positions have made fidel castro highly respected throughout the arab world since the early years of the cuban revolution cuba also played a prominent role in liberation movements on the african continent for example in 1961 cuba supported the national liberation front in its fight against french colonialism in algeria subsequently in october 1963 after algeria had been liberated from france cuba sent troops to help safeguard algeria s recently acquired independence against moroccan expansionism during the sand war fidel castro may 1 2003 havana cuba also sent material and military assistance in support of the marxist movement for the liberation of angola in the late 1960s after angola gained independence from portugal in november 1975 cuba supported the leftist people s movement for the liberation of angola mpla by sending 25 000 troops to help repel interventions on the part of south africa and zaire which were supported by washington after zaire and south africa withdrew their forces cuban troops remained to support the mpla government during much of the angolan civil war 1975 2002 eventually leaving in 1991 the case of cuba is not an isolated one it would be an error to think of it only as the case of cuba the case of cuba is that of all underdeveloped nations it is the case of the congo it is the case of egypt it is the case of algeria it is the case of iran and finally it is the case of panama which wants its canal back it is the case of puerto rico whose national spirit they are destroying it is the case of honduras a portion of whose territory has been seized in short without specifically referring to other countries the case of cuba is the case of all underdeveloped and colonized countries the problems of latin america are like the problems of the rest of the underdeveloped world in africa and asia the monopolistic interests are not concerned with the development of the peoples what they want is to exploit the natural resources of our countries and exploit the peoples the cuban people have been struggling against the most formidable imperial power ever known to humankind for 60 years it could be said that never has the world witnessed such an unequal fight when considering the relative sizes populations and military strengths of the two countries fidel castro may 1 2003 havana however despite these disparities in favour of the us cuba crushed the bay of pigs mercenary invasion organized by a us administration thereby preventing a direct military intervention in 1962 cuba confronted with honor and without a single concession the risk of being attacked with dozens of nuclear weapons it stoically endured thousands acts of sabotage and terrorist attacks organized by the us government it thwarted hundreds of assassination plots against the leaders of the revolution fidel castro may 1 2003 havana cuba was able to achieve these victories because fidel castro may 1 2003 havana fidel castro june 23 2007 long live free cuba long live the victorious revolution fidel castro

montpelier lawmakers return to the state house next week for the new biennium facing a number of ongoing issues as well as some matters of personal importance past issues that are likely to reappear this session include efforts to regulate the sale and tax of marijuana address affordable health care and renewed efforts to increase the minimum wage and pass a paid family leave bill the democratic super majority in the house may allow the party to override vetoes by gov phil scott a republican the following are responses from several senate and house members from washington county about their priorities for the new session senate anne cummings i think the biggest challenge facing vermont is the national decline in the rural economy while chittenden county continues to prosper the rest of the state including many of our small cities see their economies stagnating or declining it s a national issue one that is contributing to addiction anger and social unrest i don t know the solution but i do know we have to work together to find one after that or probably before that we will need to continue to work on the rising cost of education and health care anthony pollina knowing that vermont median family income actually went down last year my priorities include efforts to support middle class and lower income families pollina said that includes raising the minimum wage and establishing paid family medical leave changing how we fund education because the current system is unfair making low and moderate income families pay more of their income than higher income families so the funding must be made more fair and based more on income and ability to pay we must make our state colleges tuition free and make housing and child care affordable these policies will also encourage young people to come to and stay in vermont he added andrew perchlik the newly elected democrat said his first priority was simply doing a good job representing washington county also i acknowledge that depending on what committees i m on and what the leadership of the senate and of the committees i m on decides is a priority what i get to work is a bit out of my control perchlik said that s why i do say that a priority is to do a good job i should find the best way to help the communities of washington county and staying in communication with folks across the county regardless of what issues i m working on perchlik said his top three priorities would be economic viability of families paid family leave minimum wage increase increased public support to child care and other services for pre k children in need and other family and child services increased housing especially affordable housing county wide i also put public transportation in this category and local renewable heating energy infrastructure and heating affordability specifically focused on local economic development with advanced wood heating he added perchlik said he also wanted increased funding for low income weatherization support for low income utility customers and getting vermont on the right course for a sustainable low carbon transportation future house washington 1 ken goslant affordability was the number one priority for republican ken goslant the big thing is affordability keeping existing vermonters here and making it more affordable goslant said i m really in line with the governor about the affordability i m really concerned about the opiate crisis he continued also people don t talk much about the elderly i d really like to keep the elderly staying in vermont instead of getting a florida address i know they re coming out with the carbon tax but i m not in favor of the carbon tax he added anne donahue could not be reached for comment washington 2 francis topper mcfaun mcfaun s priorities include protecting children while in school eliminating social security taxes for more vermonters and increasing the availability of affordable day care mcfaun would also like to provide appropriate and timely services to individuals with mental health problems keep property taxes down reduce the benefits cliff for reach up participants so they have an incentive to work and provide more incentives to businesses so they can expand and attract new businesses to vermont to create good paying jobs rob laclair i ve had a lot of folks reach out to me in person or via email or phone calls concerned about the carbon tax and i ve not really had anybody say that they support it laclair said the affordability issue in vermont is still near and dear to a lot of folks hearts it s kind of an expensive state to live in and anything we can do to address that issue would be fantastic the lake champlain cleanup is something we certainly have to take a hard look at as something we need to do whether we need to attack it with new revenue or other revenues i know there s a lot of stuff coming our way from marijuana to minimum wage and paid family leave and like anything the devil is in the details so we ll have to see what that looks like he added washington 3 tommy walz my overall priority is to create a cleaner safer healthier and more prosperous vermont walz said my specific priorities are in no ranked order to create more affordable housing address the opioid crisis raise the minimum wage reduce our greenhouse gas output enact paid family leave and reduce the state s debt peter anthony my priorities are to increase available and diverse housing stock by means of rehabilitation weatherization and new starts anthony said i would also like to incentivize the occupancy of now vacant space in designated downtowns like barre re think invent the models and state support for workforce training and participation continue the push to convert addicted persons into productive citizens and redouble efforts to re establish sustainable ecosystems that are land sky and water based washington 4 mary hooper hooper said the most important issue for her was to improve the economy noting that stagnant wages are not keeping up the cost of living hooper said she did not believe that the solution to improving the economy was austerity instead she said the state needs to think about which services people need that actually help them advance economically warren kitzmiller my priority is to deal with the issues that come before my committee government operations kitzmiller said i do not have any personal agenda items that i m pushing for in the background there is always berlin pond but i don t know that that will come to the front this year i m afraid that berlin pond actually needs to be harmed before anybody is going to listen and unfortunately that may happen actually fairly soon and it will cost montpelier over 1 million to correct he added washington 5 kimberly jessup my top priorities for the coming session fall into two broad categories economic security and environmental stewardship jessup said to promote greater economic security we need to get a handle on health care costs expand access to child care raise the minimum wage and establish paid family leave as environmental stewards i believe our responsibilities need to include addressing climate change and identifying clean water funding finally i believe that change at the federal level means we must take measures to protect reproductive choice for vermonters she added washington 6 janet ancel if i m back on ways and means committee issues that i anticipate dealing with are funding for clean waters something we have been working on for some years now and need to come to a decision on ancel said i expect that we will be asked to act on tax and regulate for marijuana the senate plans to act on that first in terms of personal priorities some changes to act 46 are important to me one is to facilitate implementation of the forced mergers for at least a year and another is to set up an evaluation of act 46 with respect to the goals that were set out initially and whether we re actually making progress toward those goals ancel continued one issue on the sales tax i think we will act on is the u s supreme court made a decision that allowed us to collect from online retailers we had statues in place that made it possible to do that but we have not yet addressed what s called the marketplace which would be the etsys and ebays where they re direct sellers and i think we need to make a change to bring the marketplaces under our jurisdiction so that we can also collect vermont sales tax she added washington 7 maxine grad as chair of the house judiciary committee i hope to build on my work of community safety and justice reform grad said priority issues are protecting women s reproductive rights fair and impartial policing racial justice protection of crime victims prevention of domestic violence homicide prevention of sexual violence expanding current law on expungement as part of my workforce development work school safety suicide prevention providing statewide access to treatment courts alleviating charging and sentencing disparities and ensuring vermonters constitutional right to access to the courts by understanding the status of our court system and possible responses i hope we will see the progress on clean water funding and water quality depending upon what is being discussed there may be issues of jurisdiction for my committee the same goes for regulation of cannabis she added kari dolan i am thrilled to have this opportunity to represent the interests passions and values of the communities that make up the washington 7 district duxbury fayston moretown waitsfield and warren dolan said my top priority is to be available and listen to community members town leaders and businesses in order to best represent their interests at the statehouse more specific priorities include affordability and livability economic issues and opportunities for our rural communities healthy environment and actions to combat racism and other injustices washington chittenden theresa wood there is not a sufficient number of people paying attention to services for older vermonters elder care services wood said so particularly in light of the residential care home closings and the state taking over receivership of residential care homes i m going to be paying particular attention to elder care issues

dollar hurt as us fed s powell pledges patience over economy new york reuters the u s dollar retreated against the euro giving up all the gains logged after a robust u s jobs report following comments from federal reserve chairman jerome powell that the u s central bank will be sensitive to the downside risks the market is pricing in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves powell told the american economic association on jan 4 powell said the fed is not on a preset path of interest rate hikes and suggested that it could pause its policy tightening as it did in 2016 powell s comments that the fed is prepared to alter policy expectations quickly and flexibly are weighing on the u s dollar and giving risk sentiment a boost said eric viloria fx strategist at credit agricole in new york overall powell s tone is cautious which is contributing to u s dollar softness viloria said the euro was 0 09 percent higher at 1 1401 against the greenback earlier in the day the euro zone single currency fell as low as 1 1347 against the dollar after the dollar rose following data that showed u s employers hired the most workers in 10 months in december while boosting wages the data contrasts with reports this week signaling the global economy is slowing china posted data showing factory activity contracted for the first time in 19 months in december and there is evidence of weak manufacturing across much of europe and asia i think he powell was not as forceful as some people myself included expected him to be that is what took a bit of the wind out of the sails of the dollar especially after a somewhat solid nonfarm payroll report said alfonso esparza senior currency analyst at oanda in toronto against the japanese yen the u s dollar was 0 7 percent higher the greenback which had slipped against the safe haven japanese yen in recent days amid worries about a slowdown in global growth found support earlier in the session after china announced new measures to support its economy and hopes grew that upcoming u s china trade talks would make some progress market sentiment improved when china confirmed that trade talks with the united states would be held in beijing on jan 7 8 china s central bank slashed the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the fifth time in the past year the latest effort to free up new lending and reduce the risk of a sharp economic slowdown president donald trump and democratic leaders failed to strike a deal on friday to end a partial shutdown of the u s government as they fought over trump s request for 5 billion to fund a wall on the border with mexico lawmakers said the australian dollar recovered after being hit hard in jan 3 s scramble for safety and was up 1 6 percent most emerging market currencies rebounded the south african rand and the turkish lira each gained more than 2 percent against the greenback the canadian dollar logged its third consecutive day of gains after touching an almost 20 month low earlier in the week sterling jumped on jan 4 after suffering heavy losses spurred by fears of a global economic slowdown but uncertainty about brexit kept gains in check
the federal reserve sent a clear message to wall street on friday it will not allow the longest bull market in american history to end the message was received loud and clear and the dow rose by more than 700 points hundreds of thousands of federal workers remain furloughed or forced to work without pay as the partial government shutdown enters its third week but the us central bank is making clear that all of the resources of the state are at the disposal of the financial oligarchy responding to thursday s market selloff following a dismal report from apple and signs of a manufacturing slowdown in both china and the us the fed declared it was listening to the markets and would scrap its plans to raise interest rates speaking at a conference in atlanta where he was flanked by his predecessors ben bernanke and janet yellen both of whom had worked to reflate the stock market bubble after the 2008 financial crash chairman jerome powell signaled that the fed would back off from its two projected rate increases for 2019 we re listening sensitively to the messages markets are sending he said adding that the central bank would be patient in imposing further rate increases to underline the point he declared if we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans was causing a problem we wouldn t hesitate to change it this extraordinary pledge to wall street followed the 660 point plunge in the dow jones industrial average on thursday capping off the worst two day start for a new trading year since the collapse of the dot com bubble william mcchesney martin the fed chairman from 1951 to 1970 famously said that his job was to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going now the task of the fed chairman is to ply the wealthy revelers with tequila shots as soon as they start to sober up powell s remarks were particularly striking given that they followed the release friday of the most upbeat jobs report in over a year with figures including the highest year on year wage growth since the 2008 crisis universally lauded as stellar while us financial markets have endured the worst december since the great depression amid mounting fears of a looming recession and a new financial crisis analysts have been quick to point out that there are no hard signs of a recession in the united states both the dow and the s p 500 indexes have fallen more than 15 percent from their recent highs while the tech heavy nasdaq has entered bear market territory usually defined as a drop of 20 percent from recent highs the markets powell admitted are well ahead of the data but it is the markets not the data that powell is listening to since world war ii bear markets have occurred on average every five and a half years but if the present trend continues the dow will reach 10 years without a bear market in march despite the recent losses now the fed has stepped in effectively to pledge that it will allocate whatever resources are needed to ensure that no substantial market correction takes place but this means only that when the correction does come as it inevitably must it will be all the more severe and the fed will have all the less power to stop it from the standpoint of the history of the institution the fed s current more or less explicit role as backstop for the stock market is a relatively new development founded in 1913 the federal reserve legally has had the dual mandate of ensuring both maximum employment and price stability since the late 1970s fed officials have traditionally denied being influenced in policy decisions by a desire to drive up the stock market but like all institutions of the capitalist state the central bank functions not to impartially and equally protect the interests of worker and capitalist rather to quote the communist manifesto it is an essential part of the committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie federal reserve chairman paul volcker appointed by democratic president jimmy carter in 1979 deliberately engineered an economic recession by driving the benchmark federal funds interest rate above 20 percent his highly conscious aim in the name of combating inflation was to quash a wages movement of us workers by triggering plant closures and driving up unemployment the actions of the fed under volcker set the stage for a vast upward redistribution of wealth facilitated on one hand by the trade unions suppression of the class struggle and on the other by a relentless and dizzying rise on the stock market volcker s recession together with the reagan administration s crushing of the 1981 patco air traffic controllers strike ushered in decades of mass layoffs deindustrialization and wage and benefit concessions leading labor s share of total national income to fall year after year these were also decades of financial deregulation leading to the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s the dot com bubble of 1999 2000 and worst of all the 2008 financial crisis in each of these crises the federal reserve carried out what became known as the greenspan put later the bernanke put an implicit guarantee to backstop the financial markets prompting investors to take ever greater risks in 2008 this resulted in the most sweeping and systemic financial crisis since the great depression prompting fed chairman bernanke new york fed president tim geithner and treasury secretary henry paulson the former ceo of goldman sachs to orchestrate the largest bank bailout in human history since that time the federal reserve has carried out its most accommodative monetary policy ever keeping interest rates at or near zero percent for six years it supplemented this boondoggle for the financial elite with its multi trillion dollar quantitative easing money printing program the effect can be seen in the ever more staggering wealth of the financial oligarchy which has consistently enjoyed investment returns of between 10 and 20 percent every year since the financial crisis even as the incomes of workers have stagnated or fallen american capitalist society is hooked on the toxic growth of social inequality created by the stock market bubble this in turn fosters the political framework not just for the decadent lifestyles of the financial oligarchs each of whom owns on average a half dozen mansions around the world a private jet and a super yacht but also for the broader periphery of the affluent upper middle class which provides the oligarchs with political legitimacy and support these elite social layers determine american political life from which the broad mass of working people is effectively excluded the federal reserve is a key mechanism for perpetuating this whole filthy system in which wall street rules but its services in behalf of the rich and the super rich only compound the fundamental and insoluble contradictions of capitalism plunging the system into ever deeper debt and ensuring that the next crisis will be that much more violent and explosive in this intensifying crisis the working class must assert its independent interests with the same determination and ruthlessness as evinced by the ruling class it must answer the bourgeoisie s social counterrevolution with the program of socialist revolution

most federal workers even those with rent owed and bills due would gladly forgo their paycheck as a measure of support for his 5 6 billion border wall president trump said on friday he also noted that mexico would actually be paying for the wall through a new trade agreement which at the very least raised the question of why the government had to be shut down over a funding dispute involving american tax dollars if the funding was coming from another country and then there was a plan c he said he could use emergency powers to build the wall the wall was needed for many reasons mr trump said stopping drug and human trafficking and a nonspecific reference to a torrent of terrorists and coyotes easily flowing in over the southern border they drive right in and they make a left he said but there also was sunshine amid the gloom mr trump spoke of a stunningly positive jobs report and a stock market that soared at least for a day lower gas prices one person to thank

decided to increase the import tax on all goods produced in serbia and bosnia to 100 from 10 the decision prompted serbia to completely suspend exports to kosovo as of december 31 kosovo s decision has resulted in direct damages estimated at 46 1 million euro 52 3 million for the serbian economy between november 21 and december 31 according to serbia s trade minister rasim ljajic now we can say that trade has been completely halted there were many appeals from the international community to abolish the taxes but the kosovo authorities only radicalised the situation and adopted new measures ljajic said on november 21 kosovo government decided to increase the import tax on all goods produced in serbia and bosnia to 100 from 10 set earlier that month in order to protect kosovo s sovereignty and interests the scope of the tax was expanded on december 29 to include products manufactured under international brands in serbia and bosnia kosovo s decision drew fire from the eu johannes hahn the eu enlargement commissioner said the new tariffs on imports from serbia and bosnia are unacceptable and against the principles of the regional economic area rea and central european free trade agreement cefta serbia was the biggest importer into kosovo with around 450 million euro 511 million of imports in 2017 whereas imports from bosnia amounted to around 82 million euro according to data from kosovo s statistical office kosovo considered a potential candidate for eu membership by the european commission unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and has so far has been recognised by more than half of the 193 un member states serbia and bosnia however do not recognise the independence of kosovo the former southern province of serbia populated predominantly by ethnic albanians kosovo s government decision on the new import taxes for serbian and bosnian products gave a boost to bilateral relations with albania a few days after pristina announced its decision albania s prime minister edi rama said albania and kosovo will remove all trade barriers between them in the first half of 2019 zero tariffs and zero non tariff barriers within the first half of next year between albania and kosovo rama said the two countries will advance a project for unification of customs and remove border controls within the first half of 2019 he noted adding that from january 1 kosovo will have a customs office in albania s biggest sea port of durres albania and kosovo will also work towards harmonization of legislation for all documents and certificates of products within six months implement an agreement for mutual recognition of driving licences within the first half of 2019 and scrap roaming fees rather than subside tensions between serbia and kosovo were further heightened a few weeks later when kosovo s parliament adopted three laws initiating the process of the transformation of the kosovo security force into a professional army the decision was backed by the us while nato warned that it was ill timed in a letter to serbia s president aleksandar vucic and another one to his kosovo counterpart hashim thaci us president donald trump encouraged both belgrade and pristina to seize the opportunity for reaching a deal on the normalisation of their relations it would be extremely regrettable to miss this unique opportunity for peace security and economic growth trump said he added that he is looking forward to hosting thaci and vucic at the white house to celebrate what would be a historic accord the united nations under secretary general for peacekeeping operations jean pierre lacroix too said serbia and kosovo need to find ways to re engage in the dialogue aimed at the normalisation of their relations speaking at an urgent meeting of the un security council requested by serbia vucic said that the un has to assume a greater role in the dialogue between belgrade and pristina in accordance with security council resolution 1244 we have nothing against the dialogue being under the auspices of the eu but we want the united nations to get more involved in the process vucic said for his part thaci described the decision as normal legal just if kosovo was wrong in something it was because it waited for five years for the formation of an army the decision is delayed but it is by no means wrong we were late because we waited for the goodwill of those who had not shown it so far thaci said more problems for vucic at home domestic politics too was giving vucic a headache in the last days of 2018 thousands of people rallied in belgrade on december 30 for the fourth weekend in a row to protest against him and the government led by his populist conservative party sns more than 35 000 citizens protested against what they see as an increasingly autocratic rule by vucic and called for the resignation of interior minister nebojsa stefanovic and for media freedom the organiser of the rally opposition alliance for serbia led by former belgrade mayor dragan djilas said a series of protests has been held in belgrade since december 7 following the assault on borko stefanovic leader of the serbian left party the december 30 rally was organised under the one of five million slogan referring to a statement by vucic that he would not fulfil any of the protesters demands even if they were five million the protests are political but people have the right to protest as long as they are peaceful there will be no police at the protests i am ready to see what these people are dissatisfied with vucic said in an interview with tv broadcaster studio b on december 29 the alliance for serbia accuses sns and vucic of provoking the attack against stefanovic who was assaulted by a group of men on november 23 in krusevac in southern serbia and suffered injuries from being beaten with an iron rod people are in the streets because they are sick of the injustice corruption violence and extortion today in serbia we cannot fight this through institutions as they are in fact suspended vuk jeremic former foreign minister and leader of the people s party a member of alliance for serbia said in a video file posted on the website of bulgarian private tv broadcaster btv on december 30 the alliance for serbia was established before the local elections in belgrade held in march

indices on the bucharest stock exchange hitting a six month low bulgaria extends bidding deadline in sofia airport concession tender while romania and serbia were rattled by political turbulence politicians in neighbouring bulgaria had a calm christmas and new year perhaps he most interesting event in the country in the first week of january was the transport ministry s decision to again

company grappling with increasing chinese consumer anxiety other brand names such as ford motor co and jeweler tiffany co already have reported abrupt declines in sales to chinese buyers china still

from its reliance on exports and investment china s third quarter economic growth of 6 5 percent was stronger than most other major economies but the country s lowest since the 2008 global crisis the

2018 likely will be remembered for achieving solid economic growth a highly volatile stock market and an emerging trade war with china in 2019 we can expect slower growth continued volatility and china to resist significant market based reforms these and other factors combined with an environment of political uncertainty could create greater risks the u s economy is estimated to have grown by 3 percent in 2018 this rate is based on various components including strong retail and construction sectors and a real estate market that has slowed due to a housing shortage rising mortgage rates and high home prices which have kept some buyers on the curb and consumer spending which represents 70 percent of u s output is reflected in relatively strong but slightly decreasing consumer confidence says the conference board a u s think tank the labor market is another issue that has real impact the exceptionally low unemployment rate has been good for workers but it has contributed to a labor and skills deficit that s not good for businesses struggling to find them consequently there are more than 7 million non farm job openings that have not been filled according to the bureau of labor statistics many industries including manufacturing construction and trucking are experiencing the largest labor shortages in decades if companies can t find the employees and skills they need they can t grow resulting in downward pressure on economic growth but one of the biggest factors that will impact the u s economy in 2019 is international trade although the changes are minimal and likely to lead to higher priced automobiles the united states mexico canada agreement known as usmca if passed by congress essentially resulting in a modified nafta will help to reduce uncertainty and market volatility and the likelihood that the u s and european union can reach a favorable trade agreement in 2019 will be another step in the right direction but trying to get china to comply with all the demands made by president trump will be unlikely by march 1 the end of the 90 day trade truce agreed to by trump and chinese president xi at the g20 meeting in buenos aires on dec 1 and here s why for decades china has been subsidizing its state owned enterprises thereby giving them an unfair competitive advantage pressuring u s companies to hand over technology in exchange for market access and placing market restrictions on u s companies in addition enforcement of chinese intellectual property protection laws have been weak resulting in lost profits for american firms to adequately address many of these concerns as well as achieve higher levels of sustainable economic growth china needs to press ahead with many market based economic reforms it agreed to implement when it joined the world trade organization in december 2001 but the speed at which this might occur if at all could have positive or negative consequences for example beijing should eliminate subsidies from its 100 000 state owned enterprises many of which underperform and put a drag on its economy but to do so too quickly could cause unemployment and social unrest to rise something feared by the ruling communist party on the other hand reforms initiated slowly that in the long run would alleviate trade tensions may not satisfy the white house timetable how trump perceives china s offer in march and presents it to his base will determine if it is a win for the administration or a reason to ratchet up the trade war that could turn into a cold war and the latter would generate greater uncertainty and volatility the enemy of prosperity in turn american investors and consumers would be inclined to spend less putting downward pressure on u s economic growth the federal reserve and the wall street journal s economic forecasting survey predict the u s growth rate will decline to 2 3 percent in 2019 this is based on metrics we can see and analyze but it s the direction of u s china trade and relations political uncertainty volatility in the stock market or a combination of factors that could create new risks affecting the economy as a result 2019 will require american consumers households businesses and investors to operate very cautiously
loonie one of the big losers of 2018 remains expensive experts say it was a rough ride for the loonie in 2018 the canadian dollar fell nearly eight per cent against its u s counterpart last year with much of its slide worsening in the fourth quarter plunging almost six per cent since october in fact the loonie was the second worst performing major currency in the world against the u s dollar in the last quarter just behind another commodity currency the norwegian krone according to cibc advertisement advertisement a combination of falling oil prices trade tensions higher interest rates in the u s and a stronger u s dollar have weighed on the canadian dollar while the loonie has started 2019 on the upside rising more than one per cent to around 74 cents us analysts say it s difficult to predict if things will turn around for the currency this year loonie needs to weaken bipan rai head of north american foreign exchange strategy at cibc capital markets thinks the loonie needs to weaken further in the long term in order to make non energy exports like manufacturing more competitive the non energy trade balance is still in the red with an uncertain consumption and investment outlook the canadian dollar needs to cheapen to bolster competitiveness going forward said rai in a note this week jonathan hayward the canadian press he added that canada much like the u s is heavily dependent on external funding from overseas investors for its current account deficit advertisement advertisement ongoing liquidity withdrawal leaves canada vulnerable and implies that the canadian dollar will need to weaken rai said the latest data from statistics canada shows that foreign investment in canadian securities fell to 4 billion in october down from 7 8 billion in september at the same time canadians were also moving more money overseas investment in foreign securities increased to 14 9 billion in the same period the largest investment since january 2018 loonie overvalued cibc s sentiments were echoed by swiss bank ubs in december when it called the loonie overvalued in its global currency forecasts report for 2019 advertisement advertisement the canadian dollar still stands out as being one of the more overvalued currencies in the g10 space the bank said canada s external balance remains negative and would require foreign exchange depreciation to bring it back to a more sustainable level meanwhile the bounce that the loonie has seen this week could be short lived according to shaun osborne chief foreign exchange strategist at scotiabank the week so far albeit truncated by the holidays looks potentially positive for the canadian dollar osborne said in a note seasonal trends usually run the other way u s dollar positive with january delivering the best monthly returns on average for the u s dollar over the past 20 years so some caution is warranted perhaps still but overall a lot of bad news may already be in the loonie s price according to mazen issa senior foreign exchange strategist at td securities advertisement advertisement there are notable risks that are likely to prevent it from achieving any meaningful escape velocity to the upside namely trade woes and decelerating domestic economic growth in part exacerbated by low oil prices issa said he expects the loonie to remain around 77 cents us for much of this year

rep alexandria ocasio cortez is ready to tax the rich to make her green new deal a reality people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes the recently elected new york democrat told tv show 60 minutes in an interview set to air sunday speaking of prior decades taxation rates in the country ocasio cortez added once you get to the tippy tops on your 10 millionth dollar sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent 60 minutes sunday alexandria ocasio cortez suggests taxes as high as 70 on the wealthiest to pay for a green new deal if that s what radical means call me a radical aoc tells andersoncooper pic twitter com fcw2ytdesd steven portnoy stevenportnoy january 4 2019 it shouldn t be a surprise that the avowed democratic socialist went with the predictable tax the rich formula in order to pay for a massive government program to combat climate change but it would hardly be good news for most americans if ocasio cortez got her way in fact such a scheme would mean that her constituents in new york city would pay a max income tax rate of 82 6 percent as americans for tax reform was quick to point out perhaps new yorkers deserve what they voted for but does the country interest in the green new deal while democratic house leadership has so far balked at the green new deal it enjoys strong support from over 40 members of congress per the daily caller a poll released in december also shows americans might be more inclined than you d think to support the plan the poll from the yale program on climate change communication and the george mason university center for climate change communication showed that 8 out of 10 americans hadn t heard about it but when asked if they would support it albeit with a very favorable description of the deal that didn t discuss higher taxes for instance 81 percent of registered voters said they would back it however polls tend to change quickly when people learn about how much policies cost them and the details of the green new deal demonstrate that it s about more than just a higher tax on a tiny number of rich people a radical agenda in fact the tax hikes on the rich would be one of the least radical parts of the agenda it s no exaggeration to say that if implemented the green new deal would upend our way of life and destroy the liberty and prosperity that americans of all backgrounds currently enjoy among its goals are meeting 100 percent of national power demand through renewable sources retrofitting every residential and industrial building for state of the art energy efficiency comfort and safety and eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing agricultural and other industries those changes are going to come with real costs according to an editorial for investor s business daily moving the economy away from fossil fuels to 100 percent renewable energy will come at a cost of about 5 2 trillion over 20 years so much for america s newfound energy renaissance that has in large part come through innovative new oil drilling techniques energy status quo couldn t change this fast even if we re willing to shoulder the costs it s well impossible to achieve producing 100 percent of electricity from renewable sources is a practical impossibility in the near future stated a report issued by the senate republican policy committee in december the report which looked at the green new deal continued scientists doubt it would be achievable by 2050 let alone 2029 the deadline democrats would set such a massive overhaul in power generation would require the closure and replacement of about 83 percent of u s electricity generation including all coal natural gas and nuclear plants today renewable electricity mainly wind solar and hydroelectric provides only 17 percent of american electricity make no mistake while progressives have long been focused on green extremist policies the green new deal proposals are significantly more radical than other environmentalist ideas like carbon taxes and subsidies for green industries foregoing the sticks and carrots approach to addressing climate change this deal would instead rely on the ruthless bludgeoning of private industry and citizens through the levers of the state in fact the plan outright dismisses attempts to incentivize the private sector toward greener policies as simply inadequate to transition to a fully greenhouse gas neutral economy as quickly as needed instead the plan calls for direct government intervention to be its prime driver and in a mere 10 years no less a trojan horse of liberal goodies but that s not all there s more the green new deal doesn t just include environmentalist proposals it also includes a grab bag of other left wing goodies to mitigate deeply entrenched racial regional and gender based inequalities in income and wealth including without limitation ensuring that federal and other investment will be equitably distributed to historically impoverished low income deindustrialized or other marginalized communities in such a way that builds wealth and ownership at the community level among the liberal wish list items included the green new deal contains a proposal for universal health care and a basic minimum income program to make up for all the jobs lost in the process of transitioning to a fully green economy of course this will all come with an immense cost citing an analysis by the mercatus center bob moffit a health care expert at the heritage foundation wrote that the medicare for all legislation proposed by sen bernie sanders i vt would cost 32 6 trillion over 10 years a universal minimum income or basic income plan would also likely cost trillions of dollars a year the entire federal budget in 2018 was 4 trillion the green new deal would require the u s to massively expand this already bloated budget that is burying us in debt how do green new deal proponents propose to pay for this extreme growth in government n the same ways that we paid for the 2008 bank bailout and extended quantitative easing programs the same ways we paid for world war ii and many other wars the plan says the federal reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments new public banks can be created as in wwii to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes can be employed in other words by massively hiking taxes and then borrowing and ultimately printing money then it would use public banks run by unaccountable bureaucrats to carry the whole thing out that s not very democratic but it is socialistic an american version of a soviet style five year plan focused on command and control economic solutions that have proven to fail the world over as justin haskins executive editor at the heartland institute wrote for the washington examiner make no mistake about it this is one of the most dangerous and extreme proposals offered in modern u s history it s the sort of thing you d see in the soviet union not the united states the stakes just got higher if there is one positive thing the green new deal does it s that it brings to light the fact that much of the environmentalist agenda is just a thinly veiled vehicle for implementing far left socialism given the fact that nearly half of millennials say they d rather live under socialism or communism than capitalism according to a 2017 poll conducted by the victims of communism we shouldn t ignore the fact that these ideas didn t die at the end of the cold war they ve been repackaged by young hip millennials like ocasio cortez who can deceive a generation mostly detached from history into believing that the failed flim flam sauce of socialism can somehow work this time around despite overwhelming evidence of failure and suffering the american left is now more openly embracing socialism a worrying and disturbing trend that needs to be countered it s no longer just sanders waging this crusade in congress it is a growing cohort of younger even more extreme members who are attempting to revive ideas that should have been left in the ash heap of history as sanders himself recently noted in a cnn interview his 2016 campaign helped make certain positions mainstream that were previously considered extreme and fringe whatever one thinks about ocasio cortez it s undeniable that she connects with a large and growing subset of voters her everywoman persona and ability to seem truly genuine is making her a potent voice on the left the instagram cooking advice and dance routines may be charming and relatable especially to millennials but attention to these trivial matters masks the radicalism and bankruptcy of her views socialism is not the cure for what ails america and it hardly takes a history lesson to figure this out the agony of a collapsing venezuela praised as an economic model for the future just a decade

president donald trump ended last year with a trade cliffhanger leaving nearly all of his major disputes on the issue unresolved and everyone guessing about if and how they will wrap up in 2019 the stakes are high economic growth slowed in the third quarter and the stock market experienced a sharp decline in the finals months of 2018 two metrics that trump has repeatedly bragged about during the first two years of his presidency the biggest challenge to a win on trade may be the sheer number of conflicts the administration faces a self imposed march deadline to agree to a deal with china that would stop the imposition of new tariffs congress needs to approve a trade deal negotiated by the trump administration to replace nafta and in the fall the administration opened up new negotiations with japan while floating the idea of starting trade talks with the united kingdom they have the capacity to be dealing with one major thing and maybe one minor thing in an intensive way says david dollar an economist at the brookings institution the fact that there are so many trade issues definitely puts pressure on the administrative bureaucracy by the far the biggest issue on everyone s radar is the long running dispute with china over everything from the country s trade deficit with the u s to its weak protections for intellectual property president trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping announced a pause in trade tensions in early december with a 90 day window to come to a comprehensive agreement that will halt further escalation including higher tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods that trump had originally planned to implement in january trump tweeted in late december that an agreement is moving along very well and if made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute but the details of a comprehensive agreement that actually settles all points of dispute are hard to imagine the trump administration s complaints are wide ranging and many of them cut to the core of chinese long term growth strategy including the country s funding of industrial programs the selection of u s trade representative robert lighthizer a china hardliner to lead the negotiations signaled a tough road ahead for a potential deal china has consistently expressed a willingness to negotiate even offering some significant concessions like reducing restrictions for u s automakers the country is unlikely to give into many of trump s demands no one is in a position to dictate to the chinese people what should or should not be done xi said in a dec 18 speech the wall street journal reported in late december that negotiators were discussing a deal that would increase u s exports and soften some chinese regulations the situation has left the business community in an awkward position observers widely agree that china has engaged in unfair and even illegal practices but many hope for a return to short term stability even if it means kicking some of thornier issues down the road with that in mind trump might work out a deal to protect intellectual property while china leaves its bigger industrial polices intact trump might even accept a deal in which china agrees to buy more u s goods and reduce the trade deficit an arrangement economists say is virtually meaningless but would at least halt escalating tariffs he is not at all encumbered in terms of declaring victory and saying we won says ron kirk the chief trade negotiator under barack obama conflicts with foreign governments lie at the heart of trump s trade disputes but he also faces significant challenges to his trade agenda at home most obviously his replacement to nafta dubbed the united states mexico canada agreement or usmca faces an uphill battle to win congressional approval the deal is more of an update than a major overall to nafta but many democrats have insisted on changes before they will approve it and may be reluctant to give trump a win trump also faces the simmering angst of many of his most ardent supporters in rural areas whose local economies have suffered as china shifts its agricultural purchases away from the u s in retaliation for tariffs on hundreds of billions of goods trump has imposed on the country that anger could worsen not just if china clamps down but also as a result of the trans pacific partnership which took effect dec 30 trump pulled the u s out of the deal before early in his presidency and now the 11 pacific countries that remain in the pact will enjoy reduced tariffs and lower barriers to entering each other s markets for some specific sectors suddenly the u s is really going to be at a disadvantage says dollar at the same time wall street types who have held their nose at many of trump s foibles because of the booming economy may turn their backs if things change economic growth slowed significantly in the third quarter and the stock market dipped in the final months of 2018 of course all of this comes against a backdrop of a presidency that always seems to be teetering on the brink of a crisis and trump has at times responded to one crisis by stoking another most notably the investigation by robert mueller into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential obstruction of justice seems to be nearing its conclusion if the results of the investigation are seriously bad for trump said asia society president kevin rudd a former prime minister of australia in a speech on u s china relations that certainly would be an x factor how such an x factor or any of the others on a seemingly endless list would play into trump s trade decision is anyone s guess

opinion hey there time traveller this article was published 04 01 2019 1919 days ago so information in it may no longer be current goodbye 2018 please don t let the screen door smack you in the rump like 2017 which was a very good year indeed for investors 2018 had investors feeling exuberant for many months trader michael capolino works on the floor of the new york stock exchange on dec 27 the last few months of 2018 were rough on the stock market richard drew associated press files then came october november and december tallying up enough losses to wipe out most of the year s gains at times we were in bear market territory depending on what market you were looking at and yet the stock market has not accurately reflected economic reality in fact many canadian and u s businesses did pretty well in 2018 if i told you earnings growth would be up 25 per cent and i asked you to tell me what the markets would do you d probably say it s been a pretty good year says kevin mccreadie ceo of agf management ltd then again investors are not spooked without reason growth has slowed though not stopped interest rates have risen substantially which hurts bond investors borrowers and generally stock markets then there s u s president donald trump almost singlehandedly dragging the world into a trade war as part of his quest to make america great again circa 1955 sprinkle in some hurtin albertans in the oilpatch again and you have a formula for market upheaval this past year has been a rough ride almost any way you care to slice it and quite a contrast to 2017 which was an almost magical year of big market gains and minimal volatility everything an investor could dream of says eric lascelles chief economist for rbc global asset management just don t expect 2019 to rekindle the market magic then again investors probably shouldn t invest entirely in gics either although we are in the later stages of the growth part in the global economic cycle which is often followed by a recession the markets and economy are in much better shape than investor sentiment indicates says karl cheong head of exchange traded funds for first trust portfolios canada when you see the numbers coming in for earnings there s a sizable and growing gap for fundamentals and stock market pricing behaviour he says there s a fear in the marketplace that we ve hit peak earnings but to me it s not really peak earnings but rather peak earnings growth employment is still very strong in the u s and not too shabby in canada either companies continue to reap large profits the concern is their growth of cash flows may not be as large this year as in past years although we won t see 25 per cent growth in that marketplace earnings growth may slow down to five to 10 per cent he says but nothing in our analysis indicates the fundamentals have us heading toward recession that doesn t mean a recession two straight quarters of negative gross domestic product growth won t occur in fact the pullback in the stock market is the result of investors fearing a coming recession they re not entirely off the mark there have been signs that it might be coming including a temporarily inverted yield curve for u s treasuries bonds in which short term borrowing became more expensive than long term borrowing but the bond market is not always right cheong says pointing to two instances in history where yield curves inverted and a recession did not follow heck given the world we live in where the unexpected is the new normal it s anyone s guess that s why many money managers are exalting the benefits of diversification in short spread out your risks as well many experts suggest skewing portfolios toward defensive strategies like holding more cash or near cash investments like gics that way you have safe money when you need it including to buy good stocks should prices fall further additionally they recommend favouring defensive sector stocks more than recent years because consumer staples utilities and financials tend to do better when investors are nervous than sectors like tech and cannabis as well canadians should be wary of the loonie and its potential to outperform the u s dollar while that would be great news for travellers to the u s a rising loonie can hurt those owning u s investments if this is a concern investors should consider currency hedging says jeff weniger asset allocation strategist with wisdomtree asset management in chicago if your base case is a rising canadian dollar you want to hedge that he says and i think for a 2019 position that likely is going to be a satisfactory play otherwise investors could see a 10 per cent gain in u s equities reduced to three per cent if the canadian dollar for example rises seven per cent vis à vis the u s dollar yet the loonie s ascent is not guaranteed its rise is dependent on oil prices increasing the u s federal reserve slowing its pace of interest rate hikes and the bank of canada boosting its frequency of interest rate increases as of today oil is still down quite a bit the fed seems likely to raise rates at least a couple more times in 2019 and the bank of canada seems less certain about hiking borrowing costs with the oilpatch struggling frankly it s difficult not to feel dread about 2019 especially when you must constantly ask what might donald trump tweet today but consider this what if 2018 was as good as 2017 might we then be even more worried about what lies ahead after all the bubble most investors fear will burst at some point would be even bigger and possibly more fragile investors need a scare every once in a while to keep them honest weniger says so maybe what we ve just been through could be the correction the markets needed to continue to grow if that s the case stocks are on sale relative to where they were three months ago find me anyone in the market who is euphoric right now cheong says adding markets of dread and anxiety are often the best time to buy stocks what s more is both canada and the u s are revving up for elections i believe investors will have a big tailwind the entire time trump is president because for him to get re elected the economy must do well mccreadie says winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement one problem with that is the president embodies the same key characteristic as the markets volatility who knows how manic he will become as investigations into his business dealings and alleged collusion with russia move toward their conclusions that s why lascelles says although investors shouldn t shun stock markets entirely they re well advised to be cautious this year make little clever bets and try to win over the long run he says a balanced approach is likely to do the least harm and the most good it s the classic all weather strategy and one that might work particularly well next year

opinion hey there time traveller this article was published 04 01 2019 1919 days ago so information in it may no longer be current goodbye 2018 please don t let the screen door smack you in the rump like 2017 which was a very good year indeed for investors 2018 had investors feeling exuberant for many months trader michael capolino works on the floor of the new york stock exchange on dec 27 the last few months of 2018 were rough on the stock market richard drew associated press files then came october november and december tallying up enough losses to wipe out most of the year s gains at times we were in bear market territory depending on what market you were looking at and yet the stock market has not accurately reflected economic reality in fact many canadian and u s businesses did pretty well in 2018 if i told you earnings growth would be up 25 per cent and i asked you to tell me what the markets would do you d probably say it s been a pretty good year says kevin mccreadie ceo of agf management ltd then again investors are not spooked without reason growth has slowed though not stopped interest rates have risen substantially which hurts bond investors borrowers and generally stock markets then there s u s president donald trump almost singlehandedly dragging the world into a trade war as part of his quest to make america great again circa 1955 sprinkle in some hurtin albertans in the oilpatch again and you have a formula for market upheaval this past year has been a rough ride almost any way you care to slice it and quite a contrast to 2017 which was an almost magical year of big market gains and minimal volatility everything an investor could dream of says eric lascelles chief economist for rbc global asset management just don t expect 2019 to rekindle the market magic then again investors probably shouldn t invest entirely in gics either although we are in the later stages of the growth part in the global economic cycle which is often followed by a recession the markets and economy are in much better shape than investor sentiment indicates says karl cheong head of exchange traded funds for first trust portfolios canada when you see the numbers coming in for earnings there s a sizable and growing gap for fundamentals and stock market pricing behaviour he says there s a fear in the marketplace that we ve hit peak earnings but to me it s not really peak earnings but rather peak earnings growth employment is still very strong in the u s and not too shabby in canada either companies continue to reap large profits the concern is their growth of cash flows may not be as large this year as in past years although we won t see 25 per cent growth in that marketplace earnings growth may slow down to five to 10 per cent he says but nothing in our analysis indicates the fundamentals have us heading toward recession that doesn t mean a recession two straight quarters of negative gross domestic product growth won t occur in fact the pullback in the stock market is the result of investors fearing a coming recession they re not entirely off the mark there have been signs that it might be coming including a temporarily inverted yield curve for u s treasuries bonds in which short term borrowing became more expensive than long term borrowing but the bond market is not always right cheong says pointing to two instances in history where yield curves inverted and a recession did not follow heck given the world we live in where the unexpected is the new normal it s anyone s guess that s why many money managers are exalting the benefits of diversification in short spread out your risks as well many experts suggest skewing portfolios toward defensive strategies like holding more cash or near cash investments like gics that way you have safe money when you need it including to buy good stocks should prices fall further additionally they recommend favouring defensive sector stocks more than recent years because consumer staples utilities and financials tend to do better when investors are nervous than sectors like tech and cannabis as well canadians should be wary of the loonie and its potential to outperform the u s dollar while that would be great news for travellers to the u s a rising loonie can hurt those owning u s investments if this is a concern investors should consider currency hedging says jeff weniger asset allocation strategist with wisdomtree asset management in chicago if your base case is a rising canadian dollar you want to hedge that he says and i think for a 2019 position that likely is going to be a satisfactory play otherwise investors could see a 10 per cent gain in u s equities reduced to three per cent if the canadian dollar for example rises seven per cent vis à vis the u s dollar yet the loonie s ascent is not guaranteed its rise is dependent on oil prices increasing the u s federal reserve slowing its pace of interest rate hikes and the bank of canada boosting its frequency of interest rate increases as of today oil is still down quite a bit the fed seems likely to raise rates at least a couple more times in 2019 and the bank of canada seems less certain about hiking borrowing costs with the oilpatch struggling frankly it s difficult not to feel dread about 2019 especially when you must constantly ask what might donald trump tweet today but consider this what if 2018 was as good as 2017 might we then be even more worried about what lies ahead after all the bubble most investors fear will burst at some point would be even bigger and possibly more fragile investors need a scare every once in a while to keep them honest weniger says so maybe what we ve just been through could be the correction the markets needed to continue to grow if that s the case stocks are on sale relative to where they were three months ago find me anyone in the market who is euphoric right now cheong says adding markets of dread and anxiety are often the best time to buy stocks what s more is both canada and the u s are revving up for elections i believe investors will have a big tailwind the entire time trump is president because for him to get re elected the economy must do well mccreadie says winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement one problem with that is the president embodies the same key characteristic as the markets volatility who knows how manic he will become as investigations into his business dealings and alleged collusion with russia move toward their conclusions that s why lascelles says although investors shouldn t shun stock markets entirely they re well advised to be cautious this year make little clever bets and try to win over the long run he says a balanced approach is likely to do the least harm and the most good it s the classic all weather strategy and one that might work particularly well next year
wikileaks founder julian assange whose courageous publication of leaked documents exposed the crimes and mass surveillance of the us and its allies is facing a new threat to expel him from ecuador s london embassy he was granted political asylum there in 2012 to protect him from being extradited to the us to face possible life imprisonment or even execution on trumped up espionage or conspiracy charges having already cut off assange s internet access and communication with the outside world last march in an effort to coerce him into leaving the embassy ecuadorian president lenín moreno has set in motion a pseudo legal inquisition to provide a cover for his government to repudiate its asylum obligations facing mounting demands from washington moreno s government has unveiled a special examination of assange s asylum and citizenship a process clearly designed to repudiate both the issue of citizenship is significant because ecuadorian law forbids extradition of citizens on january 3 former ecuadorian president rafael correa whose government granted assange asylum tweeted an image of a letter he received from ecuador s state comptroller general on december 19 notifying him of an investigation by the direction national de auditoria specifically the general objective of the audit is to determine whether the procedures for granting asylum and naturalization to julian assange were carried out in accordance with national and international law it will cover the period between january 1 2012 and september 20 2018 correa now living in belgium was asked to supply information for the inquiry but no timeline was mentioned nor any date for the end result there is no doubt however that the timing is directly connected to the escalating economic financial and political pressure on ecuador above all emanating from the us military intelligence apparatus and political establishment wikileaks tweeted correa s news the same day pointing to the link between the special examination and the moreno government s mooted resort to an imf bailout because of its deepening debts which have been fuelled by falling global oil prices and the dictates of the financial markets wikileaks reported ecuador has initiated a formal special examination of julian assange s asylum and nationality nationals cannot be extradited as it seeks a 10 billion imf bailout for which the us government demanded handing over assange and dropping environmental claims against chevron all the evidence points to the handing over to the us of assange effectively the world s number 1 political prisoner being a condition set by washington and the financial elite for the survival of moreno and his government the relentless and vindictive operation against assange is driven by the ruling capitalist class s determination to silence dissent as it faces the re emergence of working class struggles around the world squeezed by lower oil prices and punitive interest rates on its international loans moreno has admitted considering an imf bailout which would also require savage cost cutting and further attacks on working class conditions absolutely nothing is off the table he told reporters last month when asked about a potential imf agreement any such loan could trigger widespread unrest jaime carrera director of the watchdog fiscal policy observatory recently told the los angeles times that the imf was sure to set onerous conditions including likely demands that moreno cut at least 10 percent of the 450 000 strong central government workforce and end all or most of 4 billion in annual fuel subsidies for consumers those reductions will bring a lot of people out into the streets to protest carrera said confronted by this prospect moreno has been desperately seeking financing from investment banks and other countries including china he visited beijing last month to discuss re negotiating repayments on chinese loans said to total 6 5 billion like other latin american countries ecuador has been placed in a financial and political vice by the us and the international financial institutions s p global ratings has imposed junk bond status on ecuador with the country s b rating one notch below argentina s b grade these ratings mean usurious rates of interest more than 10 percent on ecuador s sovereign bonds in recent months the us media has highlighted the chinese debt as part of its propaganda offensive against beijing accusing it of debt diplomacy to financially trap poor countries but ecuador s debts also feature us finance houses and conglomerates the government owned petroamazonas oil firm which produces 80 percent of the country s oil owes 3 billion in debts to contractors including texas based oil field services firm schlumberger an imf team visited ecuador last year from june 20 to july 4 and later issued a statement insisting that while moreno had moved to embrace the requirements of the financial markets since taking office in april 2017 much harsher measures were needed among them were higher oil prices temporary tax measures cuts in capital spending and a public sector hiring freeze it was no coincidence that us vice president mike pence arrived in quito at the same time to discuss tightening ecuador s economic and military ties with washington as well as assange s fate at a press conference in the government palace ecuador s economy and finance minister richard martinez said he had spoken with pence who also met moreno about securing us support to permit multilateral organisations to generate sources of financing with favourable conditions for ecuador while pence and president donald trump have been centrally involved in ratcheting up the intense pressure on ecuador the democrats have been the most vehement repeatedly demanding that the trump administration force ecuador to hand over assange now that the democrats hold a majority in the us house of representatives this agitation is certain to escalate it forms a pivotal aspect of the drive by the democrats working closely with the military intelligence agencies to push the white house into a confrontation with russia as well as china democratic aligned corporate media outlets have made lurid and absurd allegations that wikileaks was part of a nefarious conspiracy with russian president vladimir putin to assist trump s 2016 presidential campaign this is feeding into the witch hunting investigation by special counsel robert mueller formerly a long time fbi director into alleged russian interference in the 2016 election at the centre of these accusations are leaked emails proving that the democratic national committee sought to undermine the so called democratic socialist bernie sanders and ensure that hillary clinton became the democratic party s presidential candidate they also included the texts of speeches clinton gave to corporate audiences pledging support to wall street and boasting of her role in organising the barbaric us led war on libya in 2011 significantly the new threat to assange follows the collapse of the latest smear campaign december s much headlined claim by the guardian that trump s former campaign manager paul manafort held secret talks with assange inside the ecuadorian embassy in london five weeks on as the intercept s glenn greenwald reported on january 3 the guardian s editor in chief kath viner and the chief author of the claim luke harding have refused repeated requests to respond to the exposure of the obvious falsifications and contradictions in the report the claims have been categorically refuted by manafort wikileaks and former ecuadorian embassy staff the world socialist web site and the socialist equality parties internationally are conducting a campaign in the working class and among youth to defend assange and wikileaks this is an absolutely essential issue in the fight to defend free speech against the intensifying repression and censorship of capitalist governments and corporate giants such as google and facebook aimed at silencing and isolating anti war and anti capitalist dissent as part of that struggle the sep in australia where assange remains a citizen will organise and seek the broadest support for political demonstrations in sydney on march 3 and melbourne on march 10 the rallies will demand that the australian government end its collaboration with the us led persecution of assange and immediately intervene using all its diplomatic and legal powers to insist that the british government allow the wikileaks publisher to leave the ecuadorian embassy and unconditionally return to australia if he chooses to do so with a guarantee against extradition to the us

reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them 1 growing pessimism if you wanted evidence that the u s economy could be rolling over the surprise miss on the institute for supply management s closely watched manufacturing index was it wall street and treasury yields slumped after the ism index turned in its largest drop since the financial crisis in 2008 and investors now bet that the fed is more likely to cut rates this year than raise them but manufacturing isn t the big weight in the u s economy it used to be services now account for roughly 80 percent of economic activity and investors will be watching closely on monday to see if ism s barometer of that key sector delivers solace or more pain it is expected to dip modestly to a reading of 59 7 from 60 7 in november a reading above 50 indicates activity is growing but the risk is that it turns in a downside surprise like the manufacturing index 2 flash crash with the brewing china u s trade war biting into global growth already and liquidity tightening around the world 2019 was always going to be a stressful year but nobody expected it to start with a currency market flash crash that briefly pushed dollar yen below 105 00 the move was attributed to automatic sell triggers in thin markets but it would have fully reversed by now if investors saw no fundamental justification to it poor manufacturing surveys in asia europe and the united states and a sales warning from apple might go a long way in explaining the move the yen s strength is a red flag for world markets but a massive domestic problem as well it hurts japanese exports and the bank of japan which only months ago looked keen to normalize policy may see it as a risk to its decades long efforts to create inflation indeed on their first day back to work boj governor haruhiko kuroda echoed ecb chief mario draghi s whatever it takes comment and top fx diplomat masatsugu asakawa reminded fx traders of past g7 and g20 coordination on intervention such reminders may get louder in the coming days and weeks 3 back to school 5 day rule there s no denying it it s been a rocky start to the year for world markets just how rocky the ride is for the rest of 2019 remains to be seen of course but it might be worth keeping an eye on one of investors quirky market guidelines for clues the so called s p five day rule it s a rule often touted by ex goldman bigwig jim o neill and goes like this when the rises in the first five trading days of the year the market turns in a positive annual performance o neill puts the success rate of this rule of thumb since 1950 at more than 85 percent according to the stock trader s almanac as the s p 500 goes over the full month of january so goes the full calendar year in the last 70 years there have been 10 major errors 1966 1968 1982 2001 2003 2009 2010 2015 and of course 2018 the s p 500 usually goes up in the last 91 years the index has risen in 62 of them and fallen in 29 of them at the time of writing after only two full trading days of 2019 the index is down 2 35 percent plenty of time for a turnaround but sentiment is most definitely bearish 4 chip wreck it was a rotten week for apple after boss tim cook warned that china s economic slowdown has caught the company off guard and trade tensions between washington and beijing were starting to hurt consumer spending on smartphones in the world s 2nd largest economy cook s bombshell fueled worries that apple s relatively pricey smartphones may be falling out of favor in china where rivals such as huawei offer cheaper options apple shares nasdaq tumbled 10 percent on thursday a remarkable fall for one of the world s most valuable and liquid stocks resulting in the s p technology index s worst day since august 2011 it deepened the recent equities rout and cemented the increasingly gloomy picture for corporate earnings the early indications of which will become clearer in the upcoming earnings season that kicks off later this month analysts outlook is already pretty bleak estimated earnings growth for world technology stocks 12 months ahead is just 5 6 percent its lowest since april 2009 5 will they won t they the start of the year is normally a busy time for sovereign debt issuers especially developing nations emerging market debt has risen steadily in recent years and pay back time is approaching over 4 trillion of em debt matures by the end of 2020 of which around a third is denominated in foreign currency according to the institute of international finance but it might be different this year worries over global growth are deepening and sending tremors through world markets dampening investors appetite for riskier assets and making it harder and more expensive for em issuers to roll over debt and borrow analysts at citi expect em spreads to continue widening due to increased anxiety about the end of the economic cycle in the u s uncertainty about damage caused by the fed s tightening and a lack of clarity regarding china u s trade disputes it s shaping up to be a quieter start to the year as governments weigh their options and wait on the sidelines for an opportune moment yet some are still planning to make an appearance israel will start its investor roadshow in europe on monday

working poor and also takes the next progressive cloward piven step towards giving ss medicare to all regardless of work by removing the tax cost of reporting ss wages which invites fraud in reporting them as also noted by other authors the prebate is calculated to merely repay the poor for any ft they pay as if we all agree with that but it would actually pay them far more by assuming the poor spend more than the underlying hhs poverty guidelines and that they will pay ft on all of their purchases but they won t see some ft ers still market the old ft lie that we get a big raise no income p r taxes and ft prices would be the same as today s that just cannot be true ft is merely supposed to change the method of paying the same total tax dollars we pay today so if you get a big raise prices must go up by the same total dollar amount except for minor savings in compliance costs retail prices would rise by nearly the full 30 even the afft and an economist it engaged now admit that prices would rise substantially and perhaps the full 30 see this results in a combined fed s l 30 45 initial in your face sales tax that would spark a taxpayer revolt that would destroy our retail sales sensitive economy that s 30 ft not 23 plus 0 15 s l those rates might go up to say 60 75 at an illustrative 30 evasion avoidance rate incredibly ft assumes zero evasion zero intentional reduction in spending and zero migration from new to used goods instead of increasing the ft rates the 600 900b shortfall will more likely result in a new income tax see below ft s 30 rate is really closer to 50 ft hides another appx 20 in taxes but ft ers deceptively say the ft is fully transparent just look at your receipt and you will see all of the ft you will pay 1 12 is hidden by having fed s l govts pay ft which is likely unconstitutional ultimately they must get that money from us 2 the fed budget will rise for a ss all fed pension cola s caused by ft s 30 price increase and for b fraudulent new ss benefits invited by ft s removal of the tax cost for reporting ss wages as noted by other authors 3 ft economists have admitted that the ft is 5 short incidentally used property is advertised as exempt from ft but that may be a cruel hoax because of the practical difficulty of establishing that the buyer has met the requirements that ft was paid and that none of 3 listed credits against the ft were claimed it is a myth that irs is abolished ft s new irs i e staa may be more invasive than today s irs the buyer is liable to pay ft and receive show a receipt and so staa may audit consumers see sec 101 d also we may well have to file an annual ft summary see as also noted by cato institute see ft leaves us more vulnerable to winding up with both a new income tax and ft instead of adding 20 30 on top of the ft s already high explicit 30 rate congress would surely repeal ft s laughable sunset clause and with the 16th amendment surely still firmly in place would use the excuse of the large revenue shortfall from evasion avoidance to enact a new income tax which i believe is congress ultimate objective of stealing even more of our money to redistribute to those who will vote for them to summarize the ft rate it appears that ft required a much higher tax rate afft simply assumed away 20 30 evasion avoidance hid 12 by taxing fed s l govts reduced the rate by 5 and ignored the ft caused fed budget increases to get the rate down to 30 then a clever afft lawyer deceptively twisted the statute to make 30 superficially appear to be only 23 seniors would start to pay for ss medicare again and some would pay a 2nd 3rd tax on their earnings many middle class seniors would pay more ft than they would have paid in income tax and many would lose purchasing power because of 1 the nearly 30 price increase and 2 the higher s l federal taxes required because they must pay ft and can only get those funds from us and 3 higher federal taxes due to nearly 30 higher ss federal pension cola s and fraudulent ss benefits ft promises grand economic benefits which are all entirely unpredictable mere hype change ft employs marketing hype and hyperbole making countless undeliverable claims instead we need a flat income tax no deductions exemptions credits a 10 rate business income taxed only once on a very simple basis irs neutered 1 page filing everyone pays more

can it all really be donald trump s fault do the antics of the worst most malicious and willfully ignorant president in modern u s history serve to explain the spread of authoritarian regimes racist and anti immigrant parties and rightwing fake populism across much of the planet in some cases to be sure trump is a direct enabler the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi on orders from saudi arabia s reform ruler and jared kushner s great friend crown prince mohammed bin salman was followed by a coverup so absurd that no one â except trump â pretends to believe it even while the u s backed saudi led coalition war in yemen assumes genocidal proportions but there are widespread and chilling examples of authoritarian rule from above supported by a popular rightwing base attacking the most vulnerable groups in society the philippines president rodrigo duterte openly boasts of extrajudicial mass murders by his police forces the incoming brazilian president jair bolsonaro promises to exterminate political opposition revive torture unleash the police and military on poor communities and crush indigenous peoples resistance to development of the amazon â with the potential to turn the world s most ecologically vital rain forest into desert by mid century violent hindutva nationalism in india is encouraged by the modi government the erdogan regime in turkey has jailed journalists by the hundreds and purged the civil service and professions of hundreds of thousands of opponents real or imagined in tanzania lgbtq people are in hiding for fear of their lives these vicious attacks on democratic rights and targeted populations are not simply perpetrated by totalitarian government repression as is the case with the chinese regime s mass incarceration camps and reeducation of the uighur people but gain significant support from below the european situation is just as disturbing the polish law and justice party government attacks women s rights and purges the courts hungary s illiberal democracy strongman viktor orban and italy s so called populist coalition government build support by brutal assaults on immigrants and desperate asylum seekers how much of this behavior is enabled by trump s rhetoric over the invasion of refugees from central america the family separations and mass detentions at the u s border and his incitement against journalism as the enemy of the people vladimir putin s regime with its pre and post election relations with trump and his extended family business sends operatives abroad to poison defectors while russian journalists antiwar critics and lgbtq rights advocates at home are rubbed out with much less publicity in ukraine the baltic states and eastern europe russian and western military provocation and counter provocations are dangerously increasing feeding back as war crises generally do into the repressive and anti democratic tendencies arising in all these places causes of crisis of course asking whether trump is responsible for all this is only half serious but there are deeper substantive issues to be addressed about this reactionary pattern what are the underlying causes of the surge in rightwing pseudo populism including in u s politics â this alliance of the wealthiest and most privileged elites with an angry popular and working class base what are the counter trends and what are the prospects and responsibilities of the radical and socialist left in this turbulent period the so called rules based global order so highly praised by the wealthy classes who have prospered from it has left behind much of the population so called center right liberal and social democratic parties have pushed the elites agenda of free trade â meaning free movement of capital â financial deregulation and austerity for the poor today as that neoliberal order slowly crumbles and lurches toward the next recession or financial crisis some of those who were relatively well off see their own futures vanishing the latest example among many is general motors planned idling of five north american plants which may throw 14 000 auto workers jobs on the scrap heap threatens many thousands more and devastates affected communities many observers feel that this move is gm s ploy to scare autoworkers into dropping their demands in the 2019 contract negotiations the elites move to the right â especially in south america most dramatically shown in brazil â while workers and the poor are left to fend for themselves their response can take retrograde forms such as white u s working class support for trump but also more promising revolts against austerity as in the widespread popular support in france for the yellow vests protests see what is at stake in the yellow jacket mobilization by leon cremieux we can step back and view part of a larger pattern within europe the gap between wealthy nations like germany that benefit from the common euro currency and the less affluent especially greece that are trapped by it â and within each country the widening gap between richer and poorer regions and classes â are pulling the european union apart in britain that dynamic enabled opportunist anti muslim and barely disguised white nationalist forces to carry the brexit referendum leading to a britain eu divorce that seems to be leading somewhere between a messy deadlock and a chaotic disaster take another step back and the bigger picture emerges for the global south the whole story of the peaceful post world war ii liberal order inaugurated by the united states was always a giant lie from the congo and southern africa to the middle east southeast asia and latin america multinational corporate pillage superpower proxy wars that became genocides western backed dynasties and military dictatorships were the order of the day popular and revolutionary movements were routinely crushed now with old and new conflicts also intensified by the effects of climate change â particularly droughts and extreme weather driving masses of rural people off the land â refugees are taking their lives in their hands in desperate journeys to reach europe or the southern u s border worldwide there are now some 68 million displaced people only a harbinger of the hundreds of millions to come as more places become uninhabitable within a few decades to say nothing of the escalating climate driven disasters hitting the united states right now in the united states as in europe the anti refugee backlash is sickening as well as frightening if a few thousand families today fleeing drug gangs and death squads can be labeled an invasion force threatening u s security can we even imagine what future crises might look like if the anti immigrant forces aren t defeated donald trump is not the cause of these interlocking crises â if only the diagnosis and cure were so simple â but a half deranged symptom of a global systemic disease to be sure he s making things worse in his total indifference to friendly regimes repression racism and general brutality his boasts about bringing jobs back to america look hollow enough in the wake of gm s announcement â and his tariff man tweets and absurd tariffs on canadian and european steel and aluminum definitely exacerbated the december stock market plunge â but trump at his worst can t be as destructive as neoliberal capitalism itself more important the trump regime and the assorted rightwing pseudo populists in europe have no solutions to the crises that have propelled them into prominence they offer only false promises that speak effectively to the greed of the super rich and to the fears of people whose livelihoods families and communities are being devastated but offer no way out the results of the u s midterm elections and the prospects of a revived left are partly a response to that reality u s midterms and socialist revival the democrats new majority in the house of representatives should be seen we think as a re balancing rather than a breakthrough â although significant in that they needed a big voter margin to overcome republican gerrymandering and racist voter suppression in key states widespread revulsion against trump was obviously a huge factor as well as high voter turnout among african americans women and the millennial generation had the 2016 election gone the other way we suspect that two years of a hillary clinton presidency would have resulted in a republican red wave taking a stranglehold on both houses of congress voter suppression is now a front and center issue including the up front republican theft of the race for governor in georgia the republican party today is a far right dominated outfit relying on extreme gerrymandering and vote suppression â along with the absurdity of the electoral college â to hold on to power nationally in states like michigan and wisconsin with incoming democratic administrations gerrymandered republican legislatures in lame duck sessions are enacting the most outrageous anti democratic measures to cripple unions and hamstring the new governors nationally the emergence of a larger progressive caucus including some self declared democratic socialists and the higher proportion of women elected to the next congress has to be balanced against other realities of the incoming democratic majority as matt karp incisively notes in jacobin the strategy that the clinton campaign foolishly pursued in 2016 â ignoring the working class in favor of that somewhat stereotyped college educated suburban women vote â worked for the democrats this time in some contested districts but what flipped one way in 2018 could readily flip back next time we won t predict here what the democrats will do with their restored powers or whether and when the republican leadership and wall street might finally turn against trump we see two main takeaways from these midterms first even if a large minority of u s voters are attracted to elements of rightwing authoritarianism and fake populism the majority didn t vote for it in 2016 and they re repelled by it now including trump s ugly anti immigrant hysteria mutual admiration with the world s sordid dictators and obscene personal family and regime corruption second however the growth of the democratic party s progressive wing does not change the party s character as an organ and defender of capital and the neoliberal order nor does it pose a fundamental challenge to its pro corporate leadership the white working class vote for the republicans has actually slipped but the democratic leadership has almost nothing to say to them beyond promises to defend health care challenges for the left whatever agenda the democrats adopt â whether it s a halfway positive legislative program or instead the diversionary empty noise about impeachment â real initiative and a genuine left and socialist revival depends as always upon social movements the defense of immigrants and refugees of women s rights and reproductive freedom of black communities against rampant police violence continue to be priorities even if the balance of official political power has become a bit less reactionary the looming realities of catastrophic climate change must also be faced directly without a clear alternative people are pushed toward either despair or denial at the very time when action is most urgently required the debacle of french president macron s gas tax increase shows exactly what not to do by imposing the costs on those who can t afford it but there are new challenges and openings think for example about the possibility of a genuinely progressive response to gm s plant closures if threats of strikes and factory occupations force some corporate concessions that would be welcome but what s needed is a vision that leaps much further ahead â a fight for converting the plants and using workers skills to production of desperately needed infrastructure for mass transit and 100 renewable energy within the next crucial decade that kind of transformation requires political and legislative action to be sure â but above all social mobilization workers control and democratic planning of production and collective societal concern for the future of threatened working people and their communities and it s not only auto but agriculture and communications and health care and education and so much more that require equally fundamental reorganization and not only within national borders but globally that s the vision for a real socialist revival â and it s the key to overcoming the appeal of capitalist reaction and fake populism with its assorted lies and false promises january february 2019 atc 198
the brussels eurocrats should know better ahead of the tenth anniversary of the euro born at the start of 1999 the european commission celebrated the single currency s resounding success the monetary union was an achievement of strategic importance for the world at large by making europe a pole of macroeconomic stability the ensuing euro crisis brutally exposed the hollowness of these claims as the currency bloc nearly fell apart as well as weakening the global economy undaunted a decade later as the 20th anniversary approached jean claude juncker set out the goal of strengthening the international role of the euro as part of a broader mission to increase the european union s heft in the world in his final state of the union speech last autumn the commission s president declared that the euro must become the face and the instrument of a new more sovereign europe whether this vaulting ambition for the euro is that desirable is open to question as long ago as the 1960s france took issue with the exorbitant privilege of the united states owing to the dollar s role in underpinning the international monetary system in the era of floating exchange rates since the early 1970s the main benefit for the us is lower borrowing costs thanks to foreign purchases of american safe assets yet that tends to keep the dollar stronger than would otherwise be the case if the euro were genuinely to rival the dollar eurozone businesses would have to cope with a stronger currency rather than the weak one that has propped them up over the past few years thanks to the european central bank s ultra loose policies whatever its pros and cons juncker s exalted vision won t happen at first sight the euro might appear to merit a more influential role europe s monetary union has after all stuck together expanding from an initial membership of 11 countries in january 1999 to the current rollcall of 19 the euro area has managed a continuing if uneven recovery since the double dip recession between mid 2011 and early 2013 growing particularly fast in 2017 at market exchange rates it is second only to the us in the size of its economy though china will soon push it into third place the euro is widely used beyond the confines of the currency club such as in montenegro while countries like denmark peg their currencies to it the euro is undoubtedly the world s second most important currency but it is a distant second to the dollar the status of a currency shows up above all in its portion of foreign exchange reserves held by central banks the euro s share over the past 20 years reveals a dismal story of dashed hopes according to the most recent figures from the imf which are for the end of the third quarter of 2018 the single currency makes up 20 per cent of global reserves that s little higher than its 18 per cent share in early 1999 after reserves held predominantly in the form of deutsche marks had been converted into euros the inadequacy of a currency that lacks a state was laid bare in the turmoil of the euro crisis furthermore the euro s current share marks a step backward since a high almost a decade ago when it had risen to 28 per cent at the end of the third quarter of 2009 that contrasts with the dollar s current share of 62 per cent the same as when the euro reached its peak and only a little lower than its 65 per cent share at the end of 1997 a year before the launch of the euro other indicators paint a similar picture a new composite index published last june by the european central bank which covers the euro s share not just in global foreign exchange reserves but in international bonds cross border loans and deposits and foreign exchange settlements showed that the euro has gone back to square one in its international standing the dollar s continuing preeminence is unsurprising from a historical perspective once established a dominant international currency is hard to dislodge sterling clung on into the 20th century even though britain s economic power had long dwindled similarly the dollar has remained on top since the second world war even though the american economy no longer stands head and shoulders above others as it did in the late 1940s there are compelling economic reasons why an incumbent international currency is hard to challenge in his speech last year juncker lamented the fact that the bulk of european energy imports were paid in dollars but for a single commodity such as oil that is traded round the world it makes sense to price it in the world s existing main currency for the oil producers who receive the revenues there is far more scope to invest in dollar based assets than in euro based ones more important the dollar is backed by a state whose debt is backed by national taxpayers by contrast the euro is a currency that lacks a corresponding state the members of the monetary union remain far from creating the complementary fiscal and political union that would permit the creation of a common public debt market supported by eurozone taxpayers the inadequacy of a currency that lacks a state was laid bare in the turmoil of the euro crisis the euro managed to pick itself up from its hospital bed after more than two years of acute crisis when mario draghi made his famous vow in july 2012 to do whatever it takes to save the single currency but even a commitment from the ecb s president could not protect the euro from the near exit of greece in 2015 such a departure would have put a permanent question mark over the supposed irrevocability of the monetary union stoking doubts about other struggling countries following suit it is easy to proclaim an ambition for the euro as a global rather than a regional currency but if europe really wants to achieve that goal then it must do the difficult things starting with further substantive steps to strengthen the institutions underpinning the still fragile monetary union beyond that lies the far trickier agenda of much deeper fiscal and political integration this currently appears unfeasible as the pull of the nation state reasserts itself and populist leaders such as italy s matteo salvini make the running yet unless it can be achieved the ambition to enhance the clout of the euro will be empty rhetoric

to square recession worries with the strongest job growth we ve seen in years said alec young managing director of global markets research for ftse russell stocks rose even further after federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the central bank will be flexible in deciding if and when it raises interest rates he added that the fed is open to making changes in the way it shrinks its giant portfolio of bonds which affects rates on long term loans such as mortgages until recently the fed had suggested it planned to raise short term interest rates three times this year and next and powell said the fed s balance sheet was shrinking on auto pilot wall street feared that the fed might be moving too fast in raising borrowing costs said phil orlando chief equity market strategist at federated investors the fed s interest rate and bond portfolio policies were at the top of the list of things we were concerned about which is why the statement powell made today is so supportive of

file photo a trader looks at price monitors as he works on the floor at the new york stock exchange nyse in new york city new york u s january 3 2019 reuters shannon stapleton reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them 1 growing pessimism if you wanted evidence that the u s economy could be rolling over the surprise miss on the institute for supply management s closely watched manufacturing index was it wall street and treasury yields slumped after the ism index turned in its largest drop since the financial crisis in 2008 and investors now bet that the fed is more likely to cut rates this year than raise them but manufacturing isn t the big weight in the u s economy it used to be services now account for roughly 80 percent of economic activity and investors will be watching closely on monday to see if ism s barometer of that key sector delivers solace or more pain it is expected to dip modestly to a reading of 59 7 from 60 7 in november a reading above 50 indicates activity is growing but the risk is that it turns in a downside surprise like the manufacturing index graphic manufacturing ism index 2 flash crash with the brewing china u s trade war biting into global growth already and liquidity tightening around the world 2019 was always going to be a stressful year but nobody expected it to start with a currency market flash crash that briefly pushed dollar yen below 105 00 the move was attributed to automatic sell triggers in thin markets but it would have fully reversed by now if investors saw no fundamental justification to it poor manufacturing surveys in asia europe and the united states and a sales warning from apple might go a long way in explaining the move the yen s strength is a red flag for world markets but a massive domestic problem as well it hurts japanese exports and the bank of japan which only months ago looked keen to normalize policy may see it as a risk to its decades long efforts to create inflation indeed on their first day back to work boj governor haruhiko kuroda echoed ecb chief mario draghi s whatever it takes comment and top fx diplomat masatsugu asakawa reminded fx traders of past g7 and g20 coordination on intervention such reminders may get louder in the coming days and weeks graphic japanese investments in us assets 3 back to school 5 day rule there s no denying it it s been a rocky start to the year for world markets just how rocky the ride is for the rest of 2019 remains to be seen of course but it might be worth keeping an eye on one of investors quirky market guidelines for clues the so called s p five day rule it s a rule often touted by ex goldman bigwig jim o neill and goes like this when the s p 500 rises in the first five trading days of the year the market turns in a positive annual performance o neill puts the success rate of this rule of thumb since 1950 at more than 85 percent according to the stock trader s almanac as the s p 500 goes over the full month of january so goes the full calendar year in the last 70 years there have been 10 major errors 1966 1968 1982 2001 2003 2009 2010 2015 and of course 2018 the s p 500 usually goes up in the last 91 years the index has risen in 62 of them and fallen in 29 of them at the time of writing after only two full trading days of 2019 the index is down 2 35 percent plenty of time for a turnaround but sentiment is most definitely bearish graphic s p 500 5 day rule 4 chip wreck it was a rotten week for apple after boss tim cook warned that china s economic slowdown has caught the company off guard and trade tensions between washington and beijing were starting to hurt consumer spending on smartphones in the world s 2nd largest economy cook s bombshell fueled worries that apple s relatively pricey smartphones may be falling out of favor in china where rivals such as huawei offer cheaper options apple shares tumbled 10 percent on thursday a remarkable fall for one of the world s most valuable and liquid stocks resulting in the s p technology index s worst day since august 2011 it deepened the recent equities rout and cemented the increasingly gloomy picture for corporate earnings the early indications of which will become clearer in the upcoming earnings season that kicks off later this month analysts outlook is already pretty bleak estimated earnings growth for world technology stocks 12 months ahead is just 5 6 percent its lowest since april 2009 graphic world tech stocks hit

back time is approaching over 4 trillion of em debt matures by the end of 2020 of which around a third is denominated in foreign currency according to the institute of international finance but it might be different this year worries over global growth are deepening and sending tremors through world markets dampening investors appetite for riskier assets and making it harder and more expensive for em issuers to roll over debt and borrow analysts at citi expect em spreads to continue widening due to increased anxiety about the end of the economic cycle in the u s uncertainty about damage caused by the fed s tightening and a lack of clarity regarding china u s trade disputes it s shaping up to be a quieter start to the year as governments weigh their options and wait on the sidelines

stocks showed a substantial move to the upside over the course of the trading day on friday more than offsetting the sharp pullback seen in the previous session the major averages all moved significantly higher with the tech heavy nasdaq leading the way the major averages moved roughly sideways going into the close holding on to strong gains the dow surged up 746 94 points or 3 3 percent to 23 433 16 the nasdaq soared 275 35 points or 4 3 percent to 6 738 86 and the s p 500 spiked 84 05 points or 3 4 percent to 2 531 94 with the rally on the day the major averages also moved notably higher for the week while the dow jumped by 1 6 percent the nasdaq and the s p 500 shot up by 2 3 percent and 1 9 percent respectively the rebound on wall street partly reflected a positive reaction to a labor department report showing much stronger than expected job growth in the month of december the labor department said non farm payroll employment soared by 312 000 jobs in december after climbing by an upwardly revised 176 000 jobs in november economists had expected employment to increase by about 177 000 jobs compared to the addition of 155 000 jobs originally reported for the previous month paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics suggested the substantial job growth in december would seem to make a mockery of market fears of an impending recession admittedly employment is a coincident indicator whereas the ism manufacturing index which we learned yesterday fell sharply in december is a leading indicator ashworth said he added but even allowing for that distinction this employment report suggests the u s still has considerable forward momentum the report also said the unemployment rate rose to 3 9 percent in december from 3 7 percent in november while economists had expected the unemployment rate to come in unchanged however the unexpected uptick by the unemployment rate came as the labor force jumped by 419 000 people compared to a much more modest 142 000 person increase in the household survey measure of employment the labor department said average hourly employee earnings payrolls climbed by 11 cents to 27 48 in december reflecting a 3 2 percent increase compared to the same month a year ago the annual rate of growth in average hourly employee earnings in december accelerated from the 3 1 percent increase seen in november reaching its highest level since april of 2009 even as the jobs data offset recent concerns about the u s economy federal reserve chairman jerome powell noted the central bank will be patient with monetary policy as it watches the economy evolve powell stressed that monetary policy is not on a preset path after the fed raised interest rates four times in 2018 and forecast two rate hikes in the new year particularly with muted inflation readings that we ve seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves powell said the fed chief said the central bank is always prepared to significantly shift the stance of monetary policy if incoming economic data does not meet expectations powell s comments came as part of a joint discussion with former fed chairs janet yellen and ben bernanke at the american economic association and allied social science association annual meeting in atlanta the rally on wall street also came after china s commerce ministry said china and the u s would hold vice ministerial level trade talks in beijing next week sector news partly reflecting optimism about trade talks between the u s and china steel stocks turned in some of the market s best

with the year 2018 according to the christian calendar now out and 2019 now setting in people traditionally sum up the results of the past year even though the iranian new year of 1398 is still three months away we will stick to the russian tradition and look back on 2018 which is already history now for the islamic republic of iran the past christian year was one of the most trying in its recent history with a series of negative factors affecting the country s foreign and domestic policy the economy and national security the worst of them all was washington s withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa commonly known as the iran nuclear deal resulting in a resumption of hard hitting us sanctions and the exit of more than 100 big foreign companies which had previously been doing business with iran socio economic situation the start of 2018 in iran was marked by a series of mass scale nationwide protests demanding better living conditions for the people and putting an end to the government s policy of spending huge financial resources aimed at attaining military and political goals abroad the authorities managed to bring the situation under control but the protests though on a lesser scale continued flaring up throughout the past year the situation was further exacerbated by president donald trump s announcement in may of the us withdrawal from the iran nuclear accord and the subsequent introduction of anti iranian sanctions in august and november iran s national currency the rial plunged to record lows hitting a dismal 190 000 rials to the us dollar in early september although it later stabilized somewhat at 100 000 110 000 to the greenback the downfall led to an economic crisis according to imf estimates inflation spiked to 30 percent with iran s own central bank putting the figure at 40 percent the country s gdp slipped by more than 3 percent many enterprises shut down and unemployment reached 12 percent 18 percent among young people it should be noted that the hardest hit by the us sanctions was the iranian economy still reeling from the tough international sanctions imposed on the country between 2012 and 2015 while blaming the economic problems on the country s overdependence on oil exports the iranian president hassan rouhani also acknowledged the negative impact of the us sanctions on the living standards of ordinary iranians he still believes however that the united states will fail and the iranian government with the support of the parliament the people and the country s spiritual leader will cope with difficulties when unveiling the 2019 draft budget in parliament on december 25 president rouhani promised that in the upcoming iranian new year in march civil servants and pensioners would see their incomes grow by 20 percent and that state subsidies for the purchase of basic goods for the country s poor would reach 14 billion meanwhile russia india and china are lending a helping hand to iran with indian ports global ltd ipgl taking over in keeping with a bilateral agreement the management of iran s shahid beheshti port for up to 18 months with the possibility of a 10 year renewal the contract will facilitate the transit of goods between india and afghanistan bypassing the territory of pakistan and will significantly contribute to the region s economic growth following the french oil company total s withdrawal from iran china s cnpc company has been moving in to fill the void other countries are also offering their services in an effort to offset the negative impact of washington s sanctions on tehran domestic political situation the outgoing year saw an increase in the activity of opposition forces representing the radical anti western segment of the iranian establishment including ex president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the loser of the 2017 presidential election hard line islamist ibrahim raisi throughout the past year the opposition was working hard if not to remove hassan rouhani s liberal reformers from power than at least to target their individual representatives in summer they managed to force the resignation of the minister of economy and finance masood karbasian and the minister of labor social security and cooperatives ali rabiyi earlier the head of the central bank valiolla safe was equally dismissed replaced by abdnnacer hemmati in 2018 divisions in the country s ruling elite became increasingly visible but it would still be premature to talk about any serious crisis much hoped for by the us president donald trump in fact trump has played right into the hands of iran s radicals and conservatives because instead of undermining iran s islamic regime the sanctions have hit president rouhani and his team who are looking for a dialogue with the west with the rouhani government losing its political clout in 2018 its radical and hard line opponents have been strengthening their positions and their role in the country s domestic and foreign policy while there were no signs last year of hassan rouhani being forced out as long as he enjoys the support at least verbal of the country s spiritual leader ayatollah khamenei the president could still bend under the pressure from the opposition and change his domestic and foreign policy and not necessarily in the direction of reforms and liberalization foreign policy in 2018 iran continued its efforts to impact the situation in the middle east primarily in syria yemen iraq lebanon and afghanistan president trump s decision to withdraw the us from the 2015 nuclear deal with iran set forth a new offensive phase in tehran s foreign policy on the one hand this reflected the growing role of hardliners among those responsible for taking military and political decisions in tehran on the other the us policy towards iran has resulted in the moderates in iran including in the presidential administration and the government toughening the country s foreign policy in 2018 iran ramped up the number of short and medium range missile tests conducting seven test launches of medium range missiles five short range missile launches as well as a cruise missile launch this was a significant jump from just four medium range and a single short range missile test carried out in 2017 russian iranian relations the russian iranian political dialogue in 2018 reflected the two countries shared view on some regional and global policy issues above all the establishment of a multi polar world order strengthening the united nations role in international affairs countering new challenges and threats on syrian and iraqi settlement as well as the situation in afghanistan moscow viewed cooperation with tehran as an important condition for ensuring russia s national interests and strengthening stability in the south caucasus central asia and the middle east in 2018 russia maintained constant high level contacts with iran presidents vladimir putin and hassan rouhani have met 14 times since rouhani s election in 2013 and have on many occasions resolved important issues by telephone the russian and iranian foreign ministers met regularly in moscow and tehran during un general assembly sessions on the sidelines of other international events and also communicated by phone in its relations with tehran moscow proceeds from the assumption that cooperation with iran is important for ensuring its national interests strengthening stability in the region and elsewhere in the world that is why throughout the past year russia actively defended the iran nuclear deal which the us withdrawal threatens to unravel there is a shared view in both moscow and tehran that the breakup of the iran nuclear deal is fraught with the destabilization of the region and the whole world in 2018 moscow and tehran repeatedly reiterated their firm commitment to preserving the territorial integrity of syria and to a peaceful settlement of the syrian crisis they also voiced their concern about the continuing deterioration of the situation in afghanistan and the growing threat of terrorist attacks by local extremist forces in august as a result of efforts by russian and iranian diplomats azerbaijan iran kazakhstan russia and turkmenistan signed an agreement of a truly historic significance the convention on the legal status of the caspian sea the accord the first of this kind in centuries created real conditions that define and guarantee the signatories joint political military economic and ecological activities in the caspian russian iranian relations were an important feature of the past year the most notable being the decision to complete the creation of the 7 200 km north south transport corridor to ensure faster and cheaper shipment of goods from china and india to europe moscow and tehran agreed to simplify customs procedures remove existing barriers complicating the free flow of goods and services and improve communications in the banking sector not all problems existing in relations between russia and iran were resolved in 2018 of course russia and iran are only moving towards a strategic relationship many problems still persist in trade and economic relations with a trade turnover of just 2 billion between two major powers looking nothing but negligible the two countries are working to change this though according to a memorandum on the oil for goods program signed in 2014 russia planned to buy 5 million tons of iranian oil each year about 100 000 barrels a day and supply it to other countries in return russia would provide 45 billion worth of goods to the islamic republic tehran for its part committed to spend half of the revenue from oil sales to russia as payment for russian goods and services such as aircraft airfield and railway equipment trucks and buses pipes and construction services in iran in keeping with the program in november 2017 russia started importing limited amounts of iranian oil tehran which was then emerging from sanctions had no interest in selling more with a new round of sanctions back in place iran may now have a greater deal of interest in implementing the terms of the 2014 plan in march 2018 the russian and iranian agriculture ministries reached a preliminary agreement for the supply of russian wheat to the iranian market military technical cooperation is another promising area of mutually beneficial partnership between the two countries a russian military delegation visited tehran in late december to discuss pertinent contracts in this area russia and iran are implementing a number of large scale energy projects including the construction of the sirik thermal power station and the electrification of the garmsar inche burun railway in 2018 russia and iran continued their cooperation also in the cultural humanitarian scientific and educational fields a national competition in the persian language and literature was held in russia and the program of student and teacher exchanges between russian and iranian universities continued unabated the orthodoxy islam joint russian iranian commission on dialogue is working equally well that being said moscow and tehran still differ on certain global and regional issues however these differences can be sorted out on the basis of mutual confidence building and this is probably the main goal russia and iran will be working to achieve in the new year of 2019 first published in our partner international affairs
washington federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump and that he is prepared to be patient in deciding when to raise interest rates again both of those messages cheered stock market investors who had been worried about trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank and also the fed s seemingly inexorable march to higher rates there is no pre set path for policy powell said during an appearance at a conference of economists in atlanta with the muted inflation readings we have seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves private economists viewed powell s comments as a strong signal that the fed which in december had projected another two rate hikes in 2019 may end up deciding to pause hikes for several months with chairman powell s remarks today i would say they will do just one hike or maybe no hikes this year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics powell is definitely trying to calm the markets wall street which opened sharply higher after a report showing 312 000 jobs gained in december surged even higher during powell s appearance the dow jones industrial average finished the day up 746 points or 3 3 per cent powell called the jobs report very strong and said he was also encouraged by the rise in the labour force participation rate and gains in wages which he said for me at this time does not raise concerns about too high inflation trump has complained that the fed has pushed rates higher despite the fact that there is no evidence that inflation was getting out of control the president s attacks had become so intense that they had raised concerns that he might be considering firing powell a development which could send the market into a tailspin trump would appear to be on shaky legal ground if he tried to fire powell under the law that governs the federal reserve a president can only remove a fed chairman for cause courts in cases that involved other agencies have interpreted that language to not cover policy differences asked if he would resign if trump asked him to do so powell responded with a short no powell s willingness to be flexible on interest rates was welcome news to investors many of whom worried that fed chair risked cutting off the current economic expansion by continuing to raise interest rates despite signs the u s economy was cooling off a little on friday powell said we are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary to meet the goals of maximum employment and stable prices powell gave as an example the fact that in 2016 when janet yellen was fed chair the central bank began the year with a projection that it would raise rates four times that year but ended up raising rates only once because the economy hit a soft patch appearing on a panel with his two predecessors yellen and ben bernanke powell also said that the fed could alter its approach to trimming its huge balance sheet if it determines such a change is needed the pace of fed rate hikes and the lowering of the balance sheet which tends to put upward pressure on interest rates had both been concerns of investors in recent months the stock market has seen stomach churning declines since october a development that trump has blamed on the fed s continued rate hikes although the president s trade dispute with china as well as concerns about global economic growth also played a part in the market volatility the fed had increased the size of its balance sheet four fold to a record 4 5 trillion in an effort to push long term interest rates lower but it has been gradually reversing that stance over the past year although the balance sheet still remains above 4 trillion but some investors have worried that that process could push long term rates higher at a time when the economy was slowing powell on friday stressed that the fed was prepared to adjust the pace at which it trimmed the balance sheet if necessary to support economic growth while trump has sent out a number of tweets criticizing powell and calling the fed the biggest threat to the economy powell said that he had not received any direct pressure from the white house asked if he had had any face to face meetings with trump powell said he had not although he said previous fed leaders have had discussions from time to time with previous presidents asked if any future meeting with trump was scheduled powell said i have no news on that nothing is scheduled
