in this brief introduction to the global markets we take a look at some of the key markets you can trade and outline a few factors you should consider before making your choice currencies currencies are the world s largest and most active trading market followed by treasuries equities and commodities while foreign exchange trading has long been dominated by large global banks and institutions it has become increasingly popular with and accessible to individual investors trading currencies is a bit different to other asset classes trading in other assets involves trading in one market with profit and loss based on absolute returns i bought it went up i made money it went down i lost money currency trading is done in pairs with one currency being traded against another returns in currency markets are relative with profit and loss being measured by how one currency performs relative to another for example on a given day the us dollar usd could appreciate relative to the euro eur swiss franc chf and british pound gbp but decline relative to the japanese yen jpy canadian dollar cad and australian dollar aud as the world s reserve currency trading in us dollar related pairs is the foundation of currency trading around the world the most active pairs also known as the majors include eur usd gbp usd usd chf and usd jpy currency pairs that don t involve usd are known as cross pairs popular cross pairs include gbp eur eur jpy and aud cad pricing in currencies is based on the first currency in the pair also known as the base currency in the case of eur usd this means how much usd it would take to buy one eur when eur usd goes up it means that eur is gaining in value and when eur usd goes down it means eur is losing value or usd is gaining value â trading in resource currencies such as aud usd and usd cad is also popular as the valuation of these currencies plus those of other resource producing nations such as the new zealand dollar znd norwegian krona nok and south african rand zar tend to be influenced by commodity prices which represent a significant part of the goods traded by these countries note that cad and nok tend to be more sensitive to energy prices aud and nzd to metal and grain prices and zar to precious metal prices carry trade usd and jpy tend to be seen as more defensive currencies because of their low interest rates investors tend to borrow money at lower rates in these countries and try to earn higher returns elsewhere in what is widely known as currency carry trade in times when investors are interested in taking on risk the carry trade increases and capital flows out of usd and jpy into other currencies when fear increases and investors become more risk averse they tend to sell off their riskier assets and pay back their usd and jpy based loans â like other markets currency values tend to be based on supply and demand generally speaking traders tend to favour countries and currencies with higher interest rates political and financial stability and higher economic growth higher potential for profit from investments over countries with lower interest rates or slower growth because inflation erodes the value of paper currencies over time currencies with the potential for current or future high inflation rates tend to be shunned currencies with higher political or financial risks high deficits high national debt levels or banking system problems also tend to be marked down to reflect these issues commodities there are two main types of participants in commodities markets hedgers and speculators hedgers are those who want to lock in a price for a product that they intend to deliver or use at a future point in time for example a farmer about to plant wheat may want to lock in a price for when they deliver it in september while a baker needing wheat for june may want to lock in their price before that for planning and budgeting purposes this category tends to be dominated by industry participants commodity prices are mainly impacted by changes in supply and demand of the particular goods being traded speculators are those interested in attempting to profit from changes in prices as supply and demand conditions change and have no intention of delivering or taking delivery of physical goods most investors fall into this category â commodities tend to fall into a number of groups that share similar influences precious metals gold silver â â while most people may consider precious metals as jewellery gold and silver in particular have been used as currencies for centuries because of this precious metals tend to be viewed as a store of value and tend to attract interest during times when investors are concerned that the value of paper money particularly the us dollar may fall â energy crude oil natural gas gasoline heating oil like the weather energy prices tend to be a hot topic of conversation pretty much all of the time because they have such an impact on many people s day to day lives energy prices and demand tends to be linked to global economic growth as people tend to use more energy during good times and cut back during lean times for example businesses may operate more shifts or consumers may travel more in good times weather can have an influence on the pricing of energy commodities that are used in home heating such as natural gas and heating oil a significant part of the global energy supply particularly crude oil tends to be produced in or travel through politically unstable regions because of this political risks can impact the price of oil particularly during times when supplies may be limited although crude oil is a global market prices tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions in the united states and china the world s largest energy consumers base metals copper metals with industrial applications also tend to be sensitive to global economic activity with demand generally increasing as economies grow supply can be increased by the development of new mines and limited by strikes or other operational difficulties in recent years demand for base metals has been driven by demand from emerging economies such as china india and brazilâ that are building out infrastructure grains wheat corn soybeans â as more economies have evolved from subsistence farming to emerging industrial societies in recent decades the demand for agricultural commodities has been steadily increasing grain prices tend to be impacted more by developments on the supply side of the market developments that can have a negative impact on supply can lead to shortages and push prices up for example droughts freezes and floods on the other hand when prices rise farmers tend to plant more crops so the impact can be mitigated over longer periods of time â â other commodities there are a number of other commodities that can be traded including coffee sugar cocoa and many others differences in each market tend to be related to weather conditions in producing areas and changing demand conditions worldwide indices another type of diversification is to invest in baskets of shares across a wide variety of industry groups to gain exposure to wider business opportunities and mitigate the risk that one sector may encounter difficult times for example investors only looking at the energy sector could have problems when commodity prices fall but this risk can be lessened by also having exposure to areas that benefit from falling energy prices particularly transportation companies and anyone that consumes fuel â although sector trading has become more popular in recent years trading broad market indices is the primary means that equity investors use to increase their diversification over individual shares most indices that are tradable are based on a basket of the largest and most actively traded companies on a particular exchange or in a particular country another advantage of trading indices is that they are usually widely followed in the press so there tends to be a lot of information available about themâ some of the best known indices include europe ftse 100 uk dax germany cac 40 france ibex 35 spain omxs30 sweden ftse mib italy north america dow jones industrial average dow jones 30 s p 500 nasdaq 100 russell 2000 s p tsx 60 asia pacific hang seng hong kong nikkei 225 japan s p asx 200 australia generally speaking indices in the same region tend to perform similarly over time because the largest companies tend to have multi national operations close to each other there can be some differences between indices depending of what sectors make up the largest weightings in the basket for example the s p 500 tends to be more heavily weighted in consumer products financial services technology and health care canadian and australian indices tend to carry a higher weighting in materials and energy producers the hang seng tends to be more weighted in financials including real estate the ftse 100 on the other hand has a large weighting in banking pharmaceuticals metals and oil treasuriesâ government bonds also known as treasuries are another very active trading market giving investors the opportunity to trade off grander macroeconomic trends in various countries â most large investors such as banks and institutions tend to purchase bonds with the intention of holding them to maturity and view the interest rate on the bond as the primary return on their investment over time bond prices tend to fluctuate along with economic conditions creating opportunities for investors the compensation through interest rates that investors demand in order to purchase a bond tends to be driven by two major factors inflation and repayment risk in order to earn income over time investors need their bonds to return at least the rate of inflation in the issuing country in addition investors tend to demand a premium to cover the risk that the bond issuer may default on either the principal or interest payments since you can t throw debtors into jail any more in most countries â based on this investors tend to demand higher interest rates from countries running high rates of inflation as has been seen during the european sovereign debt crisis issues such as high government deficits or high national debt levels can increase the risk of insolvency and lead investors to demand higher interest rates to compensate them for their risks while sometimes equity investors can fall in love with their stocks and be more forgiving of failure bond investors tend to be extremely strict about the quality of their investments and are sometimes referred to as bond vigilantes because the interest rate on most bonds is fixed after issuance bond prices change over time to reflect changing interest rates suppose a ten year bond is issued at 5 0 interest and a year later new nine year bonds are being issued at 4 0 because the 5 0 bond carries a higher interest rate all else being equal investors would be willing to pay more for that bond on the other hand if investors could get 6 0 on new nine year bonds they would not be willing to pay as much for the 5 0 bond bonds tend to be issued at a price of 100 0 known as par and are expected to be redeemed for the same price at maturity if interest rates on new bonds increase the price of existing bonds tends to drop so that they trade below 100 0 or at a discount the potential for capital appreciation offsets the lower interest rate similarly if the interest rate on new bonds falls the price of existing bonds tends to rise to trade at a premium to par with the capital loss over time offsetting the higher interest rate â â understanding this inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices is key for bond traders the time to maturity is also an important factor central banks tend to use short term rates to speed up or slow down economic growth because of this the difference between short term and long term rates can fluctuate quite a bit most of the time long term rates are higher to reflect the risk of changing developments over time but sometimes short term rates can rise above long term rates particularly when central banks are trying to slow economic growth or control inflation shares most people first become familiar with the world of investing through individual shares and stock markets â companies around the world issue shares to the public for many reasons primarily to raise capital for expanding their business additional benefits for corporations of being publicly traded include generating a higher profile with potential customers and the public at large the sharing of risk among more investors reducing the company s capital costs succession planning for founders and more the sale of shares from a company s treasury to shareholders is known as the primary market â â once a company completes its initial public offering its shares then usually trade on a traditional stock exchange such as the nyse new york fse frankfurt or lse london or list on an over the counter exchange such as nasdaq new york where trades are executed directly between brokerages both of these are known as secondary markets â individuals looking to make money in the stock market usually try to do so through two ways capital gains from making a profit on a favourable price move either from the long side buy low and sell higher or short side sell high and buy back lower income can also be earned from dividends that companies pay to their shareholders out of net profits â generally speaking investors tend to bid up the prices of shares where positive things are expected to happen to a company such as improved earnings in future from increased sales or new contracts or a higher dividend or a takeover bid or other development on the other hand expectations of negative developments such as a slowdown in the business regulatory changes losing contracts and political changes can lead investors to want to sell and push down the share price â â with a buyer and seller involved in every transaction at any given time share prices tend to reflect the balance of the expectations of all market participants share prices may change as expectations change â factors which can impact market expectations can include macroeconomic factors that influence the business environment industry factors such as changing commodity prices and company specific factors such as earnings dividend changes and other business developments â one regular development that tends to influence trading is a company s earnings report the timing of these reports tends to be publicised well in advance with analysts who follow the company weighing in with their expectations many companies also publish their own expectations known as guidance how a company s results and future guidance fare relative to expectations can have a major impact on short and long term trading trends industry sectorsâ once people start trading shares they often find that they become exposed to the risks of the particular business that they are trading for example someone who trades shares of oil and gas companies may find that while energy producers in general tend to rise and fall with the price of crude oil and related commodities their return can also be influenced by how well the individual company they are trading performs on the exploration and operation fronts for example one company may have significant exploration success while another may drill a series of dry holes or have production slow down due to equipment problems â the primary means that investors use to mitigate some of the company specific risks is to trade a group of shares rather than one share in what is known as diversification one way to diversify involves trading more than one share within an industry group in the oil and gas sector for example trading a basket of shares would give you exposure to several companies exploration programmes while mitigating the risk of one company s problems it would also capture more general exposure to underlying commodity price moves there are ten major sectors in equity markets which fall into four major categories interest sensitive financial services utilities telecommunications these companies tend to have higher debt loads and because of this interest payments represent a significant part of their expense base these companies tend to outperform in times of falling interest rates and underperform when rates are rising quickly defensives consumer staples and health care companies in these areas tend to have fairly stable and predictable revenue and earnings streams they tend to produce or sell goods that people use day to day regardless of economic conditions such as personal care products groceries and pharmaceuticals they tend to outperform the market during recessions and underperform in stronger economic times economically sensitive consumer discretionary and industrials these areas tend to do very well in times of prosperity and poorly during recessions as they represent goods and services that can be sacrificed or substituted during tough times some examples within these groups include auto makers clothing stores business services and airlines â learn more about investing in airline stocks capital spending sensitive energy materials and technology growth for companies in these groups tends to come from large scale projects that can take time to implement because of this they can run a little behind the economic cycle because companies usually wait for confirmation that the economy has turned higher before committing to large scale projects and after a top tend to complete projects that are underway before cutting budgets â note that for technology this mainly applies to companies which sell hardware software and services to business customers there are an increasing number of technology companies that sell primarily to consumers and would potentially fall into the economically sensitive group which markets should i trade deciding which markets to trade can seem like a complicated process but there are a few factors that can simplify the decision trading what is familiar most investors start out trading the shares of companies they are familiar with or are located in the same country before branching out internationally or trading different asset classes trading similar asset classesâ once you have gained some comfort trading in one area you may want to expand into related areas for example expanding trading from shares to indices or from resource shares to related commodities small picture versus big picture investors more interested in taking advantage of broad national or global trends may find currencies treasuries or indices more appealing on the other hand those interested in doing some digging and finding unnoticed opportunities may find investing in shares more interesting â time zones which markets are active during the time of day that you plan to trade may also influence your decision if you plan to trade during your business day markets in your region may offer the best opportunities if you plan to trade in the morning or evening there may be more opportunities in other regions â don t forget that one of the reasons that trading in indices commodities and currencies has become more popular in recent years is that many of them are available for trading on a 24 hour basis â relationships between markets although the details of investing in different markets or asset classes may vary the underlying drivers of movement tend to be the same across markets such as interest rates inflation expectations gdp growth risk factors and more as you gain comfort with some markets you may find other markets where you can apply what you have learned
overview despite better than expected chinese data and last week s investor friendly developments asia pacific equities were mixed australia led the advancing bourses with a 1 6 gain its largest for the year despite the government revising down growth and wages china taiwan and indian markets also moved higher europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is extending its advance for the fourth consecutive session despite disappointing flash pmis to reach new record highs us shares are trading to the upside and the sp 500 has a three day rally in tow benchmark 10 year yields have mostly edged lower though the australian yield tumbled 10 bp as the government is reluctant to use fiscal policy to support the economy the us 10 year yield is slightly firmer around 1 83 the dollar is trading with a heavier bias against the major currencies emerging market currencies are mixed with the turkish lira chinese yuan and mexican peso among the decliners the south african rand and russian rouble are leading the advancers with around 0 4 and 0 25 gain respectively gold and oil prices are little changed asia pacific china s november industrial production and retail sales rebounded industrial output rose 6 2 from 4 7 in october and expectations for a 5 gain retail sales rose 8 from 7 2 first many are skeptical of chinese data in general and especially if it posts gains when the economy is seen slowing second the strength is dismissed by others on ideas it was flattered by quarter end seasonal quirks and singles day however we are a bit less dismissive and see other potential signs that official efforts to stabilize the economy may be working china s infrastructure push appears to be yielding results that seems to be what the higher construction material prices like cement steel rebar and construction aggregate it is hard to untangle how much of the apparent slowdown of the chinese economy is a function of its own internal dynamics and how much is due to trade tensions in terms of a reduced volume of exports to the us there is the kernel of truth in claims that china paid for the tariffs it paid for the tariffs in terms of quantities it sold fewer goods importers paid the tariff of course but the impact on overall imported prices and inflation more broadly was minimal ironically it may be china s required purchases of us foodstuffs and other goods that may help underpin us prices going forward the devil may be in the details but in this holiday season the importance of the us china agreement is to be found in the big picture that the trade tensions have not gotten worse each seems to be determined to continue to frustrate the ambitions of the other the actual tariff relief for us businesses and consumers is minor china has long offered to step up its purchases of us goods to reduce the bilateral imbalance indeed reducing the us deficit with china will prove considerably easier than improving the overall external position with a change in us savings and investment us reports claim that the agreement includes a 200 bln increase in exports to china of which 40 50 bln will be agriculture products stretches credence in 2017 before the tariff conflict began us goods exports to china were less than 130 bln of which agriculture was about 24 bln from 2007 2017 us exports to china rose by roughly 85 compared while exports to the rest of the world by a little more than 20 australia s treasurer frydenberg slashed the projected budget surplus to a 5 bln from a 7 1 bln projection in april amid signs of weaker growth growth in the year through june 2020 was cut to 2 25 from 2 75 forecasts for wage growth were also cut the key takeaway is that the australian government does not intend to use fiscal stimulus to support the economy as others such as new zealand and japan intend monetary policy will still have to bear the burden and this will increase speculation that the reserve bank of australia may introduce an asset purchases program next year the dollar is has been confined to about a quarter of a yen below jpy109 50 where a roughly 960 mln option is struck that expires today another option for almost 800 mln is struck at jpy109 00 and also will be cut the pre weekend high was set near jpy109 70 after rejecting the 0 6940 area before the weekend and the bearish shooting star candlestick there was no follow through selling of the australian dollar today it too is little changed unable to resurface above 0 6900 and finding support near 0 6870 the offshore yuan cnh sold off ahead of the weekend and strengthened today leaving the greenback straddling cnh7 0 the onshore yuan closed firmed before the weekend and had some catch up to do today the dollar is up about 0 4 to resurface above cny7 0 it rose above the previous session s high for the first time in nine sessions europe the eurozone flash manufacturing pmi disappointed but the resilience of the service pmi may have helped the euro shrug off the news the aggregate manufacturing pmi fell to 45 9 from 46 9 economists had expected a small gain the german component fell to a new two month low 43 4 from 44 1 the french reading also fell 50 3 from 51 7 services which are seen to be a better measure of domestic demand was stronger than expected at 52 4 from 51 9 the german service pmi rose to 52 0 from 51 7 a new four month high the french reading rose to 52 4 from 52 2 the emu composite was steady at 50 6 the uk s flash pmi was disappointed but can be seen as dated given that the election results lifted the uncertainty the composite slumped to 48 5 from 49 3 as both manufacturing 47 4 vs 48 9 and service 49 0 vs 49 3 components fell the combination of the brexit resolution and the fiscal stimulus that prime minister johnson promised is expected to lift the uk economy the euro is trading quietly at the lower end of its pre weekend range have been turned back from the approach to 1 12 support was found near 1 1120 initial resistance has been encountered by 1 1150 where the 200 day moving average is found and a 1 3 bln expiring option has been struck there is another option at 1 1125 for about 930 mln euro also expires today sterling s attempt to push above 1 34 met strong selling pressure an option for about gbp810 mln placed there will expire today another option at 1 3350 for about gbp440 mln will also expire lastly an option at 1 33 for around gbp820 mln looks safe today america mexico s senate passed a revised nafta 2 0 107 1 last week it is expected to pass the us house ways and means committee on tuesday and the full house on thursday one contentious issue was the inspection of mexican labor conditions by us nationals which was rejected by mexico as an affront to its sovereignty however mexico s chief negotiator seade has formally objected to the us congressional proposal to create five new labor attaches to monitor implementation this apparently was not included in the agreement signed last week in mexico city foreign officials must be recognized by mexican authorities to perform their duties we expect a compromise will be found argentina is set to raise export taxes to raise revenue it will be raised from four pesos for a dollar to 9 there is some confusion over the impact on include agriculture products like soy which accounts for around a third of the country s exports soybeans were not specified there are some reports that suggest soy corn and wheat may return to the previous tax of 12 but because soybeans and processed soy have an 18 surcharge it is possible than an overall 30 export tax is levied the us reports the december empire state manufacturing survey and the flash pmi the treasury s international capital report tic for october will be released late in the session recall that the pmi strength contrasted with the ism weakness and the conflicting signals are still evident in the gdp trackers where the atlanta fed s model projects 2 growth here in q4 and the new york fed s model is for 0 7 canada reports its version of the tic data and november s existing home sales neither typically moves the capital markets after several attempts the cad1 3150 level which is a 61 8 retracement of the rally from late october lows is yielding to the dollar selling pressure the greenback has tested the cad1 3130 area in the european morning and leaving the intraday technical readings stretched before the start of north american activity the next target is near cad1 3100 the us dollar briefly traded below mxn19 00 before the weekend for the first time since late july it is hovering around little changed levels and meets resistance near mxn19 10 the dollar index is softer but within the pre weekend range which itself was inside the wide 96 50 97 50 range from december 12
canadian dollar tipped for gains into year end on boost to risk assets image adobe stock cad on front foot in risk on market at open of new week as u s china deal uk election and usmca aid risk assets scotiabank sees usd cad fall into year end on risk appetite seb looks for usd cad return to trump era lows next year but saxo bank sees usd cad struggling to break 1 30 level the canadian dollar was on its front foot monday as a hat trick of positive developments on the international trade front continued to lift market risk appetite although some analysts are tipping further gains into year end canada s dollar got the better of all major rivals except the swedish krona and norwegian krone monday as investors chased so called risk assets higher including the loonie which lagged other currencies in a global pushback against the u s dollar late last week after president donald trump announced a very large phase one deal to end the trade war with china president trump s declaration of a deal came hard on the heels of a landslide win for prime minister boris johnson in the uk general election and amid chatter suggesting the usmca replacement of the north american free trade agreement nafta could be successfully run the washington gauntlet this week all of which have helped at least partially dispel fears in the market over a possible crunch in the global economy trump s deal which has not yet been made public and may not be signed until the end of january has already averted one volley of tariffs that were supposed to land on china s remaining untariffed exports to the u s on sunday and is expected to lead to a reduction of existing tariffs on both sides meanwhile the uk election outcome has buried the threat of a no deal brexit at least until the end of 2020 while progress on usmca will neuter the most direct trade related threat to canada s economy above usd cad rate shown at 4 hour intervals today s dollar weakness appears to follow the relatively muted market reaction late last week to trade news usmca and china us and the tories victory in thursday s election in the uk on the surface the combination of these three would have pointed to a weaker usd through last week yet there remain risks in each of these matters that may have limited usd weakness says shaun osborne chief fx strategist at scotiabank the jpy and chf are underperforming within the g 10 space owing to the risk on tone in markets which has provided a boost to the aud nzd and cad while the mxn is unchanged owing to usmca uncertainty last week s hat trick of geopolitical headlines has quelled fears about another damaging blow being dealt to the global economy by more u s tariffs while the prospect of some existing tariffs being rolled back has gotten markets hoping the pact might prompt a small global economic rebound in the months ahead that deflated the u s dollar japanese yen and swiss franc while lifting so called risk currencies like the australian canadian and new zealand dollars as investors bet on brighter days ahead for the global economy which has been wounded by the 18 month long tariff fight between the u s and china recovering risk appetite could weigh on the usd cad rate into year end scotiabank s osborne says while analysts at nordic lender seb said monday that they re looking for the exchange rate to continue falling once into 2020 above usd cad rate shown at daily intervals the cad will continue to outperform the usd in 2020 part of the story is expectations of a generally weaker usd which usually feed into a move lower in usd cad as well but this is far from the only reason the canadian economy is doing well with inflation close to the target unemployment rate near historical lows and accelerating wage growth says richard falkenhall a senior currency strategist at seb the cad is also positively correlated with improved risk appetite and in a main scenario where the global manufacturing sector recovers in 2020 this will be an advantage against the usd seb says the gap between u s and canadian interest rates combined with the current level of oil prices suggests the usd cad rate should be trading closer to 1 22 however the bank forecasts the exchange rate will fall only as far as 1 25 next year because the bank of canada boc is expected to cut interest rates which will have an adverse impact on the value of the canadian currency scotiabank forecasts a usd cad rate decline to 1 30 by the end of 2019 followed by a steady fall to 1 25 next year and as far as the very short term outlook goes the bank s technical analysts say that losses could accelerate in the coming days taking the exchange rate down to its late october low around 1 3042 however and as much as there are plenty of voices out there calling for a higher canadian dollar some see the loonie nearing the end of its road the loonie is standing out on the strong side as the usmca trade deal nearing passage looks to see canada avoiding any further negative trade focus but to get usdcad down through 1 3000 we need a weaker usd and cad won t be a performer on any weaker us economic performance says john hardy chief fx strategist at saxo bank above usd cad rate shown at weekly intervals
summary amid the widespread attention the kremlin s recent inroads in africa have attracted there has been surprisingly little discussion of south africa a country which for nearly a decade unquestionably represented russia s biggest foreign policy success story on the continent as relations soared during the ill starred presidency of jacob zuma 2009 2018 the kremlin sought to wrest a geopolitically significant state out of the west s orbit and to create a partnership that could serve as a springboard for expanded influence elsewhere in africa moscow s strategy was multifaceted capitalizing on well established close ties with zuma a former african national congress senior intelligence official with extensive soviet bloc connections russian president vladimir putin and other senior officials pursued a series of initiatives such as the inclusion of south africa in the bric brazil russia india and china grouping and the launch of ambitious forms of cooperation between state backed energy interests primarily in the nuclear sector yet relations were undermined by the kremlin s propensity to overreach to lean too heavily on the legacy of cold war era relationships forged with leaders of national liberation movements and to take advantage of cultures of corruption the controversy arising from a massive 76 billion nuclear power plant construction deal triggered strong pushback and legal challenges from south africa s institutional checks and balances civil society groups and independent media key parts of the russian national security establishment view civil nuclear power exports as an important tool for projecting influence overseas while creating revenue streams for sustaining intellectual and technical capabilities and vital programs inside russia itself yet such cooperation is often a two edged sword on the one hand costly projects such as the one pushed by zuma typically make little economic sense for the purchasing country spurring uncomfortable questions about who stands to benefit on the other hand heavily subsidized projects pursued mainly for geopolitical reasons risk saddling russia s nuclear power monopoly rosatom with burdens it can ill afford ongoing investigations of high level corruption during the period of so called state capture under zuma shed remarkable light on how the kremlin operates in africa and other parts of the world in retrospect the sustainability of moscow s embrace of south africa was highly questionable due to its paltry tool kit russian involvement in the south african economy is miniscule compared to that of other trading partners such as the eu china the united states india and the uk accounting for a mere 0 4 percent of south africa s foreign trade while the soviet union was an important patron during the anti apartheid struggle modern day russia offers little in the way of practical assistance for helping south africa deal with its deep set economic and societal challenges acknowledgments this publication is based on research supported by the united states european command with additional support from c5 capital the views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the official polices either express or implied of the u s government introduction over the past eighteen months the kremlin s gains in africa have attracted widespread attention curiously south africa seldom features in these accounts yet for nearly a decade it was one of russia s biggest foreign policy success stories why are russia s recent inroads in south africa and the dramatic reversals that followed being overlooked and what do they reveal about the effectiveness of moscow s broader strategy and overall tool kit on the continent the kremlin often takes advantage of cultures of corruption and to a certain extent its efforts in south africa fit this broader pattern the high water mark for russia south africa relations occurred during jacob zuma s presidency 2009 2018 which was marred by a series of corruption scandals commonly described by south africans as the period of state capture yet russian engagement with south africa during the zuma era was more deeply rooted it relied on a web of relationships at the highest levels of both governments the promotion of multi billion dollar projects involving state owned companies particularly in the energy sector and the leveraging of cold war era ties forged during south africa s period of national liberation in the end much of what went wrong for russia was a testament to south africa s remarkably robust system of institutional checks and balances zuma s excesses which led to his resignation under pressure in february 2018 generated a strong pushback from various quarters south africa s competitive political system civil society judiciary and news media served as dogged champions of accountability and transparency south africans from vantage points inside and outside of government closely scrutinized russian activities meticulously documented them and launched a series of political and legal challenges in response their ability to challenge a controversial head of state stands as a powerful example for policymakers elsewhere on the continent and in other parts of the world who are contending with russian malign activities as carnegie s paul stronski has written russia is decidedly late to the party in africa 1 its gains have been mostly in pariah states ostracized by the international community such as zimbabwe and strategically less important ones like the central african republic from which other major powers have largely disengaged moscow has devoted relatively few resources to expanding its influence in africa compared to other major external actors such as the european union eu the united states and china but it has repeatedly demonstrated a knack for spreading narratives about moscow s resurgence as a leading power and fostering the impression that its accomplishments on the continent have come at the expense of the united states and its allies andrew s weiss weiss is the james family chair and vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment where he oversees research on russia and eurasia more andrewsweiss yet it is quite striking how time and again the russian leadership has opted for imagery over substance and a consistent reluctance to tackle any of the issues atop the agendas of many african countries issues like economic development quality of governance the rule of law communal violence conflict resolution and public health concerns including infectious diseases the kremlin s modest ability to project military power and low appetite for risk in africa have meant that its security activities have been mostly parceled out to a rogues gallery of shadowy mercenaries and contractors such as the wagner group 2 moscow s attempt to secure a foothold in south africa was somewhat of a departure from its usual approach to the continent in recent years russian inroads in africa have been largely a product of opportunism rather than strategic vision unlike some other african states with a markedly increased russian presence in recent years south africa represented a strategic opportunity for the kremlin to wrest a geopolitically significant state out of the west s orbit and to create a partnership that could serve as a springboard for expanded influence elsewhere in africa russia carefully cultivated ties with zuma from the beginning of his presidency and the warm relationship was largely free of the erratic ups and downs that had plagued relations between moscow and pretoria since the second half of the 1980s zuma himself served as a dogged promoter of russian interests behaving in ways that mystified even some of his closest aides why then did russian south african relations soar to such heights during zuma s presidency only to trigger his political implosion the pervasiveness of state capture tells a large part of the story though not all of it it is also important to take stock of extensive historical ties between russia and south africa which provide a glimpse of how modern day russia seeks to leverage the legacy of the soviet union s extensive support for revolutionary movements and postcolonial governments throughout africa in a similar vein a close evaluation of russian ties to south africa can generate insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the tool kit that the kremlin brings to bear on the continent this account has benefited from extensive investigations of the zuma presidency undertaken by south african governmental and legal bodies civil society groups environmental activists and independent media outlets 3 by far the most important source has been an impartial legal inquiry into state capture the so called zondo commission the commission is an impressive illustration of the strength of south africa s institutional checks and balances and the country s remarkable capacity for self examination and accountability 4 the commission is similar to the truth and reconciliation commission which documented crimes and abuses on both sides of the armed struggle to end apartheid the zondo commission s public hearings and sworn statements provide extensive detail on how the zuma government operated and how the interests of zuma s inner circle and the kremlin became intertwined the authors of this paper also conducted extensive interviews in south africa the united kingdom uk and the united states in addition they relied on declassified u s government documents historical records and open source materials in russian and english along with analytical insights developed as part of carnegie s multiyear research project entitled the return of global russia comrades in arms south africa has a long history of homegrown left wing political activism dating back to the early twentieth century the south african communist party sacp whose forerunner was founded in 1921 was an early proponent of a nonracial south africa and served as an important pillar of the african national congress anc senior sacp party members such as joe slovo contributed a great deal to underground anti apartheid activities after the party was banned in 1950 including by participating in the founding of umkhonto we sizwe mk or spear of the nation the armed wing of the anc in 1961 as irina filatova and apollon davidson wrote in their exhaustive history the hidden thread russia and south africa in the soviet era moscow was a central albeit underappreciated force in encouraging and organizing opposition to the apartheid regime the ussr helped the anc to turn itself both in south africa and internationally into the main voice of south africa s oppressed african majority even though it was a party in exile it helped the anc to occupy a respected and prominent place in the international arena 5 the leadership of the anc carefully balanced this relationship with close ties to western partners most notably sweden which secretly provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support 6 operating from london the leaders of the anc in exile oliver tambo and thabo mbeki sustained a delicate balancing act between its external backers and competing voices inside the anti apartheid camp eugene rumer rumer a former national intelligence officer for russia and eurasia at the u s national intelligence council is a senior fellow and the director of carnegie s russia and eurasia program more to be sure soviet policy toward south africa had deep ideological and geopolitical underpinnings the oppression of the black majority vividly illustrated the evils of the capitalist system and the anti apartheid struggle became a mainstay of soviet propaganda throughout most of the cold war soviet activism in africa was a low risk way for the kremlin to challenge western standing in the developing world and to compete ideologically and geopolitically with its chief communist rival china based on these motivations the soviet union provided extensive financial military and intelligence support to the anc beginning in the 1960s 7 according to a declassified 1986 central intelligence agency cia document the soviet bloc provides virtually all the military assistance received by the anc supplies virtually all the military equipment to the mk and the 500 cuban and east german instructors present in angolan training camps provide training to mk recruits among others the soviet bloc donates all advanced military and sabotage training by means of scholarships to the ussr and east germany attendance at such courses seems to be a sine qua non for advancement in the mk hierarchy 8 upward of 3 000 anc activists and fighters came to the soviet union for extended periods for various types of training educational opportunities and medical treatment during this period according to vladimir shubin who coordinated support on behalf of the central committee of the soviet communist party 9 veterans of the anti apartheid struggle speak reverently of their training and experiences in the soviet bloc ronnie kasrils a senior mk figure who served as the minister of intelligence services under former president mbeki and later became one of zuma s staunchest critics described conditions in the early 1960s at a dedicated training facility for fighters from liberation movements on the black sea i was there with two hundred black people for them their impressions of being trained by white people being served in canteens by white people their rooms cleaned by old ukrainian ladies they just couldn t get over it we were very fortunate to have military instructors who 20 years earlier were those driving the nazis from the gates of leningrad and stalingrad they were witty people who kept us laughing but at the same time were so clearly strong and determined to pass their lessons onto us their presence was outstanding to us the soviet union was like a dream and it was held with much love and respect 10 yet there were darker aspects to soviet support training programs were geared toward ideological indoctrination and the cultivation of agents of influence the kgb kept close tabs on foreign students and tried to recruit them as agents 11 instruction on clandestine activities was a key part of the curriculum for students being prepared to participate in underground movements once a week during the academic year and for a full month during the summer students learn conspiratorial work such as disguise use of pseudonyms infiltration and exfiltration small arms marksmanships and unarmed combat at a paramilitary training site outside moscow according to a declassified cia report from 1980 12 the soviet relationship with south africa was complicated by a protracted slump in oil prices during the 1980s which dried up the primary source of the kremlin s hard currency earnings those constraints also magnified what famed kgb defector vasiliy mitrokhin referred to as deep contradictions at the heart of soviet policy towards southern africa moscow maintained top secret contacts with pretoria over the regulation of the world market in gold diamonds platinum and precious metals in which the soviet union and south africa between them had something of a duopoly 13 this economic co dependence appears to have kept in check soviet willingness to confront the apartheid regime head on a frozen relationship moscow s relations with the anc during the waning days of apartheid were complicated by a series of radical policy shifts under both mikhail gorbachev and boris yeltsin as well as mbeki s proactive efforts to reduce the anc s dependence on soviet support as the gorbachev government sought a fundamentally new relationship with the west it began to downplay support for armed struggle in africa in both rhetorical and practical terms for his part mbeki understood that a thaw in the cold war would inevitably mean moscow s withdrawal of support for the anc non alignment was becoming a necessity 14 during the late soviet period the kremlin pushed a series of diplomatic initiatives to reduce tensions in southern africa including by arranging the removal of all anc fighters from angola via airlift to uganda roughly 2 000 kilometers away according to mbeki s biographer mk commander joe modise believed that this move was the moment the penny dropped that south africa s only solution would be a negotiated one 15 in 1991 the kremlin canceled direct funding for the anc and all military training programs for foreign fighters desperate for new sources of external financial support the gorbachev government responded to the lifting of the ban on the anc in early 1990 by reestablishing formal diplomatic contacts with pretoria which stirred unease inside the anc both gorbachev and yeltsin avoided personal contact with newly freed nelson mandela in june 1992 yeltsin hosted a state visit by south african president frederik w de klerk to showcase his break with soviet foreign policy orthodoxy mandela s first visit to moscow would not happen until seven years later russian policy toward africa remained a low priority during vladimir putin s first two terms as president from 2000 to 2008 the agenda for putin s 2006 visit to south africa the first by a sitting russian president was largely devoted to arranging commercial opportunities for russian companies flush with cash from the commodities boom a handful of large scale investments in strategic sectors specifically manganese and vanadium mining by leading russian tycoons viktor vekselberg and roman abramovich drew high level attention 16 when then president dmitry medvedev traveled to africa in the summer of 2009 south africa was not included on his itinerary in a moment of candor medvedev admitted that moscow was almost too late in engaging with africa work with our african partners should have been started earlier 17 over the following decade russia s involvement in the south african economy has remained truly miniscule when compared to that of other trading partners and investors such as the eu china the united states india and the uk in 2017 russia accounted for only 0 4 percent of south africa s foreign trade 18 while south african exports to russia totaled a mere 747 million with copper wire being the single largest export 19 europe the united states and china remain by far the most important sources of foreign direct investment for south africa 20 zuma s rise and the advent of state capture zuma s role in the anc s underground activities and the armed struggle dates to the earliest days of mk his trade union and anc activism had begun when he was a teenager in the late 1950s imprisoned on robben island for a decade he served his sentence alongside senior figures such as mandela soon after his release in 1973 he went into exile and lived for nearly two decades in mozambique swaziland and zambia he rose quickly through the ranks and occupied a series of senior anc positions focused on intelligence and the coordination of underground activities inside south africa zuma has spoken very little about his activities during this period he spent three months in the soviet union for military training in 1978 a practice that was customary for senior anc cadres 21 zuma s role in anc intelligence structures was largely dictated by the operational requirements of the time following the 1976 soweto uprising that mobilized an entire generation of student activists the anc s ranks in frontline countries like angola and mozambique swelled as young exiles fled south africa eager to join the fight that influx opened the door for the first time to soviet bloc military training for anc fighters in nearby countries but it also allowed the apartheid regime s intelligence service to infiltrate the anc on a large scale extensive soviet and east german training and support helped the anc ramp up its counterintelligence capabilities to deal with its most pressing task rooting out the thousands of infiltrators in its midst this relentless search for traitors eventually led to serious human rights abuses zuma took over the intelligence unit of the anc secret police in the late 1980s following an internal anc investigation into those abuses 22 strong circumstantial evidence suggests that zuma himself played a part in the mistreatment of anc prisoners zuma was part of the first wave of senior anc officials who returned to south africa immediately after the ban on the organization was lifted he played an important role in the negotiations that led to the peaceful handover of power in 1994 zuma s stature rose steadily during the presidencies of mandela and mbeki he served as deputy president for six years under mbeki with whom he had a long standing rivalry mbeki was ultimately forced to resign the presidency in late 2008 following revelations that he had interfered improperly in an investigation into zuma s alleged involvement in a corrupt arms deal that paved the way for zuma s victory in the 2009 presidential election getting warmer again with zuma at the helm south africa s ties to russia quickly warmed his first year in office 2009 coincided with the global financial crisis which hit commodity producers especially hard zuma pushed for south africa to join the informal bric grouping of brazil russia india and china which moscow touted as an important alternative to the g7 the kremlin provided important backing for zuma s request to join the nascent forum at the time many observers were decidedly skeptical including the goldman sachs economist who had first coined the bric moniker 23 south africa s small global economic footprint low life expectancy and high levels of inequality compared unfavorably to other prospective members such as indonesia mexico or turkey 24 zuma attended his first brics heads of state meeting in april 2011 in sanya china and joined his fellow leaders in condemning the u s led intervention in libya even though south africa had voted in favor of a no fly zone over libya in the united nations un security council just weeks earlier 25 the libya crisis roiled the u s russian relationship with russian officials charging publicly that washington and its allies had gone beyond their un security council mandate 26 events in libya and other regions also helped propel the zuma government s foreign policy in directions that were increasingly critical of u s and european positions on international security matters after russia annexed crimea in 2014 the south african government appeared to set aside some of its traditional principles specifically noninterference in the affairs of sovereign states the inviolability of borders and opposition to regime change 27 it abstained from voting on a un general assembly resolution in march 2014 in support of ukraine s territorial integrity and avoided any direct criticism of russian actions against ukraine for his part zuma justified the move by insisting weakly that it was important to close ranks with fellow brics members on the matter 28 meanwhile the kremlin launched a major push to establish close ties with south africa s security apparatus such moves benefited from a reshuffling of senior security advisers and zuma s increased reliance on figures such as david mahlobo a zuma protégé and unabashed loyalist with no prior intelligence or law enforcement experience who was appointed in 2014 to lead the state security agency ssa during his first year in office he met with russian security council secretary nikolai patrushev at least four times 29 the russian readout of patrushev s late november 2015 visit to pretoria highlighted the threat of foreign interference and color revolutions the term russian officials use to describe democratic revolutions which they claim the united states sponsors to install u s friendly regimes 30 from time to time such rhetoric crept into public pronouncements by mahlobo and others about zuma s political and civil society opponents ssa personnel allegedly traveled to russia for training according to unconfirmed local press accounts earlier in zuma s tenure south african military intelligence had reportedly sought to develop its own satellite surveillance capabilities with russian help 31 politicization of the intelligence services already a long standing problem became an increasingly important source of tensions during zuma s tenure amid pressure on his political opponents media manipulation and other abuses according to a blue ribbon panel established by current south african president cyril ramaphosa 32 a nuclear maelstrom starting with putin s 2006 visit the kremlin pushed systematically to elevate bilateral nuclear cooperation with south africa the first breakthrough was a putin mbeki agreement for russia to supply fuel to south africa s koeberg nuclear power plant 33 koeberg is part of an inheritance from the apartheid regime s nuclear weapons program and its two reactors generate approximately 5 percent of the country s total electricity 34 on the same visit putin also publicly called for ramping up bilateral cooperation on uranium mining and nuclear power plant construction activities that would eventually take center stage during the state capture investigation 35 south africa s installed electricity capacity is considerable at roughly 44 000 megawatts as of 2018 36 the state owned monopoly eskom made important strides to expand access to electricity starting in the late 1980s and it was generally well regarded prior to zuma s tenure growth projections for the south african economy during the early 2000s highlighted possible supply constraints and the destabilizing effects thereof by 2010 there was robust discussion about whether future electrical generation capacity would be derived from coal the country s main legacy fuel source fracking and natural gas thanks to south africa s abundant reserves nuclear power or wind and solar energy during the mbeki presidency eskom explored a possible 12 billion expansion of the koeberg facility but decided in 2008 that the project was unaffordable 37 enter russia s nuclear power monopoly rosatom the firm s then ceo sergei kiriyenko the author of major reforms to russia s nuclear sector in the mid 2000s had identified growth of nuclear power plant construction overseas as one of rosatom s top priorities in the wake of the global financial crisis the crisis had led to significant belt tightening throughout the russian economy and rosatom s leadership viewed international expansion as a mechanism for sustaining intellectual and technical capabilities inside russia and funding vital programs the firm continues to play up prospects for foreign reactor sales even today in a june 2019 interview current ceo alexey likhachev claimed that rosatom has contracts for 190 billion of which 90 billion is for projects in twelve countries that have already started 38 russian and foreign experts have expressed skepticism about these numbers despite the propensity of the company s executives to exaggerate their overseas marketing prowess rosatom also serves as an important tool for the kremlin s foreign policy agenda that role has created significant albeit unresolvable tensions within the company its technocratic leadership which takes a more conservative approach to managing the firm s finances chafes at being saddled with projects that do not make good economic sense yet to the kremlin which controls the company through its oversight board even bad deals can make for good geopolitics putin s persistent advocacy of a large scale nuclear deal with south africa fell squarely into this category 39 the makings of a shady deal viewed from south africa the most troubling aspects of the deal were its enormous cost the disregard for the established legal and administrative norms for government procurement and the likelihood that the chief personal beneficiaries would be zuma and the guptas the guptas are a trio of immigrants to south africa from india who became close with zuma and enriched members of the zuma family his inner circle and themselves from rosatom s point of view the deal appears to have been little more than a loss leader south africa s lackluster economic prospects and questionable ability to shoulder the costs of constructing and operating a new constellation of civil nuclear power plants meant that financial rewards for rosatom were far from a sure thing ultimately any commercial upside for rosatom would have been derived from lucrative long term agreements for nuclear fuel reactor maintenance and decommissioning activities over the plant s projected fifty to sixty years of service life accordingly the geopolitical value of a deal positioning russia as a major actor in south africa s economy with an eye toward further expansion elsewhere on the continent would have been far more consequential discussions with moscow on nuclear cooperation accelerated shortly after zuma ascended to the presidency from the outset there was a race under way between the protagonists of the zuma russia nuclear deal and the many checks to it which early on were activated 40 as early as the autumn of 2011 zuma told then finance minister pravin gordhan that he wanted to award the entire construction deal to russia he brushed aside gordhan s insistence on following established procedures for state procurement according to gordhan s written testimony to the state capture commission 41 gordhan warned zuma that failing to follow the established procedures could land the president in trouble similar to the fallout over the earlier arms sales scandal that had nearly ended his political career as gordan s successor nhlanhla nene who served as finance minister from may 2014 to december 2015 put it the nuclear project would have constituted the largest public investment program in south african history and relative to the size of the south african economy would have been one of the largest public sector investments ever undertaken internationally 42 as negotiations continued zuma loyalists like those in the department of energy tried to sideline opponents of the deal zuma himself assumed direct control of the process through a special energy commission this bureaucratic wrestling match along with efforts to conceal information about the deal from parliamentary oversight made it impossible to evaluate the project s potential impact on the country s financial health gordhan and other officials were largely cut out of the discussions concerns about tax incentives offered to the russians as part of the deal were largely disregarded 43 treasury officials also worried about the projected societal impact of the public debt associated with the project and the possibility that future electricity price increases would be passed on to the general population the south african opposition party democratic alliance investigative journalists and civic activists all charged publicly that the nuclear reactor deal was concocted in large measure to benefit the gupta family in 2010 the guptas had partnered with zuma s son duduzane and used state funds to purchase a major uranium mine a move that positioned them as potential suppliers of the country s future nuclear power plants u s officials warned south african counterparts at the time that the guptas expansion into uranium mining may have been funded by iran and that uranium from this mine was destined for iran s nuclear program 44 the guptas also ensured that zuma installed their allies on eskom s board thus giving them a major say in the running of the company 45 in august 2014 zuma unexpectedly traveled to russia accompanied only by intelligence minister mahlobo and a deputy foreign minister the purpose of the visit and zuma s meeting with putin was not adequately explained which provoked a great deal of attention and speculation at home despite its prominence on the bilateral agenda nuclear cooperation was conspicuously absent from the south african government s official readout of the visit 46 mahlobo later claimed that zuma had gone to moscow for medical treatment following an assassination attempt 47 just three weeks later in vienna south african and russian representatives signed a formal agreement on strategic nuclear cooperation 48 the agreement was kept confidential and the episode only heightened suspicions about the true nature of the two countries developing nuclear relationship a joint press statement said that the agreement laid the foundation for the large scale nuclear power plants npp procurement and development program of south africa based on the construction in rsa of new nuclear power plants with russian vver reactors with total installed capacity of up to 9 6 gw up to 8 npp units these will be the first npps based on the russian technology to be built on the african continent 49 rosatom s kiriyenko said at the time that the construction portion of the deal was worth upward of 40 50 billion 50 the total deal was estimated to be worth 76 billion 51 scrutiny from civil society groups and zuma s political opponents as well as the government s lack of transparency about the deal and about russia s central role in it created an escalating series of political and legal problems soon thereafter ecodefense a russian environmental nongovernmental organization leaked a copy of the confidential september 2014 agreement to two south african activists the contents of the document made it difficult for the government to convince anyone that it was conducting a proper tender based on bids from french south korean and u s firms let alone subjecting the deal to parliamentary review 52 the activists makoma lekalakala and liz mcdaid won considerable acclaim for stirring grassroots opposition and organizing legal challenges neither zuma nor the russian government appeared to fully appreciate the controversy that they had created or the scale of opposition to the deal according to former finance minister nene s testimony zuma was fully committed to proceeding with the deal at the brics summit in russia in july 2015 even though key financial details had not been resolved 53 nene raised concerns with zuma that the financial details of the deal had been kept from treasury officials only for zuma to criticize him for allegedly failing to fulfill his duties nene was fired in late 2015 even after an april 2017 high court ruling that the nuclear deal was unconstitutional zuma remained defiant he brushed aside demands to adhere to state procurement procedures and accusations of corruption while continuing to look for ways to resuscitate the agreement in the months prior to his resignation he stirred additional controversy by assigning intelligence chief mahlobo to run the department of energy zuma s abrupt resignation sealed the fate of the deal since then his successor ramaphosa has maintained a respectful stance toward moscow even as he has made clear that the nuclear deal is simply unaffordable for now ramaphosa s presence at the inaugural russia africa summit in sochi in october 2019 was overshadowed by a symbolic visit of two russian nuclear capable blackjack bombers to south africa 54 the lack of meaningful deliverables from ramaphosa s visit to russia conveyed an unmistakable impression that the bilateral relationship between russia and south africa today is simply marking time russia s tool kit less than meets the eye the failed nuclear deal was unique in terms of its outsized impact on south africa s domestic political stability potential negative economic consequences and the desire of russian officials to use nuclear power as a tool to expand moscow s footprint in africa for decades to come but the deal also illustrated the limits of russia s reach and its modest tool kit for projecting power and influence in regions far beyond its periphery the failure of the nuclear deal also raised questions about the viability of russia s renewed hopes for wielding greater global influence notably the deal was hardly a coup for russian state coffers the sheer size of the proposal and its projected burden on the south african economy tend to obscure the fact that rosatom was being forced to undertake a massive construction project with uncertain upfront financing and equally uncertain prospects for long term commercial gain 55 in theory rosatom stood to recoup some of these outlays via long term fuel purchases and other service agreements yet in practice it is hard to overlook the fact that the deal was largely a dodgy venture with significant risks driven by geopolitical rather than commercial considerations russia is hardly an attractive economic partner for south africa in most respects bilateral trade is inconsequential and considering the major role of extractive industries in both countries economies they enjoy no natural complementarity russia has long struggled to attract foreign investors and is hardly a promising investment destination for south africa moscow has no history of extending loans to pretoria during the cold war as a result the kremlin could not dangle debt forgiveness one of its primary tools for economic statecraft to incentivize south african political cooperation in multilateral venues like the un as it has long done with partners in other parts of sub saharan africa arms deals are similarly a nonstarter sales of russian conventional weaponry which have been important for moscow s courtship of various african countries have had little appeal for pretoria south africa forced to operate under international sanctions during the apartheid regime has long had its own indigenous armaments industry as a result south africa has neither a legacy arsenal of soviet era weapons and equipment in need of modernization or maintenance nor a need to purchase new russian arms and equipment besides that generational change is gradually eroding russia s other source of leverage the impressive degree of support the kremlin gave to the anc during the apartheid era the legacy of apartheid is present in virtually every aspect of south african life and russia s lack of involvement with the apartheid regime is definitely still an important reputational advantage but the generation of anc leaders who were trained in the soviet union or who may have benefited from soviet support is aging zuma and mbeki are both seventy seven years old modern day russia offers little in the way of practical assistance for helping south africa deal with its deep set economic and societal challenges that is likely to limit its attractiveness as a partner to future generations of south african leaders their attitudes and priorities are more likely to be shaped by the country s complex political life and development needs than by apartheid era nostalgia that leaves two other tools for russia to exploit in expanding ties with south africa high level diplomacy and a hear no evil see no evil approach to doing business south africa s inclusion in the brics and putin s personal involvement in brics diplomacy are undoubtedly useful for sustaining high level ties with south african leaders u s president donald trump s administration s continued inattention to south africa enhances the utility of such personal diplomacy for south africa s leaders annual appearances at brics summits bolster their country s standing on the african continent and offer domestic and international prestige but when south african leaders have sought to use the brics as a platform to deal with the issues of greatest concern to the global south they have discovered that the kremlin is a rather inattentive and fickle champion the lack of tangible deliverables from brics gatherings limits their utility for south africa and inadvertently may even detract from russia s role in these forums by emphasizing the importance of another key power china for south africa at the un moscow has prioritized building close ties with south africa and the countries holding the three rotating african seats on the security council the so called a3 russia and china have frequently dangled the idea of un security council reform in discussions with the a3 and south africa which has been a nonpermanent member of the security council three times moscow and beijing have implied that brics members and other countries of the global south should have greater clout yet russian support appears to be primarily rhetorical 56 russian diplomats seldom if ever specify how reform might work or issue convincing calls for expanding the security council s membership ranks once again russia talks big but does not really deliver russia s lack of interest in upholding ethical norms can be useful in its economic outreach in countries with weak rule of law and civil society but the kremlin learned the hard way the downsides of pursuing a nuclear deal with south africa without much regard for that country s well established legal and administrative institutions and norms independent media landscape and vibrant civil society such institutional checks and balances helped expose the nature of state capture and improper behavior by senior south african officials along with russia s problematic approach to state capitalism zuma s willingness to turn a blind eye to the controversy provided only temporary advantages for the kremlin in the end all of these advantages came to naught a meager inheritance at first glance russia s prospects for securing a foothold in south africa looked quite promising zuma a soviet trained intelligence operative ascended to the presidency under a cloud of corruption allegations the kremlin had successfully leveraged such situations elsewhere in the world over time zuma backed away from south africa s mandela era western leaning foreign policy framework in favor of a more anti western heavily conspiratorial view of the international system to be sure such views have deep roots in the anc even though they are strongly contested zuma s foreign policy aligned rather nicely with russian positions on many issues including the conflicts in libya and syria as well as the threat allegedly posed by so called color revolutions and the hidden hand of self interested western powers but the kremlin overplayed its hand its pursuit of a massive nontransparent nuclear deal mobilized south african civil society and zuma s political opponents instead of anchoring moscow s relationship with pretoria the nuclear deal demonstrated russia s limited reach and lack of appeal as a partner to a country resilient in terms of democratic governance strong civil society organizations press freedoms and political competition another unintended consequence was the impression that the failed nuclear deal was all there was to the south africa russia relationship this exposed russia s limited at best tool kit for long range projection of its power and influence the questionable ethical aspects of the nuclear deal and the kremlin s role in avidly promoting it illustrate the putin regime s reputation as an oftentimes unsavory and shortsighted business partner such deals may appeal to the leaders of countries with weak rule of law and fragile civil society but in south africa any future deals involving russia are likely to attract considerable scrutiny while the questionable benefits of the nuclear deal for south africa have been well documented the dubious economic benefits for russia have drawn less attention this in turn underscores the role of geopolitics and opportunism as the key drivers of russian policy toward south africa with a meager tool kit for sustaining its geopolitical ambitions moscow is finding that success is more elusive than commonly perceived serious questions remain about the tangible benefits such global forays will provide to the kremlin over the long run against the backdrop of the kremlin s interference in the 2016 u s presidential election and in other major western democracies it is tempting to conclude that russia s renewed global activism is producing one success after another unfortunately examples of russian overreach and miscalculation continue to be overlooked south africa stands as a revealing example of the limits of the kremlin s ham fisted dealmaking its limited tool kit and the unsavory tools

summary amid the widespread attention the kremlin s recent inroads in africa have attracted there has been surprisingly little discussion of south africa a country which for nearly a decade unquestionably represented russia s biggest foreign policy success story on the continent as relations soared during the ill starred presidency of jacob zuma 2009 2018 the kremlin sought to wrest a geopolitically significant state out of the west s orbit and to create a partnership that could serve as a springboard for expanded influence elsewhere in africa moscow s strategy was multifaceted capitalizing on well established close ties with zuma a former african national congress senior intelligence official with extensive soviet bloc connections russian president vladimir putin and other senior officials pursued a series of initiatives such as the inclusion of south africa in the bric brazil russia india and china grouping and the launch of ambitious forms of cooperation between state backed energy interests primarily in the nuclear sector yet relations were undermined by the kremlin s propensity to overreach to lean too heavily on the legacy of cold war era relationships forged with leaders of national liberation movements and to take advantage of cultures of corruption the controversy arising from a massive 76 billion nuclear power plant construction deal triggered strong pushback and legal challenges from south africa s institutional checks and balances civil society groups and independent media key parts of the russian national security establishment view civil nuclear power exports as an important tool for projecting influence overseas while creating revenue streams for sustaining intellectual and technical capabilities and vital programs inside russia itself yet such cooperation is often a two edged sword on the one hand costly projects such as the one pushed by zuma typically make little economic sense for the purchasing country spurring uncomfortable questions about who stands to benefit on the other hand heavily subsidized projects pursued mainly for geopolitical reasons risk saddling russia s nuclear power monopoly rosatom with burdens it can ill afford ongoing investigations of high level corruption during the period of so called state capture under zuma shed remarkable light on how the kremlin operates in africa and other parts of the world in retrospect the sustainability of moscow s embrace of south africa was highly questionable due to its paltry tool kit russian involvement in the south african economy is miniscule compared to that of other trading partners such as the eu china the united states india and the uk accounting for a mere 0 4 percent of south africa s foreign trade while the soviet union was an important patron during the anti apartheid struggle modern day russia offers little in the way of practical assistance for helping south africa deal with its deep set economic and societal challenges acknowledgments this publication is based on research supported by the united states european command with additional support from c5 capital the views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the official polices either express or implied of the u s government introduction over the past eighteen months the kremlin s gains in africa have attracted widespread attention curiously south africa seldom features in these accounts yet for nearly a decade it was one of russia s biggest foreign policy success stories why are russia s recent inroads in south africa and the dramatic reversals that followed being overlooked and what do they reveal about the effectiveness of moscow s broader strategy and overall tool kit on the continent the kremlin often takes advantage of cultures of corruption and to a certain extent its efforts in south africa fit this broader pattern the high water mark for russia south africa relations occurred during jacob zuma s presidency 2009 2018 which was marred by a series of corruption scandals commonly described by south africans as the period of state capture yet russian engagement with south africa during the zuma era was more deeply rooted it relied on a web of relationships at the highest levels of both governments the promotion of multi billion dollar projects involving state owned companies particularly in the energy sector and the leveraging of cold war era ties forged during south africa s period of national liberation in the end much of what went wrong for russia was a testament to south africa s remarkably robust system of institutional checks and balances zuma s excesses which led to his resignation under pressure in february 2018 generated a strong pushback from various quarters south africa s competitive political system civil society judiciary and news media served as dogged champions of accountability and transparency south africans from vantage points inside and outside of government closely scrutinized russian activities meticulously documented them and launched a series of political and legal challenges in response their ability to challenge a controversial head of state stands as a powerful example for policymakers elsewhere on the continent and in other parts of the world who are contending with russian malign activities as carnegie s paul stronski has written russia is decidedly late to the party in africa 1 its gains have been mostly in pariah states ostracized by the international community such as zimbabwe and strategically less important ones like the central african republic from which other major powers have largely disengaged moscow has devoted relatively few resources to expanding its influence in africa compared to other major external actors such as the european union eu the united states and china but it has repeatedly demonstrated a knack for spreading narratives about moscow s resurgence as a leading power and fostering the impression that its accomplishments on the continent have come at the expense of the united states and its allies andrew s weiss weiss is the james family chair and vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment where he oversees research on russia and eurasia more andrewsweiss yet it is quite striking how time and again the russian leadership has opted for imagery over substance and a consistent reluctance to tackle any of the issues atop the agendas of many african countries issues like economic development quality of governance the rule of law communal violence conflict resolution and public health concerns including infectious diseases the kremlin s modest ability to project military power and low appetite for risk in africa have meant that its security activities have been mostly parceled out to a rogues gallery of shadowy mercenaries and contractors such as the wagner group 2 moscow s attempt to secure a foothold in south africa was somewhat of a departure from its usual approach to the continent in recent years russian inroads in africa have been largely a product of opportunism rather than strategic vision unlike some other african states with a markedly increased russian presence in recent years south africa represented a strategic opportunity for the kremlin to wrest a geopolitically significant state out of the west s orbit and to create a partnership that could serve as a springboard for expanded influence elsewhere in africa russia carefully cultivated ties with zuma from the beginning of his presidency and the warm relationship was largely free of the erratic ups and downs that had plagued relations between moscow and pretoria since the second half of the 1980s zuma himself served as a dogged promoter of russian interests behaving in ways that mystified even some of his closest aides why then did russian south african relations soar to such heights during zuma s presidency only to trigger his political implosion the pervasiveness of state capture tells a large part of the story though not all of it it is also important to take stock of extensive historical ties between russia and south africa which provide a glimpse of how modern day russia seeks to leverage the legacy of the soviet union s extensive support for revolutionary movements and postcolonial governments throughout africa in a similar vein a close evaluation of russian ties to south africa can generate insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the tool kit that the kremlin brings to bear on the continent this account has benefited from extensive investigations of the zuma presidency undertaken by south african governmental and legal bodies civil society groups environmental activists and independent media outlets 3 by far the most important source has been an impartial legal inquiry into state capture the so called zondo commission the commission is an impressive illustration of the strength of south africa s institutional checks and balances and the country s remarkable capacity for self examination and accountability 4 the commission is similar to the truth and reconciliation commission which documented crimes and abuses on both sides of the armed struggle to end apartheid the zondo commission s public hearings and sworn statements provide extensive detail on how the zuma government operated and how the interests of zuma s inner circle and the kremlin became intertwined the authors of this paper also conducted extensive interviews in south africa the united kingdom uk and the united states in addition they relied on declassified u s government documents historical records and open source materials in russian and english along with analytical insights developed as part of carnegie s multiyear research project entitled the return of global russia comrades in arms south africa has a long history of homegrown left wing political activism dating back to the early twentieth century the south african communist party sacp whose forerunner was founded in 1921 was an early proponent of a nonracial south africa and served as an important pillar of the african national congress anc senior sacp party members such as joe slovo contributed a great deal to underground anti apartheid activities after the party was banned in 1950 including by participating in the founding of umkhonto we sizwe mk or spear of the nation the armed wing of the anc in 1961 as irina filatova and apollon davidson wrote in their exhaustive history the hidden thread russia and south africa in the soviet era moscow was a central albeit underappreciated force in encouraging and organizing opposition to the apartheid regime the ussr helped the anc to turn itself both in south africa and internationally into the main voice of south africa s oppressed african majority even though it was a party in exile it helped the anc to occupy a respected and prominent place in the international arena 5 the leadership of the anc carefully balanced this relationship with close ties to western partners most notably sweden which secretly provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support 6 operating from london the leaders of the anc in exile oliver tambo and thabo mbeki sustained a delicate balancing act between its external backers and competing voices inside the anti apartheid camp eugene rumer rumer a former national intelligence officer for russia and eurasia at the u s national intelligence council is a senior fellow and the director of carnegie s russia and eurasia program more to be sure soviet policy toward south africa had deep ideological and geopolitical underpinnings the oppression of the black majority vividly illustrated the evils of the capitalist system and the anti apartheid struggle became a mainstay of soviet propaganda throughout most of the cold war soviet activism in africa was a low risk way for the kremlin to challenge western standing in the developing world and to compete ideologically and geopolitically with its chief communist rival china based on these motivations the soviet union provided extensive financial military and intelligence support to the anc beginning in the 1960s 7 according to a declassified 1986 central intelligence agency cia document the soviet bloc provides virtually all the military assistance received by the anc supplies virtually all the military equipment to the mk and the 500 cuban and east german instructors present in angolan training camps provide training to mk recruits among others the soviet bloc donates all advanced military and sabotage training by means of scholarships to the ussr and east germany attendance at such courses seems to be a sine qua non for advancement in the mk hierarchy 8 upward of 3 000 anc activists and fighters came to the soviet union for extended periods for various types of training educational opportunities and medical treatment during this period according to vladimir shubin who coordinated support on behalf of the central committee of the soviet communist party 9 veterans of the anti apartheid struggle speak reverently of their training and experiences in the soviet bloc ronnie kasrils a senior mk figure who served as the minister of intelligence services under former president mbeki and later became one of zuma s staunchest critics described conditions in the early 1960s at a dedicated training facility for fighters from liberation movements on the black sea i was there with two hundred black people for them their impressions of being trained by white people being served in canteens by white people their rooms cleaned by old ukrainian ladies they just couldn t get over it we were very fortunate to have military instructors who 20 years earlier were those driving the nazis from the gates of leningrad and stalingrad they were witty people who kept us laughing but at the same time were so clearly strong and determined to pass their lessons onto us their presence was outstanding to us the soviet union was like a dream and it was held with much love and respect 10 yet there were darker aspects to soviet support training programs were geared toward ideological indoctrination and the cultivation of agents of influence the kgb kept close tabs on foreign students and tried to recruit them as agents 11 instruction on clandestine activities was a key part of the curriculum for students being prepared to participate in underground movements once a week during the academic year and for a full month during the summer students learn conspiratorial work such as disguise use of pseudonyms infiltration and exfiltration small arms marksmanships and unarmed combat at a paramilitary training site outside moscow according to a declassified cia report from 1980 12 the soviet relationship with south africa was complicated by a protracted slump in oil prices during the 1980s which dried up the primary source of the kremlin s hard currency earnings those constraints also magnified what famed kgb defector vasiliy mitrokhin referred to as deep contradictions at the heart of soviet policy towards southern africa moscow maintained top secret contacts with pretoria over the regulation of the world market in gold diamonds platinum and precious metals in which the soviet union and south africa between them had something of a duopoly 13 this economic co dependence appears to have kept in check soviet willingness to confront the apartheid regime head on a frozen relationship moscow s relations with the anc during the waning days of apartheid were complicated by a series of radical policy shifts under both mikhail gorbachev and boris yeltsin as well as mbeki s proactive efforts to reduce the anc s dependence on soviet support as the gorbachev government sought a fundamentally new relationship with the west it began to downplay support for armed struggle in africa in both rhetorical and practical terms for his part mbeki understood that a thaw in the cold war would inevitably mean moscow s withdrawal of support for the anc non alignment was becoming a necessity 14 during the late soviet period the kremlin pushed a series of diplomatic initiatives to reduce tensions in southern africa including by arranging the removal of all anc fighters from angola via airlift to uganda roughly 2 000 kilometers away according to mbeki s biographer mk commander joe modise believed that this move was the moment the penny dropped that south africa s only solution would be a negotiated one 15 in 1991 the kremlin canceled direct funding for the anc and all military training programs for foreign fighters desperate for new sources of external financial support the gorbachev government responded to the lifting of the ban on the anc in early 1990 by reestablishing formal diplomatic contacts with pretoria which stirred unease inside the anc both gorbachev and yeltsin avoided personal contact with newly freed nelson mandela in june 1992 yeltsin hosted a state visit by south african president frederik w de klerk to showcase his break with soviet foreign policy orthodoxy mandela s first visit to moscow would not happen until seven years later russian policy toward africa remained a low priority during vladimir putin s first two terms as president from 2000 to 2008 the agenda for putin s 2006 visit to south africa the first by a sitting russian president was largely devoted to arranging commercial opportunities for russian companies flush with cash from the commodities boom a handful of large scale investments in strategic sectors specifically manganese and vanadium mining by leading russian tycoons viktor vekselberg and roman abramovich drew high level attention 16 when then president dmitry medvedev traveled to africa in the summer of 2009 south africa was not included on his itinerary in a moment of candor medvedev admitted that moscow was almost too late in engaging with africa work with our african partners should have been started earlier 17 over the following decade russia s involvement in the south african economy has remained truly miniscule when compared to that of other trading partners and investors such as the eu china the united states india and the uk in 2017 russia accounted for only 0 4 percent of south africa s foreign trade 18 while south african exports to russia totaled a mere 747 million with copper wire being the single largest export 19 europe the united states and china remain by far the most important sources of foreign direct investment for south africa 20 zuma s rise and the advent of state capture zuma s role in the anc s underground activities and the armed struggle dates to the earliest days of mk his trade union and anc activism had begun when he was a teenager in the late 1950s imprisoned on robben island for a decade he served his sentence alongside senior figures such as mandela soon after his release in 1973 he went into exile and lived for nearly two decades in mozambique swaziland and zambia he rose quickly through the ranks and occupied a series of senior anc positions focused on intelligence and the coordination of underground activities inside south africa zuma has spoken very little about his activities during this period he spent three months in the soviet union for military training in 1978 a practice that was customary for senior anc cadres 21 zuma s role in anc intelligence structures was largely dictated by the operational requirements of the time following the 1976 soweto uprising that mobilized an entire generation of student activists the anc s ranks in frontline countries like angola and mozambique swelled as young exiles fled south africa eager to join the fight that influx opened the door for the first time to soviet bloc military training for anc fighters in nearby countries but it also allowed the apartheid regime s intelligence service to infiltrate the anc on a large scale extensive soviet and east german training and support helped the anc ramp up its counterintelligence capabilities to deal with its most pressing task rooting out the thousands of infiltrators in its midst this relentless search for traitors eventually led to serious human rights abuses zuma took over the intelligence unit of the anc secret police in the late 1980s following an internal anc investigation into those abuses 22 strong circumstantial evidence suggests that zuma himself played a part in the mistreatment of anc prisoners zuma was part of the first wave of senior anc officials who returned to south africa immediately after the ban on the organization was lifted he played an important role in the negotiations that led to the peaceful handover of power in 1994 zuma s stature rose steadily during the presidencies of mandela and mbeki he served as deputy president for six years under mbeki with whom he had a long standing rivalry mbeki was ultimately forced to resign the presidency in late 2008 following revelations that he had interfered improperly in an investigation into zuma s alleged involvement in a corrupt arms deal that paved the way for zuma s victory in the 2009 presidential election getting warmer again with zuma at the helm south africa s ties to russia quickly warmed his first year in office 2009 coincided with the global financial crisis which hit commodity producers especially hard zuma pushed for south africa to join the informal bric grouping of brazil russia india and china which moscow touted as an important alternative to the g7 the kremlin provided important backing for zuma s request to join the nascent forum at the time many observers were decidedly skeptical including the goldman sachs economist who had first coined the bric moniker 23 south africa s small global economic footprint low life expectancy and high levels of inequality compared unfavorably to other prospective members such as indonesia mexico or turkey 24 zuma attended his first brics heads of state meeting in april 2011 in sanya china and joined his fellow leaders in condemning the u s led intervention in libya even though south africa had voted in favor of a no fly zone over libya in the united nations un security council just weeks earlier 25 the libya crisis roiled the u s russian relationship with russian officials charging publicly that washington and its allies had gone beyond their un security council mandate 26 events in libya and other regions also helped propel the zuma government s foreign policy in directions that were increasingly critical of u s and european positions on international security matters after russia annexed crimea in 2014 the south african government appeared to set aside some of its traditional principles specifically noninterference in the affairs of sovereign states the inviolability of borders and opposition to regime change 27 it abstained from voting on a un general assembly resolution in march 2014 in support of ukraine s territorial integrity and avoided any direct criticism of russian actions against ukraine for his part zuma justified the move by insisting weakly that it was important to close ranks with fellow brics members on the matter 28 meanwhile the kremlin launched a major push to establish close ties with south africa s security apparatus such moves benefited from a reshuffling of senior security advisers and zuma s increased reliance on figures such as david mahlobo a zuma protégé and unabashed loyalist with no prior intelligence or law enforcement experience who was appointed in 2014 to lead the state security agency ssa during his first year in office he met with russian security council secretary nikolai patrushev at least four times 29 the russian readout of patrushev s late november 2015 visit to pretoria highlighted the threat of foreign interference and color revolutions the term russian officials use to describe democratic revolutions which they claim the united states sponsors to install u s friendly regimes 30 from time to time such rhetoric crept into public pronouncements by mahlobo and others about zuma s political and civil society opponents ssa personnel allegedly traveled to russia for training according to unconfirmed local press accounts earlier in zuma s tenure south african military intelligence had reportedly sought to develop its own satellite surveillance capabilities with russian help 31 politicization of the intelligence services already a long standing problem became an increasingly important source of tensions during zuma s tenure amid pressure on his political opponents media manipulation and other abuses according to a blue ribbon panel established by current south african president cyril ramaphosa 32 a nuclear maelstrom starting with putin s 2006 visit the kremlin pushed systematically to elevate bilateral nuclear cooperation with south africa the first breakthrough was a putin mbeki agreement for russia to supply fuel to south africa s koeberg nuclear power plant 33 koeberg is part of an inheritance from the apartheid regime s nuclear weapons program and its two reactors generate approximately 5 percent of the country s total electricity 34 on the same visit putin also publicly called for ramping up bilateral cooperation on uranium mining and nuclear power plant construction activities that would eventually take center stage during the state capture investigation 35 south africa s installed electricity capacity is considerable at roughly 44 000 megawatts as of 2018 36 the state owned monopoly eskom made important strides to expand access to electricity starting in the late 1980s and it was generally well regarded prior to zuma s tenure growth projections for the south african economy during the early 2000s highlighted possible supply constraints and the destabilizing effects thereof by 2010 there was robust discussion about whether future electrical generation capacity would be derived from coal the country s main legacy fuel source fracking and natural gas thanks to south africa s abundant reserves nuclear power or wind and solar energy during the mbeki presidency eskom explored a possible 12 billion expansion of the koeberg facility but decided in 2008 that the project was unaffordable 37 enter russia s nuclear power monopoly rosatom the firm s then ceo sergei kiriyenko the author of major reforms to russia s nuclear sector in the mid 2000s had identified growth of nuclear power plant construction overseas as one of rosatom s top priorities in the wake of the global financial crisis the crisis had led to significant belt tightening throughout the russian economy and rosatom s leadership viewed international expansion as a mechanism for sustaining intellectual and technical capabilities inside russia and funding vital programs the firm continues to play up prospects for foreign reactor sales even today in a june 2019 interview current ceo alexey likhachev claimed that rosatom has contracts for 190 billion of which 90 billion is for projects in twelve countries that have already started 38 russian and foreign experts have expressed skepticism about these numbers despite the propensity of the company s executives to exaggerate their overseas marketing prowess rosatom also serves as an important tool for the kremlin s foreign policy agenda that role has created significant albeit unresolvable tensions within the company its technocratic leadership which takes a more conservative approach to managing the firm s finances chafes at being saddled with projects that do not make good economic sense yet to the kremlin which controls the company through its oversight board even bad deals can make for good geopolitics putin s persistent advocacy of a large scale nuclear deal with south africa fell squarely into this category 39 the makings of a shady deal viewed from south africa the most troubling aspects of the deal were its enormous cost the disregard for the established legal and administrative norms for government procurement and the likelihood that the chief personal beneficiaries would be zuma and the guptas the guptas are a trio of immigrants to south africa from india who became close with zuma and enriched members of the zuma family his inner circle and themselves from rosatom s point of view the deal appears to have been little more than a loss leader south africa s lackluster economic prospects and questionable ability to shoulder the costs of constructing and operating a new constellation of civil nuclear power plants meant that financial rewards for rosatom were far from a sure thing ultimately any commercial upside for rosatom would have been derived from lucrative long term agreements for nuclear fuel reactor maintenance and decommissioning activities over the plant s projected fifty to sixty years of service life accordingly the geopolitical value of a deal positioning russia as a major actor in south africa s economy with an eye toward further expansion elsewhere on the continent would have been far more consequential discussions with moscow on nuclear cooperation accelerated shortly after zuma ascended to the presidency from the outset there was a race under way between the protagonists of the zuma russia nuclear deal and the many checks to it which early on were activated 40 as early as the autumn of 2011 zuma told then finance minister pravin gordhan that he wanted to award the entire construction deal to russia he brushed aside gordhan s insistence on following established procedures for state procurement according to gordhan s written testimony to the state capture commission 41 gordhan warned zuma that failing to follow the established procedures could land the president in trouble similar to the fallout over the earlier arms sales scandal that had nearly ended his political career as gordan s successor nhlanhla nene who served as finance minister from may 2014 to december 2015 put it the nuclear project would have constituted the largest public investment program in south african history and relative to the size of the south african economy would have been one of the largest public sector investments ever undertaken internationally 42 as negotiations continued zuma loyalists like those in the department of energy tried to sideline opponents of the deal zuma himself assumed direct control of the process through a special energy commission this bureaucratic wrestling match along with efforts to conceal information about the deal from parliamentary oversight made it impossible to evaluate the project s potential impact on the country s financial health gordhan and other officials were largely cut out of the discussions concerns about tax incentives offered to the russians as part of the deal were largely disregarded 43 treasury officials also worried about the projected societal impact of the public debt associated with the project and the possibility that future electricity price increases would be passed on to the general population the south african opposition party democratic alliance investigative journalists and civic activists all charged publicly that the nuclear reactor deal was concocted in large measure to benefit the gupta family in 2010 the guptas had partnered with zuma s son duduzane and used state funds to purchase a major uranium mine a move that positioned them as potential suppliers of the country s future nuclear power plants u s officials warned south african counterparts at the time that the guptas expansion into uranium mining may have been funded by iran and that uranium from this mine was destined for iran s nuclear program 44 the guptas also ensured that zuma installed their allies on eskom s board thus giving them a major say in the running of the company 45 in august 2014 zuma unexpectedly traveled to russia accompanied only by intelligence minister mahlobo and a deputy foreign minister the purpose of the visit and zuma s meeting with putin was not adequately explained which provoked a great deal of attention and speculation at home despite its prominence on the bilateral agenda nuclear cooperation was conspicuously absent from the south african government s official readout of the visit 46 mahlobo later claimed that zuma had gone to moscow for medical treatment following an assassination attempt 47 just three weeks later in vienna south african and russian representatives signed a formal agreement on strategic nuclear cooperation 48 the agreement was kept confidential and the episode only heightened suspicions about the true nature of the two countries developing nuclear relationship a joint press statement said that the agreement laid the foundation for the large scale nuclear power plants npp procurement and development program of south africa based on the construction in rsa of new nuclear power plants with russian vver reactors with total installed capacity of up to 9 6 gw up to 8 npp units these will be the first npps based on the russian technology to be built on the african continent 49 rosatom s kiriyenko said at the time that the construction portion of the deal was worth upward of 40 50 billion 50 the total deal was estimated to be worth 76 billion 51 scrutiny from civil society groups and zuma s political opponents as well as the government s lack of transparency about the deal and about russia s central role in it created an escalating series of political and legal problems soon thereafter ecodefense a russian environmental nongovernmental organization leaked a copy of the confidential september 2014 agreement to two south african activists the contents of the document made it difficult for the government to convince anyone that it was conducting a proper tender based on bids from french south korean and u s firms let alone subjecting the deal to parliamentary review 52 the activists makoma lekalakala and liz mcdaid won considerable acclaim for stirring grassroots opposition and organizing legal challenges neither zuma nor the russian government appeared to fully appreciate the controversy that they had created or the scale of opposition to the deal according to former finance minister nene s testimony zuma was fully committed to proceeding with the deal at the brics summit in russia in july 2015 even though key financial details had not been resolved 53 nene raised concerns with zuma that the financial details of the deal had been kept from treasury officials only for zuma to criticize him for allegedly failing to fulfill his duties nene was fired in late 2015 even after an april 2017 high court ruling that the nuclear deal was unconstitutional zuma remained defiant he brushed aside demands to adhere to state procurement procedures and accusations of corruption while continuing to look for ways to resuscitate the agreement in the months prior to his resignation he stirred additional controversy by assigning intelligence chief mahlobo to run the department of energy zuma s abrupt resignation sealed the fate of the deal since then his successor ramaphosa has maintained a respectful stance toward moscow even as he has made clear that the nuclear deal is simply unaffordable for now ramaphosa s presence at the inaugural russia africa summit in sochi in october 2019 was overshadowed by a symbolic visit of two russian nuclear capable blackjack bombers to south africa 54 the lack of meaningful deliverables from ramaphosa s visit to russia conveyed an unmistakable impression that the bilateral relationship between russia and south africa today is simply marking time russia s tool kit less than meets the eye the failed nuclear deal was unique in terms of its outsized impact on south africa s domestic political stability potential negative economic consequences and the desire of russian officials to use nuclear power as a tool to expand moscow s footprint in africa for decades to come but the deal also illustrated the limits of russia s reach and its modest tool kit for projecting power and influence in regions far beyond its periphery the failure of the nuclear deal also raised questions about the viability of russia s renewed hopes for wielding greater global influence notably the deal was hardly a coup for russian state coffers the sheer size of the proposal and its projected burden on the south african economy tend to obscure the fact that rosatom was being forced to undertake a massive construction project with uncertain upfront financing and equally uncertain prospects for long term commercial gain 55 in theory rosatom stood to recoup some of these outlays via long term fuel purchases and other service agreements yet in practice it is hard to overlook the fact that the deal was largely a dodgy venture with significant risks driven by geopolitical rather than commercial considerations russia is hardly an attractive economic partner for south africa in most respects bilateral trade is inconsequential and considering the major role of extractive industries in both countries economies they enjoy no natural complementarity russia has long struggled to attract foreign investors and is hardly a promising investment destination for south africa moscow has no history of extending loans to pretoria during the cold war as a result the kremlin could not dangle debt forgiveness one of its primary tools for economic statecraft to incentivize south african political cooperation in multilateral venues like the un as it has long done with partners in other parts of sub saharan africa arms deals are similarly a nonstarter sales of russian conventional weaponry which have been important for moscow s courtship of various african countries have had little appeal for pretoria south africa forced to operate under international sanctions during the apartheid regime has long had its own indigenous armaments industry as a result south africa has neither a legacy arsenal of soviet era weapons and equipment in need of modernization or maintenance nor a need to purchase new russian arms and equipment besides that generational change is gradually eroding russia s other source of leverage the impressive degree of support the kremlin gave to the anc during the apartheid era the legacy of apartheid is present in virtually every aspect of south african life and russia s lack of involvement with the apartheid regime is definitely still an important reputational advantage but the generation of anc leaders who were trained in the soviet union or who may have benefited from soviet support is aging zuma and mbeki are both seventy seven years old modern day russia offers little in the way of practical assistance for helping south africa deal with its deep set economic and societal challenges that is likely to limit its attractiveness as a partner to future generations of south african leaders their attitudes and priorities are more likely to be shaped by the country s complex political life and development needs than by apartheid era nostalgia that leaves two other tools for russia to exploit in expanding ties with south africa high level diplomacy and a hear no evil see no evil approach to doing business south africa s inclusion in the brics and putin s personal involvement in brics diplomacy are undoubtedly useful for sustaining high level ties with south african leaders u s president donald trump s administration s continued inattention to south africa enhances the utility of such personal diplomacy for south africa s leaders annual appearances at brics summits bolster their country s standing on the african continent and offer domestic and international prestige but when south african leaders have sought to use the brics as a platform to deal with the issues of greatest concern to the global south they have discovered that the kremlin is a rather inattentive and fickle champion the lack of tangible deliverables from brics gatherings limits their utility for south africa and inadvertently may even detract from russia s role in these forums by emphasizing the importance of another key power china for south africa at the un moscow has prioritized building close ties with south africa and the countries holding the three rotating african seats on the security council the so called a3 russia and china have frequently dangled the idea of un security council reform in discussions with the a3 and south africa which has been a nonpermanent member of the security council three times moscow and beijing have implied that brics members and other countries of the global south should have greater clout yet russian support appears to be primarily rhetorical 56 russian diplomats seldom if ever specify how reform might work or issue convincing calls for expanding the security council s membership ranks once again russia talks big but does not really deliver russia s lack of interest in upholding ethical norms can be useful in its economic outreach in countries with weak rule of law and civil society but the kremlin learned the hard way the downsides of pursuing a nuclear deal with south africa without much regard for that country s well established legal and administrative institutions and norms independent media landscape and vibrant civil society such institutional checks and balances helped expose the nature of state capture and improper behavior by senior south african officials along with russia s problematic approach to state capitalism zuma s willingness to turn a blind eye to the controversy provided only temporary advantages for the kremlin in the end all of these advantages came to naught a meager inheritance at first glance russia s prospects for securing a foothold in south africa looked quite promising zuma a soviet trained intelligence operative ascended to the presidency under a cloud of corruption allegations the kremlin had successfully leveraged such situations elsewhere in the world over time zuma backed away from south africa s mandela era western leaning foreign policy framework in favor of a more anti western heavily conspiratorial view of the international system to be sure such views have deep roots in the anc even though they are strongly contested zuma s foreign policy aligned rather nicely with russian positions on many issues including the conflicts in libya and syria as well as the threat allegedly posed by so called color revolutions and the hidden hand of self interested western powers but the kremlin overplayed its hand its pursuit of a massive nontransparent nuclear deal mobilized south african civil society and zuma s political opponents instead of anchoring moscow s relationship with pretoria the nuclear deal demonstrated russia s limited reach and lack of appeal as a partner to a country resilient in terms of democratic governance strong civil society organizations press freedoms and political competition another unintended consequence was the impression that the failed nuclear deal was all there was to the south africa russia relationship this exposed russia s limited at best tool kit for long range projection of its power and influence the questionable ethical aspects of the nuclear deal and the kremlin s role in avidly promoting it illustrate the putin regime s reputation as an oftentimes unsavory and shortsighted business partner such deals may appeal to the leaders of countries with weak rule of law and fragile civil society but in south africa any future deals involving russia are likely to attract considerable scrutiny while the questionable benefits of the nuclear deal for south africa have been well documented the dubious economic benefits for russia have drawn less attention this in turn underscores the role of geopolitics and opportunism as the key drivers of russian policy toward south africa with a meager tool kit for sustaining its geopolitical ambitions moscow is finding that success is more elusive than commonly perceived serious questions remain about the tangible benefits such global forays will provide to the kremlin over the long run against the backdrop of the kremlin s interference in the 2016 u s presidential election and in other major western democracies it is tempting to conclude that russia s renewed global activism is producing one success after another unfortunately examples of russian overreach and miscalculation continue to be overlooked south africa stands as a revealing example of the limits of the kremlin s ham fisted dealmaking its limited tool kit and the unsavory tools

global finance capital has seized control of the economies of most nation states the citizens watch helplessly as money and goods are transferred with little regulation across borders they watch as jobs in manufacturing and the professions are shipped to regions of the global south where most workers are paid a dollar or less an hour and receive no benefits they watch as the taxes of the rich and corporations are slashed often to zero they watch as austerity programs dismantle or privatize utilities and basic social services jacking up fees to consumers they watch as chronic unemployment and underemployment devastate workers especially the young they watch as wages stagnate or decline leaving working men and women with unsustainable debts this economic tyranny lies at the root of the unrest in hong kong india chile france iran iraq and lebanon as well as the rise of right wing demagogues and false prophets such as british prime minister boris johnson president donald trump and indian prime minister narendra modi it does not matter whether liberals or conservatives tories or labour republicans or democrats are in power finance capital is impervious to political control the newly defeated labour party in britain by adopting a brexit neutral stance in the election badly misread the zeitgeist yes its leader jeremy corbyn had to contend with hysterical warnings of economic collapse and endured a smear campaign amplified by a media mouthing the accusations of his tory opponents that included claims he was a threat to national security and an anti semite but his and labour s failure to appreciate how desperate workers were for a solution even one growing out of magical thinking about the promise of brexit was a mistake brexit is not a realistic alternative to economic tyranny but it at least offers a hope however unfounded of shattering the bonds of corporate power it posits itself as a weapon in the war between the insiders and the outsiders that this desperate hope by the outsiders is peddled by con artists and charlatans such as johnson and trump is part of the sickness of our age an echo of the economic distortions and right wing populism that saw fascists rise to power in italy and germany in the first part of the 20th century goldman sachs jpmorgan chase citibank exxon mobile walmart apple and amazon are the modern versions of the east india company or la compagnie française de l orient et de la chine these and others among today s global corporations with the assistance of the world bank the world trade organization and the international monetary fund have created unassailable monopolies and effectively hollowed out many nation states both physically and culturally forlorn derelict urban wastelands populated by the bitterly dispossessed are as common in france or britain as they are in america s rust belt governments captive to corporate control have been prostituted to transfer wealth upward swell corporate profits and crush dissent at the expense of democracy the decay and rupture of the social bonds that once held our societies together have unleashed the dark pathologies of opioid alcohol and gambling addictions and led to an explosion of hate crimes and mass shootings along with suicide social control provided by work civic and political participation bonds that integrated us into our communities and gave us a sense of place dignity and agency has been handed over to a heavily militarized police a massive prison system and a judicial system complicit in abolishing basic rights including due process and privacy so to steal a line from vladimir lenin what is to be done can a reformist political candidate a bernie sanders or perhaps an elizabeth warren although i question the authenticity of warren defeat trump and the retrograde forces that empower him or will the u s reformers suffer corbyn s fate in short can the system be reformed from the inside or will we have to take to the streets as the people are doing in chile lebanon france hong kong and elsewhere to demand the overthrow of corporate rule the left even under corbyn is not ready to speak in revolutionary language revolutionary rhetoric within the political system has been adopted by the neofascists and the hard right the brexit debate is about blowing up the system not working within it those who support brexit and johnson will like those who support trump be betrayed but the language employed by johnson and trump is about destruction and this yearning for destruction runs deep among the working class the tragedy is that by backing these demagogues the public is complicit in its own enslavement extinction rebellion which i support is attempting to counter this corporate assault and the consequent ecocide with revolutionary language and sustained civil disobedience designed to make governance impossible i hope extinction rebellion will gain enough popular support to raise a strong barrier before the corporate state starts employing the brute force outlined in operation yellowhammer the six page british government plan that calls for the possible deployment of 50 000 regular and reserved troops and 10 000 riot police to cope with the unrest that might be caused by food and medical shortages following britain s departure from the european union the violent suppression of protesters in france chile iraq iran lebanon india and hong kong is already underway a window into what may be coming to england the united states and other countries that attempt to throw off the yoke of corporate oppression the corporate state loathes the political left but the american political left by agreeing to operate within the constrained and largely rigged electoral system is easily neutered as liberalism was this year in britain and was in 2016 and will be in 2020 in the united states america s democratic party leadership as hostile to its progressive candidates as many in the labour party hierarchy in britain were to corbyn employed a series of measures to prevent sanders from obtaining the nomination in 2016 they included a superdelegates scheme the use of hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate money iron control of the democratic national committee and blocking those registered as independents from voting in democratic primaries politicians such as sanders and corbyn are easily dispatched but while the corporate state detests political mavericks such as sanders and corbyn it both hates and fears the revolutionary left the revolutionary left speaks an unvarnished truth about corporate power and calls out the entire political ruling class for its complicity it is not interested in accommodation it seeks to disrupt and paralyze the corporate state when many thousands as in hong kong take to the streets shouting slogans like there are no rioters only a tyrannical regime and it was you who taught me that peaceful marches are useless the corporate ruling elites begin to worry this is why populist leaders including eric drouet of the gilets jaunes or yellow vests in france are arrested it is why roger hallam the co founder of extinction rebellion spent six weeks in jail this fall in britain it is why edward leung is serving a six year prison sentence on charges of rioting and assaulting a police officer during the 2016 fishball revolution in hong kong revolutionaries refuse to play by the rules these global revolutionary movements embody a resurrection of the concept of the common good the belief that a society should be structured around caring for all its members especially the most vulnerable they are forces of solidarity even community they understand as the economist karl polanyi wrote that there are two kinds of freedoms there are the bad freedoms to exploit those around us and extract huge profits without regard to the common good and there are the good freedoms freedom of conscience freedom of speech freedom of meeting freedom of association freedom to choose one s job that the bad freedoms destroy the bad freedoms championed by an atomized hyper individualistic consumer culture which kneels before the cult of the self have triumphed the death grip of the ruling elites was illustrated in recent days in madrid where world leaders refused during cop25 the united nations conference on climate change to take meaningful action to halt the climate emergency an existential threat to humankind the bankrupt ideologies of globalization and neoliberalism formulated and used to justify the consolidation of wealth and power as well as the ecocide that is devastating the planet have however lost their credibility neoliberalism the idea that once regulations on corporations and trade barriers are lifted and taxes slashed a society will prosper was always an absurdity none of its promises could be defended by the history and theory of economics concentrating wealth in the hands of a global oligarchic elite eight families now hold as much wealth as 50 percent of the world s population while demolishing government controls and regulations sending production to the global south privatizing public services and destroying labor unions does not distribute wealth allowing global speculators to use money lent to them by the government at virtually zero percent interest to buy back their stock does not distribute wealth permitting corporations to engage in structured asset destruction through inflation to strip assets through mergers and acquisitions to raise the levels of debt incumbency to enforce debt peonage on the public to engage in corporate fraud that includes the dispossession of assets does not distribute wealth the raiding of pension funds credit and stock manipulations and looting the u s treasury when the bubbles and ponzi schemes evaporate does not distribute wealth such actions funnel wealth to those at the top they create enormous income inequality and monopoly power they fuel discontent and political extremism they make the planet uninhabitable for most species they destroy democracy but economic rationality was never the point the point was the restoration of class power neoliberalism transforms freedom for the many into freedom for the few the idiocy of the intellectual gurus who sold us this ideology milton friedman friedrich hayek and ayn rand should have exposed the con from the beginning but they were given ample platforms while their critics the old keynesians were pushed out and silenced freedom became equated with freedom of market forces to do anything the capitalists wanted and that freedom doomed us and looks set to doom the ecosystem on which we depend for life karl marx in volume one of capital explained over a century ago how freedom of the market always results in social inequality the loss of credibility of the reigning ideology has led the ruling elites to forge an alliance with right wing neofascist demagogues such as trump and johnson who employ the tropes of racism islamophobia homophobia bigotry and misogyny to channel the public s growing rage and frustration away from the corporate elites and toward the vulnerable these demagogues accelerate the pillage they accelerate the hatred racism and violence that act as a diversion and they accelerate the social unrest that becomes the excuse for the imposition of tyranny hope lies in the streets millions of people in hong kong india chile france iran iraq and lebanon understand it is time to join them
source xinhua 2019 12 16 18 02 12 editor huaxia video player close by xinhua writer gao wencheng beijing dec 16 xinhua haunted by trade tensions a manufacturing downturn and geopolitical uncertainty 2019 is set to witness the weakest global economic expansion in a decade at this delicate juncture where the global economy remains fragile even though the financial crisis ended 10 years ago more certainty an anchor if you will is needed that is why the world economy will breathe a sigh of relief as the chinese economy has remained resilient this year synchronized slowdown in global growth the global economy is in a synchronized slowdown said the international monetary fund imf in its latest world economic outlook in the october outlook the imf further downgraded its expectations for world economic growth to 3 percent for 2019 the slowest pace since the global financial crisis growth for advanced economies is projected to slow to 1 7 percent in 2019 while emerging market and developing economies will experience growth of 3 9 percent this year a notable feature of the sluggish growth in 2019 is the sharp and geographically broad based slowdown in manufacturing and global trade the washington based institution said u s gross domestic product gdp increased at a 2 1 percent annualized rate in the third quarter marking a sharp deceleration from the 3 1 percent in the first quarter with growth in consumer spending which accounts for about 70 percent of u s economic activity at a 2 9 percent rate lower than the 4 6 percent growth pace in the second quarter the european union s statistics office eurostat estimated that eurozone growth was a meager 0 2 percent in the third quarter against the previous three months the same as in the second quarter and lower than that of the first quarter moreover the european commission has said that euro area gdp is forecast to expand by 1 1 percent in 2019 downgraded by 0 1 percentage points from its previous projections japan s gdp grew an annualized 1 8 percent in july september the weakest growth seen this year as sales tax hike and weakening external demand are hanging over its economy among emerging market and developing economies india grew by 4 5 percent during july september quarter the slowest growth pace in six years the european bank for reconstruction and development predicted that the russian economy will record growth of 1 1 percent in 2019 south africa s economy shrank by 0 6 percent in the third quarter with its yearly economic growth rate projected at just 0 5 percent according to the un s economic commission for latin america and the caribbean the region s overall growth this year should be only 0 1 percent easy monetary policy mounting uncertainty combined with insufficient technological innovation aging populations and geopolitical disputes have posed challenges to global economic expansion among them rising trade tensions initiated by protectionists and their impact on exports as well as industrial production took a major toll on the world economy according to the world trade organization wto trade flows hit by new restrictions implemented by wto members continued at a historically high level between mid october 2018 and mid may 2019 with the trade coverage of import restrictive measures implemented during the review period estimated at 339 5 billion u s dollars the geneva based organization also said recently that world merchandise trade volumes are expected to rise by only 1 2 percent in 2019 substantially slower than the 2 6 percent growth forecast in april an economic outlook issued this year by the organization for economic co operation and development identified trade tensions as the principal factor weighing on the world economy it underlined that the cycle of trade disputes hurts manufacturing disrupts global value chains and generates significant uncertainty analysts said that behind the main challenges facing the world economy are the trade protectionist moves by certain countries and disruption to the rules based multilateral trading system to dampen the headwinds from slowing global growth numerous central banks including the u s federal reserve and the european central bank have announced interest cuts in an attempt to stimulate economies some of which even adopted unconventional monetary measures such as negative interest rates easy monetary policies across advanced and emerging economies may have helped avert a serious economic downturn in the short run but challenges such as rising debt inflated asset bubbles and increased vulnerability of the financial system have also emerged vitor gaspar director of the imf fiscal affairs department advised policymakers to follow prudent fiscal policies saying that the interest rates are negative in many advanced economies and further decreases in policy interest rates are limited china s role in pursuit of certainty china and the united states have agreed on the text of a phase one economic and trade agreement based on the principle of equality and mutual respect according to a statement issued by the chinese side on friday as the global economy faces downward pressure the agreement will boost confidence in the global market stabilize market expectations and create a favorable environment for normal economic trade and investment activities the statement said policymakers must undo the trade barriers put in place with durable agreements rein in geopolitical tensions and reduce domestic policy uncertainty imf chief economist gita gopinath has said such actions can help boost confidence and reinvigorate investment manufacturing and trade gopinath added in the october world economic outlook the imf projected a modest improvement in global growth to 3 4 percent in 2020 with 1 7 percent for advanced economies and 4 6 percent for emerging market and developing economies next year emerging and developing economies are expected to act as the main engine of the world economy with china s role of a stabilizer and engine china s overall gdp growth reached 6 2 percent year on year in the first three quarters of this year the fastest among major economies worldwide according to official data facing significant external headwinds from trade protectionism in some major economies china has maintained stable growth in 2019 with main economic indicators kept within an appropriate range said yi gang governor of the people s bank of china furthermore kiyoyuki seguchi research director at the canon institute for global studies noticed the chinese economic policies today are marked by a devotion to high quality development rather than quantitative expansion as imf managing director kristalina georgieva said china has been a major growth engine for the world economy and its economic health bears global significance
interview with benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb conducted by jean quatremer on 4 december and published on 16 december 2019 on 25 september sabine lautenschläger the german member of the executive board resigned after the public sector purchase programme pspp europe s quantitative easing was reactivated on 13 september following a majority decision of the governing council several other ecb members also voted against and the governors of the german austrian and dutch central banks openly criticised this decision what happened in september the euro area was facing the risk of a further slowdown and inflation was remaining too far away from our 2 objective the entire governing council agreed on this diagnosis the debate was not about the need to act but about the choice of instruments some of us were not convinced that relaunching asset purchases was the most suitable instrument because long term interest rates had never been so low it s normal for there to be different points of view but once a decision has been taken we should accept it and move on in fact that s one of the ecb s greatest qualities that it can take decisions by simple majority making it more reactive than other european institutions not everyone has to be in agreement although it s better when they are as that gives the decision more weight a technical debate that nevertheless resulted in an open and intense confrontation sabine resigned for a combination of personal reasons and only she can comment on them another relevant topic is communication i think that once the institution has taken a decision whatever your personal opinion you should defend that decision things would be different if the votes were public which is something i ve always supported each individual would have to take responsibility for their vote and explain how it was in the interest of the euro area the national central bank governors sit in frankfurt in a personal capacity and should support the collective interest not just their country s since the start of the euro area crisis in 2010 the bundesbank has routinely voted against the ecb s decisions criticised them publicly even joined legal actions against it the governing council was almost unanimous in its agreement that the measures taken during the crisis were both necessary and within the ecb s mandate i m thinking particularly about the decision on outright monetary transactions omts that we took in september 2012 to protect the euro area from speculation that could have forced some countries out of the single currency that decision was almost unanimous the single vote against came from the president of the bundesbank who thought these operations crossed the line separating monetary and fiscal policy as it was designed to support a euro area country s bond market that was under attack from the markets this was not the opinion of the governing council which had spent the entire summer of 2012 ensuring that this line would not be crossed we therefore made our intervention conditional on the activation of a european stability mechanism esm adjustment programme that is essential because it means it is not the ecb that is reforming a country s economy or getting a country s public finances back on their feet when it asks for help the country has to do this itself within the framework of an esm programme then the ecb can provide the liquidity that enables the bond market to stabilise moreover the european court of justice ruled in our favour we seem to be witnessing a real clash of ideologies between the left and right within the ecb as your zero rates policy is resulting in the euthanisation of the rentier to borrow a 19th century phrase meaning it s hurting savers and pensioners hence the criticism from germany and the netherlands but helping workers or growth in other words it s a false dichotomy one of my regrets is that we haven t managed to convince the german public of the merits of our policy on the one hand monetary policy always and everywhere affects the balance between saving and consumption via interest rates if it didn t do that it would serve no purpose and on the other hand in a period where unemployment skyrockets growth slows or there is the threat of deflation as was the case in 2012 and 2014 it is normal for the ecb to be on the side of employment i have no concerns here it s part of our mandate without growth and employment you cannot have price stability our policy is in the interest of the euro area as a whole and therefore of germany it s as simple as that as soon as you have a single market and a single currency there s no point artificially setting the interests of different countries against each other because we are all in the same boat your policies have also weakened the banks who have seen their margins shrink to the point that some of them are no longer concerned about charging for deposits on the one hand interest rates are not low because of the ecb us lowering our key rates for example the rate at which bank deposits held with the ecb are remunerated to very low or even negative levels means that there is a savings glut in the economy the natural rate of interest has fallen due to weak growth the ageing population and a sort of anxiety in the global economy leading to demand for very safe assets like government bonds but for monetary policy to work and stimulate the economy the interest rates set by the central bank have to be below this equilibrium rate if one wants to return to a situation in which savings generate returns and conditions are supportive for the financial sector criticising the central bank achieves nothing action needs to be taken on the fundamentals to boost returns on capital which would naturally lead to interest rates increasing and the central bank could follow on the other hand it is true that the fact that the yield curve is flat in other words that interest rates are low across the maturity spectrum is weighing on the financial sector indeed the difference between the long term performance of savings and the short term cost of funding is currently almost zero but what is weighing even more heavily on the profitability of european banks is that they have a cost base that is much higher than that of banks in the united states japan the united kingdom and scandinavia and that in certain countries they have non performing loans on their balance sheet that no longer yield a return and finally there are too many banks in europe and consolidation has not started so we need fewer banks in the euro area the banking union hasn t yet enabled consolidation within the sector we need to see cross border m a activity in the banking sector and we also need to overcome a number of obstacles to banking activity but the banking union has played a useful role in stabilising a sector that is now much more robust than it was in 2012 since the ecb has taken on the role of banking supervisor and has strengthened capital and liquidity requirements it is important to recognise that one of the major achievements of the past eight years has been to reduce the influence of the banking lobby the banking union has put a stop to the vicious triangle that existed in each country between big banks the regulator in other words the finance ministry and the supervisor which was generally the national central bank we have created some distance between the banking sector and the supervisor which is a good thing for the people of europe another effect of your monetary policy has been to create the conditions for a new real estate bubble since there s no longer any return on savings there is a risk but we re not there yet there are local tensions but nothing that affects the euro area as a whole preventing risks has to start at the national level if property prices are soaring in a particular city is the problem related to mortgage lending or is it related to land use planning in the latter case that certainly falls outside the ecb s purview financial institutions are fundamentally stronger than they were in 2008 because they re better capitalised and they have to comply with stricter rules particularly when it comes to measuring their risks for example basel iii has imposed limits on banks use of internal models previously they could calculate themselves the risks they were taking and this made them overconfident that said if we remain in this environment of low interest rates for a long time the risk of real estate bubbles will of course increase i would like the ecb to develop an approach which allows a better comparison between the benefits for the real economy of low interest rates and the risks created through the financial sector at the moment it s not clear at what point the risks start to outweigh the benefits isn t there also a need to strengthen the rules that banks need to observe when granting a loan macroprudential tools offer scope to tighten capital requirements for banks and the conditions they impose on borrowers if financial stability problems appear to be emerging such measures are taken at the national level in france for example the high council for financial stability which is chaired by the finance minister has taken measures related to lending to large firms and to housing loans if the ecb thinks that a country isn t doing enough it can take matters into its own hands the european systemic risk board identifies risks and can make recommendations to individual countries but if the ecb thinks that this doesn t go far enough it can take charge and impose additional requirements at the european level something that has so far never been done the area where no tools exist and this is a matter of concern is non bank activity since the financial crisis there has been a shift towards the non bank sector banks have shrunk their balance sheets while investment funds money market funds and asset managers continue to grow and are effectively financing the economy so if an investment fund buys a portfolio of loans from a bank it becomes a creditor to firms and households yet there is much less supervision and fewer prudential tools in this sector this is where major work will be needed in the coming years we need to develop a macroprudential approach for non bank activity so that credit conditions can be tightened if necessary since you started at the ecb in january 2012 the institution has undergone a fundamental transformation it used to be much like the bundesbank but now it acts more like the us federal reserve the existential crises we went through first with spain and italy in summer 2012 and then with greece in summer 2015 and the actions of one man mario draghi who was president of the ecb until november this year gave us the necessary maturity to make full use of the instruments granted to us by the treaties does this mean that we have become like the federal reserve in a certain sense yes because we are equipped with a comprehensive toolbox to support the euro area economy at all times using tools like quantitative easing inspired by the us model and the capacity to intervene in the markets but there are also significant differences for a start we don t have the same mandate the federal reserve has a dual mandate that gives equal weighting to price stability and full employment while the ecb s mandate prioritises price stability and our financial markets are not the same bond markets in the united states are very deep and liquid which gives the federal reserve an almost unlimited capacity for intervention in europe there is no capital markets union bond markets are fragmented across 19 countries which limits the capacity of monetary policy are you proud of what has been accomplished there are three things i take pride in first mario draghi s speech in july 2012 when he said that the ecb within its mandate would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro and the creation of outright monetary transactions which were the concrete manifestation of that commitment and made it possible to maintain the integrity of the euro area then there was the episode with greece which was of course very controversial as can be seen in the costa gavras film adults in the room but when the greek government was close to bankruptcy we ensured the continued financing of the greek economy and of greek banks which had lost access to the markets and to their own savers following a capital flight while respecting the political will of euro area governments that the assistance to greece should be conditional our actions ultimately allowed greece to remain in the euro there were those who wanted to make the ecb responsible for greece leaving the euro area but we resisted that and the third thing i m proud of is the quantitative easing we launched in 2015 which averted the risk of deflation any regrets we probably started quantitative easing qe a little too late though i m not blaming anyone it was a major innovation which required an immense effort of persuasion within the governing council for example we had long discussions as to who would bear the risk of these asset purchases and we finally decided that 80 would be borne by the national central banks on their balance sheets and not by the ecb the idea was to prevent qe a massive purchase of public securities we now hold almost a third of total european debt equivalent to 20 of euro area gdp from being a way of ushering in a fiscal union through the back door against the wishes of member states we also underestimated the impact that the policy of fiscal austerity would have on activity this policy was enshrined in the treaty on stability coordination and governance and was necessary at the time in order to provide stability to the financial markets but this would have required a more accommodative monetary policy as recommended by the imf going as far as qe which should have been running from 2010 rather than from 2015 finally we may have sat on the fence for slightly too long with regard to climate change even if that is not our core task other central banks such as the bank of england became aware of it earlier than we did for one climate change needs to be integrated into financial sector supervision taking into account the risks it poses for certain sectors of activity and financial securities and we need to reflect on its consequences for monetary policy and then there were other errors that were not of our making one reason for the deterioration of the crisis in the euro area was that we lagged far behind the united states in cleaning up the financial sector the european countries were deluding themselves about the state of their banks and we were very late in conducting serious stress tests and imposing recapitalisations certain countries including france even fought rearguard actions so as to avoid bolstering their large banks capital base all of this has weighed on growth we now need to make sure we don t slip back again christine lagarde has announced that she will lead a review of the ecb s strategy christine lagarde is right it s a good idea to step back and lead such a discussion i hope that the debate will not be held solely within the ecb but that independent economists and civil society representatives will be involved too if we look back on how the euro has fared since 1999 we can see that it did not produce all the effects that people had hoped for trade in the euro area is declining the capital markets union is in limbo countries with large capital surpluses such as germany or the netherlands are investing them in the united states or in china etc in fact the country that is gaining the most from the euro is germany which amply benefits from the euro s undervaluation everyone benefits from the euro because the exchange rate risk has disappeared and financial conditions for investment have never been so favourable likewise the euro is a common good that enables us to speak with one voice on the international scene even if we don t make enough use of this strength but it is true that we created the euro which was backed up with the banking union and the european stability mechanism to enable a single european market and the fact is that this market is at a standstill why because at the outset it was conceived as a space for the free movement of goods whereas we are now in a service economy and there is no single market for services you cannot ignore the northern european countries refusal to offer financial solidarity we have a political problem the european states have a single currency which through its very existence is an extraordinary expression of solidarity but they tend to see the euro area too much as a club with free membership giving them the right to a certain number of services however participation in the euro brings with it a duty of solidarity when your neighbour is going through a rough patch while it s true that the member states fulfilled their duty towards greece ireland portugal cyprus and spain they did so under conditions that were extremely costly or even toxic on a political level the adjustment programmes generated huge tensions and acrimony and conversely you need to keep your own house in order to avoid creating problems for your neighbours countries can have whatever economic policy they want that s democracy but on the condition that they do not jeopardise their neighbours to that end the members of the club need to observe certain rules in reality however countries have little regard for those rules one day we will need to create ad hoc institutions including an authority in charge of a euro area budget which would embody the collective interest have decision making powers and be accountable before the european parliament for as long as that is not in place we will have to cross our fingers and hope that no crisis occurs so is the ecb making up for the failure of political will yes the lack of coordination in the fiscal domain means that we are the ones who are doing the work i dream of a euro area with a strong and democratic political base which would alleviate the burden on the ecb the politicisation of the ecb results from the weakness of the political pillar of economic and monetary union some people accuse the ecb of doing too much and of not being democratic enough but the excessive expectations projected onto the ecb are only a reflection of political weakness

the prospect is proud to exclusively release the book take back our party restoring the democratic legacy by james kwak we will release one chapter every other day over the next two weeks read the introduction chapter 1 and chapter 2 the first question is how is what you re selling unique don draper in mad men marketing is something that everyone thinks he or she is an expert in we may not know how to design or build a computer we may not have the guts to try to sell a million dollars worth of software to a large company but we all know a good tagline or a bad television commercial when we see it i know this because i worked in marketing for most of my time in the business world which meant that most of my colleagues thought perhaps with good reason that they could do my job as well as i could i don t often write about my business experience it just isn t that relevant to most questions of economics policy or politics no matter what ross perot george w bush donald trump and a host of businessmen turned politicians like to say building and selling a product is very different from balancing the interests of multiple constituencies to cobble together a package of policy initiatives that serve most people more or less well while responding to external shocks and threats like recessions or hostile regimes there are however a few basic principles of marketing that apply reasonably well to the political arena first whatever you are selling your message has to relate to something that your audience cares about if you are selling expensive software systems to large companies something i did a lot of you need to talk about how you can improve their business or reduce their costs not the fanciest features of your cutting edge technology second you have to differentiate yourself from your competitors if everyone else claims that they help companies save money you should focus on how you help them attract new customers third your message has to be legitimately based on your actual product if you try to position yourself as the reliable bulletproof no risk option you had better have the product to back it up or the market will soon see through you that s why don draper starts off by asking a budding computer entrepreneur about his product and what is unique about it once upon a time the democratic party did all of these things well in the 1930s in the depths of the great depression president franklin roosevelt s central theme was economic security jobs for the unemployed and pensions for the elderly he identified the democrats as the party of common people portraying the republicans as flunkies of the rich in the pocket of wall street in a 1936 speech he listed his enemies business and financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteering he continued they are unanimous in their hate for me and i welcome their hatred and roosevelt backed up his words with action his first term in office saw structural regulation of the financial sector major public works programs and the creation of social security there could be no doubt about what the democratic party stood for and why you should vote for or against it in recent decades however our party has forgotten these core principles not surprisingly we have been routinely pummeled at the polls by our opponents up and down the ballot and all across the country since the 1994 election republicans have controlled both houses of congress for 14 years democrats for only four and that thanks to george w bush s catastrophic incompetence and the iraq war between 2009 and 2017 republicans captured more than 950 seats in state legislatures from democrats and the number of states in which they controlled the legislature grew from 14 to 32 in the 2017 and 2018 anti trump elections republicans lost about 300 seats and control of two legislatures on the presidential level where democrats have best been able to compete thanks to occasionally charismatic nominees and the ability to match republicans financially we somehow lost the unlosable elections of 2000 and 2016 when the hand picked successors of popular presidents running in favorable economic environments somehow made the contest close enough that the electoral college mattered and these dismal results came even as the republicans drifted further to the right and further away from a voting public whose expressed preferences on health care taxes immigration and even cultural issues such as gay marriage are closer to the democrats the most striking example of bad political marketing in recent years of course was the 2016 presidential election there are many reasons why donald trump defeated hillary clinton including his exploitation of anti immigrant anti female and anti minority sentiments among part of the electorate we have to remember however that most americans are not xenophobic misogynistic and racist and trump s embrace of these positions should not have been a winning strategy while clinton was unmistakably the candidate of tolerance and diversity as well as basic human decency respect for the facts and facility with the english language what made the election close in the first place was her inability to explain to ordinary voters what her administration would actually do for them hillary clinton s basic promise was to make the economy work for everyone and to drive growth that s strong fair and lasting political campaigns are shifting targets so i will focus here on a major speech she gave in june 2016 to lay out her economic vision her plan focused on five key points create better jobs make college debt free change regulations to encourage corporations to pay their employees more and deter them from shifting jobs or profits overseas increase taxes on corporations and the rich in particular by eliminating the tax break for carried interest and implementing the buffett rule which would impose a minimum overall tax rate on the wealthy put families first by providing paid family leave and better employment benefits as policy these are all decent ideas as politics they miss the mark beginning with the fact that three of her five points were really broad headings that encompassed laundry lists of actual ideas in her speech her plan to create better jobs included 22 different policy proposals by my count a platform oriented around growth for everyone is too broad to address anyone s most important concerns how many people sitting at the kitchen table late at night wondering how to pay the bills think to themselves if only the economy would grow faster with the exception of debt free college a position clinton was pushed into by the popularity of the bernie sanders campaign and paid family leave her proposals did not promise to solve the concrete problems of working and middle class americans today people who have jobs but struggle with rising rents or medical bills are unlikely to see how raising taxes on hedge fund managers or investing in broadband infrastructure is likely to help them in addition clinton failed to explain how her vague promise to create more higher paying jobs was better than or even significantly different from the republicans perpetual promise to create more higher paying jobs by cutting taxes and eliminating regulations her talking points included investing in infrastructure encouraging advanced manufacturing improving access to credit for small businesses by slashing unnecessary regulations on banks freeing entrepreneurs to do what they do best and providing tax credits to encourage private sector investment and apprenticeship programs in other words a long catalog of nudges to try to get profit seeking businesses to hire a few more people at somewhat higher wages once she conceded that all good things come from markets and the private sector all clinton could argue was that she would be a better economic manager than trump probably true but hardly compelling even in a speech about the economy her most effective means of differentiating herself from her opponent was invoking demographic issues immigration reform systemic racism equal pay for women and gay rights after the 2016 debacle laid bare the failure of the party to address ordinary americans economic concerns the democratic leadership promised to develop a new platform that would in the words of senate minority leader chuck schumer show the country that we re the party on the side of working people the campaign they rolled out under the headline a better deal however was so broad as to be meaningless we stand for three simple things schumer pledged first we re going to increase people s pay second we re going to reduce their everyday expenses and third we re going to provide workers with the tools they need for the 21st century economy party spokespeople afraid to say anything that might turn away any potential voter somehow managed to avoid differentiating the democratic party from the most toxic presidential administration in american history expand tom williams cq roll call via ap images chuck schumer after a news conference unveiling a better deal on trade and jobs august 2 2017 we want to be in a position to help create 10 million good paying full time jobs representative cheri bustos of illinois one of the designers of a better deal said in one meeting to pitch newspaper editors there are still people hurting and i think we need to acknowledge that and say that we want to do something about that chuck sweeny a reporter answered donald trump says that too he says exactly the same thing too many people are still out of work you know we need to do something about bringing back jobs bustos even went on to argue for lowering the corporate tax rate at the time one of trump s few coherent proposals to which sweeney responded once again i have no idea what the democratic party actually stands for anymore nor does anyone else the democrats did win a majority of the house of representatives in 2018 while losing two seats in the senate but they did so largely by ignoring a better deal and riding a wave of anti trump resentment that had been seeking an outlet for two years when it came to economic issues their most potent weapon was an old fashioned defense of a federal entitlement in this case protections for people with preexisting conditions the 2018 elections proved that democrats can still put up a fight when republicans go after popular government programs but the first major weakness of the democratic economic platform in recent decades has been a failure to talk about the economic issues that most people actually care about presidents obama and clinton liked nothing more than invoking the soaring rhetoric of growth and opportunity schumer bustos and the rest of the leadership seem to think that repeating the word jobs will enable them to connect with the working class but for most people growth and opportunity are just abstract concepts and jobs are not what keep them up late at night few people setting aside their medical bills because they are afraid to open them think that a larger economy will be the solution to their problems or that cheaper student loans will turn their lives around nor are jobs the answer to all problems for one thing the unemployment rate is historically low it was less than 5 percent when donald trump was elected president and has since fallen as low as 3 5 percent it is true that many people have given up on looking for jobs and are not counted in those figures although the broadest measure of unemployment which includes discouraged and underemployed workers is also at the lowest level since 2000 but workers without the skills to find employment in a highly favorable labor market are unlikely to think that the existence of more job openings will magically make them better off the economy has been growing for a decade and unemployment is low yet tens of millions of people still face a daily struggle to make ends meet people have real economic anxieties the cost of health care and the prospect of illness paying for their children s education finding a place where they can afford to live or not being able to retire in recent decades mainstream democrats have responded by promising that growth jobs and prosperity would solve all of these pocketbook concerns of course it is logically true that if someone makes more money she will have more to spend on health care education housing or retirement but speaking in vague generalities is not the way to convince voters that you understand and will address the challenges that they face especially when ordinary americans who have lived through the past 40 years can see that prosperity has largely passed them by in 2000 for example the centerpiece of al gore s economic platform was his promise to maintain budget surpluses and use them to pay down the national debt while this may have been a sound policy as politics it appealed only to a handful of policy wonks and perhaps the bond traders president clinton had complained about more generally the desire to be seen as fiscally responsible market oriented centrists and not as architects of the welfare state has constrained democrats ability to say anything compelling on the subjects people care about most instead the party line on education has been increased accountability and competition from charter schools on housing relaxing constraints on financial institutions to stimulate the mortgage market and on retirement incentives to help people save in private accounts sold by the asset management industry the one exception has been health care which both bill clinton and barack obama made the centerpiece of their initial presidential campaigns while both were willing to offer a new federal program in both cases they took care to highlight the role of markets and private insurers ironically some of the democratic party s greatest political successes have come when it has posed as the defender of the welfare state recall the government shutdowns of 1995 1996 which president clinton successfully framed as a battle to defend medicare the resounding defeat of president george w bush s 2005 campaign to privatize social security the 2012 electoral wins following paul ryan s proposal to privatize medicare and the 2018 defense of the affordable care act while a relentless focus on preexisting conditions helped win in the house the strategy of playing to the middle to hold onto vulnerable senate seats in red states largely failed moderates such as joe donnelly and heidi heitkamp thought that collaborating with republicans on a 2018 financial deregulation bill would win themselves points for sensible bipartisanship only to be soundly defeated in november expand david phillip ap photo bush and gore wait for the start of a debate at wake forest university october 11 2000 politically speaking nothing suits democratic politicians quite so well as a republican attack on a major entitlement program which enables them to take up arms on behalf of the common man and yet they are mortally afraid of proposing anything that might sound like an expansion of those programs and the size of the federal government the democrats defensive crouch of protecting entitlement programs can win an election here and there but taking an emphatic stand for comprehensive economic security would build the party s brand as the champion of the ordinary voter the second fundamental flaw in our economic messaging is that it fails don draper s uniqueness test the current democratic party s economic platform boiled down to its essence is that sound management of market capitalism will promote growth bringing jobs and prosperity to everyone this is scarcely distinguishable from the republican platform which is that market capitalism will promote growth bringing jobs and prosperity to everyone did you catch the difference worse the republican story is better it is simpler more memorable and more intuitive for the past half century the conservative mantra has been unchanged government suppresses innovation and entrepreneurship so minimizing taxes and regulation will unleash the power of free markets and generate prosperity for everyone regardless of whether this is true it s easy to understand and communicate in memorable sound bites cowed by the potent symbolism of this story democrats have been afraid to stand up for the importance of collective action instead conceding that market capitalism is the answer to all economic problems and that the role of government is to support the private sector we attempt to distinguish ourselves from republican zealots by displaying our superior understanding of economics because markets are prone to failures externalities adverse selection moral hazard and so on we argue smart government policies are necessary to make them run optimally and maximize social welfare plus we continue the republicans are actually incompetent hypocrites who run up spending on foreign wars while democrats are the most prudent stewards of the national balance sheet everything we say may be true smart public policy can improve market functioning and republican administrations in recent decades have been associated with lower economic growth and higher deficits to say nothing of the tax cut fueled disaster that was sam brownback s tenure as governor of kansas but none of that matters as far as marketing and hence politics is concerned the conservative republican credo is passionate unequivocal and inspiring give people liberty and they will do great things by comparison the democratic response is derivative intellectual and patronizing unregulated markets generally produce good outcomes but not always and that s why narrowly tailored government interventions are necessary to make people better off if anyone is still paying attention we keep expecting the electorate to reward us for our greater intellectual refinement and our ability to use empirical evidence correctly forgetting that voters don t care about such things the feebleness of our economic message is particularly apparent today president trump s story of how he will make the economy great again is simple stop immigrants from stealing americans jobs negotiate new trade deals that will enable us to defeat our trade partners eliminate government regulations that stifle companies and cut taxes to stimulate innovation and industry the democratic response is that immigrants help the economy trade barriers hurt all countries involved markets need regulation and the optimal tax rate is actually higher than current levels again we may be right on all counts but at best we have captured the overeducated intellectual vote we have forgotten that while membership in the reality based community can help win votes against an outrageous target like president trump on its own it cannot generate the political support necessary to roll back decades of rightward drift and stem the rising tide of inequality the core problem is that we have let ourselves be maneuvered onto the enemy s home turf once both sides agree that the sole source of prosperity is the private sector republicans can keep repeating their one easily understandable talking point get government out of the way and let capitalism flourish or as former house majority leader dick armey said the market is rational and the government is dumb democrats can t offer anything equally bold for two reasons first once we have accepted the basic premise that markets know best all we have to offer are nudges that try to get those markets to behave a little bit better than they currently do even the best designed nudges say automatic enrollment in 401 k plans are limited in what they can achieve and are ill suited to galvanize voters second our insistence that everything must be budget neutral based on our profound fear of being seen as fiscally irresponsible prevents us from using the one powerful political weapon in the traditional left wing arsenal the promise of a bold new program even the green new deal which is urgently needed in order to among other things protect the continued existence of our species continues to be opposed and undermined by centrist democrats there s no way to pay for it senator dianne feinstein said in a hostile lecture to 15 children on this battleground we cannot win if you look at the typical profile of the candidates that democratic congressional leaders like to recruit and support it s almost as if they are admitting that fact for the last decade the prototype has been people with compelling personal profiles particularly veterans with combat experience in afghanistan or iraq strong fundraising potential and inoffensive middle of the road policy ideas particularly on economic issues looking ahead to 2020 rahm emanuel president obama s first chief of staff and a leading power broker in the party listed authenticity credibility and viability as the key ingredients to defeating president trump with scarcely a mention of standing for anything in particular american conservatives discovered long ago that the way to effect real long term change is to come up with bold ideas on issues that people care about and champion them passionately and persistently until the country moves in your direction we democrats may consider those conservative ideas to be crazy but instead of offering bold ideas of our own we continue to muddle through trying to squeak out one election victory at a time by offending as few people as possible the democratic party could start talking about the real economic problems that american families face today and we could come up with a message that clearly differentiates us from the republicans some politicians already have but the third failing of our political strategy will take much longer to fix it is a widespread belief that marketing is the same thing as advertising coming up with catchy slogans and images that induce people to buy something this notion is especially prevalent in that peculiar branch of marketing known as politics in this age of low information voters the story goes a candidate need only figure out what different groups adding up to 51 percent of the electorate want through surveys and focus groups and then promise them that winning politicians are those who can identify key themes that resonate with voters and boil them down into powerful sound bites of which build the wall is the latest example the losers fail to come up with the right message or they change their message too often or they can t deliver their message effectively but as discussed above this isn t how marketing works marketing begins with understanding what your target customers want and then building it it wasn t the think different campaign brilliant as it was that rescued apple from oblivion in the late 1990s and early 2000s what mattered was that the company introduced the imac os x the ipod and the itunes store within less than five years without excellent products that people wanted to buy billboards featuring muhammad ali mahatma gandhi and pablo picasso would have become just another failed gimmick deserving a brief footnote in advertising history spending lots of money on a flashy campaign will get you attention and perhaps a short term bump in sales but if you can t deliver the goods the market will eventually see through your pitch in general great brands have to be built on a foundation of great products and they have to be consistent with the way people perceive those products that s why think different worked for apple but would have flopped for ibm whose reputation is based on reliability dependability and conservatism expand ap photo a voting machine in 1952 once upon a time the democratic party successfully marketed a powerful brand as the advocate of workers and the middle class against the privileged elite that brand was the consequence of things that democratic leaders actually did for ordinary families from social security and jobs programs in the 1930s through medicare medicaid and food stamps in the 1960s the popularity of those policies and the consistency of the image they projected were the foundation for the party s nearly uninterrupted reign over congress from the great depression until the reagan revolution over those decades the party built up a deep reservoir of trust of brand loyalty among lower and middle class families they might disagree with certain policies or dislike specific electoral candidates but they continued to identify democrats as the party of the new deal and social security of workers rights and pensions and health care the republicans by contrast were the party of local notables who owned real estate agencies and car dealerships and sat on bank boards and of rich executives who occupied corner offices and socialized at country clubs after losing both the senate and the white house in 1980 however and especially after walter mondale s crushing defeat four years later the democratic elite no longer wanted to be associated with the poor or with workers or at least not the unionized factory workers who had once symbolized the party instead the new democrats decided to become the party of finance technology and a brave new world in which the magic of markets would deliver prosperity to everyone as told in chapter 1 for the most part the party has successfully expanded its appeal to these new constituencies today silicon valley and the southern california entertainment industry are largely democratic and wall street is no longer the republican enclave it once was as the republicans have increasingly espoused racism sexism and xenophobia democrats have also responded by becoming the party of immigration racial and ethnic minorities gay rights and women s rights tolerance and diversity are important values and it is good that at least one party is willing to stand up for them although as on other issues national democrats did not embrace marriage equality until pushed into it by the courts and by their constituents but they became the brand of contemporary democrats by flowing into the vacuum left by the party s abandonment of its traditional economic identity at the same time that they tried to reposition themselves as forward looking compassionate demographically diverse capitalists however democratic candidates wanted to hold onto the votes of the poor and the working class by definition people making less than the median income can cast half the votes in any election making them an important constituency so the political balancing act of establishment democrats from bill clinton forward has been cozying up to elites and taking their cash by the bushel while loudly proclaiming their affection for the common man and woman the latest installment in this story is 2020 presidential candidates including joe biden kamala harris but particularly pete buttigieg holding fundraisers for wealthy donors virtually in secret while touting their small dollar donations in public the first clinton was the master of the genre with his friendly southern drawl his immense charisma and his modest origins born to a single mother in a rural town called hope he could make peace with wall street sign a draconian welfare reform bill cut taxes on investment income and still pass as a man of the people with each successive decade however the magic act has become harder to pull off struggling to pull away from the mediocre george w bush in 2000 al gore promised to fight for those who need a voice those who need a champion those who need to be lifted up so they are never left behind unlike clinton however gore was born and grew up in washington d c son of a congressman and future senator and the spark never passed john kerry a boston brahmin who married into the heinz ketchup family hardly tried to reach out to the masses preferring to run as a military man and a competent civil servant barack obama had both the political gifts and the personal narrative as a mixed race child raised by a single mother to cast the clinton spell in 2008 he was enough of a blank slate for people to project their hopes and dreams onto him enabling him to combine a vaguely technocratic centrist platform with a shining evocation of a better future for all people in 2012 obama s campaign successfully played the populist card by characterizing mitt romney a private equity magnate as the ruthless boss who lays you off by contrast hillary clinton was widely perceived as immensely rich and accustomed to the corridors of power the awkward spectacle of her paid speeches to wall street financiers and her steadfast refusal to tell the public what she had actually said highlighted the immense difficulty she faced in appealing to the working class voters who were once the bedrock of her party clinton still won a majority of votes from people in households with incomes less than 50 000 per year but donald trump won 16 percentage points more than mitt romney had four years earlier among people making less than 30 000 he did six points better among those making between 30 000 and 50 000 he won 78 percent of the votes of people who said their family s financial situation was worse than four years before people facing economic insecurity who once would have naturally turned to democrats compared to romney trump did better in counties suffering economic distress particularly in the post industrial midwest both rural and urban he won in places like trumbull county ohio where real median household income fell by 27 percent since 1980 and which voted for obama twice by more than 20 percentage points in general trump did better in counties with lower or negative gains in median incomes and employment levels he also did especially well in counties that were vulnerable to competition from imports from china one could argue that whatever clinton s weaknesses as a candidate low and middle income voters should still have recognized that she would better serve their interests than donald trump who was promising to repeal the affordable care act and shower the rich with yet another major tax cut but the underlying problem was that the historical democratic brand the party of the workers and ordinary people not corporate executives and the rich had withered away due to years of neglect in politics as in business brands don t last forever lincoln freed the slaves and for almost a century african americans were largely loyal to the republican party then lyndon johnson embraced the civil rights movement richard nixon s southern strategy drew in formerly democratic whites unhappy with desegregation and soon the party of lincoln had become the party of racial resentment bill clinton inherited a brand image that had been built up over decades as democratic presidents and congressional majorities actually did things that helped the working class often at the expense of the rich who paid higher taxes to fund a larger government and a broader safety net that image was a major reason why clinton could sustain his popularity with lower income voters despite not doing anything in particular to help them the popular identification of the democratic party with ordinary people of modest means survived into this century even as the party s elected representatives did little to justify it but by 2016 the credit built up by franklin roosevelt and lyndon johnson had been completely drawn down unemployed factory workers underpaid service industry employees single mothers struggling to find child care retirees stretching their social security checks to cover their prescriptions at some point they stopped trusting that the democratic party would do anything for them or even cared about them they may not have wholeheartedly embraced the republicans but they didn t turn out to support democrats particularly in the states that were decisive in the 2016 election it is true that american voters are not particularly well informed about economic issues and what policies are best for them and for the country but you can only fool people for so long and certainly not for a quarter century the marketing remained the same democrats would fight for you or restore power to the people or give you a better deal or some such collection of words but the product itself changed during those years to the point where it could no longer support the message in the 2016 presidential election for the first time in modern history the democratic candidate did better among high income voters the top 10 percent by income than among everyone else today many in the party want to take up the important cause of antitrust and pose as the scourge of big business but few people will believe it as long as congressional leaders continue doing the bidding of monopolies like facebook which counts minority leader schumer among its most powerful supporters if democrats have a brand identity today it is as the party of tolerance multiculturalism and women s rights all of which are important causes but it is no longer the party of the economically less fortunate regardless of what its politicians claim by adopting the central republican idea that dynamic markets and limited government are the sole source of prosperity we lost the ability to differentiate our economic message from our opponents by forgoing bold programs to help struggling families directly and doing nothing to slow the progress of extreme inequality we squandered our brand equity and our greatest political asset yes we can still win elections by combining attractive candidate expand william smith ap photo president eisenhower in october 1953 biographies with important themes such as women s rights and climate change while hoping that voters will be repelled by republican bigotry and corruption but when it comes to the basic economic issues that still play a large role in dictating election outcomes we have a lousy product and no real message at all in tacking toward the middle and trying to be all things to all people defenders of the 99 percent andenablers of the 1 percent democrats have also forgotten the cardinal lesson of modern american political history in the 1950s conservatism was completely impotent as an ideology in the united states there was a republican party but its economic platform amounted to little more than accommodation to the new deal and a vague claim to fiscal responsibility its leader president dwight eisenhower famously wrote should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things their number is negligible and they are stupid eisenhower also believed exactly what democrats today believe that government action was necessary to correct for the failings of the private sector his compelling personal story as the conquering general of world war ii got him by but did little for the republican brand sixty years later extreme conservatives have completely reshaped the political landscape they have increasingly tightened their stranglehold on the republican party they have lowered taxes and cut back regulations to an extent their ancestors could only have dreamed of they have slashed welfare with president clinton s assistance and put privatization of social security and medicare onto the national agenda they have installed a generation of judges who are determined to restore pre new deal limits on the powers of the federal government and as discussed above they have dragged the democratic party so far to the right that it occupies the space once taken by mainstream republicans they have accomplished all this despite positions on immigration women s rights and gay rights that are offensive to a majority of the population they did it not by adapting their identity to what the median voter wanted but by staking out compelling positions on core issues most importantly that small government and free markets are the source of prosperity and repeating their key messages incessantly until the electorate came to them they did it while rallying around barry goldwater in 1964 even though he had no chance at winning the general election backing ronald reagan s 1976 challenge to a sitting republican president and purging their congressional delegation of moderate incumbents better positioned to hold onto seats for their party by contrast in recent elections particularly since 1992 democrats have run toward the middle desperately trying to please the crucial swing demographic of the moment whatever it may be that s why the national party was opposed to or silent on gay marriage until state level momentum was impossible to ignore why it tiptoed around abortion largely supporting restrictions on federal funding for abortions until only the last few years and why it still has an equivocal position on climate change and the fossil fuel industry to cite only a few issues that s why the ideal candidate recruited by the democratic congressional or senatorial campaign committee is a combat veteran who started a small business and now promises to get washington to work creating jobs and opportunity without saying anything that might sound like redistribution expanding the welfare state or raising taxes on the rich while conservatives demand ideological purity the democratic establishment silences its left wing and extols the political virtues of centrism while its presidential candidates fantasize about a mythical post partisan america to us every election is so crucial every swing voter so important that the priority is always to grind out a win by catering to any bloc of undecideds or independents necessary rather than spelling out a clear vision of where we are headed and asking the people to come with us but the joke is on us while we have been eagerly cozying up to the median voter the conservatives have been remaking the american economy they have cut taxes undermined the safety net slashed job killing regulations turned federal agencies over to the industries they are supposed to monitor promoted the extraction of fossil fuels stacked the judiciary with pro business judges and so on sometimes as with welfare reform financial deregulation and shale gas drilling abetted by democrats anxious to seem pro business or simply hopeful for campaign contributions or plum lobbying jobs if you look at how the landscape of national politics has changed since 1980 it is clear who won and who lost at least when it comes to economic issues the republicans don t win every election or every vote although from 2010 through 2016 it often seemed that way but that is because they have moved the terrain of political debate so far in their direction we don t have to endorse their substantive positions or their often cavalier disregard for facts to appreciate that the conservative minority has executed the most powerful long running political marketing campaign of our lifetimes the most important lesson of the conservative revolution is that real change takes time it took decades of centrist policies to undermine the democratic brand and it will take decades to restore it but the sooner we begin the better

25 years ago mexican peso crisis on december 20 1994 the mexican peso was devalued sending shock waves throughout the structure of world capitalism mexico had been touted for a decade as proof that the profit system was capable of developing the oppressed semi colonial countries and transforming them into modern industrialized societies its collapse led to a generalized loss of confidence in emerging markets from brazil to poland the collapse of the peso which lost 40 percent of its value between december 20 and 27 produced a crisis of confidence in the mexican government on the part of the international and especially the american bourgeoisie the clinton administration and the federal reserve stepped in with an 18 billion line of credit to prop up the peso only because a complete financial collapse would spill over into american markets and threaten the stability of wall street itself in return washington demanded ruthless attacks on jobs and living standards by the government of president ernesto zedillo president ernesto zedillo told a national television audience december 29 that he was accepting the resignation of finance minister jaime serra puche and implementing an austerity policy include a 20 percent to 30 percent cut in government spending wage freezes and further privatization of state owned enterprises the peso had been undermined by the mushrooming mexican trade deficit which soared from 4 billion in 1987 to 23 billion in 1993 for a time this was offset by the influx of foreign capital into mexico foreign holdings of mexican stocks and bonds skyrocketed from 1 billion in 1988 to 28 4 billion by 1994 however repeated increases in us interest rates by the federal reserve slowed the flow of us capital into mexico and the political events of 1994 including the chiapas peasant rebellion and the assassinations of two prominent leaders of the ruling partido revolucionario institucional began to shift the flow of capital into reverse the immediate trigger to the peso s fall was the report that zapatista rebels in the southern state of chiapas had seized control of 38 municipalities in armed actions on december 19 the peasant based movement quickly retreated when heavily armed mexican army troops and state police moved into the towns yet the brief occupation produced a sharp fall in the mexico city stock exchange and a run on the peso in currency markets on december 20 finance minister jaime serra puche announced an effective devaluation of the peso by 12 7 percent but this only encouraged further speculation against the mexican currency by the following day the government had used up half its foreign reserves and was compelled to float the peso against the dollar 50 years ago general electric strike isolated by unions the national strike of 150 000 general electric ge workers that had begun in october 1969 continued into the third week of december though the strike enjoyed broad sympathy in the working class the lead union representing the workers the international union of electrical workers iue made clear it would not mobilize the support needed to defeat ge one of the world s richest corporations the company took a hard line in the negotiations ge s board of directors accepted that they would surrender some profits during the strike in order to secure their long term goals this week after negotiations between ge and the international union of electrical workers iue broke down fred j bosch ge s chairman told the press we do not intend to offer more we feel we have gone the limit with inflation increasing 1970 was expected to see more unrest and strikes from workers suffering declines in their living standards and purchasing power ge was looking to set a precedent there would be no movement on cost of living increases in the uncertain economy for workers of all industries on december 22 1969 the bulletin the us forerunner of the world socialist web site wrote this giant must be brought to its knees for what is at stake is an offensive not only against ge workers but of all american labor everyone knows ge is acting in the interests of nixon and all big business to forestall a wage offensive next year as millions of workers seek to get back what the bosses inflation has taken from them the iue gave its approval to an anti democratic injunction that stated that a maximum of 10 workers could appear on the picket line at one time the injunction which set a standard that is still used against workers today served a dual purpose for the company by avoiding mass pickets it could use the police to attack and arrest workers who might block scab labor from entering the plants second it threatened strike pay as only workers who manned a picket line could receive such funds from the union the union claimed the injunction was the outcome of a compromise at a meeting in cicero illinois where 18 workers had been arrested during the strike one worker responded by saying a few more compromises like this and we will have no rights whatsoever 75 years ago provisional anti fascist government established in hungary on december 22 1944 delegates from a range of oppositional parties in hungary gathered in debrecen and agreed to form a provisional national government in opposition to the fascistic regime of ferenc szálasi which was allied with germany the move came amid a crisis of fascist forces throughout europe including the expulsion of the nazis from greece and signs that benito mussolini s italian social republic was on the verge of collapsing or being overthrown it preceded a full scale military assault on the pro german hungarian regime by the soviet red army represented in the new provisional government were members of the stalinist communist party the independent smallholders party the social democrats the national peasant party and several senior generals who had defected from the old regime béla miklós who had served as a commanding general before advocating in 1944 that hungary switch its allegiance to the soviet union was appointed prime minister successive hungarian governments had collaborated with the nazi s worst crimes including by deporting hundreds of thousands of jews and political dissidents to german death camps amid the routing of german troops throughout eastern europe the hungarian authorities were discussing extricating themselves from the war hitler responded by launching operation margarethe effectively a german invasion and occupation of the country in march 1944 over the following months mass roundups and political repression intensified as allied victories grew including on the western front regent of hungary miklós horthy again looked to negotiate a separate peace with britain and the soviet union the nazis initiated operation panzerfaust another military operation aimed at shoring up their control of the country horthy was removed and an even more right wing government headed by ferenc szálasi of the fascist national socialist arrow cross party was installed in october the red army entered hungary proper with intense fighting between the soviets and anti fascist partisans on the one side and the germans and their fascist collaborators on the other hitler had declared budapest the capital to be a fortress city leading to months of brutal fighting and a soviet enforced siege of the city the establishment of the provisional national government which was carried out with the blessing of the soviet authorities was part of a broader attempt by the stalinist bureaucracy to ensure its control over political developments in the post world war ii period in western europe the soviets alongside the other allied powers supported the establishment of right wing capitalist governments in eastern europe they sought to fashion regimes based on an alliance between dissenting sections of the military command the communist parties and openly bourgeois formations the stalinists were hostile to the prospect of any revolutionary struggle by the working class against european capitalism for fear that it would result in social and political upheavals within the soviet union itself 100 years ago us authorities deport anarchist leader emma goldman on december 21 1919 anarchist leader emma goldman was deported by the woodrow wilson administration to soviet russia under the immigration act of 1918 which sought to expel immigrant left wingers in the aftermath of the 1917 russian revolution and amidst a massive strike wave spearheaded by coal miners and steelworkers goldman had been released on september 27 from the missouri state penitentiary where she served a two year prison under the espionage act for her opposition to world war i she was freed during the mass hysteria of the first red scare shortly before the start of the infamous palmer raids of attorney general a mitchell palmer in november which were used to break up left wing meetings and arrest thousands of foreign born revolutionary workers under the immigration act palmer s subordinate j edgar hoover the future head of the fbi took personal responsibility for ensuring that the government did everything in its power to expel goldman and her partner alexander berkman he wrote in a letter at the time that they were beyond doubt two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country at her deportation hearing on october 27 whose outcome thanks to hoover was never in doubt goldman noted the class character of the anti immigrant law the object of deportations and of the anti anarchist law as of all similar repressive measures is to stifle the voice of the people to muzzle every aspiration of labor the state ordered her expulsion from the united states and she and berkman were confined at ellis island december 5 ten days later the soviet envoy in new york ludwig c a k martens offered her refuge in soviet russia on december 21 scores of federal agents and immigration officials escorted 247 immigrant socialists communists and anarchists aboard the s s buford whose crew had been issued weapons goldman berkman and the other deportees arrived in finland on january 17 where they were welcomed by representatives of the soviet government
skip to comments posted on by seekandfind there s a sense that the bureaucrats who command the federal leviathan work for themselves not for the country at large that wasn t true of paul volcker since his death last week paul volcker has been heavily eulogized that s not the purpose here in these trying times americans faith in our nation s institutions is at historic lows once vaunted organizations like the fbi now struggle to command a majority of americans support the causes for this are legion but there is a general sense that the vast federal appendages created in the last 100 years have little connection to the interests of the rest of america there s a sense that the bureaucrats who command this leviathan work for themselves not for the country at large that couldn t be said about volcker while jumping around between the treasury department the private sector academia and the federal reserve bank of new york volcker got a reputation for problem solving pragmatism and being apolitical all necessary ingredients of public service volcker also had a reputation for not buying into the latest academic fad or political expediency and instead used history and evidence as his guides how paul volcker stopped runaway inflation in a way history picked volcker in the late 1970s inflation was running at around 10 percent and rising in 1977 during the carter presidency the u s treasury had to issue bonds denominated in swiss francs because nobody wanted dollars at the rate the treasury was able to pay they were called carter bonds by the time ronald reagan was elected president inflation was nearing 15 percent inflation of 5 percent can hurt working people as the prices of the things they buy go up faster than wages and the businesses that hire them are unable to plan but inflation above this level becomes disastrous the expectation of price rises begets even higher prices and inflation risks spinning out of control the result throughout the 1970s was americans waiting in lines at gas stations while their real wages fell sharply volcker was the natural choice to fight this inflation some would even say that president carter had no choice but to nominate volcker to be fed chairman in 1979 so volcker was pulled from his position as head of the new york fed to be chairman of the federal reserve he took a pay cut moved into a small foggy bottom apartment and his wife went back to work as a bookkeeper volcker was a monetary conservative and consistently advocated sound fiscal and monetary policy when nixon decided to close the gold window in 1971 ending the dollar s international convertibility into gold volcker was in the room at camp david the decision was meant to be temporary but volcker and others lobbied for the dollar to be re pegged to gold at a lower value to no avail as fed chair volcker said he would jack up short term interest rates directly set or influenced by the fed to fight inflation many at the time doubted this would work as fed chair he did just that bringing the fed funds rate all the way up to 20 percent in 1981 the fed funds rate is the short term rate the fed sets which influences all other interest rates in the economy despite inflation s dire effect on working people those who depended on credit were outraged by volcker s scorched earth effort to fight inflation by jacking up rates the political pressure volcker faced was immense especially from the left farmers and other interest groups held protests outside the federal reserve s washington d c eccles building sometimes temporary pain is good for the economy then treasury secretary donald regan didn t want president reagan to re appoint volcker in 1983 even though reagan did to his great credit re appoint volcker in 83 the fed chair and the president didn t always see eye to eye at one time volcker declined reagan s invitation to visit the white house in 1984 and with president reagan in the room white house chief of staff james baker ordered volcker not to raise rates ahead of the election overall however reagan s faith in volcker paid off because of volcker s high rates the american economy was hit by a double dip recession in 1980 and 82 but volcker tamed inflation which dropped from nearly 15 percent in 1980 to 3 percent in 1983 reagan won his 1984 election in a landslide critics charged volcker with doing the bidding of wall street but these critics ignored or forget that while wall street doesn t like high inflation the market definitely doesn t like high short term interest rates and double dip recessions yet volcker didn t mind shocking wall street with hikes they didn t expect which he did often all this complication is bad for the economy despite being a monetary and fiscal conservative volcker had little countenance for today s establishment republican dogma of financial deregulation as fed chair volcker opposed rules that would weaken glass steagall a law in place since the 1930s that kept investment banks and brokerages from merging with commercial banks and was eventually repealed by bill clinton in the late 1990s volcker was also highly critical of the financialization of america s economy in 2009 mr volcker questioned whether any new financial innovation beyond the atm had added to the real economy i wish that somebody would give me some shred of neutral evidence about the relationship between financial innovation recently and the growth of the economy just one shred of information i am getting a bit wound up here said volcker following the greatest financial crash since the great depression volcker had an on and off relationship with the obama administration president barack obama was a bit friendlier to volcker s ideas but obama s treasury secretary wall street insider tim geithner was less keen in the end volcker got a rule in obama s dodd frank act named after him the volcker rule aimed to accomplish some of what glass steagall had intended and keep banks from using government insured fdic insured deposits to gamble on the open market volcker lived to see his rule implemented then watered down after many critics rightly noted that it hurt market making activity and decreased liquidity in the bond market which could exacerbate a crisis working americans should be able to save profitably but volcker wasn t a liberal democrat he strongly criticized the fed s 2 percent inflation target adopted by ben bernanke during the obama years volcker thought working americans should be able to save their dollars and get a positive real return on their savings without the fed eroding the purchasing power of their hard earned money ironically the easy money striving for a little inflation as a means of forestalling deflation could in the end be what brings about volcker also stood steadfast against the monetary status quo where central bankers assume they need to pursue low rates to hit the arbitrary 2 percent target or at the mere hint of declining stock prices even though this stimulus boosts financial assets disproportionately held by the rich volcker even pointed out that the fed s monetary interventions which grew much larger in the last decade could sow the seeds of the next crisis by causing the excessive creation of debt while zero interest rates may be necessary at the moment they lead to some dangerous possibilities in terms of breeding more speculative excesses volcker said in 2009 volcker wrote in 2018 that ironically the easy money striving for a little inflation as a means of forestalling deflation could in the end be what brings about yet since volcker s time at the fed fed chairs alan greenspan and ben bernanke flooded the system with money and bailed out irresponsible actors when panic hit greenspan acted quickly to bail out the market in the october 1987 crash and during the long term capital management crisis bernanke did the same during the global financial crisis and tried to massively devalue the dollar while juicing wall street as america was emerging from that recession later fed chair janet yellen kept rates ultra low long after the recession was over volcker on the other hand wasn t trying to be popular support asset prices or set himself up for a book tour he was doing his job it s too bad that america s so called elite schools don t generate more men and women like volcker and it s too bad that america s political system counts women and men like volcker as the exception not the rule instead of a eulogy think of this as a call to action america desperately needs more public

swedish krona norwegian krone riksbank norges bank talking points riksbank pioneering central bank phenomenon climbing out of negative rates the swedish krona could rise on riksbank rate hike but may fall on the outlook norwegian krone may oscillate between norges bank rate decision trade risks the swedish krona along with policymakers around the world will be closely watching the upcoming rate decision from the oldest central bank in the world the riksbank scandinavian monetary authorities are set to end their five year journey in negative interest rate territory and may be viewed as a template for institutions seeking to do the same in the future riksbank rate decision why it matters for global policymakers following the 2008 financial crash the riksbank embarked on an easing cycle and eventually drove interest rates into negative territory for the first time in the central bank s history however the ascension of the benchmark from the proverbial abyss is a key insight for global policymakers who wonder what a recovery from negative interest rates looks like in this regard the magnitude of the upcoming rate decision cannot be underestimated since it could become a source of abundant joy or market wide panic how sweden s financial system endures tightened credit conditions after an unprecedented amount of time at an ultra loose setting could be a template for how larger economies like the eurozone cope with a similar struggle while the swedish economy may have been saved by expansionary monetary measures the specter of its own policies is coming back to haunt it amid the low interest rate environment swedes began to incur large sums of debt since the cost of borrowing so was low more specifically they began to take on mortgages which have led to an explosion in the swedish housing market note below 1 5 depressed between 1 5 and 0 5 undervalued between 0 5 and 0 5 fair valued between 0 5 and 1 5 overvalued above 1 5 bubble risk the growing concern now is debt burdened swedes with an average debt to income ratio of over 330 percent have become sensitive to interest rate adjustments more precisely their ability to service their debt may become compromised if interest payments on their various loans exceeds their income the result is a possible onslaught of defaults that creates an inter bank contagion spreads throughout the baltic states as the riksbank noted in their bi annual global financial stability report expectations of very low interest rates in the coming years can lead to an increase in risk taking to assets being overvalued and to indebtedness increasing in an unsustainable manner several participants have also turned to riskier and more illiquid assets to obtain higher returns were economic developments to become significantly weaker than expected it could expose vulnerabilities that have built up in the financial system both households and banks have large exposures to the housing market which means that a large fall in prices could have consequences for macroeconomic and financial stability in sweden the swedish banking system size concentration interconnectedness limited capital levels and in some respects low resilience to liquidity risks riksbank financial stability report furthermore the vulnerability in sweden s debt market is amplified by the fact that sweden is an outward facing economy with a financial system that is dependent on international financial markets multiple factors including trade wars and a disorderly brexit or a combination of elements could trigger a multi iterated financial contagion of the country s debt and bring the swedish economy to its knees and the krona with it norges bank rate decision what is the outlook officials at the norges bank nb are expected to vote to keep interest rates at 1 50 percent after raising rates three times this year effectively doubling the cost of borrowing the downside shift in implied policy rates from a month ago

glen hodgson is a senior fellow at the c d howe institute global growth is being deeply affected by the trade turmoil fomented by u s president donald trump and uncertainty is at the forefront with slower growth in many places and plenty of policy risk here are five key issues to watch in 2020 expect little overall improvement in global economic prospects it would be unrealistic to expect a material improvement in economic performance both the international monetary fund and organization for economic co operation and development project the global economy will not strengthen by much growth in 2020 will remain below 3 5 per cent after 3 per cent projected for 2019 that would be the weakest period of global growth since the 2008 09 financial crisis and recession policy risk remains heightened there are always risks to the economic outlook but this is an especially turbulent time recession risk remains present yield curves that were inverted during the summer have returned to a modest uptick but they remain an important leading indicator of possible recession that ought to be taken seriously trade tension notably the u s china trade dispute is taking a toll on business confidence and investment in many countries and regions while ratification of the new north american free trade pact the united states mexico canada agreement and a british election result backing the conservatives plans on brexit might help continuing policy uncertainty adds to the risk of trade tension spilling into financial markets the probability of being disappointed by the actual performance of the global economy is likely greater than the chance of a stronger outcome which makes the consensus outlook for 2020 imbalanced and climate change risk has not yet been factored into the growth outlook emerging and developing economies are now nearly 60 per cent of global gdp emerging markets and developing economies now represent almost 60 per cent of global gross domestic product gdp at purchasing power parity exchange rates and that share keeps rising they are projected to expand collectively by 4 6 per cent in 2020 up from 4 per cent in 2019 even as projected chinese growth dips below 6 per cent due principally to weak exports and heavy domestic debt india is a global growth leader with projected growth of 7 per cent in contrast advanced economies will grow by only 1 7 per cent in 2020 increasingly affected by aging demographics and weak trade growth american growth will moderate further in 2020 to around 2 per cent the u s fiscal boost provided by the 2018 tax cuts has come to an end and resulting fiscal deficits now exceed us 1 trillion annually and are still growing u s employment and consumption have been buoyant but investment is sluggish and tariffs erode confidence growth across the european union will average 1 4 per cent and only 0 5 per cent in japan what about canada the consensus outlook is for a modest rebound in 2020 with growth at around 1 6 per cent this outlook largely depends on factors beyond our control notably improved trade policy certainty vis à vis the u s and china and stabilization of global prices and demand for energy and other key commodities trade is a drag on growth trade is no longer the cutting edge of the global economy as it was for decades global trade is projected by the world trade organization to grow by only 1 25 per cent in 2019 the worst year since the 2008 09 global financial crisis trade growth is projected to rebound to around 2 7 per cent in 2020 but will remain well below historic trends trade relationships and global value chains are being re examined and restructured on the fly which will ultimately affect the competitiveness of many firms and countries inflation is an afterthought consumer price inflation is expected to average only 1 5 per cent in 2020 in advanced economies the u s may see inflation tick above 2 per cent in 2020 due to an economy operating above potential canada is operating at potential with inflation close to the bank of canada s 2 per cent target and short term rates are generally expected to remain unchanged muted inflation elsewhere provides some scope for accommodative monetary policy in an attempt to shore up growth inflation in emerging markets will dip below 5 per cent on average although there are a few sad cases of hyper or high inflation notably venezuela zimbabwe and argentina where does this mixed outlook leave canada policy makers and business leaders cannot control external forces but they could do more to address factors that are within our control such as ensuring our products can get to global markets reducing internal barriers to trade reforming the tax system to support growth investing sufficiently in human capital promoting business and policy innovation and deepening trade relations with more diverse partners
prices are essential signals for coordinating the distribution of goods in an economy prices tell us where scarce resources are most needed f a hayek s insights on this have been summarized by peter leeson market prices he argues signal to producers and consumers the relative scarcity of resources they tell producers how to combine resources in the ways that produce the most value for consumers and tell consumers when they should expand or contract their consumption of various goods and services so what would happen if prices were controlled by government policy the answer bad things trouble in zimbabwe between 1983 and 1985 president muhammadu buhari was general muhammadu buhari the military head of state of nigeria he instituted price controls on milk soap sugar etc overnight milk soap and sugar disappeared from the shelves in different stores this is not rocket science once it becomes illegal for producers and sellers to sell their commodities over a certain price and that price is less than what it costs to make that commodity available producers and sellers will not make that commodity available for example say there are one hundred million nigerians who eat bread then the government passes a law stipulating that bread should not be sold for more than 150 naira forty one cents per loaf since many bakeries have different costs of production for their bread they would be affected differently let s say there are one hundred bakeries in the country those whose bread costs 150 naira and above to make and who have to sell above that price to make a profit would go out of business let s say forty bakeries fall into this category now we have only sixty bakeries to provide bread for the one hundred million people remember the quantity of bread demanded did not decrease yet we now have fewer bakeries selling bread the result is a reduction in the supply of bread according to the economic principle of demand and supply the price of bread will go up because supply just been reduced and there are more people competing for the limited bread supply but remember that bakeries cannot sell bread for more than 150 naira if the bakeries continue to sell bread at 150 naira there won t be enough supply so people will have to line up for the limited amount available shortages will result you may say why can t the sixty bakeries increase their production capacity to cover the lost supply of the remaining forty bakeries that just went out of business in an unhampered market they easily could but under a regime of price controls they can t why because to increase production bakeries need to buy more equipment and ingredients but without charging more for bread it s unlikely that these bakers will be able to cover their costs that is increasing production would be financial suicide in reality what happens is that some of those bakeries owners will be willing to take the risk of going to prison or in some cases losing their lives to sell their bread to the more desperate customers at a higher price creating a black market but the thing with black markets is that since they are illegal and sellers are exposed to the risk of prison or death if caught prices will be well above the mandated legal price ceilings but black markets are not a substitute for a truly free market and in many cases such as that of zimbabwe price controls mean that the economy comes to a halt plunging people into squalor and untold suffering as a result president mugabe of zimbabwe embarked on economic reforms in the early 1990s but because these reforms did not feature more market freedom other disasters awaited by the late 2000s the reserve bank of zimbabwe had printed so much money that its supply rose far beyond what was demanded resulting in hyperinflation it became so bad that by november 2008 the inflation rate had reached 89 7 sextillion percent per year according to economist steve hanke new money had to be printed to reflect these changes and the highest denomination of the zimbabwe dollar during this era was the one hundred trillion note by 2009 the central bank had stopped printing currency as it had become completely worthless the country started using the currencies of other countries such as the south african rand in 2015 the zimbabwean state announced that it would start using the us dollar as legal tender but all this inflation led to a perceived need for even more price controls mugabe thus instituted new price controls and the economy came to a halt thomas sowell describing the situation quotes the new york times bread sugar and cornmeal staples of every zimbabwean s diet have vanished seized by mobs who denuded stores like locusts in wheat fields meat is virtually nonexistent even for members of the middle class who have money to buy it on the black market gasoline is nearly unobtainable hospital patients are dying for lack of basic medical supplies power blackouts and water cutoffs are endemic hunter lewis continues zimbabwe was once considered a breadbasket of africa but in the 2000s began to suffer mass starvation the principal reason was that president robert mugabe promised land reform but actually gave the once rich farms to his cronies at about the same time everything was price controlled often below the cost of production the central bank was printing unlimited numbers of zimbabwean dollars so that by 2008 prices were rising 98 a day property and market values plunged by at least 99 but it was hard to say for sure because there were no buyers while these events were unfolding mugabe railed against greedy entrepreneurs ruthless markets and the forces of globalization mugabe blamed capitalism and the united states but it was his regime that destroyed the economy for his people through price controls and inflationary monetary policy it s ironic that in 2015 the zimbabwean state started using the us dollar as legal tender the cycle began again in 2019 when the new regime created a new currency and decreed that all foreign currencies would no longer be legal tender again history is repeating itself
indian economy delicately poised by all indications revival in 2020 is not possible renu kohli the year 2019 has played out on a mixed note politically the general election outcome upheld the popular choice of a majority government economically conditions deteriorated rapidly through the year in fact an undercurrent of concern about the economic situation prevailed throughout 2019 this surfaced upfront immediately after the may election and reached a flashpoint by the middle of the year business confidence and consumer sentiments plunged gross domestic product growth fell sharply to 5 per cent in april june leading indicators continued to surprise with the intensity of their downslide thereafter too and in july september growth slipped further down to 4 5 per cent these developments pushed the government into reform cum stimulation mode and prompted the reserve bank of india to lower interest rates throughout 2019 pausing only this month with these armours all expect the economy to recover next year will it look up in 2020 the near term outlook does not look promising none is sure if the economy troughed last quarter some think there is further downslide to come incoming data for october november show continued shrinkage of industrial output and exports consumer sentiments have slid some more while other markers such as bank credit vehicle sales power demand aviation and rail traffic and so on show no improvement either trends so far suggest that the festival demand uplift has been short lived spending has fallen back worryingly households inflation expectations have jumped from the rising vegetable prices which are uncharacteristically high for the season the external demand situation continues to be subdued although the uncertainties caused by brexit and the trade tensions between the united states of america and china have lifted there is no guarantee this will translate into corresponding improvements in global growth advertisement even before the arrival of high frequency data last week most analysts and agencies had scaled down india s growth forecasts for this financial year ending march 2020 the central bank caught up with these downgrades less than a fortnight ago slashing fy20 growth projections by 110 basis points to 5 per cent its third such downgrade this year beyond this however there is broad unanimity about uplift in 2020 private sector consensus prediction is that gdp will grow above 6 per cent in 2020 21 the next financial year the rbi expects an early comeback an average 6 1 per cent in april september 2020 and the international monetary fund s october world economic outlook forecast india s gdp growth accelerating to 7 per cent in 2020 up from 6 1 per cent in 2019 this optimism is presumed upon an uptick in spending and production from monetary and fiscal policy support namely enhanced pass through of cumulative monetary easing in 2019 lower business taxes partially eased labour regulations further counter cyclical stimulus expected in the forthcoming budget and other sector specific relief measures an improved rabi crop outlook owing to robust monsoons adds to this optimism progressive improvement in liquidity and financing conditions of the stressed non bank sector is also anticipated all good however there is much weighing down the respondents who eventually determine economic vigour through changes in their spending behaviours most segments are fundamentally weak or strained a quick health check shows businesses and consumers are less than fit many large firms are still to deleverage regain balance sheet strength to contemplate investing afresh the protracted slowdown has slowed this process it has also tipped newer firms into this pool adding fresh bad loans to the existing stockpile of non performing assets and aggravating overall stress consumers or households also increased their liabilities in the last two years in which income growth slowed not an ideal situation for borrowing or spending more the weakened capacities could therefore mute the magnitude of aggregate demand response or private investment and consumption the public or government sector is increasingly strained this is a large segment with significant economic influence through taxation and expenditure policies to elaborate higher government spending alone contributed 1 9 percentage points to last quarter s gdp growth of 4 5 per cent but now the government is cash strapped on the revenue side it is affected by declining economic activities that reduce tax collections as well as recent tax cuts committed expenses strain the expenditure side the resource constraint is posing a difficult choice whether to axe spending or raise taxes either will result in further demand compression it is to be hoped such a vicious spiral does not set in elevated fiscal risk has also alerted bond markets and rating agencies the 10 year benchmark yield the reference rate for bank loans is climbing up which squeezes room for further market borrowings by government else interest rates would rise and counter the monetary easing a perverse outcome then standard poor global ratings recently issued an early warning the agency stated that india s debt may be downgraded in the event of a major economic slowdown although it expects a gradual recovery in the next few years india s sovereign rating could be lowered if this does not come about and structural deterioration becomes clearer these are adverse portents for next year it is difficult to visualize an easy navigation or early emergence from this trap fiscal strains have also narrowed the policy space to manoeuvre a revival considering the role of government spending in propping economic growth until now this is not an insignificant matter more could obstruct the march upwards the financial sector is under immense stress from long festering bad assets interconnectedness risks from non banks added to this last year banks are burdened with unresolved npas for over five years now their balance sheets remain pressured creating persistent risk aversion that escalated from several non banking finance company defaults in 2019 indirect real estate exposure through non banks is another risk the non bank stress endures with capital adequacy issues raised funding costs and rationing so far there is little evidence that government s partial credit guarantee for bank lending to nbfcs has eased financing constraints especially for lower rated entities fragilities in real estate infrastructure and construction sectors are equal dangers for banks and non banks that high unresolved npa levels aggravate the severity of a slowdown is well known timely resolution matters for output recovery in this instance india s growth deceleration has stretched for nearly two years intensified in 2019 with reports of fresh npa creations in new segments in the year faster npa resolutions could make a difference to the 2020 outlook but past evolution of this process suggests the probability is quite low finally exports these suffered from rupee overvaluation for several years in a row besides the usual long standing disadvantages poor infrastructure high wage costs and so on in 2019 however the rupee steadily depreciated indicating a change in exchange rate management strategy will this stimulate exports here the extent of correction many regard this inadequate matters other than how much depreciation alone can recoup competitiveness to meet the challenge from competitors enjoying far better cost and other advantages in a testing global environment the economic situation is thus nebulous delicately poised the above drawbacks are not hidden or underappreciated many supportive actions aim to redress these banks are also being prodded to step up lending credit conditions could ease the economy could surprise with a strong rebound as many predict the sobering notes from a longer perspective are that the domestic demand weakening precedes the nbfc crisis which no doubt intensified the deceleration and that public capital expenditure stimulation has motivated fiscal policy for over five years but private investment response has eluded it can 2020 be significantly better in this light the author is a macroeconomist
since his death last week paul volcker has been heavily eulogized that s not the purpose here in these trying times americans faith in our nation s institutions is at historic lows once vaunted organizations like the fbi now struggle to command a majority of americans support the causes for this are legion but there is a general sense that the vast federal appendages created in the last 100 years have little connection to the interests of the rest of america there s a sense that the bureaucrats who command this leviathan work for themselves not for the country at large that couldn t be said about volcker while jumping around between the treasury department the private sector academia and the federal reserve bank of new york volcker got a reputation for problem solving pragmatism and being apolitical all necessary ingredients of public service volcker also had a reputation for not buying into the latest academic fad or political expediency and instead used history and evidence as his guides how paul volcker stopped runaway inflation in a way history picked volcker in the late 1970s inflation was running at around 10 percent and rising in 1977 during the carter presidency the u s treasury had to issue bonds denominated in swiss francs because nobody wanted dollars at the rate the treasury was able to pay they were called carter bonds by the time ronald reagan was elected president inflation was nearing 15 percent inflation of 5 percent can hurt working people as the prices of the things they buy go up faster than wages and the businesses that hire them are unable to plan but inflation above this level becomes disastrous the expectation of price rises begets even higher prices and inflation risks spinning out of control the result throughout the 1970s was americans waiting in lines at gas stations while their real wages fell sharply volcker was the natural choice to fight this inflation some would even say that president carter had no choice but to nominate volcker to be fed chairman in 1979 so volcker was pulled from his position as head of the new york fed to be chairman of the federal reserve he took a pay cut moved into a small foggy bottom apartment and his wife went back to work as a bookkeeper volcker was a monetary conservative and consistently advocated sound fiscal and monetary policy when nixon decided to close the gold window in 1971 ending the dollar s international convertibility into gold volcker was in the room at camp david the decision was meant to be temporary but volcker and others lobbied for the dollar to be re pegged to gold at a lower value to no avail as fed chair volcker said he would jack up short term interest rates directly set or influenced by the fed to fight inflation many at the time doubted this would work as fed chair he did just that bringing the fed funds rate all the way up to 20 percent in 1981 the fed funds rate is the short term rate the fed sets which influences all other interest rates in the economy despite inflation s dire effect on working people those who depended on credit were outraged by volcker s scorched earth effort to fight inflation by jacking up rates the political pressure volcker faced was immense especially from the left farmers and other interest groups held protests outside the federal reserve s washington d c eccles building sometimes temporary pain is good for the economy then treasury secretary donald regan didn t want president reagan to re appoint volcker in 1983 even though reagan did to his great credit re appoint volcker in 83 the fed chair and the president didn t always see eye to eye at one time volcker declined reagan s invitation to visit the white house in 1984 and with president reagan in the room white house chief of staff james baker ordered volcker not to raise rates ahead of the election overall however reagan s faith in volcker paid off because of volcker s high rates the american economy was hit by a double dip recession in 1980 and 82 but volcker tamed inflation which dropped from nearly 15 percent in 1980 to 3 percent in 1983 reagan won his 1984 election in a landslide critics charged volcker with doing the bidding of wall street but these critics ignored or forget that while wall street doesn t like high inflation the market definitely doesn t like high short term interest rates and double dip recessions yet volcker didn t mind shocking wall street with hikes they didn t expect which he did often all this complication is bad for the economy despite being a monetary and fiscal conservative volcker had little countenance for today s establishment republican dogma of financial deregulation as fed chair volcker opposed rules that would weaken glass steagall a law in place since the 1930s that kept investment banks and brokerages from merging with commercial banks and was eventually repealed by bill clinton in the late 1990s volcker was also highly critical of the financialization of america s economy in 2009 mr volcker questioned whether any new financial innovation beyond the atm had added to the real economy i wish that somebody would give me some shred of neutral evidence about the relationship between financial innovation recently and the growth of the economy just one shred of information i am getting a bit wound up here said volcker following the greatest financial crash since the great depression volcker had an on and off relationship with the obama administration president barack obama was a bit friendlier to volcker s ideas but obama s treasury secretary wall street insider tim geithner was less keen in the end volcker got a rule in obama s dodd frank act named after him the volcker rule aimed to accomplish some of what glass steagall had intended and keep banks from using government insured fdic insured deposits to gamble on the open market volcker lived to see his rule implemented then watered down after many critics rightly noted that it hurt market making activity and decreased liquidity in the bond market which could exacerbate a crisis working americans should be able to save profitably but volcker wasn t a liberal democrat he strongly criticized the fed s 2 percent inflation target adopted by ben bernanke during the obama years volcker thought working americans should be able to save their dollars and get a positive real return on their savings without the fed eroding the purchasing power of their hard earned money ironically the easy money striving for a little inflation as a means of forestalling deflation could in the end be what brings about volcker also stood steadfast against the monetary status quo where central bankers assume they need to pursue low rates to hit the arbitrary 2 percent target or at the mere hint of declining stock prices even though this stimulus boosts financial assets disproportionately held by the rich volcker even pointed out that the fed s monetary interventions which grew much larger in the last decade could sow the seeds of the next crisis by causing the excessive creation of debt while zero interest rates may be necessary at the moment they lead to some dangerous possibilities in terms of breeding more speculative excesses volcker said in 2009 volcker wrote in 2018 that ironically the easy money striving for a little inflation as a means of forestalling deflation could in the end be what brings about yet since volcker s time at the fed fed chairs alan greenspan and ben bernanke flooded the system with money and bailed out irresponsible actors when panic hit greenspan acted quickly to bail out the market in the october 1987 crash and during the long term capital management crisis bernanke did the same during the global financial crisis and tried to massively devalue the dollar while juicing wall street as america was emerging from that recession later fed chair janet yellen kept rates ultra low long after the recession was over volcker on the other hand wasn t trying to be popular support asset prices or set himself up for a book tour he was doing his job it s too bad that america s so called elite schools don t generate more men and women like volcker and it s too bad that america s political system counts women and men like volcker as the exception not the rule instead of a eulogy think of this as a call to action america desperately needs more public servants in volcker s mold he wasn t always right just as none of us are but he listened to his better angels and put his country first willis krumholz is a writer for the federalist who lives in

gresham s law states that bad money drives out good money but anyone who has spent time around washington d c knows that this law can safely be applied to information too bad information tends to drive out good information such is the case with america s assessments of other countries military and economic power defense spending is one of the most commonly used measures for gauging a country s potential military power setting expectations of what the military balance might look like in the future it helps give us a sense of how much of a state s economic power is being converted into military power well in theory it should if we knew how to measure it right but comparing defense spending across countries is a complicated task as a consequence the united states doesn t really know where its military expenditure stands in relation to that of its principal adversaries what kind of military capability they re getting for their money and whether the balance of power is likely to improve or worsen over time policymakers are barraged by a daily stream of think tank reports academic writing and media stories competing for their perceptions for example by cherry picking a few gross measures including military expenditure a recent rand report caricatured russia as a weakling rogue state major newspapers generate erroneous headlines many ran stories asserting that in 2017 russian defense spending declined by a fifth in our experience both in washington and london decision makers have little time to investigate or read and tend to believe many of the headlines they come across indeed rarely does a discussion take place on russia or china without a series of assumptions being voiced based on questionable assessments of relative power when it comes to gdp defense spending or demographics of course a necessary precursor to finding measures that matter is knowing how to measure in the first place this is a challenge we hope to briefly take up here it is hardly an academic question strategic implications abound for america s pursuit of a favorable regional military balance in europe and decisive military advantages over its adversaries in our view despite its tremendous size u s defense spending does not actually dwarf that of the rest of the world this also raises some uncomfortable questions about the ability of the united states to attain deterrence by denial against competing revisionist powers the disparity is especially evident when looking at the case of russian military expenditure which is much larger than it appears though a fair assessment of chinese defense spending would also yield pessimistic expectations about the future balance of military power why russia gets more bang for the ruble based on the annual average dollar to ruble exchange rates russia is typically depicted as spending in the region of 60 billion per year on its military this is roughly in line with the defense spending of medium sized powers like the united kingdom and france however anybody familiar with russia s military modernization program over the past decade will see the illogic how can a military budget the size of the united kingdom s be used to maintain over a million personnel while simultaneously procuring vast quantities of capable military equipment russian procurement dwarfs that of most european powers combined beyond delivering large quantities of weaponry for today s forces russia s scientists and research institutes are far along in development of hypersonic weapons such as tsirkon and avangard along with next generation air defense systems like s 500 this volume of procurement and research and development should not be possible with a military budget ostensibly the same size as the united kingdom s when theory checks in with practice the problem with the approaches that return such answers is plain for anyone to see the reason for this apparent contradiction is that the use of market exchange rates grossly understates the real volume of russian military expenditure and that of other countries with smaller per capita incomes like china instead any analysis of comparative military expenditure should be based on the use of purchasing power parity ppp exchange rates rather than market exchange rates this alternative method takes differences in costs between countries into account as we demonstrate despite some shortcomings ppp is a much more methodologically robust and defensible method of comparing defense spending across countries than the method of comparing spending using the market exchange rates that are commonly used by think tanks and academics using ppp one finds that russia s effective military expenditure actually ranged between 150 billion and 180 billion annually over the last five years that figure is conservative taking into account hidden or obfuscated military expenditure russia may well come in at around 200 billion to put it simply calculating russian military expenditure based on purchasing power means that the united states spends only about four times more than russia on defense rather than ten times more when using market exchange rates but this remains a crude comparison the gap is even narrower when one digs into the differences in how this money is spent at nearly 50 percent of federal budget spending on national defense a large proportion of the russian defense budget goes to procurement and research and development by comparison in other countries with large defense budgets procurement spending tends to be much lower in india the united states and the united kingdom spending is at about 20 25 percent unlike some other large military spenders for example saudi arabia and india russia also produces most of its weaponry itself and does not buy its equipment from countries with higher costs this means that effective russian military expenditure is much larger given that a ruble spent at home buys considerably more than a dollar spent abroad and despite russia s largely stagnant economy this higher level of spending has proven far more durable than media narratives have suggested perhaps most importantly the more methodologically sound approach to comparing defense spending based on ppp illustrates that the gap between u s expenditure on the one hand and that of russia and china on the other has closed dramatically over the past 15 years today when taken together spending by russia and china is roughly equal to u s defense expenditure with russia representing a much larger share than previously recognized figure 1 russian military expenditure as a share of u s expenditure percent 2005 2018 richard connolly getting defense comparisons right much of this confusion over the relative scale of russian military expenditure is explained by differences in how analysts choose to measure military expenditure when u s dollars calculated at market exchange rates are used to measure military expenditure across countries the data can fluctuate wildly over time more often than not due to changes in relative exchange rates rather than because of any changes in a given country s military expenditure this was vividly illustrated in 2014 2015 when the ruble depreciated sharply vis à vis the dollar largely due to collapse in the global price of oil russian military expenditure calculated at market exchange rates was presented as having declined even if in ruble terms military expenditure was in fact growing briskly but exchange rate volatility is hardly the main reason why market exchange rates should not be used to measure military expenditure in russia china or any other country this is because converting military expenditure measured in national currencies to a common currency usually the u s dollar at market exchange rates conceals important differences in purchasing power across countries many goods and services have different relative prices within a country with non traded goods and services being relatively less expensive in poorer countries this can result in military expenditure being drastically understated in countries with lower income levels and correspondingly lower costs than the united states comparing defense expenditures using market exchange rate methodologies results in a parade of erroneous figures which can be observed in annual think tank assessments such as those made by the stockholm international peace research institute sipri or the international institute for strategic studies flagship publication the military balance the problem was best illustrated earlier this spring when sipri announced that russian defense spending in 2018 had fallen behind saudi arabia and france to sixth in the world at 61 4 billion similarly a chapter in the military balance comparing defense expenditure shows russian expenditure to be a paltry 45 billion based on constant 2010 market exchange rates less than that of the united kingdom these of course are remarkable assertions one need not be a russian military analyst to have a general appreciation for the fact that the russian armed forces including conventional and nuclear components are vastly larger in size greater in fielded capability and in a higher state of readiness than those of france or the united kingdom the most appropriate method for taking differences in relative costs across countries into account is therefore to use a ppp exchange rate today the international monetary fund calculates an implied ppp exchange rate of 23 4 rubles to the dollar given that the actual market exchange rate is 65 rubles to the dollar this would suggest that the value of economic activity in russia is over two and a half times larger than implied by the prevailing market exchange rate an equally important problem is how one compares gdp and relative living standards russia s economy which may seem to be closer to the size of south korea s based on simplistic conversions at current market exchange rates is more accurately reflected as the sixth largest economy in the world this is because while market exchange rates are appropriate for measuring the value of internationally traded goods ppp rates should be used when measuring non traded goods and services it is precisely these non traded goods and services that tend to dominate military expenditure in countries like russia that have sizeable and largely autarkic defense industries a closer look at russian defense spending in a recently published research paper sponsored by cna russian military expenditure is calculated using ppp exchange rates that account for differences in the cost of inputs in russian rubles the use of purchasing power based estimates reveals not only that the level of russian military expenditure is considerably higher than market exchange rate based estimates suggest but that this level has been much higher than commonly estimated since the 1990s second ppp based estimates show that the rate of growth of russian military expenditure was slower than suggested by market exchange rate based estimates third russia s rate of growth in military expenditure since 2005 was also lower than that of other powers such as china and india this is partially due to the fact that russia started from a higher base but it also reflects the fact that china india saudi arabia and many other non western powers have been engaged in a robust expansion of military spending fourth after adjusting ppp based estimates of total military expenditure for imported military equipment russia has held a steady position as the world s fourth largest military spender behind the united states china and india as a middle income country with lower costs russia spends much less maintaining its military than western states with about a third of its force made up of conscripts even if a conscript force performs worse on average than an all volunteer force conscripts can readily achieve a state s military objectives because military operations are performed by specific operationally assigned forces in defined geographic areas not by notional forces logged in excel spreadsheets of nationwide capability russia s 2014 crimea operation and 2015 intervention in syria illustrate this point as a result the russian general staff gets a lot more capability out of its military expenditure than many other higher cost militaries while some countries like india may effectively spend more on paper based on ppp the reality is that the russian defense budget over time allows moscow to wield a much bigger and pointier stick russia s state armament program has been hampered by two factors a messy divorce with ukraine s defense sector and the loss of access to certain enabling technologies imported from the west this led to major delays in several sectors and costly efforts at import substitutions chiefly of components from ukraine however this has over time made the russian military industrial complex much more self sufficient and even less dependent on imports than it was before sanctions were imposed making ppp even more useful for measuring the true level of russian defense spending furthermore the russian state has made sure that the defense sector is on a diet in terms of the profits it is allowed to make from state defense orders while this led to a debt bubble within the russian defense industry it also suggests that the state is able to get more output from the defense sector relative to other sectors of the economy although the level of russian defense spending is higher than many previously thought it is also true that it is declining as a share of gdp the russian government has chosen to let defense expenditure plateau for two reasons first because a large amount of equipment was successfully procured between 2011 and 2016 resulting in significant modernization of a previously aging force and second to avoid the sort of runaway defense spending that contributed to the soviet union s economic ruin but this slowdown in the growth of defense spending should not be confused with slashing defense spending to levels that might drastically reduce russia s military capability there is no evidence that such steep reductions are taking place instead russia is charting a middle course not killing itself with unsustainable soviet style spending on defense but equally avoiding painful reductions in order to meet the reformists demands better data for better strategy during the cold war estimating soviet defense spending proved one of the most hotly contested subjects within the u s defense community because it was an essential input into u s strategy toward a superpower adversary differing estimates of soviet expenditure were produced by the cia which based its estimates on a wealth of unclassified and classified material and the analysts located outside the intelligence community who relied on open source material as the soviet economy stagnated in the 1970s and 1980s debates over the ability of the soviet economy to support the burden of the country s vast military expenditure intensified this conversation is no less important today the strategy community needs better measures and a smarter conversation on military expenditure overestimating or underestimating adversaries can lead to the misallocation of scarce resources or bad strategy president john f kennedy and president ronald reagan both entered office mistakenly believing the united states was falling behind its soviet adversary the opposite was true perhaps more dangerously relying on simple but often distorted measures of relative capabilities raises the prospect of u s policymakers like their british counterparts a century before them failing to appreciate the erosion in their own country s military power it is certainly possible to be better at assessing russia s military expenditure than it was 30 years ago although it is true that the russian defense budget has become increasingly opaque in recent years america has much better information today on the state of the russian economy and its defense spending than it did when trying to assess the soviet union s capabilities unfortunately greater information has not translated into better analysis or more informed discourse among policymakers and academics alike on the real balance of power between the united states and its supposed competitors measuring military power is fraught with difficulty because it can be so context driven and scenario based but if russian defense spending is much larger than meets the eye it suggests that the united states will struggle to maintain a favorable balance of power over time given increased pressure from china the u s defense budget is not as vastly superior as it seems and given the numerous contingencies washington faces u s military expenditure by itself will not naturally confer the ability to deter russia in europe simultaneous pursuit of deterrence by denial against both countries near their borders seeking to prevent so called faits accomplis via direct defense is likely to prove an unaffordable and unrealistic strategy for the united states meanwhile those interested in the structural distribution of power particularly realists need to look again at their arguments which bend towards the conventional wisdom that russia is a tiny economy in decline a fixation on china in strategist circles overlooks the simple fact that while russia is certainly not going to be the world s next superpower it remains one of the largest economies and has a defense budget sufficient to maintain a military capable of challenging the united states conventionally beyond military expenditure many of the other parameters used to set expectations of a country s rise or decline such as demographics require greater scrutiny as they are probably based on equally questionable data the truth is that at times defense economists are decidedly lazy in how they measure power compare key national indicators and form their expectations about the future balance there is also a tendency to assume that rise and decline are secular trends i e that china will continue rising as russia declines the historical track record of these two powers suggests otherwise russian military expenditure and as a consequence the potential for russia to sustain its military power is much more durable and less prone to fluctuations than it might appear the implication is that even at its current anemic rate of economic growth russia is likely to be able to sustain a considerable level of military expenditure posing an enduring challenge to the united states for the foreseeable decades while ours is an exploratory analysis it suggests that russian defense spending is not prone to wild swings nor has it been dramatically affected by changes in oil prices or u s sanctions given the disparity in national budget allocations even as european allies increase their defense spending moscow is not going to struggle in keeping pace michael kofman is director and senior research scientist at cna corporation and a fellow at the wilson center s kennan institute previously he served as program manager at the national defense university the views expressed here are his own richard connolly is director of the centre for russian european and eurasian studies at the university of birmingham and senior lecturer in political economy his research and teaching are

spread the love prices are essential signals for coordinating the distribution of goods in an economy prices tell us where scarce resources are most needed f a hayek s insights on this have been summarized by peter leeson market prices he argues signal to producers and consumers the relative scarcity of resources they tell producers how to combine resources in the ways that produce the most value for consumers and tell consumers when they should expand or contract their consumption of various goods and services so what would happen if prices were controlled by government policy the answer bad things trouble in zimbabwe between 1983 and 1985 president muhammadu buhari was general muhammadu buhari the military head of state of nigeria he instituted price controls on milk soap sugar etc overnight milk soap and sugar disappeared from the shelves in different stores this is not rocket science once it becomes illegal for producers and sellers to sell their commodities over a certain price and that price is less than what it costs to make that commodity available producers and sellers will not make that commodity available for example say there are one hundred million nigerians who eat bread then the government passes a law stipulating that bread should not be sold for more than 150 naira forty one cents per loaf since many bakeries have different costs of production for their bread they would be affected differently let s say there are one hundred bakeries in the country those whose bread costs 150 naira and above to make and who have to sell above that price to make a profit would go out of business let s say forty bakeries fall into this category now we have only sixty bakeries to provide bread for the one hundred million people remember the quantity of bread demanded did not decrease yet we now have fewer bakeries selling bread the result is a reduction in the supply of bread according to the economic principle of demand and supply the price of bread will go up because supply just been reduced and there are more people competing for the limited bread supply but remember that bakeries cannot sell bread for more than 150 naira if the bakeries continue to sell bread at 150 naira there won t be enough supply so people will have to line up for the limited amount available shortages will result you may say why can t the sixty bakeries increase their production capacity to cover the lost supply of the remaining forty bakeries that just went out of business in an unhampered market they easily could but under a regime of price controls they can t why because to increase production bakeries need to buy more equipment and ingredients but without charging more for bread it s unlikely that these bakers will be able to cover their costs that is increasing production would be financial suicide in reality what happens is that some of those bakeries owners will be willing to take the risk of going to prison or in some cases losing their lives to sell their bread to the more desperate customers at a higher price creating a black market but the thing with black markets is that since they are illegal and sellers are exposed to the risk of prison or death if caught prices will be well above the mandated legal price ceilings but black markets are not a substitute for a truly free market and in many cases such as that of zimbabwe price controls mean that the economy comes to a halt plunging people into squalor and untold suffering as a result president mugabe of zimbabwe embarked on economic reforms in the early 1990s but because these reforms did not feature more market freedom other disasters awaited by the late 2000s the reserve bank of zimbabwe had printed so much money that its supply rose far beyond what was demanded resulting in hyperinflation it became so bad that by november 2008 the inflation rate had reached 89 7 sextillion percent per year according to economist steve hanke new money had to be printed to reflect these changes and the highest denomination of the zimbabwe dollar during this era was the one hundred trillion note by 2009 the central bank had stopped printing currency as it had become completely worthless the country started using the currencies of other countries such as the south african rand in 2015 the zimbabwean state announced that it would start using the us dollar as legal tender but all this inflation led to a perceived need for even more price controls mugabe thus instituted new price controls and the economy came to a halt thomas sowell describing the situation quotes the new york times bread sugar and cornmeal staples of every zimbabwean s diet have vanished seized by mobs who denuded stores like locusts in wheat fields meat is virtually nonexistent even for members of the middle class who have money to buy it on the black market gasoline is nearly unobtainable hospital patients are dying for lack of basic medical supplies power blackouts and water cutoffs are endemic hunter lewis continues zimbabwe was once considered a breadbasket of africa but in the 2000s began to suffer mass starvation the principal reason was that president robert mugabe promised land reform but actually gave the once rich farms to his cronies at about the same time everything was price controlled often below the cost of production the central bank was printing unlimited numbers of zimbabwean dollars so that by 2008 prices were rising 98 a day property and market values plunged by at least 99 but it was hard to say for sure because there were no buyers while these events were unfolding mugabe railed against greedy entrepreneurs ruthless markets and the forces of globalization mugabe blamed capitalism and the united states but it was his regime that destroyed the economy for his people through price controls and inflationary monetary policy it s ironic that in 2015 the zimbabwean state started using the us dollar as legal tender the cycle began again in 2019 when the new regime created a new currency and decreed that all foreign currencies would no longer be legal tender again history is repeating itself source mises wire share this share

speech by philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb at the central bank of ireland ecb conference on household finance and consumption introduction it is a special pleasure to speak at the sixth conference on household finance and consumption which is jointly organised this year by the central bank of ireland and the european central bank the engine behind this conference series is the eurosystem s household finance and consumption network which coordinates the household finance and consumption survey hfcs the hfcs gives us an insight into the distributions of assets liabilities and incomes across euro area households it is very promising that many of you together with other researchers are using this dataset to improve our understanding of key features of economic behaviour in europe in my remarks today i wish to discuss the relevance of differences across households for macroeconomic outcomes and the transmission of monetary policy households differ across many dimensions age geography employment income wealth assets and debt it follows that the impact of a macroeconomic shock or a shift in monetary policy will naturally vary across households in turn understanding how shocks and policies affect different types of households has the potential to improve our modelling of aggregate dynamics compared with the restrictive approach of imposing that aggregate household behaviour can be adequately represented by a single representative household moreover the examination of household level data is also important in measuring the distributional impact of macroeconomic shocks and macro financial policy decisions which can help inform wider policy discussions about income distribution before turning to the microeconomic evidence a natural starting point is to review the standard macroeconomic analysis of aggregate consumption dynamics chart 1 shows that consumption has increased steadily in recent years which lines up with the substantial increase in household incomes due to rising employment and increasing wages another important indicator is consumer confidence which in turn relates to how consumers view their personal financial situation and the wider macroeconomic situation chart 2 in addition households do not only consume but also contribute to investment in the form of residential property both house purchases and renovations chart 3 chart 1 households real disposable income and consumption year on year percentage changes percentage point contributions sources eurostat and ecb calculations notes all income components are deflated with the gdp deflator the contribution from the terms of trade is proxied by the differential in the gdp and consumption deflator consumption and total disposable income are deflated with the consumption deflator latest observation q3 2019 for real consumption and q2 2019 for the rest chart 2 euro area consumer confidence percentage balances deviation from mean sources european commission and ecb calculations latest observation november 2019 chart 3 household investment year on year percentage changes sources eurostat and ecb note the data refer to nominal gross fixed capital formation by households and non profit institutions serving households latest observation q2 2019 for monetary policy analysis an important question is the extent to which easier financial conditions have contributed to these dynamics through a variety of direct and indirect channels a comprehensive analysis of this question requires a microeconomic approach which takes into account relevant differences across households household level data such as those available from the hfcs are essential for this purpose these data highlight some quantitatively important dimensions of heterogeneity in the euro area which can be grouped into two broad categories first the level and volatility of income varies across households according to socio economic characteristics such as education age and occupation households with different income sources e g employees firm owners unemployed different skill levels or different labour supply elasticities will respond differently to macroeconomic shocks in turn wages vary strongly with characteristics such as age and education such differences not only matter for understanding how different types of households react differently to economic shocks evidence suggests that changes in the composition of the workforce can help explaining euro area wage growth at the aggregate level estimates for the largest four euro area countries indicate that the increase in income after an expansionary monetary policy shock is particularly large for households in the lowest income quintile chart 4 the explanation is that low income households are substantially more likely to be unemployed at any point in time it follows that this group is more likely to benefit from the employment creation triggered by a monetary expansion similarly the elasticity of labour income in relation to changes in aggregate gdp growth is significantly higher for workers in lower income households chart 4 effect of monetary policy easing on household income by income quintile percentages sources lenza m and slacalek j 2018 op cit eurosystem household finance and consumption survey wave 2 notes the chart taken from lenza m and slacalek j 2018 op cit shows the percentage change in mean income across income quintiles in the euro area four quarters after the impact of a quantitative easing shock which is assumed to correspond to a 30 basis point drop in the spread between a 10 year sovereign bond and the policy rate it also shows the decomposition of the change into the extensive margin transition from unemployment to employment and the intensive margin increase in wages the numbers in brackets show the initial levels of mean gross household income in each quintile the statistics cover the euro area which is modelled here as an aggregate of france germany italy and spain second households differ substantially in the size and composition of the assets they own and in their indebtedness chart 5 based on the second wave of the hfcs almost 60 percent of euro area households are homeowners of which about a third have a mortgage almost all households own financial assets even if their value is typically only a small fraction of the value of their real estate holdings these dimensions of household heterogeneity clearly matter for the exposure of individual households to monetary policy decisions chart 5 household assets and debt by income quintile x axis quintiles and deciles y axis eur thousands sources de bond g et al op cit and household finance and consumption survey results from the second wave notes the chart shows the average value of assets and debt per household across five income quintiles for the euro area the top quintile is further broken down into two deciles housing wealth is composed of the households main residence and other real estate other assets include the value of households vehicles voluntary pension life insurance shares valuables bonds managed accounts and money owed to households for instance ecb simulations suggest that unexpectedly low inflation tends to harm young and middle aged households and more so for young income rich households that disproportionately have nominal debt liabilities by contrast older households tend to gain from unexpectedly low inflation especially if they are income rich since this group tends to hold nominal assets to the extent that their financial assets have short maturities and their mortgages have adjustable rates households will also be differently affected by a reduction in the interest rate the estimates in chart 6 show that an average net borrower has gained close to eur 2 000 per year in lower interest payments in recent years whereas an average net saver has lost close to eur 700 per year chart 6 change in net interest income for borrowers and savers in the euro area euros per household change in annual net interest income 2007 2017 sources dossche m et al op cit using the household finance and consumption survey second wave notes net borrowers are defined as households with a negative net financial wealth position and net savers are defined as households with a positive net financial wealth position percentages in brackets indicate the share of net borrowers and net savers in the total household population analogously only homeowners will benefit from any increase in house prices induced by a monetary policy easing and those with mortgages will benefit disproportionately due to the impact of leverage conversely chart 7 reports estimates of the evolution of household net wealth as a result of the lower house prices observed in many countries between 2011 and 2014 it suggests that the net wealth of homeowners declined by 6 percentage points more than the wealth of renters the decline was especially marked for homeowners with mortgages for whom it amounted to as much as around 20 percent chart 7 growth of median net wealth by housing status 2011 14 hicp adjusted percentages source household finance and consumption survey waves 1 and 2 note the chart shows the growth rates of the median net wealth in the euro area for outright owners owners with a mortgage and renters from 2011 to 2014 deflated by the hicp assessing the overall implications of these many dimensions of heterogeneity is challenging recent ecb research suggests that the most important dimension of heterogeneity is related to employment status following an easing of monetary policy conditions there are disproportionate increases in income in the lower part of the income distribution which results in a decline in measured income inequality by contrast since a majority of households are homeowners an increase in house prices due to a looser monetary policy has a relatively even impact of house prices across the wealth distribution at the same time it is worth keeping in mind that the degree of home ownership can vary considerably across countries the more concentrated ownership of equities and bonds among households means that this component of the wealth distribution varies with the monetary stance even while recalling that many households have indirect financial holdings through pension funds and other types of investment vehicles from a broader perspective we should also bear in mind that the contribution of monetary policy to changes in inequality is small compared with the role of fiscal policy especially the degree of redistribution in the design of the tax and transfer systems and structural economic trends differences across households also matter for the relation between aggregate income and aggregate consumption in particular if an increase in aggregate income is not uniform across households the overall consumption response will depend on the marginal propensity to consume that is the fraction of an additional euro received that is spent on consumption of the different household types a rich empirical literature has uncovered considerable heterogeneity in marginal propensity to consume across household types in particular this literature finds that the spending decisions of households owning few liquid assets are much more sensitive to shocks than the spending decisions of households that own sufficient liquid buffers similarly highly indebted households tend to have a higher propensity to consume than savers quantifying the implications for the transmission of monetary policy of heterogeneity in the marginal propensity to consume requires detailed institutional and socio economic information on households at higher frequency this type of information is available in certain countries and it is encouraging that researchers are starting to make use of it the results indicate that this heterogeneity does play a role in shaping the transmission of monetary policy beyond the intertemporal substitution channel other channels have been highlighted by the expanding literature on heterogeneous agent new keynesian hank models these include a cash flow channel through which the decline in debt service for debtors means that they have more of their income available for spending an income channel whereby higher consumption expenditure results from the increase in employment and wages and a wealth channel such that the increase in asset valuations generates more spending through wealth effects some initial estimates of the quantitative impact of all these channels are also available for the euro area they are reported in chart 8 where households are classified into three groups i renters with limited financial assets ii homeowners with limited financial assets but possibly a sizable mortgage and iii homeowners with adequate financial assets according to this classification 10 percent of households in the euro area are renters with limited financial assets 12 percent are homeowners with limited financial assets and 78 percent are homeowners with adequate financial assets chart 8 effects of a 100 basis point cut in interest rates on consumption in the euro area depending on household wealth change in consumption percentages source slacalek tristani and violante 2019 household finance and consumption survey wave 2 notes the figure shows a decomposition of the effects of a 100 basis point cut in interest rates on consumption the total consists of four parts the standard intertemporal substitution effect ies the cash flow effect the income effect and the housing wealth effect the size of these effects varies depending on households wealth euro area in this chart refers to france germany italy and spain this classification is relevant since it has been argued that the two groups of households with limited financial assets are more constrained in their ability to smooth consumption over time and tend to respond more strongly to temporary changes in income in addition the composition of wealth of the different groups varies while homeowners with limited financial assets tend to have a mortgage and their debt service decreases when the policy rate is cut the homeowners with substantial financial assets often experience lower returns on interest rate bearing assets if the policy rate declines chart 8 decomposes the overall effect on consumer spending into the components attributable to the various transmission channels first the standard intertemporal substitution channel is present only for financially unconstrained households which are able to save it makes up only about a third of the total impact on aggregate consumption second the cash flow channel is particularly strong for homeowners with limited financial assets who tend to have large mortgages often with adjustable rates third spending is substantially stimulated via the income channel this channel is heavily skewed towards lower income households who also tend to benefit disproportionately from a stronger labour market fourth the strongest asset price effect occurs through the increases in house prices this effect turns out to be quite large for highly leveraged homeowners since their consumption is more sensitive to house prices overall the spending of the lower income cohort and the cohort of homeowners with only limited financial assets is much more strongly stimulated by monetary policy easing a 100 basis point cut in interest rates increases consumption of these groups by almost 1 0 percent and 1 6 percent respectively while consumption of the financially unconstrained group increases only by 0 4 percent these estimates suggest that the standard intertemporal substitution channel substantially contributes to the spending decision of many households but the other three channels which have traditionally been neglected are decisive for the consumption choice of the lower income cohort and highly leveraged homeowners these three channels contribute about two thirds of the total response of aggregate consumption to a monetary policy shift it follows that household heterogeneity can help to explain how the effects of monetary policy can be relatively large due to the larger consumption response of the hand to mouth group even if the intertemporal substitution channel is weaker than in the representative agent framework to summarise it is important to account for heterogeneity in the transmission of monetary policy but this is not a simple exercise comparisons between winners and losers based on a single channel or a specific factor are necessarily incomplete and likely to prove misleading concluding remarks let me conclude attention to variation across households and its relation to monetary policy is welcome it helps us to make progress in understanding the key features of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy it is also very promising that the economics profession is finding ways to incorporate relevant dimensions of household heterogeneity in our models this flourishing field recognises that monetary transmission is more complicated and dependent on many institutional features than suggested by the traditional representative agent model further advances will require more data and more analysis an essential source to estimate these effects in the euro area is the hfcs one avenue is to make use of the administrative data available in other datasets including tax data and credit registers to complement and improve the information collected via household surveys i very much applaud this effort another important element is to better understand how consumers form expectations to this end the ecb is working on establishing a consumer expectations survey which we hope will provide a useful basis to deepen our understanding of consumer behaviour at a granular level and the extent to which this matters for macroeconomic outcomes

2 the benchmark over the longer term principally through exploiting inefficiencies in the pricing of closed end funds this objective is intended to reflect the company s aim of providing a better return to shareholders over the longer term than they would get by placing money on deposit the benchmark is a target only and should not be treated as a guarantee of the performance of the company or its portfolio investment policy the company invests in closed end investment funds traded on the london stock exchange s main market but has the flexibility to invest in investment funds listed or dealt on other recognised stock exchanges in unlisted closed end funds including but not limited to funds traded on aim and in open ended investment funds the funds in which the company invests may include all types of investment trusts companies and funds established onshore or offshore the company has the flexibility to invest in any class of security issued by investment funds including without limitation equity debt warrants or other convertible securities in addition the company may invest in other securities such as non investment fund debt if deemed to be appropriate to produce the desired returns to shareholders the company is unrestricted in the number of funds it holds however at the time of acquisition no investment will have an aggregated value totalling more than 15 of the gross assets of the company furthermore the company will not invest more than 10 in aggregate of the value of its gross assets at the time of acquisition in other listed closed end investment funds although this restriction does not apply to investments in any such funds which themselves have stated investment policies to invest no more than 15 of their gross assets in other listed closed end investment funds in addition the company will not invest more than 25 in aggregate of the value of its gross assets at the time of acquisition in open ended funds there are no prescriptive limits on allocation of assets in terms of asset class or geography there are no limits imposed on the size of hedging contracts save that their aggregated value will not exceed 20 of the portfolio s gross assets at the time they are entered into the board permits borrowings of up to 20 of the company s net asset value measured at the time new borrowings are incurred the company s investment objective may lead on occasions to a significant amount of cash or near cash being held chairman s statement i am pleased to present the report on your company s activities during the six months to 31 october 2019 performance over the six months to 31 october 2019 the company s net asset value per share total return was 1 2 and the share price total return was 4 5 these returns compare to the return from the company s benchmark sterling 3 month sonia 2 which delivered a total return of 1 4 a comprehensive review of the factors affecting the company s performance during the period can be found in the investment managers review later in this report share price share issuances and buybacks the share price reduced over the period from 276 5p to 264 0p the shares traded at a discount to net asset value per share of 3 0 at the end of the period demand for the company shares at the beginning of the period led to the issue of 150 000 new ordinary shares at a premium to net asset value not too long after that share issuance however the company s shares started trading at a discount to net asset value in order to keep the discount under control the company undertook a buyback of 100 000 shares at a price of 265 5 pence per share and a discount of 4 15 on 17 july 2019 as at 31 october 2019 the company had 28 054 985 30 april 2019 28 004 985 shares in issue since the period end the company bought back a further 100 000 shares at a price of 265 0 pence per share and a discount of 2 6 on 14 november 2019 leaving 27 954 985 shares in issue the company will always be proactive in managing its share price premium or discount issuing new shares at a premium to net asset value per share creates value for existing shareholders and any share issuance also improves the liquidity of the company s shares controls the premium to net asset value per share at which the shares trade and spreads the operating costs over a larger capital base reducing the ongoing charges ratio on the other hand share buybacks effectively reduce the overhang of shares in the market and like share issuances can correct imbalances of supply and demand the board and the investment managers are in regular contact in order to be able to react swiftly to any disproportionate premiums or discounts the company s shares are trading at communication with shareholders in order to produce cost savings reduce the company s carbon footprint and accelerate the provision of information to shareholders the board has decided to offer shareholders the option of receiving all company information electronically going forward a letter offering this opportunity was sent to shareholders together with the last annual report shareholders who elect to receive communications from the company in this way will be notified by post or if you prefer by email when information such as annual reports notices of shareholder meetings and other documents are published on our website www premiermiton com migo shareholders of course still have the right to request at no extra charge hard copy versions of the documents or information sent or supplied to you by means of the website outlook our investment manager continues to be well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise and well diversified to weather difficulties in the sector this continues to be recognised by our industry the company having won in the flexible investment category at the investment week investment company of the year awards 2018 and in the best mixed asset trust category at the money observer trust awards 2019 your board believes in the long term proposition of the company which is among other things evidenced by the fact that all directors own shares having aligned their interests with those of other shareholders richard davidson chairman 16 december 2019 investment manager s report for the period ended 31 october 2019 performance during the six months to 31 october 2019 our net asset value fell from 275 6p to 272 2p this represents a decline of 1 2 in comparison the ftse 100 index was flat on a total return basis our shares closed at 264 0p on the last day of october leaving our shares trading on a discount of 3 0 sector developments superficially it appears that our interim period was rather a quiet affair in practice there were some tumultuous events most notable was the implosion of woodford investment management which will reverberate around financial markets for some time to come in response to this episode wealth managers and institutions have become focused on the liquidity within their portfolios in practice many funds have become illiquid by virtue of their large size often running to many billions this has led to widespread selling of smaller companies and investment trusts this has triggered a widening of discounts across our portfolio as managers attempt to demonstrate that they could manage a run of redemptions in their funds we estimate that the real time discount of our largest twelve positions approaches 25 a situation we have not seen for several years in the circumstances our net asset value which is calculated using the depressed market price rather than the value of its underlying portfolio has held up well during a difficult period for our universe a more helpful development has been the broadening of markets until recently we have endured a momentum or nothing phase a narrow range of defensive growth stocks have driven the indices ever higher given that we articulate a deep value special situations strategy it would cause alarm had we chosen to chase momentum the breakdown of this phenomenon appears to have been triggered by a reversal in bond yields it is interesting to note that in last year s interim report we commented that the yield on us ten year treasuries had risen to 3 2 at the time of writing they only offer 1 75 having fallen as far as 1 45 at one point the steady decline in yields was key in creating the momentum market the closed end sector continues to evolve into a home for alternative asset classes this category now exceeds equity funds for the first time it is possible to create far more diversification using closed end funds than their open ended peers as a far wider range of asset classes are available this partially explains the low correlation miton global opportunities demonstrates when measured against mainstream equity indices contributors alpha real estate continued to perform strongly earlier in the year it disposed of a data centre in frankfurt and a residential project in leeds both transactions triggered significant uplifts in the net asset value these disposals have made alpha s portfolio far more liquid which justifies the trust trading at a narrower discount than in the past in june a tender offer was made for up to 25 of the shares at 175p many shareholders accepted the offer boosting the value attributed to ongoing shareholders alpha shares have continued to appreciate baker steel and ecofin both benefited from investors flight to safe havens falling bond yields made ecofin s portfolio of utility and infrastructure companies attractive to income starved investors in the case of baker steel resources their 40 exposure to precious metals proved extremely helpful there are several exciting projects in baker steel s portfolio that are approaching commercialisation this leaves us optimistic about the outlook for this trust new positions after our successful due diligence trip to vietnam we initiated a position in vietnam enterprise in order to increase our exposure to the country vietnam has become a manufacturing hub in asia as china has become a more expensive location young demographics and a growing middle class will drive consumption and services increasingly essential expenditure is coming down as a percentage of income which again should drive the economy finally vietnam is a beneficiary of the trade war between china and the us as many companies have moved manufacturing capacity to vietnam this trend has accelerated post international tensions despite good performance over the past few years vietnamese trusts have continued to trade on wider discounts than would normally be expected this is partially because when they were launched some years ago vast sums were raised on the back of vietnam s popularity at the time both the trusts we own are sufficiently large to be constituents in the ftse 250 index this leaves supply rather larger than demand leaving the point where these are in equilibrium well below the current value of their portfolio we also started a position in oakley capital this trust had been on our avoid list for many years due to corporate governance issues such as issuing stock at a discount more recently the trust s management has evolved into a more professional operation however the discount reflects investors nervousness about past troubles detractors political issues were the main cause of two of our biggest detractors over the period phoenix spree deutschland and macau property opportunities in macau sentiment has been poor due to the riots in hong kong and the us china trade war many of the casinos in macau are owned by us companies and they have to renew their licenses over the coming months during our trip to the far east we were also able to visit macau and were struck by the amount of investment in the greater bay area we think it is unlikely that the chinese would wish to derail their plans for the area and so will be pragmatic in their dealings with the us companies the arrival of the new ceo in macau towards the end of the year should also help kick start the economy as he is likely to bring policy gifts from the mainland when he takes over unfortunately it is unlikely that the chinese will loosen restrictions on taking currency out of china until there is a resolution to the trade war this will impede the trust s ability to sell some of its upmarket properties to mainland chinese investors in june the berlin state government proposed a five year rent freeze for the city this hit the share price of phoenix spree deutschland as it led to uncertainty in practice the rent freeze is likely to be deemed unconstitutional as it is only the senate that can control rent regulation rather than the state government nevertheless any decision could take up to eighteen months to make its way through the slow process of the federal constitutional court this lengthy period will weigh on the share prices of german property companies phoenix spree however is able to pivot its business model away from rental into splitting up properties and selling them into the private market where the restrictions don t apply an announcement that they had begun this process as well as share buybacks have led to some recovery in the price the indian market has struggled due to problems in the non banking finance sector these companies have become the de facto lenders to small and medium sized businesses their capacity to lend has been impaired post a number of scandals which led to investors redeeming reducing capital available for them to lend once they pulled away from the market these businesses struggled to access financing india capital growth where the mandate focuses on small and medium sized businesses has been particularly hard hit by these developments we have been reducing our indian position in light of these short term headwinds outlook whilst it certainly does not feel like it at the moment events at woodford investment management will in the longer term prove beneficial for both miton global opportunities and investment trusts in general the debacle has highlighted how valuable the protection from having to accommodate daily inflows and outflows that the closed ended capital structure offers has been there has been a general decline in trading liquidity this makes it increasingly difficult for investors to buy and sell larger lines of stock making closed end protection even more valuable to managers of investment trusts in the future historically whenever discounts in our portfolio have been at the wider end of their range this has proved a leading indicator of decent periods of progress for our portfolio these have often proved short and sharp as they did in 2016 and 2017 there continue to be vast quantities of noise generated by issues such as brexit and trump s trade war with china this has contributed to the widening discounts in smaller closed end funds nevertheless these funds control assets which have a fundamental value the catalyst for many of our themes will be that the real world will buy the assets which have become undervalued by the city for internal structural reasons in many cases we will enjoy the benefit of the elimination of discounts at both portfolio and trust level nick greenwood charlotte cuthbertson miton asset

includes both ordinary and subscription share holdings includes both ordinary and convertible preference share holdings capital structure as at the date of this report the company s share capital comprises 27 954 985 ordinary shares of 1p each with one vote per share the company s articles of association contain provisions enabling shareholders to elect at three year intervals for the realisation of all or part of their shareholding the realisation opportunity at the discretion of the company shareholders may request that all or part of the ordinary shares they hold be placed repurchased or purchased out of the proceeds of an issue of new ordinary shares or purchased under a tender offer or by a market maker if realisation elections cannot be satisfied in their entirety through the placing and or repurchase mechanism all remaining elected shares shall be converted into realisation shares also in the event that the company does not make available to members an opportunity to effect such a realisation at the appointed time shareholders may serve a realisation election requesting that all or part of their ordinary shares be converted into realisation shares the portfolio would then be split into two separate and distinct pools pro rata as between the continuing ordinary shares the continuation pool and the realisation shares the realisation pool the continuation pool would be managed in accordance with the company s investment objective and policy while the assets comprising the realisation pool would be managed in accordance with an orderly realisation programme with the aim of making progressive returns of cash to holders of realisation shares as soon as practicable the precise mechanism for any return of cash to holders of realisation shares would depend on the relevant factors prevailing at the time and would be at the discretion of the board if the net asset value of the company s continuing ordinary shares is more than 30 million then the company would continue in operation in october 2018 the company offered a realisation opportunity giving shareholders the option either to retain or to realise their investment in the company realisation elections were received in respect of 1 55 of shares in issue at the time and these shares were subsequently placed in the market into ongoing demand there are currently no realisation shares in issue the next realisation opportunity will be offered to shareholders in 2021 the board intends to put forward tailored proposals in relation to each realisation opportunity to ensure it can be delivered efficiently and in accordance with the best interests of the company at the relevant point in time interim management report principal risks and uncertainties a review of the half year and the outlook for the company can be found in the chairman s statement and in the investment manager s review the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company fall into the following broad categories investment risks including market and discount risk liquidity cash and foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and macro risk strategic risks including shareholder relations and share price performance risk key person risk and company duration risk and operational risks in particular service provider risk these risks were explained in detail on pages 14 to 17 in the annual report for the year ended 30 april 2019 the company s principal risks and uncertainties have not changed materially since the date of that report and are not expected to change materially for the remaining six months of the company s financial year the board acknowledges the continued uncertainty surrounding the uk s decision to leave the eu while the board does not consider that this decision has significantly altered the risk profile of the company it acknowledges that there has been a considerable level of currency volatility since the decision was taken the company does not currently hedge its currency exposure related parties transactions during the first six months of the current financial year no transactions with related parties have taken place which have materially affected the financial position or the performance of the company going concern the directors believe having considered the company s investment objective risk management policies capital management policies and procedures the nature of the portfolio and expenditure projections that the company has adequate resources an appropriate financial structure and suitable management arrangements in place to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and more specifically that there are no material uncertainties pertaining to the company that would prevent its ability to continue in such operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of the approval of this half year report for these reasons the directors consider there is reasonable evidence to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the half yearly report directors responsibility statement the board of directors confirms that to the best of its knowledge the condensed set of financial statements contained within the half yearly report has been prepared in accordance with financial reporting standard 104 interim financial reporting and the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by dtr 4 2 7r of the disclosure guidance and transparency rules being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year and dtr 4 2 8r of the disclosure guidance and transparency rules being related party transactions that have taken place in the first six months of the current financial year and that have materially affected the financial position or performance of the entity during that period and any changes in the related party transactions described in the last annual report that could do so the half yearly report has not been

performance measures apms discount or premium apm a description of the difference between the share price and the net asset value per share the size of the discount or premium is calculated by subtracting the share price from the net asset value per share and is usually expressed as a percentage of the net asset value per share if the share price is higher than the net asset value per share the result is a premium if the share price is lower than the net asset value per share the shares are trading at a discount net asset value nav total return apm the nav is shareholders funds expressed as an amount per individual share shareholders funds are the total value of all the company s assets at current market value having deducted all liabilities and prior charges at their par value or at their asset value ongoing charges apm ongoing charges are calculated by taking the company s annualised revenue and capitalised expenses excluding finance costs and certain non recurring items expressed as a percentage of the average monthly net assets of the company during the year six months to six months to one year to 31 october 31 october 30 april 2019 2018 2019 000 000 000 management

annualised 1 3 1 4 1 4 the ongoing charges percentage reflects the costs incurred directly by the company which are associated with the management of a static investment portfolio consistent with aic guidance the ongoing charges percentage excludes non recurring items in addition the nav performance also includes the costs incurred directly or indirectly in investments that are managed by external fund managers many of these managers net these costs off within their valuations and therefore they form part of the company s investment return and it is not practical to calculate an ongoing charges percentage from the information they provide share price total return apm the combined effect of any dividends paid together with the rise and fall in the share price or nav total return statistics enable the investor to make performance comparisons between trusts with different dividend policies any dividends after tax received by a shareholder are assumed to have been reinvested in either additional shares of the trust at the time the shares go ex dividend the share price total return or in the assets of the trust at its nav per share the nav total return as the company does not currently pay dividends the nav and share price total return are calculated by taking the increase in the nav or share price during the relevant period and dividing by the opening nav or share price volatility volatility is related to the degree to which nav or prices differ from their mean the standard deviation volatility is calculated by taking the daily nav or closing prices over the relevant year and calculating the standard deviation of those prices the daily standard deviation is then multiplied by an annualisation factor being the square root of the number of the trading days in the

los angeles times cbs globally have been buying gold at a very strong pace and 2019 looks to be a record year for cb gold purchases with our target of 750 tonnes combined purchases likely to be met rising political risk together with negative european rates may be an important reason behind the large share of unaccounted gold investment over the past several years exhibit 17 shows cumulative unexplained gold demand based on world gold council post 2010 and gfms pre 2010 balances data it surged since 2016 similar dynamics can be seen when we look at implied vaulted gold stocks built in the uk and switzerland which is calculated as implied cumulative total net imports minus transparent etf gold stocks one can see that since the end of 2016 the implied build in non transparent gold investment has been much larger than the build in visible gold etfs see exhibit 18 this is consistent with reports that vault demand globally is surging political risks in our view help explain this because if an individual is trying to minimize the risks of sanctions or wealth taxes then buying physical gold bars and storing them in a vault where it is more difficult for governments to reach them makes sense finally this build can also reflect hedges by global high net worth individuals against tail economic and political risk scenarios in which they do not want to have any financial entity intermediating their gold positions due to the counterparty credit risk involved construction workers recently dug up an estimated 140 000 buried in packages at a site on australia s gold coast prompting a police search to find the trove s owner in september a court in germany ruled on a case brought by a man who stuffed more than 500 000 euros in a faulty boiler only to see it incinerated when a friend made a fix on a cold day while he was on vacation the man sued his friend for the value of the lost bank notes plus interest he lost rbnz unknown something strange is going on a similar amount in hard physical currency and precious metals is literally disappearing as we reported last week it was none other than goldman sachs which recently laid out the case for gold saying gold s strategic case still strong and as a result of geopolitical uncertainty there has been a record surge in gold demand by central banks themselves as goldman notes but it was another even more bizarre discovery by goldman that caught our eye according to the bank there has beenin just the 3 years as goldman s mikhail sprogis writes and another remarkable observation or rather lack thereof in other words goldman points out that just over the past three years there have been tens of billions in gold flows which have mysteriously and inexplicably disappeared from the official record yet which are most certainlysome australians are burying it the swiss might be hiding it the germans are probably hoarding indeed while banks are printing more bank notes than ever and these seem to be disappearing off the face of the earth and nobody knows where or why or as the wsj notes central banks don t know where they have gone or why and are playing detective trying to crack the same mystery of the 1 7 trillion in us dollars in cash circulation in 2018 up from 1 2 trillion 5 years prior the vast majority is offshore where it is quickly and quietly disappears as the world s second best physical store of value after gold of course a fed economist ruth judson wrote in 2017 thatsocking those bills away provides some protection against economic turmoil especially in countries with a record of instability in their own financial systems take australia there the stock of australian bank notes on issue relative to the size of the economy is near the highest it has been in 50 years said philip lowe governor of australia s central bank he showed off newly printed bank notes to diners at a recent event in melbourne and estimated that about 2 000 in printed bills exists for every australian and just to inspire confidence in his own job he added i for one don t have anywhere near that amount on hand in a few years he will wish he did to be sure there is the criminal element as anyone who has watched a documentary on pablo escobar knows the colombian drug kingpin buried tens of billions in the ground for safe keeping in fact as the accountant s story writes as such dollar bills are often vital grease for criminal gangs and tax cheats and collectors who worry about a future collapse of the financial system but these two groups are far too small to explain the wholesale loss of cash as central bankers scramble to follow the money and glean how society s saving and spending patterns change in a time of zero and negative interest rates as the wsj notes bankers aren t just hunting down cash to satisfy their own curiosity then there are bizarre incidents such as these people hide their money everywhere said sven bertelmann head of the bundesbank s national analysis centre in mainz germany it happens again and again that people keep money in an envelope and then they shred it by mistake mr bertelmann said we pick up the bank notes with tweezers and then start to put them together like a jigsaw puzzle few are as perplexed by the fate of the missing cash as the german central bank this has led the european central bank and others to ask the public for help everyone says that they are not hoarding cash but the money is clearly somewhere said henk esselink head of the issue and circulation section in the ecb s currency management division australia s central bank says its best guess is that tax avoidance or illegal payments that is 7 6 billion australian dollars 5 2 billion missing at the beach or in couch cushions or simply lost in a boating accident to avoid the taxman until the rainy days arrive in safes under beds and at the back of cupboards both here in australia and elsewhere around the world mr lowe the rba governor said officials at the swiss national bank came up with another theory hoarded bank notes should wear out less because they aren t being used for everyday transactions demand for high denomination bank notes tends to rise when interest rates are low households feel distrustful of the banking system or people want to make transactions anonymously sure enough snb officials found that hoarding of swiss francs jumped around the year 2000 likely motivated by fear of the y2k bug infecting computer systems the bursting of the dot com bubble the september 11 terrorist attacks and introduction of the euro the financial crisis that began in 2007 encouraged people to stash even more meanwhile with a financial crisis looming and getting closer by the day for some countries such as new zealand making money disappear is becoming a national pastime as the wsj concludes around a third of new zealand s new bank notes headed overseas in 2017 up from 6 four years earlier that happened around the time that tourism overtook dairy as the country s main export money spinner leading officials to speculate on the role played by currency exchanges especially in asia the trail mostly ran cold after that our sense is that we re in the same boat as a lot of other central banks out there said christian hawkesby assistant governor at the rbnz well christian the answer to where all that cash is going is simple and is shown on the image below

article 3 months old feature stories dec 16 2019 this article was first published for subscribers on december 6 and is now open for general readership recession or recovery the global economy is on a knife edge heading into 2020 due to ongoing uncertainties meeting renewed central bank support how should investors greet the new year all hinges on trade political risks ongoing central bank easing to continue recession but a tariff away by greg peel at first glance says morgan stanley the 2020 outlook looks easy the investment bank s economists expect global growth to bottom in the first quarter of the year and then improve modestly thereafter that implies us and global manufacturing pmis purchasing managers index should inflect back to expansion 50 and pmi inflections usually boost equity and credit returns however typically when pmis have been weak implying a soft economy so too have asset valuations been weak but currently valuations are unusually high and the economists are not expecting a substantial pmi rebound indeed they expect an unusually weak one the recovery in economic growth morgan stanley is expecting in 2020 varies widely in magnitude and timing across the globe and such an uneven recovery will collide with relatively even global valuations and of course all hinges on trade with the enactment of trump s planned december 15 tariffs still a source of uncertainty enough to swing the economists forecasts toward global recession this is not nonetheless morgan stanley s base case morgan stanley expects us growth to stabilise around trend in 2020 as lower rates help to offset fading fiscal support external headwinds should ease for the eurozone as the impact of policy stimulus sets in leading to a modest recovery while japan remains sluggish with the government s consumption tax offsetting a construction boost from the tokyo olympics the uk should improve on an orderly brexit resolution and subsequent fiscal support on the assumption of an easing in trade tensions as morgan stanley is so far making although clearly this is the swing factor china will see a lift in corporate sentiment aided by ongoing policy support other emerging markets will also benefit from resultant macro stability and the capacity for further monetary easing morgan stanley does not foresee subsequent upward pressure on global inflation with the us forecast to rise to 2 but stay there and eurozone japan inflation to remain well below target for china higher inflation has been driven by food prices particularly for pork due to swine fever but this should reverse by the second half of the 32 central banks morgan stanley pays attention to across the globe 20 have already eased in 2019 and 14 are expected to ease further taking the global weighted average cash rate to a seven year low by march us eurozone and japanese rates are forecast to remain where they are while the uk may hike once towards the end of 2020 as brexit issues ease as far as equity investment is concerned morgan stanley is underweight the us given peak earnings risk over valuation and unique political risk which can only mean you know who the broker is more positive on earnings growth potential in japan and sees scope for multiple re rating in europe as political risks fade the us election for at least a year the common view among pundits is that on the one hand china s intention is to continuously drag out trade negotiations seemingly getting close before backing off again right through to the us elections in november while donald trump will be anxious not to risk leading the us into a trade related recession as that would no doubt upset his voter base at a critical time this week trump declared he would not be fussed if no trade deal were signed before the election which did not sit well with wall street given trump is demonstrably sensitive about any wall street sell off this comment must surely be a warning to china that he too can sit it out without fear with an intention of thus spurring beijing into action the interesting point here is that if beijing is hoping it can bring down trump by not signing a trade deal thus starting 2021 with a far more rational democrat president to negotiate with it is somewhat misguided while the incumbent far right in the white house and senate is an ideological chasm away from the democrat led house and the current far left democrat nominee front runners one thing the two parties do agree upon is trade the democrats agree china needs to be brought to heel and thus are not highlighting trade as any point of policy difference if whoever the democrat nominee turns out to be is equally tough on trade and bear in mind protectionism is typically a left not right wing plank then trump may not wish to be seen to compromise credit suisse suggests this puts trump in a difficult position if he can pull off a trade deal on the basis of chinese concessions he will ride into the election as a hero if china does not back down he could choose to make concessions to get a deal over the line for the sake of appeasing his tariff impacted voter base but then risk appearing weak against his democrat opponent from china s perspective its plan to hold out for a better deal under a different president may backfire the potential twist and turns could be discussed for months and quite possibly will be but as far as 2020 outlooks for us and global economic growth or otherwise are concerned trade is the big swing factor all forecasters retain trade as their caveat whether forecasts are for a stronger or weaker 2020 the enactment of the december 15 tariffs is not morgan stanley s base case as noted above but if those tariffs go ahead all bets are off morgan stanley is not alone trade the stars are aligning for an equity market rally into year end said shaw partners in their november outlook indeed the s p500 hit new all time highs throughout november but aside from easing brexit fears the driving force was belief that a trade deal actually was close despite being described as close by the white house for a good year and a half developments in december have seen doubt creep in once more as for brexit the recent uk supreme court ruling has substantially reduced the chances of no deal pimco suggests as it has strengthened the role of parliament shaw partners believes the upcoming uk election will act as a referendum if pro brexit parties win as the polls suggest then the new parliament will be able to ratify boris johnson s agreement signed with brussels in the unlikely event the pro remain parties win brexit would be cancelled either result is a positive for markets shaw believed as it prepared its november outlook trump needs a result on trade to support his election campaign given the easing of trade tensions should support us growth in 2020 equity markets globally are further supported by an abundance of liquidity as central banks around the globe spent 2019 easing policy shaw thus suggests investors be overweight equities trade again being the caveat at the expense of more conservative asset classes shaw agrees with morgan stanley in being positive on japan and on europe once brexit uncertainty is lifted but disagrees on the us seeing further upside potential amundi asset management also cites the us election as reason there will not be a material escalation in the trade war which would damage the us economy even if the noise around trade is ongoing retreat in global trade is a major change to the structure of growth says amundi but will not lead to a full blown recession not at a time of cumulatively loose monetary policies and with a partial trade deal in sight like shaw amundi s 2020 investment outlook was written in november monetary and fiscal a theme that will become prominent next year and beyond amundi believes is the combination of monetary and fiscal policies which may extend the cycle further beyond the short term the trend towards a more aggressive policy mix could potentially lead to further unorthodox measures if the risk of recession intensifies the result may be an extension of the credit cycle that could eventually end in an explosion although not as early as 2020 credit suisse lists as one of its primary risks for 2020 the potential for the chinese triple bubble in credit real estate and investment to unwind china has experienced the fourth biggest increase in credit to gdp of any economy over a ten year period and the three topping china ireland spain and thailand all ended up in major recession an unwind of the bubble requires a sharp drop in chinese house prices credit suisse suggests and to date this is not happening for amundi the risk of more aggressive policy is one of investors being forced to pile into already crowded or illiquid areas where risk is masked by excessive policy accommodation instead of fearing global recession investors should focus on adjusting portfolio exposure to the de globalisation trend they should also prepare for a mature and extended credit cycle amundi advises with higher liquidity risks due to more stringent regulations post the gfc in other words strong corporate balance sheets are fundamental pimco believes the global economy is about to enter a window of weakness which should persist heading into 2020 uncertainty remains as to whether it will be a window into recovery or recession during this period pimco suggests it would be prudent to focus on capital preservation to be relatively light in taking top down macro risk meaning assets held from a global economic perspective as opposed to bottom up micro risk which is stock specific to be cautious on corporate credit and equities and to be ready to take advantage of opportunities as they present which would imply holding a level of cash pimco s base case scenario is for global gdp to slow further for the next several quarters on trade uncertainty and widespread global political uncertainty labour markets and consumer spending have remained firm in most advanced economies but pimco sees the slump in trade and manufacturing as spilling over into the wider economy via lower corporate profits hiring and investment the analysts expect us gdp growth to slow to 1 in the first half of 2020 down from 2 in the june quarter 2019 and 3 in the march quarter surprisingly amidst ongoing trade related recession fears pimco has found no tangible evidence the trade war is adversely affecting the us economy if anything the us trade deficit has improved slightly relative to trend in 2019 implying a slight boost to gdp growth rather than drag other claims to see developments in capital spending by us corporations have also shown some recent improvement if anything core inflation measures have rebounded slightly in recent months but only from exceptionally low levels seen early in the year pimco does not expect fed policy nor current gdp growth rates will provide any meaningful upward pressure on inflation another of credit suisse s perceived major risks is an aggressive pick up in us wage growth signalling the labour market is at full capacity occurring at a time when underlying measures of us inflation are starting to rise pimco forecasts a small pick up in eurozone gdp growth in 2020 on the back of better performances from germany and italy other large eurozone economies could slow somewhat but should be supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies across the continent key risks include a disorderly brexit higher crude prices further trade war escalation and renewed political risk in italy the uk s outlook is obviously brexit dependent china s economy is slowing both structurally and cyclically pimco notes at a time the global economy is softening chinese policymakers have decided currency devaluation makes sense but the challenge for small businesses remains finance availability as banks continue to show caution the pboc will likely continue to provide accommodative monetary policy with the overarching aim of preventing froth in the property market pimco does not expect a quick permanent turnaround on the us china trade front once again the greatest risk is escalating tensions recession is not the base case but it wouldn t take much to tip over an economy that is moving at stall speed the analysts warn look elsewhere aberdeen standard investments holds a similar view to pimco seeing secular stagnation leading to low growth weak inflation and low interest rates not just in 2020 but for the next five years aberdeen s global growth forecast for 2020 21 has been downgraded to 3 1 well below the gfc average a recession could be avoided next year the analysts suggest but the risks have clearly increased the same key risks are rattled off trade brexit political uncertainty and aberdeen throws in the trade conflict underway between japan and korea which has not received much attention given us china has sucked out all the oxygen the late stage of the cycle and the lack of room for corporate margin expansion suggest equity returns will be below their long term average and a classic rotation from equites into bonds will no longer be appropriate given bond yields are so low and in many cases negative to that end aberdeen recommends investors look beyond the comfort of traditional asset classes with a cautious diversified approach for better risk return the analysts provide examples of structural themes worth pursuing over the next decade climate change

president donald trump listens to a question during a meeting with paraguay s president mario abdo benitez in the oval office of the white house friday dec 13 2019 in washington ap photo evan vucci washington the u s economy is heading into 2020 at a pace of steady sustained growth after a series of interest rate cuts and the apparent resolution of two trade related threats mostly eliminated the risk of a recession this marks a dramatic turnaround in momentum since august when some forecasters predicted a 50 percent chance of a downturn starting by the end of next year many economists credit the federal reserve s recent interest rate reductions and the slightly improved trade picture for propelling the stock market to fresh record highs and causing forecasters to bump up their predictions for how long the economy can keep growing and adding jobs without stumbling president donald trump secured democrats approval last week of a trade deal with mexico and canada that would keep most goods traded between the three nations tariff free he also reached a limited trade agreement with china that scrapped hefty tariffs in exchange for china agreeing to buy about 200 billion more in u s goods over the next two years the trade deals while not nearly as ambitious as trump promised have lessened one of the biggest drags on the u s economy uncertainty while some industries still face significant tariffs and final details remain in flux business leaders say at least they know what the situation is likely to be in 2020 offering more clarity than they have had since trump s trade war commenced nearly two years ago tariffs will be much more stable for quite a while larry kudlow trump s top economic adviser told the washington post some of the obstacles to growth including the fed and trade uncertainties are being removed and that will have a powerful positive impact on the economy u s trade representative robert lighthizer said sunday that some of the larger scale structural changes the white house wants china to make could take years to accomplish reinforcing the belief that the white house could scale back some of its adversarial tactics next year as trump nears his reelection bid the risk of a trade war induced recession which we never thought was high has been materially reduced said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics sunday in a note to clients kudlow predicts 3 economic growth next year a pace that trump promised voters but that has not been reached since 2005 and almost no forecasters outside the white house think is feasible while trump is almost certain to fall short of his vow the majority of economists now think the economy will grow about 2 percent next year a rate solid enough to ensure that unemployment stays near a half century low of 3 5 percent this could benefit trump on the campaign trail as no president since world war ii has lost reelection when unemployment was below 7 4 percent the major fears in august were that businesses would continue pulling back their spending trump would continue imposing tariffs and companies would soon turn around and ax jobs but that worst case scenario didn t materialize job gains exceeded expectations in october and november many economists say trump should be thanking the fed for coming to the rescue after he escalated the trade war this summer the fed reduced the benchmark u s interest rate three times this year in july september and october taking it from nearly 2 5 percent down to just under 1 75 percent trump has repeatedly bashed the fed calling the central bank s leadership boneheads but it was the central bank that stimulate the economy in recent months the reason things are looking more positive now is due to the fed said constance hunter chief economist at kpmg we are seeing a turnaround in housing because mortgage rates are low white house officials say the trade deals alone could push growth up half a percentage point next year up from about 2 3 percent this year u s consumers have been the powerhouse of the u s and global economies this year and that is likely to continue next year on top of that kudlow argues business investment is likely to make a comeback next year now that the fed has made it cheaper to borrow money and trump has hit the pause button on most additional tariffs business investment contracted from april through september despite assurances from white house officials that the 2017 tax cuts would lead to a surge in new investments that pullback helped create a drag on economic growth the economy next year is also expected to benefit from high levels of government spending as well as an uptick in chinese purchases of u s products the government is projected to spend 1 trillion more than it brings in through revenue next year an unusually large gap during a period of economic growth this adds to the debt and drives up borrowing costs something republicans have long opposed but they have been largely supportive since trump entered office despite the low interest rates and progress in trade talks a number of independent economists still believe the economy won t pick up much momentum many see the economy treading water next year with a modest uptick in business investment offset by weaker consumer spending they base this on recent clues such as sluggish retail sales for november typically a powerhouse month we are not headed toward a recession but the data do not indicate any form of sudden re acceleration going into 2020 said gregory daco chief u s economist at oxford economics import tariffs remain on nearly 370 billion worth of goods from china with the bulk of those aimed at parts used in manufacturing cars and other items this has created an ongoing drag that caused a contraction in u s manufacturing this year while the latest data on manufacturing indicate that the sector might have stabilized it s unclear whether things are improving trump did agree to cut tariffs on about 120 billion worth of chinese imports mostly shoes and clothes from 15 percent to 7 5 percent but daco ran the numbers and found that the impact was negligible on the economy weak growth abroad has also dampened business optimism in the united states this year as roughly 90 of the world economy experienced a slowdown next year should be slightly better according to the international monetary fund and other forecasters but paul christopher of wells fargo investment institute says this will be a slow and shallow global recovery that is much weaker than what occurred coming out of 2012 and 2015 china is re orienting its growth to domestic sources especially technology production christopher says it is not yet clear what will drive a global manufacturing recovery the one part of the economy that has shown noticeable pickup in recent months is housing a sector influenced far more by the fed s action than by trump s trade negotiators purchases and refinancings have picked up since the summer even though the share of homes for sale has remained low and affordability has been a major issue in many cities but even in housing the outlook for next year is uncertain mortgage rates are likely to stay in the same place for months to come after fed chairman jerome powell indicated last week that there is a high bar for the central bank to cut or raise interest rates in 2020 because it thinks the economy is in a good place and does not need extra stimulus none of the fed leaders penciled in a rate cut next year in their december forecasts home depot

no shortage of brains in gh so why enimil ashon features dec 13 2019 07 26 can somebody tell me why it has become so imperative for the bank of ghana to spend money to advertise the features of the two cedi coin i am not convinced that this is profitable use of the taxpayer s money such prodigality i could cry did anyone take note of the unmatched calibre of ghanaians serving on the fiscal council and financial stability council it is chaired by dr paul acquah former governor of the bank of ghana and please take note former deputy director of the africa department of the international monetary fund imf other members are professor eugenia amporfu dr nii noi ashong professor augustine fosu dr nii kwaku sowa professor robert osei and ali nakyea heavyweights of international renown their duty among others is to strengthen and reinforce the stability of the financial sector to them add alhaji bawumia himself osafo marfo anthony akoto osei the economist i admire and kojo kwarteng that s an unbeatable economic think tank not small as we say in ghana yet the last time i checked it takes gh 5 60 to buy one dollar i won t bore you with the percentage increase it was gh 5 85 to the dollar in march 2019 ghana is the only country in sub saharan africa to establish a fiscal council we are also the second country in sub saharan africa after mauritius to establish a financial stability council the raison d etre to help tie the hands of politicians in ensuring prudent macroeconomic management especially during election years of course the exchange rate crisis was no better under the preceding political regime where president mahama took the cedi from 1 00 gh 1 85 in may 2012 to 3 79 in may 2016 so alarming was the rate at which the cedi was tumbling that on july 16 2015 yours truly wrote on this very page in this very daily graphic about dr wampah bank of ghana governor at the time as follows injecting 20 million a day of borrowed money into an economy is pure wampahnomics though i am relieved by the sudden surge of power in the cedi i cannot jump because the relief is temporary in english language it is called cold comfort check the figures a few months after the dollar injection i was proved right though my econs is only a level fast forward to august 2018 myjoyonline quoted a bank of ghana source as saying that the central bank has pumped 283 4 million into the banks to meet daily demands for foreign exchange as global pressures cause the cedi to depreciate in march 2019 the daily graphic reported that the bank of ghana says it will add a minimum of 800 million to the country s reserves this month to stabilise the cedi against the major international currencies especially the dollar why does nothing seem to be working this week an economic expert interviewed on radio blamed the cedi depreciation on excessive imports as if we didn t know that before but he quickly admitted that no country could do without imports that even america china russia etc import makes sense but what does ghana import for which it critically needs a stepping up of dollar supply into the economy one we import religion according to a disclosure on peace fm a few months ago confirmed by my own checks ghanaian branches of foreign based churches call at our forex bureaux every repeat every monday with sacks of cedis to buy dollars to be sent to headquarters mostly in nigeria i think this is un christian it is the work of greedy tycoons in cassock and collar what gospel do they preach as a country with reputable economists however you don t solve this problem by appealing to the consciences of these men of god they have none was it chaucer the english writer who said as far back as 1746 that their conscience is their stomach too many of us are greedy unfortunately we don t have governments with the ability to check the spread of greed would it be asking too much to expect that we generate a list of imports which we consider critical outside of this list forex bureaux should be barred from selling the dollar euro pound sterling to meet any import demand only this week a group of ghanaian importers organised a press conference their cry is that the government should increase the allocation of foreign currencies to them from 50 000 to 200 000 how much will be left for repatriation of profits by investors and for manufacturers who need essential raw materials that must be imported if it takes rocket science to solve this challenge i beg to remind us that ghana has no shortage of rocket scientists call dr aveh kludze send a whatsapp messsage to dr ashitey trebi ollenu or dr thomas mensah have we asked ourselves how the billionaires in ghana come by the money to stock the ever multiplying number of shopping malls in this country since 98 per cent of goods sold in these shops are imported since items sold in there are bought with cedis and since it takes dollars euros and pounds sterling to re stock these malls is it rocket science to conclude where they obtain their foreign currencies from certainly and i pray it can t be bank of ghana

re expecting another tick up in the manufacturing numbers however our economists see the risk of a weaker services reading which may partly offset the positive market impact the ifo institute

hawkish stance also suggests a limited upside sterling potential stemming from the boe uk december pmis due on monday won t reflect the uk election result so won t really reflect the post election sentiment we estimate that the market friendly uk election outcome was worth around 4 in gbp gains meaning that any further sterling upside should be modest ie gbp usd not breaching the 1 35 36 area particularly when the bulk of the good news is behind us and gbp still trades with a modest premium even though its short term fair value increased modestly as the market repriced the boe outlook to less dovish aud back to the unemployment dilemma aud has been rallying for most of the last week as the us china trade deal paired with good momentum for industrial metals revamped some appetite for the currency the positive trade story may continue to support aud usd that can reasonably close the year at 0 70 or higher data wise all eyes will be on unemployment data recent dynamics have accustomed us to the make or break potential of australia jobs reports and this time won t be any different markets have been increasingly torn around the idea of more rba easing early next year as data gdp growth failed to flag an effective pass through of the rba stimulus a 0 1 deviation in unemployment will be enough to give an exact direction to rate expectations even though the 4 5 target indicated by the central bank is still out of reach the rba december minutes out on tuesday may not be of particular interest as the policy meeting took place before the release of the weaker growth data nzd growth to support the kiwi momentum after failing to break below 1 04 aud nzd has corrected higher on the back of a supported aud and smaller than expected infrastructure investment announced by kiwi policymakers the new zealand dollar net speculative positioning corrected higher but remains deep into short territory which still warrants upside potential this week s calendar will be focused on 3q gdp numbers market expectations are for a tick up in growth from 2 1 yoy in 2q and our economics team see room for a positive surprise we expect the data flow to keep endorsing markets perception that the rbnz will keep from easing monetary policy further in the coming months in this view and considering potential downside risk from australian labour data we continue to see room for further depreciation in aud nzd it s worth keeping an eye on trade data to see whether the resilience in new zealand exports have continued in november similar to aud nzd usd should keep benefitting from the sino american trade deal story next week cad inflation to stay at target usd cad has moved back below 1 3200 thanks to a supportive risk environment that helped the loonie recover after last week s big slump in employment we see little impediments to cad cashing in on the risk on mood and some support may also come from the ratification of the usmca by the us congress on wednesday markets will closely watch november cpi data latest payrolls raised concerns about the labour picture but the resilient wage growth 4 4 yoy in november is likely to keep inflation around the bank of canada 2 target while we expect the inflation picture to remain supportive for rates we do see the boc delivering a one off cut in 1q20 as the external factors keep posing risks to the outlook more details in our recent update on the boc and cad canada one more rate cut early next year chf still downside risk but less than jpy the snb left its monetary stance unchanged this week but as noted by our economics team sounded more dovish as the staff forecasts for conditional inflation were revised downwards however with no expected tilt to the bank s ultra accommodative policy on the horizon the impact on chf has remained muted the market friendly outcome of uk general election has pushed eur chf close to the 1 10 level but the pair may have further upside room next week as global risk sentiment should remain supported however the franc is less exposed than the yen to trade story and can retain some attractiveness as doubts about the eurozone outlook linger nok no surprise from nb krone prospects remain attractive the norges bank meeting thu should not bring many surprises the central bank should remain on hold and the interest rate path should remain largely unchanged as negatives such as lower than forecasted q3 gdp are offset by weaker than forecasted nok within the bank s model with a modest hawkish bias the nb forecast retaining the possibility of a hike in 2020 with the risk appetite stabilizing market friendly uk election outcome improvement on the us china trade front we see nok as the most attractive european g10 currency solid carry seasonal nok strength in january and cheap valuation all suggest the krone s outperformance next year sek priced in riksbank hike won t have a positive impact on sek we expect the riksbank to deliver the well signalled 25bp rate hike on thursday achieving its aim to bring the interest rate out of the negative territory yet given the soft growth and inflation outlook the hike is likely to be of one and done nature and the signalled rate path for 2020 should be flat ie no hike this means that sek is unlikely to benefit from the hike as a such an outcome is widely expected b it is not the start of a tightening cycle we continue to see sek as lagging nok next year and the currency reaction to the uk election outcome provided the case in point sek was flat vs eur while nok strengthened by 0 5
what s new clashes in october 2019 in oromia ethiopia s most populous region left scores of people dead they mark the latest explosion of ethnic strife that has killed hundreds and displaced millions across the country over the past year and half why did it happen prime minister abiy ahmed has taken important steps to move the country toward more open politics but his efforts to dismantle the old order have weakened the ethiopian state and given new energy to ethno nationalism hostility among the leaders of ethiopia s most powerful regions has soared why does it matter such tensions could derail ethiopia s transition meanwhile reforms abiy is making to the country s powerful but factious ruling coalition anger opponents who believe that they aim to undo ethiopia s ethnic federalist system and could push the political temperature still higher elections in may 2020 could be divisive and violent what should be done abiy should step up efforts to mend divisions within and among ethiopia s regions and push all parties to avoid stoking tensions around the elections international partners should press ethiopian leaders to curb incendiary rhetoric and offer increased aid to protect the country from economic shocks that could aggravate political problems executive summary ethiopia s transition has stirred hope at home and abroad but also unleashed dangerous and divisive forces as prime minister abiy ahmed s government has opened up the country s politics it has struggled to curb ethnic strife mass protests in late october in oromia ethiopia s most populous region spiralled into bloodshed clashes over the past eighteen months have killed hundreds displaced millions and fuelled tensions among leaders of ethiopia s most potent regions abiy s remake of the ruling coalition which has monopolised power for almost three decades risks further deepening the divides ahead of the elections scheduled for may 2020 the premier and his allies should move cautiously with those reforms step up efforts to cool tensions among oromo factions and between amhara and tigray regional leaders who are embroiled in an especially acrimonious dispute and if conditions deteriorate further consider delaying next year s vote external actors should call on all ethiopian leaders to temper incendiary rhetoric and offer increased financial aid for a multi year transition first the good news since becoming premier in early 2018 after more than three years of deadly anti government protests prime minister abiy has taken a series of steps worthy of acclaim he has embarked on an historic rapprochement with eritrea he has extended his predecessor hailemariam desalegn s policies of releasing political prisoners and inviting home exiled dissidents and insurgents he has appointed former activists to strengthen institutions like the electoral board and accelerated the reform of an indebted state led economy his actions have won him both domestic and foreign praise culminating in the 2019 nobel peace prize but abiy s moves to dismantle the old order have weakened the ethiopian state they have given new energy to the ethno nationalism that was already resurgent during the mass unrest that brought him to power elections scheduled for may 2020 could turn violent as candidates compete for votes from within their ethnic groups four fault lines are especially perilous the first cuts across oromia abiy s home state where his rivals and even some former allies believe the premier should do more to advance the region s interests the second pits oromo leaders against those of amhara ethiopia s second most populous state they are at loggerheads over oromia s bid for greater influence including over the capital addis ababa which is multi ethnic but surrounded by oromia the third relates to a bitter dispute between amhara politicians and the formerly dominant tigray minority that centres on two territories that the amhara claim tigray annexed in the early 1990s the fourth involves tigray leaders and abiy s government with the former resenting the prime minister for what they perceive as his dismantling of a political system they constructed and then dominated and what they see as his lopsided targeting of tigrayan leaders for past abuses an uptick of attacks on churches and mosques across parts of the country suggests that rising interfaith tensions could add another layer of complexity adding to tensions is an increasingly salient debate between supporters and opponents of the country s ethnic federalist system arguably ethiopia s main political battleground the system which was introduced in 1991 after the tigray led revolutionary government seized power devolves authority to ethno linguistically defined regions while divvying up central power among those regions ruling parties while support and opposition to the system is partly defined by who stands to win or lose from its dismantling both sides marshal strong arguments proponents point to the bloody pre 1991 history of coercive central rule and argue that the system protects group rights in a diverse country formed through conquest and assimilation detractors a significant cross ethnic constituency argue that because the system structures the state along ethnic lines it undercuts national unity fuels ethnic conflict and leaves minorities in regions dominated by major ethnic groups vulnerable it is past time they say to turn the page on the ethnic politics that for too long have defined and divided the nation prime minister abiy s recent changes to the ethiopian people s revolutionary democratic front eprdf the coalition that has ruled for some three decades play into this debate until late november the eprdf comprised ruling parties from oromia amhara and tigray regions as well as a fourth the southern nations nationalities and peoples region already it was fraying its dysfunction both reflecting and fuelling ethnic animosity abiy s plan entails dissolving the four blocs and merging them plus five parties that rule ethiopia s other regions into a new party the prosperity party the premier aims to shore up national unity strengthen his leadership and shift ethiopia away from what many citizens see as a discredited system his approach enjoys much support including from ethiopians who see it as a move away from ethnic politics but it also risks further stressing a fragile state whose bureaucracy is entwined with the eprdf from top to bottom tigray s ruling party and abiy s oromo rivals oppose the move seeing it as a step toward ending ethnic federalism tigray leaders refuse to join the new party the prime minister has made laudable efforts to tread a middle ground and unite the country but faces acute dilemmas the prime minister has made laudable efforts to tread a middle ground and unite the country but faces acute dilemmas placating nationalists among his own oromo for example would alienate other ethnic groups allowing tigray to retain a say in national decision making well above the region s population share would frustrate other groups that resent its long rule at their expense moreover while thus far abiy has tried to keep on board both proponents and critics of ethnic federalism his eprdf merger and other centralising reforms move him more squarely into the camp of those opposing that system meaning that he now needs to manage the fallout from those who fear its dismantling and the dilution of regions autonomy at the same time he cannot leave behind the strong constituency that wants to move away from ethnic politics and thus far has tended to give abiy the benefit of the doubt but the prime minister his government and international partners can take some steps to lower the temperature abiy should press tigray and amhara leaders to intensify talks aimed at mending their relations he should continue discussions with dissenting oromo ruling party colleagues and the oromo opposition aiming to ensure that they litigate differences at the ballot box rather than through violence he should continue to facilitate talks between oromo and amhara leaders and thus ease tensions that are increasingly shaded by ethnicity and religion and feed a sense of ferment in mixed urban areas across the country including in the capital the government might also make conciliatory gestures toward the tigray maybe even rethinking its prosecutions of tigrayan former officials in favour of a broader transitional justice process for their part tigray leaders should reconsider their rejection of the administrative boundaries and identity issues commission which was set up to resolve boundary disputes like that pitting tigray against amhara abiy and his allies should move carefully with the eprdf reform and seek to mitigate as best as they can fears that it heralds the end of ethnic federalism they should make clear that any formal review of ethiopia s constitution that takes place down the road will involve not only the ruling party but also opposition factions and activists an inclusive process along these lines would also serve the interests of ethnic federalism s opponents particularly among civil society who would have a seat at the table the prime minister is set on may 2020 elections fearing that delay would trigger questions about his government s legitimacy if the vote goes ahead as scheduled he should convene a series of meetings involving key ruling and opposition parties along with influential civil society representatives well beforehand to discuss how to deter bloodshed before and after a ballot that he has promised will represent a break from the flawed elections of the past but if risks of a divisive and violent election campaign increase his government may have to seek support among all major parties for a postponement and some form of national dialogue aiming to resolve disputes over past abuses power sharing regional autonomy and territorial claims ethiopia s international partners should adopt a stance more in tune with worrying trends on the ground they should express public support for the transition but lobby behind closed doors for a careful approach to remaking the eprdf and for all ethiopian leaders to temper provocative language as much as possible they could also suggest an election delay if the political and security crises do not cool in the months ahead a multi year package of financial aid could help strengthen weak institutions support an economy also undergoing structural reform and reduce discontent among a restive and youthful population during a period of change ethiopia s transition may not yet hang from a precipice indeed it is still a source of hope for many in ethiopia and abroad ethiopia s transition may not yet hang from a precipice indeed it is still a source of hope for many in ethiopia and abroad but signs are troubling enough to worry top and former officials among the most alarmist suggestions made by some observers is that the multinational federation could break apart as yugoslavia did in the 1990s this worry may be overstated but abiy nonetheless should err on the side of caution as he walks a tightrope of pushing through reforms while keeping powerful constituencies on board he should redouble efforts to bring along all of ethiopia s peoples facilitate further negotiations among sparring regional elites take steps to ensure that the ruling party merger does not further destabilise the country and for now defer formal negotiations over ethiopia s constitution and the future of ethnic federalism nairobi addis ababa brussels 16 december 2019 i introduction between 23 and 26 october mass protests and ethnic strife left at least 86 people dead in oromia prime minister abiy s home state and ethiopia s largest and most populous in which some 37 million people reside the latest unrest coming only four months after rogue security forces assassinated the ethiopian military s chief of staff and the president of amhara state cast in even sharper relief the precariousness of the country s mooted transition to a more open and democratic order in a widening arc of flashpoints across ethiopia attackers often propelled by ethno nationalist forces have killed hundreds over the past year and triggered the displacement of 3 5 million the wave of insecurity has set many ethiopians on edge since coming to power in april 2018 prime minister abiy ahmed s changes have come at dizzying pace but they have also lifted the lid that ethiopia s previously strong and often abusive state security machine kept on social tensions warning signs are starting to flash red this report examines the most dangerous fault lines and explores options for dialling down tensions it builds upon crisis group s previous work on ethiopia s transition one of the most closely watched on the continent it is based on interviews with ethiopian officials activists intellectuals and researchers as well as african and western diplomats research took place during july november and december 2019 in the capital addis ababa and amhara tigray and the southern nations states ii trouble in oromia the most recent bout of turmoil began on october 23 after jawar mohammed a prominent oromo activist and media owner accused the government on facebook of stripping him of his security detail in an attempt to facilitate his assassination after the facebook post hundreds of protesters gathered outside jawar s home in the capital to defend him and thousands took to the streets across oromia demonstrations in the region in 2015 2018 had taken place mostly in rural areas this time protests shook some of oromia s multi ethnic towns and cities they led to death and destruction as other groups rallied in response and confrontations triggered violence security forces shot ten protesters dead while losing five from their own ranks oromo youth groups or qeerroo played a major role in the bloodshed in some cases instigating attacks against other groups as well as fellow oromos deemed to display insufficient ethnic solidarity and in other instances retaliating after provocations the late october violence reflects an evolution of the grievances that brought hundreds of thousands of oromo into the streets in anti government protests that began in earnest in 2015 jawar is an influential but divisive figure who over the course of 2019 has become a vocal abiy critic for years he ran the prominent oromia media network from abroad and was among the dissidents whom the government welcomed home in 2018 he has a large oromo following reflecting his advocacy for greater influence for the community many amhara and other non oromo however hold him responsible for inciting qeerroo to attack minorities and destroy their property jawar has long lobbied for greater oromo heft in the federal government and played a vital role in coordinating the protests that helped bring abiy to power but his relations with the new prime minister always uneasy have taken a turn for the worse as he has reproached abiy for centralising power and for not doing enough for the oromo since taking office the day before the facebook post on 22 october abiy appeared to condemn jawar in parliament when he cited irresponsible actions by foreign media owners the late october violence reflects an evolution of the grievances that brought hundreds of thousands of oromo into the streets in anti government protests that began in earnest in 2015 then demonstrators were angered by the government s abuses corruption and failure to tackle rising living costs youth unemployment and other day to day concerns protests had ethnic undertones giving voice to the oromo s longstanding opposition to the tigray ruling party s pre eminence in the eprdf and federal security apparatus activists drew from a narrative asserting that the oromo were historically downtrodden left without an equitable share of federal power and represented by an oromo ruling party formerly the oromo people s democratic organisation opdo and then until its recent dissolution the oromo democratic party odp that was subservient to the tigray party the tigray people s liberation front tplf some concerns were more specific oromo activists opposed government plans to develop areas on the outskirts of addis ababa which the oromia region encircles as portending further displacement of oromo farmers to the benefit of investors although opdo leaders faced the ire of oromo protesters many party officials also backed the demonstrations hoping to increase their power within the eprdf they objected in particular to the tigray ruling party s equal vote in the ruling coalition s decision making bodies despite the region s smaller population and to the tigrayan grip on the security sector including national intelligence agencies and the armed forces despite euphoria among the oromo at abiy s appointment strife has continued in oromia despite euphoria among the oromo at abiy s appointment strife has continued in oromia much has been linked to the august 2018 return of rebel oromo liberation front olf leaders to ethiopia the week of their arrival saw qeerroo youth groups run riot through parts of the capital including its outskirts in oromia in some cases attacking people of other ethnicities while the olf s return appears to have been conditioned on its participation in democratic politics odp officials accuse it of continuing to foment armed rebellion since coming back to ethiopia the rebel movement already fragmented has split again dawud ibsa who led the group in its eritrean exile is seeking deals with abiy s party and other oromo groups others including some field commanders are holding out still skirmishing with the military in western oromia interfaith tensions add another layer of complexity during the recent unrest orthodox christian leaders reported mobs targeting their congregants and churches while demonstrators also attacked a mosque in adama city in central oromia the violence follows similar attacks on places of worship over the past eighteen months these attacks led some to suspect that religious differences underlay much of the unrest some oromo nationalists portray the orthodox christian church as part of the predominantly amhara power structure under the old imperial regime which they accuse of suppressing their identities and culture for centuries indeed the targeting of orthodox churches as a symbol of the old establishment is a problem not limited to oromia protesters attacked churches in the somali region in august 2018 and in southern nations in july 2019 in turn jawar s opponents brand him as an islamist jawar supported an overwhelmingly peaceful civil resistance movement in 2011 2012 that rejected the government s interference in muslim affairs but no evidence supports the accusation that he is pursuing an islamist agenda responding to the october fighting abiy explicitly recognised its religious dimension but in a positive way praising muslims who protect churches from burning down and christians who stand guard to prevent mosques from burning down at bottom oromo activists like jawar and opposition groups including the olf have political and not religious goals they want a share of federal power that matches oromia s demographic weight and protects their regional autonomy they welcome the de facto influence abiy s premiership delivers for the oromo but distrust his political agenda some also want afaan oromo the oromo mother tongue to become a working language of the federal government at present all central government business is conducted in amharic and for the oromia region to administer addis ababa several leaders in the oromo ruling party including lemma megersa the influential defence minister and a former close ally of abiy may even back the activists more assertive agenda opposition among the oromo puts abiy in a bind opposition among the oromo puts abiy in a bind on one hand many non oromo accuse abiy of favouring his own ethnic constituency pointing to his alleged leniency in dealing with oromo abuses jawar s provocations and the olf s insurgency forming an alliance with or adopting policies to mollify oromo opponents could pit abiy against other groups in ethiopia s bitterly contested political landscape on the other hand many oromo appear ready to take to the streets to protest what they see as abiy s failure to advance their interests with demonstrations frequently descending into violence moreover the former rebel movement the olf though fractured is still popular an alliance among olf factions jawar and other oromo opposition leaders which is already taking shape could present abiy s odp with serious electoral competition in oromia particularly if it can pull away top odp politicians like lemma the outbreak of communal strife following the 22 october incident at jawar s residence demonstrates just how volatile oromia s politics are iii widening ethno regional fissures the oromia bloodshed follows other incidents of violence across the country over the past eighteen months the four regions that have been run by the eprdf s member parties amhara tigray and southern nations as well as oromia face the gravest challenges showing how the ruling coalition s travails lie at the core of ethiopia s instability as intra eprdf competition increases ethno nationalist forces within the four parties are ascendant in some cases propelled by hardline opposition and protest movements those forces have driven ethnic animosity particularly among the oromo amhara and tigray as well as violence that since the beginning of 2018 has led a huge number of ethiopians some 3 5 million more than in any other country in the world in 2018 to flee their homes trends in amhara are as troubling as those in oromia trends in amhara are as troubling as those in oromia the state is the country s second largest with a population of around 29 million and was another locus of mass unrest in the years leading up to abiy s rise to power some leaders within the amhara democratic party adp at the time the amhara national democratic movement backed the protests like their oromo counterparts seeing them as an opportunity to loosen the tplf s grip indeed abiy owes his premiership in part to a tactical alliance between oromo and amhara leaders who took advantage of the growing realisation within the coalition that only genuine change could placate protesters outmanoeuvred the tplf and appointed abiy as eprdf leader at the coalition s march 2018 council meeting as in oromia protests in amhara whipped up ethno nationalist sentiment now entrenched in the region s political discourse the result is an increasingly salient narrative that presents ethnic federalism as a tplf dominated project aimed at subjugating the region true many ethnic federalism critics including a large number of amhara but also many others promote a pan ethiopian vision and portray ethnic federalism as eroding national unity they argue that it renders as second class citizens minorities in states delineated for dominant ethno linguistic groups not least because they face barriers in pursuing government services and public office they contend that by placing ethnicity at the heart of politics the system feeds ethnic conflict and may even sow the seeds of the state s collapse but much amhara opposition to the system also has an ethno nationalist and anti tplf flavour the transition has spawned a new party focused on asserting amhara rights the national movement of amhara nama which presents itself as a defender of amhara including those living outside the amhara region pressure from that movement partly explains the adp s ill fated november 2018 appointment of asaminew tsige as regional security chief asaminew a strong opponent of the tplf was jailed in 2009 for his role in a coup attempt and then pardoned by the federal government in february 2018 as part of an amnesty by then prime minister hailemariam desalegn by appointing him the adp hoped to boost its popularity to the detriment of its ascendant ethno nationalist amhara opposition the move proved disastrous on 22 june asaminew reportedly directed the assassinations of amhara leaders in the regional capital bahir dar and ethiopia s military chief of staff the tigrayan general seare mekonnen in addis ababa before himself being killed by security forces the recent bloodletting in oromia and amhara oromo fighting at several universities have sharpened tensions during his short tenure asaminew stoked amhara nationalism he worsened the bad blood between amhara and oromo by warning of impending oromo domination already the amhara oromo alliance that brought abiy to power was strained with amhara and others angered by an odp statement that the federal capital should be under oromia s control they perceive the destruction in early 2019 by oromia s government of allegedly illegal settlements including many non oromo homes on the capital s outskirts as an assertion of oromo power in july the tens of thousands attending asaminew s funeral showed the continued draw of amhara nationalism and thus the amhara leadership s narrow space for compromise the recent bloodletting in oromia and amhara oromo fighting at several universities have sharpened tensions attacks on orthodox churches heighten concerns flagged especially by the national movement for amhara about the safety of amhara living in oromia mounting religious tensions risk edging a political dispute over amhara oromo federal power sharing into a sectarian contest tigray is another hotspot the region s ruling party the tplf controls a northern region representing only around 6 per cent of the country s population but that for years dominated the eprdf and federal security apparatus and still enjoys outsized influence in the armed forces on arriving in office abiy replaced many tplf ministers and security heads partly in response to widespread sentiment that the tplf was to blame for years of repression and graft the attorney general a senior member of abiy s party issued an arrest warrant against former national intelligence chief getachew assefa a tplf politburo member who is now in hiding articulating a widely held view a senior federal official says the government has found evidence of the tplf fuelling conflict across ethiopia over the last eighteen months in order to destabilise the state tplf officials reject this allegation and resent what they sense is an attempt to sideline the tigray they say abiy s government applies selective justice most prominently by failing to prosecute the many high ranking non tigray officials who served in past administrations and also stand accused of abuses in their minds figures like asaminew who had been released as part of a wide ranging amnesty were far more deserving of prosecution than tplf leaders tplf leaders are also angry at the displacement of around 100 000 tigrayans mostly from amhara and oromia regions during and after the 2015 2018 anti government protests the tplf s waning fortunes have not only fuelled tigray anger at abiy s government but also energised long held amhara claims over two territories welkait and raya in tigray region amhara leaders believe that the tplf annexed those territories in the early 1990s and then encouraged tigrayans to move in altering their demographic makeup tigrayans argue that the two territories administration status should be decided on the basis of self determination but that only current residents not those who have left over the past nearly three decades should have a say the tplf rejects the mandate of the federal administrative boundaries and identity issues commission which abiy set up in december 2018 to look into the amhara claims and other territorial disputes tigray leaders argue that the body is unconstitutional as its mandate overlaps with that of parliament s upper chamber though probably their fear is primarily that it will rule in amhara s favour the amhara tigray tensions could be the country s most dangerous the amhara tigray tensions could be the country s most dangerous as they have the potential to draw two powerful regions into a conflict that could carry risks of fracturing the military warning signs continued to flash between amhara and tigray in october and november 2019 another fatal attack on tigrayan militia by rebels from amhara reportedly took place at the regional border in the disputed area of welkait renewed violence between amhara security forces and militia comprising qemant people left tens dead the qemant are a minority in amhara pursuing greater autonomy but their amhara opponents say they are tplf backed a claim a military officer involved in pacifying the area said there was no evidence to support for their part some tplf officials claim that they have organised a standing tigray militia to defend a security fortress in the northern province alongside the worrying signs there is one positive development amhara and tigray s leaders encouraged by abiy have recently been in contact senior tigray officials express a desire to ratchet down tensions we have to have a fraternal discussion one told crisis group those talks could set out a path toward resolving the territorial dispute a last hotspot lies at the country s opposite end in the diverse southern nations region hitherto ruled by the fourth eprdf party the fragmenting southern ethiopian people s democratic movement sepdm there ethnic groups have seized on the political opening to call for enhanced autonomy the largest the sidama pressed their constitutional right to hold a referendum on establishing their own regional state in july as authorities missed the deadline for the vote sidama protesters clashed with police and later attacked minorities the government deployed troops to contain the fighting partly by using lethal force when voting took place on 20 november it passed off peacefully and resoundingly favoured statehood but if authorities fail to manage high sidama expectations about the pace of creating the new region and bring economic benefits there could be more unrest the government also faces an uphill battle to dissuade other southern nations groups from pressing statehood claims should the regional state architecture fracture they could struggle violently for power and resources iv abiy s merger plan and ethnic federalism prime minister abiy s moves to expand and unify the ruling eprdf coalition motivated partly by his desire to bolster national unity instead risk fuelling the centrifugal forces pulling at the country s ethnic fabric on 16 november and 21 november the coalition s executive committee and then its council approved merging the four ruling coalition parties plus the five parties that control the afar benishangul gumuz gambella harari and somali regions and that are allied to but are not part of that coalition into a single unified party the prosperity party the reforms which several parties general assemblies also endorsed aim to overhaul a system that abiy and many other ethiopians see as the root of many of the country s challenges the new prosperity party would centralise decision making rebalancing authority between its executive organs and its regional branches the new prosperity party would centralise decision making rebalancing authority between its executive organs and its regional branches the upshot would be that organs at the central level would exercise greater power than is currently the case within the eprdf in which regional parties until now have been powerful independent entities according to the party s draft bylaws a key change would be that a national congress would directly elect representatives to the new party s central committee direct election would mark a departure from the eprdf system in which its 180 member council its key decision making body comprises 45 delegates from each of the regional party s central committees moreover the party s national leadership would nominate the heads of its regional branches the merger also arguably represents a step away from formal ethnic power sharing under the current system the mostly mono ethnic parties at the eprdf alliance s core run regional states in which those ethnicities predominate the principal ethno linguistic groups in each region thus enjoy substantial autonomy over local decision making including choosing the administration s working language and security management the proposed reforms open the new party s regional branches to individuals from all ethnicities and mean that its central committee will not be formally composed of ethno regional blocs opponents perceive this change as inching away from ethnic federalism opponents perceive this change as inching away from ethnic federalism toward a system based on territory but not identity the new party s draft bylaws suggest that representation in its national congress will be based on the population size and number of party members in each region indicating a move to majoritarian politics an inevitable consequence of which would be to favour the amhara and oromo critics also claim that after the election abiy wants to amend the constitution to become a directly elected president a senior federal official however said the parliamentary system is likely to remain even if there is a constitutional review process which he does anticipate after the election much of the eprdf leadership formally supports the merger much of the eprdf leadership formally supports the merger amhara democratic party leaders welcome it they believe that abiy s new party marks a step away from ethnic federalism and will further strip the tplf of influence in federal institutions for now the adp s ethno nationalist rivals in amhara also favour moving away from ethnic federalism which they also perceive as a system designed to impose tigrayan dominance at their expense odp leaders formally support abiy s plan though there are signs of discontent within the party s ranks muferiat kamil leader of the southern nations ruling party the sepdm who is also minister of peace backs the plan mustafa omer acting somali region president and an abiy ally also supports it in the past he has spoken of his worries about balkanisation describing ethiopia s decision to grant regional states control of autonomous security forces as a historic mistake the merger enjoys additional support from influential figures in society who are weary of the ethnic based political system according to mesenbet assefa an assistant professor of law at addis ababa university for example the prosperity party will help tame the hyper ethnicised political discourse it is true that ethnic federalism has allowed a degree of self governance and use of one s own language and culture but it has also fomented hostility that has reached unimaginable proportions in the country the new prosperity party will help balance pan ethiopian and ethnic sentiment in fact millions of ethiopians especially urbanites who have mixed ethnic heritage and progressive politics feel that they are not adequately represented in the ethnic federal arrangement the plan also generates hostility however mostly from those who support ethnic federalism and view the merger as a first step toward dismantling it tplf leaders reject it outright believing that it signals the end of the multinational order some argue that ethnic federalism protects ethiopia from its own history of coercive centralism and cultural homogenisation undoing it they say would set the stage for a return to rule by an abusive centre or even worse the most probable outcome is disintegration but i am not saying we will let that happen said a top tplf official tplf leaders opposed the merger at the executive committee 16 november meeting and boycotted the 21 november council meeting saying they needed more time to discuss the plans with members and raising procedural objections the sepdm upper echelons are reportedly divided on the issue despite muferiat s support an sepdm eprdf council member told crisis group that some approved the merger on the basis of the new party s commitment to multinational federation but that they would leave if that was not honoured even within abiy s own odp many regard the merger warily they like oromo opposition leaders oppose the outsized influence the tplf has previously enjoyed but value ethno regional autonomy and so are aligned with tigrayan leaders on federalism on 29 november defence minister lemma megersa broke ranks with abiy declaring his opposition to the merger he contended that the timing was not right for the merger saying oromia s ruling party had not yet delivered on its promises to the oromo lemma s open dissent is significant given his prominent role in events leading to abiy s assumption of the premiership as ex president of oromia he was a key figure in a group of eprdf reformers known as team lemma that tacitly threw their weight behind the protest movement hastening the previous administration s exit lemma was a leading candidate for the premiership until february 2018 when abiy replaced him as oromo party leader as lemma did not hold a federal parliamentary seat a prerequisite to become prime minister oromo activists also dislike the plan according to jawar sooner or later the merger will start to erode the federal system the groups won t be able to collectively bargain it s too early to dismantle ethnic based national organisations that said for now abiy s dissenting colleagues and oromo rivals appear set on waiting to see what emerges from the prosperity party they will take on the new party at the ballot box if they believe that it will erode oromia s autonomy or otherwise thwart oromo interests jawar himself pledges to run for either the oromo or the national legislature though he would have to relinquish his u s citizenship to do so indeed forthcoming elections could pit supporters of ethnic federalism including abiy s oromo rivals and the tplf against its opponents led by abiy s new party so far abiy s efforts to win over the prosperity party s detractors have largely fallen flat so far abiy s efforts to win over the prosperity party s detractors have largely fallen flat the prime minister has asserted that the merger will not affect ethnic federalism and his supporters deny that it aims to whittle down regions influence but to many opponents the plan to strengthen the central party at the expense of its regional blocs suggests the opposite because the eprdf and the federal structure came into being together in the early 1990s the two are intertwined and widely associated with one another moreover abiy s advisers and appointees include critics of ethnic federalism opponents also perceive abiy s doctrine of medemer or synergy about which he has recently published a book and which will inform the new party s program as signalling his intention to undo the system at its core medemer stresses national unity with diverse entities cooperating for the common good a 22 november statement after the eprdf council meeting said the new party would harmonise group and individual rights ethnic identity and ethiopian unity v calming the tensions the intra oromo tensions plus those between the oromo and amhara the amhara and tigray and the tplf and abiy s government threaten to derail ethiopia s transition direct armed confrontation sucking in regional elites and federal politicians and potentially splitting the military high command appears unlikely at least for now indeed the army is performing a crucial role managing flashpoints and it has remained a beacon of multi ethnic cohesion despite the 22 june assassination of its chief of staff but the consequences of such confrontation were it to happen would be catastrophic raising the spectre of all out civil war and the fracturing of eastern africa s pivotal state abiy s overarching problem in calming those tensions is that acceding to one group s demands risks eliciting violent reactions from another abiy s overarching problem in calming those tensions is that acceding to one group s demands risks eliciting violent reactions from another many ethiopians demand action against jawar for his role in the late october bloodshed but moves by the authorities against him are likely to stir up more turbulence in oromia and further weaken abiy s base if the government meets oromo demands awarding them greater administrative power over addis ababa for example it would trigger resistance from other groups especially amhara any federal attempt to assuage the tplf s concerns at its marginalisation could provoke opposition from the many ethiopians who blame it for an authoritarian system s past excesses backing amhara s territorial claims could lead to confrontation with tigray s well drilled security forces the dilemma for the prime minister related to ethnic federalism is equally pronounced until now he has largely trodden a middle path between proponents and detractors but his ruling party reform moves him more concretely into the latter camp raising the prospect of fiercer resistance by those who see preserving the system as in their interests at the same time mollifying that group risks leaving behind a pan ethiopian constituency that is influential in urban areas yet holds little formal power and which would like to turn the page on ethnic politics and has largely supported the prime minister until now the prime minister and his domestic and international allies can however take steps to cool things down the prime minister and his domestic and international allies can however take steps to cool things down abiy s camp should clearly signal that any possible future formal review of ethiopia s constitution would be inclusive of opposition parties and civil society while some interlocutors describe abiy as aloof and averse to advice the premier has started to facilitate cross party and inter ethnic crisis discussions he should continue to foster these abiy and his allies should press for intensified negotiations among oromo factions and between amhara and tigray s leaders ahead of the may 2020 elections abiy could convene a meeting with all major parties activists and civil society to help minimise violence and division around what is shaping up to be a high stakes vote but if conditions deteriorate further he could consider a delay to that vote and some form of national dialogue as for ethiopia s international partners they should pressure all elites including opposition figures to curb incendiary rhetoric they should also bolster ethiopia s economy against shocks that could aggravate political problems and if abiy s government requests it provide a multi year financial package to create space for his reforms a reducing conflict risks from the party merger plan while prime minister abiy is within his rights to spearhead the refashioning of the ruling coalition he would be better advised to calm fears that the move concentrates power in addis ababa and is the beginning of the end of ethnic federalism an issue that tigrayan politicians in particular view as almost existential it will be a hard sell signals that abiy and his allies have sent since coming to power about their intentions to remake ethiopia s federation undercut their claims that they do not seek to undo current arrangements indeed for many of abiy s supporters remaking those arrangements is a key political goal and a vocal lobby beyond them supports such reforms still abiy can reiterate more forcefully that any far reaching reordering of ethiopia s constitutional order under his watch will take place down the line and through a consensual consultative process involving not only the ruling party but also other factions and ethiopian civil society a process along these lines would also benefit those among ethiopian society that want to move away from ethnic federalism by giving them a voice in reforms b calming tensions in oromia the prime minister should maintain lines of communication with the oromo opposition and continue to facilitate dialogue between oromo and amhara political parties aimed at reducing tensions that occurred after the october violence civil society groups such as the inter religious council and elders from the various ethnic groups should press ahead with their ongoing efforts to stimulate dialogue among both elites and the grassroots oromo elders for example brokered a january 2019 agreement that helped reduce fighting between federal troops and elements of the oromo liberation front they have also reportedly played a role in encouraging talks among rival factions in oromia and should maintain this effort they should emphasise to rival camps that all parties should channel their competition through the electoral process and discourage violence c addressing tigray alienation the government ought to start reversing tigray s dangerous alienation while its politicians will inevitably lose from more representative politics there are ways to mend bridges the tigray elite have already displayed a capacity to act in the national interest over the past two years although often portrayed as having retreated to their tigray fortress in anger after losing their dominant position in addis ababa parts of the tigrayan leadership in fact displayed considerable restraint by relinquishing their grip on power in early 2018 many feared ethiopia was careening toward civil war amid the three year grinding confrontation between protesters and the security state by ceding control tplf heavyweights took a difficult but inarguably wise decision prime minister abiy and his allies can now take steps to persuade them to more substantively rejoin the conversation at the centre of ethiopia s future a first step would be to ease tigray amhara tensions and tigray disquiet over amhara s territorial claims a first step would be to ease tigray amhara tensions and tigray disquiet over amhara s territorial claims abiy s government could continue to encourage amhara and tigray leaders to intensify and broaden promising initial discussions aimed at easing their mutually hostile relations while pressuring hardliners to allow such conciliatory steps to occur the administrative boundaries and identity issues commission could assert that it aims to resolve the status of the disputed territories on the basis of self determination even if leaving open questions of who has a say in their future in turn tigray leaders might reconsider their rejection of the commission s role abiy and his allies could also reconsider what the tplf perceives as a one sided campaign of prosecutions of leading tigrayans though tigrayans were prominent in the previous administrations leaders of other major ethnicities were also present in federal security organs besides to portray the former regime s legacy in a purely negative light would be misleading it built vital infrastructure revived an economy battered by years of civil war and oversaw major advances in basic health care and education for the large impoverished rural population transitional justice might be better implemented after ongoing reforms to judicial and investigative organs are complete for its part the tplf could show greater pragmatism rather than adopting a siege mentality and drawing red lines on issues like the ruling coalition merger its leaders could seek compromises with abiy s government in the same spirit that some of them show toward nascent discussions with their amhara counterparts further if a national dialogue takes place tigrayan elites might want to own up to some of the abuses that took place in the three decades in which they controlled key state organs such a good will gesture would hasten national reconciliation and might reduce opposition to steps to end prosecutions d reducing election risks and setting up a national dialogue the prime minister s office has reaffirmed that the government intends to hold the vote on schedule understandably so given his desire to achieve a popular mandate to push forward with his reforms moreover the legal procedure for deferring the vote past may s constitutional deadline is unclear and a postponement could expose the premier to questions about his legitimacy if the vote proceeds dialling down tensions beforehand will be critical abiy and his allies could convene a national conversation with opposition parties and civil society to discuss campaigning and election procedures including the security management of contested cities that are electoral hotspots and how to ensure that state institutions and public officials do not support the ruling party as occurred extensively during past elections this forum could help on a number of fronts it would offer a chance to limit expectations even with the best of intentions polls will be marked by challenges given that the new electoral board is still finding its feet and opposition parties media and civil society monitors remain weak it could allow abiy and the authorities to build good will and encourage parties to pledge not to campaign divisively or view the vote as an existential winner take all affair abiy himself might promise to form if he triumphs at the ballot box an inclusive government for example by bringing in regional leaders in the cabinet even if they opt not to join his new party initial discussions are also necessary on how to improve inter governmental coordination in a federation facing a post eprdf future where opposing parties may control the central and regional governments if the political temperature rises further abiy may have to seek an election delay if however the political temperature rises further abiy may have to seek an election delay a divisive and bloody campaign with candidates making openly ethnic based appeals for votes could tip the country over the edge provided that abiy secures broad support for a delay and uses the time the right way he should be able to weather criticism tigray leaders want the vote on time in tigray region they face little competition or insecurity that could disrupt balloting and in any case their fears about ethnic federalism mean that they oppose constitutional violations such as election delays though the steps outlined above aimed at tackling their grievances might help bring them along oromo and amhara opposition actors from jawar and the olf to the national movement of amhara could back a postponement so long as they were included in any major political discussions if polls are delayed some form of national dialogue with abiy presiding might be an option such talks would aim first to build consensus on a timeline for transitional milestones including a long overdue census and new dates for elections including at village district and city levels more importantly it could set out a process through which ethiopia s leaders can try to resolve deep seated disagreements over past violence power sharing regional autonomy territory and the future of ethnic federalism according to one top western diplomat the prime minister could say we re trying to change the country build on the past call together a national conversation trying to build a new national social contract he could present it as the natural next stage in the nation s history orchestrating an extended dialogue that addresses fundamental constitutional issues such as the degree of federalism vi international support in a country historically suspicious of outside involvement external actors inevitably are constrained in the roles they can play but the more open environment under abiy means that the country s international partners including the u s europeans and abiy s gulf allies can be franker than in the past even if behind closed doors first outside powers need freshened up talking points ethiopia s transition still offers great hope and merits all the support it can get but the continued unmitigated acclaim from abroad appears increasingly out of step with trends on the ground now that abiy has been awarded the nobel peace prize ethiopia s international partners can offer constructive criticism as well as plaudits the prime minister foreign allies should nudge his government toward a more cautious and consultative approach they should pressure oromo amhara and tigray elites including jawar and other opposition figures with whom many international actors have contacts to avoid inflammatory rhetoric they should encourage all ethiopian leaders to defer contentious demands over federal power sharing regional autonomy and territory until after the may elections or if they are delayed until some form of national dialogue or other consultative process is in place they should back an election delay if one becomes necessary international partners should use financial aid and technical support to protect ethiopia from economic shocks secondly international partners should use financial aid and technical support to protect ethiopia from economic shocks such as from a reduction in construction jobs due to diminished infrastructure investment large scale layoffs of civil servants increased external debt servicing costs due to devaluation of the national currency the birr or basic commodities prices hikes in today s fraught environment economic discontent could easily incite protests dangerously compounding communal divisions international partners should also be ready to discuss a comprehensive package of support for institutional and economic reform during a multi year transition if the government requests it western governments could consider following china s lead and offering abiy s government debt relief which could reopen some fiscal space to maintain public investment in vital infrastructure projects that create jobs for a youthful population vii conclusion since taking office prime minister abiy has tried to drive ethiopia s transition from the centre straddling a line between ethno nationalists and opponents of ethnic federalism but his plan to transform the ruling coalition has widened a fault line that has bedevilled the ethiopian state for decades between those who see ethnic federalism as a bulwark against the coercive centralism of the past and those who view it as a source of division and violence moreover even as abiy and his allies attempt to push forward reforms they have to grapple with other challenges perhaps most urgently ethnic strife that could tip the country into wider conflict and an under employed young cohort demanding greater economic opportunities ethiopia has long been an anchor state in the restive horn of africa its three year uprising arguably served as a model for later protests in the neighbourhood many are watching its delicate transition to a potentially more open era with considerable expectation ethiopian leaders and their foreign allies should redouble efforts to prevent a breakdown and to shepherd the country to a better future nairobi

summary over the last two years the united states has carried out one of the most massive swings in foreign economic policy since the trade wars of the 1930s abandoning the multilateralism forged after world war ii and adopting a new strategy of going it alone the implications for u s and global economic growth are enormous and the consequences for u s firms ability to access foreign markets are sweeping regardless of whether the shift toward unilateralism is short lived its macroeconomic effects are likely to be long lasting first trade policy uncertainty has risen in a way that may not be easily or quickly reversed this has already had a substantial impact on growth due to the depressing effect on firm activity and it is likely to continue second the tilt toward unilateral protectionism is likely to reduce u s firms ability to access many foreign markets for a long time to come
briefing highlights forecasts for the loonie stocks canadian dollar oil at a glance cineplex to be acquired by cineworld canadian home sales prices rise equinox to buy leagold what to watch for this week what analysts are saying today required reading best and worst bank of america merrill lynch says we should hope for the best but prepare for the worst when it comes to the fragile canadian dollar of course the worst may be best for some such as manufacturers and the bank of canada which would applaud a weak currency as a support for exports as we head into the end of the year several forecasters are releasing their latest projections for the loonie bank of america foreign exchange strategist ben randol among them global trade policy remains the key wild card mr randol said in his forecast in our view uncertainty may persist near term but should decline next year benefiting the loonie against the greenback but by less than for g10 peers here s his base case our usd cad forecast remains for a near term retest of 1 34 into end year followed by a gradual decline to 1 31 in 2020 referring to the u s dollar against the loonie by their symbols that 1 34 translates to a canadian dollar at just over 74 5 us cents while 1 31 puts the currency at almost 76 5 us cents near term we think that risks to the canadian dollar will remain elevated or potentially even increase mr randol said in his report titled cad hope for the best prepare for the worst however we expect that risk premium should compress next year as external conditions become increasingly benign enabling the exchange rate to converge to medium term fair value he added however as the broader usd tops out and begins to soften on a benign u s convergence story playing out we expect cad to underperform g10 peers in 2020 this is because we see the benefits of global reflation benefiting areas outside of north america more strongly besides trade issues of course the bank of canada s actions and comments will help dictate the currency s path higher interest rates are loonie friendly and the central bank has held back from the rush among its peers to cut thus buoying the currency in the process the canadian dollar dipped earlier when the latest labour market report showed huge jobs losses raising speculation the central bank could ease but it later rebounded as the u s currency faltered cad appreciation should be self limiting for now mr randol said in the absence of clarity on trade policy developments and associated positive spillovers to commodity prices our sense is that the boc will continue to view cad appreciation as an unwelcome tightening of financial conditions in his recent outlook technical strategist george davis of rbc dominion securities put the loonie at just shy of 77 us cents in the first quarter of 2020 then eroding through next year to sit just above 75 us cents in the final three months rbc expects the bank of canada to cut its benchmark overnight rate now at 1 75 per cent by one quarter of a percentage point in the second quarter of next year this should erode some of the interest rate support that has propped up cad in 2019 and lead to a mild uptrend in usd cad as 2020 progresses that mild uptrend of course means a mild downtrend for the loonie kit juckes in turn global fixed income strategist at société générale put the canadian dollar at about 75 75 us cents in the first quarter and then a rise to 77 5 us cents by the final three months the current level of the being historically consistent with a usd cad rate somewhere below 1 25 is very close to purchasing power parity fair value mr juckes said with that 1 25 translating to a loonie at 80 us cents we don t expect that level to be reached in 2020 but we are bearish of usd cad expecting to see a move back to 1 25 1 30 eventually bearish here means bullish on the canadian dollar with the range of 1 25 to 1 30 pegging the loonie at between about 77 and 80 us cents bank of montreal chief economist douglas porter said bmo expects the canadian dollar to be rangebound in 2020 with another mild upward skew toward the higher end of the boundary however that is not a bullish canadian dollar call per se but more of a cautious outlook on the u s dollar which we expect to lose some altitude amid a less fraught global trade backdrop and heading into the deep uncertainty of

this article first appeared in capital the edge malaysia weekly on december 9 2019 december 15 2019 the risk of a global recession is fading somewhat despite continued challenges to the economy says uk based fund manager schroders we feel the risk of that is fading somewhat and that is really because of the better data that we have been seeing in the us and signs of some resolution with the us china trade talks the potential that has been associated with those trade talks has been a big drag on activity because businesses are held back so i think that has been reduced and also lower interest rates is something that helps to reduce that its chief economist and strategist keith wade tells the edge in an interview going forward wade says one should expect lower for longer when it comes to interest rates he believes the us federal reserve may well ease rates again either once or twice next year with the initial cut likely to happen in the first part of the year as for whether another global financial crisis may be in the offing that would be more difficult to predict he said on the sidelines of the recently concluded schroders international media conference 2019 in london where key speakers from the company including wade presented their views on the global economy and markets it is always very difficult to know because it depends on whether investors decide that they are going to pull funding from a different area as it stands at the moment investors are still struggling with the fact that interest rates are very very low and they have to deploy the money to make returns for their clients and you know we are not seeing the kind of excesses seen in markets before that would herald a financial crisis certainly people worry a lot about the leveraged loan market in parts of the us corporate credit market but even there when you look at some of the ratios like the interest cover ratio that companies have they are reasonably comfortable they are not overstretched and not in a situation where they will suddenly have to make big changes and cutbacks he said while markets are generally still very liquid he said there have been some areas with problems for particular specific idiosyncratic reasons what we are seeing is that there are some pockets of the markets where investors have gone into areas that are quite illiquid and they have got burned as a result this is because if there is a sudden change of sentiment and they do decide to sell it is very difficult to sell for example there were problems in the property market when the uk voted for brexit and some of the funds had to be what you call gated not our funds though but that was a problem because people just could not get their money out so those are some of the kinds of problems we are seeing schroders global head of investment charles prideaux said expectations of subdued global economic growth and low inflation against a backdrop of disruption from populist policies technology and climate change remain inescapable investment truths for the decade ahead bluntly we are moving into an environment where getting the micro right as opposed to the broad macro is becoming more and more important he said in his presentation given this expected scenario he said stock market returns over the next 10 years will likely be limited with the exception of emerging markets all regions are expected to deliver lower returns he said see chart global bond returns will also be limited he added emerging market returns better however this does not mean that investors should shy away from stock markets if you are going to be in the emerging market space be active that s how you are going to make your money there are 26 markets in which you can invest it is a very diverse place and you get different economies at different points of their economic cycle and very different market drivers said tom wilson schroders head of emerging market equities he said valuations are still quite reasonable in the emerging market space they are more expensive in the quality growth part of the market than they are in the value part of it but even in quality growth they are okay the issue really is that the eps outlook remains relatively uncertain the relatively uncertain economic environment for some time now schroders funds have been positioned towards the quality growth part of the market but in the last few months have begun to take some profit and shift a little towards the value part of the market he said south korea is a classic example of a market that could perform relatively well he said especially if the scope of the expected partial trade agreement between the us and china is bigger than expected last wednesday us president donald trump told reporters at a meeting of nato leaders in london that trade talks with china were going very well a turnaround from the previous day when he said a trade deal may have to wait until after the 2020 us presidential election bloomberg also reported that day that a trade deal between the two countries is inching closer and set to be completed before tariffs rise on dec 15 citing unnamed people familiar with the matter it said the two sides are close to agreeing on the amount of tariffs to be rolled back in the phase 1 deal at its recent strategy meeting schroders lifted its weighting on south korea said wilson it has also put some money into taiwan in the last couple of months korea is a very open trade orientated economy and it has got a lot of companies that are really very cheap it is quite a cyclically orientated market as for taiwan to a certain extent the textiles has already outperformed relatively well but again i think maybe they will continue to perform if the scope of the phase 1 deal comes through wider than people expect and there is more of a de escalation in he said schroders is however underweight in asia we have a preference for latin america which is a function of quite a material overweight on brazil and we are overweight emea wilson said within asia its main overweight is south korea while it is neutral on taiwan and china and underweight on india malaysia and the philippines wilson said there are two things that could be helpful for asian equities first if the us dollar starts to depreciate more or faster than our current expectation that is if it is not resilient and assuming it does so in a relatively benign economic environment that is really quite positive from an emerging markets standpoint and secondly if there is de escalation in us china trade tensions wilson explained in an interview that schroders is underweight in malaysia mainly because of valuations it s really valuation more than anything else the valuations have got better relative to history but we have a quant model in effect and the quant model guides are contra allocation the 1malaysia development bhd scandal was not a factor for schroders investment stance no not really it is really a function of what is the government doing from a fiscal standpoint and so on but in a nutshell we are underweight on malaysia quant model and we do not find a bottom up driver to override the model recommendation either therefore we remain out of the market at this point in time said wilson save by subscribing to us for your print and or digital copy

london calling european capitals also fall from the top 100 north america dominates top 100 most expensive locations in the world global comparison sees asia weigh in as second most costly for expatriates cost of living in thailand increases bangkok enters top 50 for the first time for more news and features see our international assignments section the latest reckoning from the provider of knowledge information and technology for international reward programmes also shows that europe more widely has taken a hit from the double whammy of a weaker german economy and a strong us dollar eca international s ranking sees most major eurozone cities drop out of the top 100 by contrast north american locations now account for almost a third of the top 100 most expensive overtaking previously dominant asia eca international s latest cost of living report registers cities in the uk dropping eight places on average over the last 12 months with central london 140 posting its lowest ever position in the global rankings according to the report continuing uncertainty surrounding brexit and the fallout from the us china trade war has had a negative impact on value of the pound making it cheaper for visitors and international expats working and living in the uk the flipside is that it is now more expensive for british expats to travel to the us australia and certain non eurozone locations says steven kilfedder production manager at eca international the uk is the cheapest it has been for foreign workers but figures suggest that this is not leading to an influx of investment because of the uncertainty over brexit meanwhile it has become more expensive for uk firms to send staff abroad while uncertainty may decrease after the election and push up the value of pound there could be years of complicated trade talks ahead so expect the uk to see more fluctuations in the ranking in years to come conversely a weakened euro combined with slow growth particularly in germany which narrowly avoided recession has seen almost all eurozone locations drop in rankings seven locations tumble out of the top 100 including major european cities such as the hague lyon rome berlin and munich ireland s capital dublin remains in the top 100 87 ahead of all uk cities including central london 140 edinburgh 156 and manchester 162 despite tumbling ten places on last year there were some price hike hotspots with europe however these were mainly outside the eurozone russian and ukrainian locations registered big rises kiev 198 witnessed the biggest increase in europe rising 38 places over the last 12 months while moscow 114 and st petersburg 168 increased their ranking 29 and 24 places respectively switzerland continues to have the highest cost of living in europe with four locations in the top ten the continuing strength of the us dollar has seen all locations in the us increase by an average of 18 places with new york 15 and honolulu 20 in hawaii both entering the global top 20 there are now 28 us locations in the top 100 compared to just five in 2014 canadian locations also saw big increases rising 20 places on average with vancouver 91 and ottawa 96 returning to the top 100 toronto 101 and montreal 124 remain outside the top 100 but did increase 23 and 12 places respectively north america now accounts for almost a third of the top 100 most expensive locations in the world with 30 cities located in either the usa or canada overtaking asia which has 28 the strength of the us dollar has made the us more expensive for workers and businesses looking to move to the country with 28 cities in the top 100 continues mr kilfedder on the other hand us companies are benefitting from the cheaper cost of sending staff abroad to locations in europe and china cost of living in hong kong remains steady retaining its position as the sixth costliest location in the world however the region has slipped from second to third in asia following a strong performance by the yen seeing tokyo rise six places to second place globally meanwhile singapore frequently seen as a rival to hong kong s claim as being asia s premier financial hub saw its ranking increase five places to 13 eleven places higher than five years ago in 2014 kilfedder said hong kong s place in the rankings has remained stable this year with the city continuing to be the sixth most expensive location in the world for expatriates despite the ongoing socio political upheavals and the fact that the economy is in recession we have yet to see a real impact in the cost of living in the city inflation remains high relative to many other locations that occupy the upper reaches of our rankings indeed hong kong has only been overtaken by tokyo due to the strong performance of the japanese yen throughout 2019 which has moved many japanese cities up the rankings we expect prices in japan to increase further owing to the recent increase in consumption tax while next year s olympics in tokyo are likely to have further inflationary effects as such we expect tokyo to remain above hong kong into 2020 added kilfedder a strong performance by the baht has seen all thai locations increase by an average of 42 places with bangkok rising 43 places to 47 this continues an upwards trend in cost of living which has seen the thai capital rise 114 places in the last five years bangkok long seen as a cheap destination for holidaymakers and businesses alike has seen a huge rise in the cost of living for people from other countries over the past few years explained mr kilfedder the strong economy has pushed up the value of the thai baht and made the country more expensive for expatriates we have seen thai cities moving significantly up the rankings over the past few years bangkok has moved up 75 places in the last two years alone and chiang mai has moved up 56 places in the same period 2024 re locate magazine published by profile locations spray hill hastings

sweeping effects on our economy and financial system network for greening the financial system 2018 hereafter ngfs usgcrp 2018 climate related shifts in the physical environment can slow economic growth increase volatility and depreciate the value of business and household assets and property avoiding further climate change will involve a substantial transformation of the economy consequently climate change appears increasingly relevant to central bankers and financial supervisors for achieving their macroeconomic inflation and financial stability mandates ngfs 2018 rudebusch 2019 as a topic for research in economics climate change touches many fields of study including finance macroeconomics and environmental international development and labor economics partly as a result climate change research has been slow to gain traction in the mainstream of the economics profession diaz rainey robertson and wilson 2017 oswald and stern 2019 to foster greater interaction and interest among researchers and policymakers on this important topic the federal reserve bank of san francisco recently hosted a conference on the economics of climate change this was the first fed sponsored conference on this issue along with discussions and presentations the conference also featured speeches by three monetary policymakers mary daly president of the san francisco fed lael brainard governor of federal reserve board and frank elderson member of the governing board of the dutch central bank and chairman of the ngfs all three of these policymakers stressed the significance of understanding climate related trends and risks as an input to policy this economic letter summarizes the main themes of the conference the speeches and research presented are available on the conference website the macroeconomic implications of a warmer world climate change has long term macroeconomic implications for worker productivity and the composition and profitability of business investment to study the links among climate change climate adaptation and climate policy researchers have constructed large scale models of the connections between the global climate and global economy these integrated assessment models are often very complex in some cases involving hundreds of variables and equations using one such model solomon hsiang u c berkeley presented research on how warmer temperatures make exposed workers less productive this is particularly important for outdoor workers as in agriculture and construction over time the higher temperatures may result in significant losses for the overall economy and notable shifts in the occupations workers choose conny olvosson sveriges riksbank constructed another integrated assessment model to investigate how a world with multiple energy sources and alternative policies to tax carbon would affect carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth his findings emphasize the importance of taxing coal which produces large amounts of carbon pollution even over other fossil fuel energy sources such as oil his research demonstrated that subsidizing green energy without taxing coal or other fossil fuels is unlikely to reduce emissions because energy subsidies tend to increase overall energy use what makes these results especially valuable is that they quantify the economic gains and losses from each policy and thus could serve as a tangible guide for policymakers there are wide differences in how climate change affects various areas of the world moreover regional disparities in resources policies and technology only exacerbate these differences still changes in one region of the world can have consequences elsewhere including people migrating to avoid adverse climate developments and extreme natural events disrupting international trade accounting for such regional differences and spillovers while a complicated task is nevertheless crucial for assessing the long run economic impact of climate on growth work presented by hashem pesaran usc suggested that the permanent losses in welfare can be substantial across the board even in the united states which is usually seen as being better positioned to adapt to climate change moreover global climate change mitigation efforts so far have had little effect on moderating these permanent losses nicholas muller carnegie mellon university argued that the costs of carbon pollution and the associated losses to productivity have a variety of macroeconomic implications he recommended taking a broader view of aggregate output by considering pollution as a reduction in welfare as such a permanent decline in the economy s capacity to grow due to climate change will diminish the returns from economic activity in the future and lower the interest rate that borrowers will accept under this perspective unabated pollution would be expected to put further downward pressure on interest rates climate risks are financial risks when pricing an asset investors demand compensation for risk and climate change is an emerging risk that may be especially relevant for equity prices some businesses are more exposed to climate risk than others and investors will require a higher premium for investing in such firms using standard asset pricing arguments dana kiku university of illinois at urbana champaign showed that equity prices are sensitive to long run temperature uncertainty and that such climate risk carries a risk premium using estimates of these premiums kiku calculated the implied cost that investors place on future carbon emissions those implicit prices of carbon are notably higher than current prices in markets for carbon emission permits extracting carbon emission prices from financial markets relies on investors being able to appropriately assess climate risks but what if they are not what would happen if investors misunderstood the risks that carbon emissions pose to the climate and in turn to the economy some possible future climate scenarios include catastrophic consequences in other words worst case outcomes even if these scenarios have only a small chance of coming true the extreme losses they entail might affect an asset s price significantly research presented by ryan riordan university of oregon suggests that investors have not yet fully priced the carbon risk in such extreme scenarios as economies adapt to climate change and gradually switch from carbon based so called brown energy to greener energy alternatives the value of assets associated with brown technologies will decline and in the extreme assets may become stranded because carbon extraction industries such as coal mining oil drilling and fracking are capital intensive they tend to require substantial external funding however loans to these industries depend on collateral whose value can evaporate quickly in turn if lenders capital buffers are insufficient for the risk involved the loan losses can generate systemic financial instability these developments are exacerbated by the response of energy companies as michael barnett arizona state university discussed for example oil extraction companies may ramp up production and curtail exploration in the short run this could cause oil prices to drop and oil firm valuations to fall further relative to green energy producers the policy implications of climate change economic policies can have unintended consequences such appears to be the case with current trade policies in many countries which may have increased carbon emissions tariffs imposed worldwide to protect certain industries from competition abroad implicitly subsidize carbon emissions the reason is that tariffs are lower for high emitting industries than for low emitting industries as joseph shapiro u c berkeley explained this research emphasizes the importance of considering climate change consequences when negotiating new trade agreements balancing trade policy to improve incentives for low emitting industries could result in sizable reductions of carbon emissions although the united states does not currently have a federal carbon tax nor a cap and trade system there is a chance such policies could be adopted in the future to help reduce carbon emissions could expectations about imposing a future carbon tax be sufficient to change the behavior of businesses and hasten a shift in energy usage toward greener alternatives or would it be more effective to actually impose a carbon tax stephie fried arizona state university showed that there are fewer distortions to the economy and more carbon reductions when policymakers actually institute a carbon tax than when they simply threaten to impose one or rely on the public s expectation that one will be imposed sometime in the future trade policy and carbon pricing clearly fall outside a central bank s mandate but climate change has important consequences for monetary policy and financial stability as sandra batten bank of england argued for example natural disasters are disturbances to the productive capacity of the economy that operate similarly to an oil price spike they both tend to raise inflation in the short run this presents a challenge for monetary policy raising interest rates to control inflation also may damp economic activity at a time of distress the transition to greener energy and other forms of climate mitigation are also likely to aggravate the stranded assets problem and may add to financial stability risk conclusion the ramifications of climate change extend to numerous areas of economic life yet many are not well understood as the research described in this letter demonstrates the economic consequences of climate change are likely to be substantial and will require responses from a wide range of policy institutions future conferences on climate change will improve our understanding of these issues and provide the foundation for the best possible policy responses galina hale is a

cash sent home by overseas filipino workers ofws grew at the fastest clip in a year to their biggest amount so far for 2019 in october global uncertainties notwithstanding the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp reported on monday cash remittances which ofws sent through banks grew by eight percent to 2 671 billion in october marking the biggest increment since the 8 7 increase recorded a year ago that brought year to date inflows to 24 858 billion reflecting a 4 6 year on year increase by type of worker cash sent home by land based workers increased by 3 8 to 19 436 billion year to date while those sent home by those at sea increased by 7 5 to 5 422 billion the central bank said in a news release personal remittances which include transfers in kind grew by 7 7 to 2 969 billion similarly marking the biggest increase in a year or since the eight percent seen in october 2018 and the biggest amount so far for 2019 october inflows drove year to date personal remittances up 4 3 to 27 612 billion with those from land based workers alone growing by 3 8 to 21 1 billion in a note e mailed to journalists on monday nicholas antonio t mapa senior economist at ing bank nv manila noted the increase in inflows despite earlier expectations for weakness in of remittances owing to unrest in hong kong struggles in the middle east given depressed oil prices and the brexit issue by jurisdiction the united states remained the biggest source of cash remittances accounting for 37 6 of the year to date total it was followed by saudi arabia singapore japan united arab emirates the united kingdom canada germany hong kong and kuwait the combined remittances from these sources accounted for 78 4 of total cash remittances in the 10 months to october the bsp clarified however that many remittance centers abroad course such funds through correspondent banks most of which are located in the us moreover remittances coursed through money couriers cannot be tracked by actual location of sources and are lodged under the country in which main offices are based which in many cases is the united states mr mapa noted that while filipinos sent home more dollars than expected in october with global headwinds swirling remittance flows from affected areas with the exception of the uk have all taken a hit with remittances from hong kong saudi arabia qatar and the uae all taking a tumble in october taken together remittances from these jurisdictions account for 24 of total weighing heavily on the total amount of foreign exchange sent home offsetting the weakness in these regions was the 26 gain in remittances from asia which was up 26 with extremely strong remittance flows from japan korea and singapore while the us continued to post double digit growth in remittance flows in 2019 he also noted that ofw remittances which help fuel overall economic growth through household spending that account for nearly 70 of gross domestic product have been lending strength to the peso against the greenback sustained remittance flows have helped narrow this year s current account deficit working together with a tighter trade gap with exports eking out growth while import compression was in full effect mr mapa wrote this development he said is impressive given that this occurred even with the us china trade war and with bsp slashing policy rates aggressively the peso s fortunes however may reverse in 2020 with the current account expected to come under renewed pressure on projected imports related to the government s fiscal push mr mapa said but one thing s for sure ofw remittance will continue to post decent growth prints to offset this weakening pressure asked on his outlook for remittance flows security bank corp chief economist robert dan j roces said in an e mail that he expects a further pickup towards the end of the holiday season but conversion could be at a slight disadvantage as the peso maintains its strength against the dollar aside from the seasonal factor brought about by the holidays rizal commercial banking corp chief economist michael l ricafort in an e mail attributed continued remittance growth to diversification of manpower markets the country s improved diplomatic relations with the major host countries for ofws as well the country s further diversification of more host countries for ofws on top of the traditional ones to more countries in asia middle east europe and americas have also supported the recent faster growth in ofw remittances especially amid aging populations and shortage of labor in some developed countries unionbank of the philippines inc chief economist ruben carlo o asuncion noted that while uncertainty in hong kong may be considerable it is not so big to sway philippine remittance growth downwards since the hk conflicts escalated philippine remittances have continued to rise considerably mr asuncion said in an e mail it seems there are no signs that remittance growth will abate in the near future for security bank s mr roces however some expatriate employers may have begun to leave and this gives some instability in terms of employment opportunities in the former british colony luz

nebc montney infrastructure in addition pembina expects to place into service an additional 1 1 billion of projects during 2020 in 2020 the pipelines division will benefit from higher revenue volumes on the peace pipeline system from new projects including phase vi nebc montney infrastructure the wapiti lateral as well as increased volumes at existing locations the pipelines division will also benefit in 2020 from the contribution of the cochin pipeline and edmonton terminals acquired as part of the kinder morgan transaction the facilities division is expected to benefit from a full year of operations at duvernay ii and the redwater co generation facility as well as the start up of projects including duvernay sour treatment facilities prince rupert export terminal and empress fractionation 2020 guidance also reflects the contribution from the acquisition of vancouver wharves these factors are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues at select dry gas facilities the outlook for the marketing new ventures division is based on an expectation of lower year over year crude oil marketing revenue and narrower ngl frac spreads driven by lower ngl prices partially offset by pembina s hedging program the company has hedged approximately 50 percent of its 2020 frac spread exposure excluding aux sable with these hedges having been systematically entered into

underpinning and good counterparties all ingredients to delivering consistent industry leading returns further we continue to execute pembina s strategy within our financial guardrails stated scott burrows pembina s senior vice president and chief financial officer it takes commitment and discipline but pembina and its stakeholders have been rewarded and we intend to maintain our approach moving forward noted mr burrows business update pembina continues to be squarely focused on delivering transportation and midstream services that enable our customers to reach the best possible markets for their products at a competitive cost thus enhancing their netbacks collectively the following developments support the ongoing build out of our integrated value chain and highlight pembina s unique capability to quickly and cost effectively add up to 300 000 barrels per day bpd of incremental peace pipeline system capacity renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential incremental fractionation facilities prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion and ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s liquids pipelines are now connected to all major export facilities and world scale storage facilities in alberta including the 10 million barrels of storage acquired from kinder morgan further through the acquisition of the cochin pipeline pembina has strengthened its capabilities and connectivity within its condensate business in addition pembina s ngl pipeline systems are connected upstream to major pembina and third party gas processing facilities and downstream to all major ngl fractionation and storage facilities in the fort saskatchewan alberta area this connectivity provides our customers with unparalleled flexibility in reaching their desired markets renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts pembina continues to progress the renewal of the legacy peace pipeline phase i and ii contracts a portion of which were previously extended as part of the phase iii expansion pembina is engaged in ongoing discussions with customers and is highly confident that the majority of the remaining contracts nearing maturity will be renewed or their firm capacity resold given the tolls are substantially lower than current posted tolls this will allow us to maintain pembina s current earnings profile while providing exceptional value flexibility and reliability for customers not available elsewhere producer demand for pembina s transportation services across the liquids rich areas of the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb continues to grow since may 2019 pembina has continued to secure firm service commitments on the peace pipeline system while extending many in the process this continues pembina s recent track record of systematically growing and extending the contracted revenue profile of these pipelines in response to customer demand and in lock step with our announced expansions firm volume commitments now will reach approximately 1 1 million bpd in 2022 peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential once the first stage of phase ix is complete pembina will have 1 1 million bpd of market delivery capacity into edmonton alberta across the peace and northern systems and will have completed its objective of achieving segregated liquids transportation service for ethane plus propane plus crude and condensate between gordondale alberta and the edmonton alberta area full product segregation is a significant accomplishment that will drive operational and capital efficiencies strengthen pembina s competitive advantage and ultimately benefit our customers there are numerous advantages associated with product segregation including most notably the avoidance of product batching which increases pipeline utilization minimizes product interface and requires less operational storage finally it also supports potential capacity increases through optimization and more efficient and ultimately cost effective lateral connectivity to the pipeline as well as optimal flexibility in future mainline expansions the elimination of batching and other hydraulic optimization initiatives which pembina refers to as phase x could create up to an incremental 100 000 bpd of capacity with minimal capital spending in addition pembina continues to have the ability through a second stage of the phase ix expansion to add approximately 200 000 of capacity to its pipelines from fox creek alberta to namao alberta through the addition of pump stations on these mainlines land for these additional pump stations has been acquired and all the upstream infrastructure required to access this capacity will be in place with the completion of the peace phase vi ix expansions incremental fractionation facilities with the increasing amount of oil and condensate resource being developed along our pipeline systems and the anticipated startup of lng canada s phase i liquified natural gas project on canada s west coast pembina continues to receive customer requests for incremental fractionation services for associated natural gas liquids increasingly we are observing customer demand for incremental natural gas liquid barrels particularly from the montney play to move westward for export given this shift in wcsb product flows pembina is pursuing multiple developments in parallel both within the existing redwater fractionation complex as well as northeast british columbia nebc which will facilitate this movement and actively respond to producers evolving needs pembina currently has in excess of 1 500 acres at the company s existing redwater fractionation complex and has secured 540 acres in nebc where pembina is evaluating new fractionation facilities based on the design of the

demand for services and provide maximum diversification to premium ngl markets such as through pembina s prince rupert export terminal and its expansion or through value added upgrading to polypropylene prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion pembina continues to advance construction of its prince rupert lpg export terminal the project is on track to provide customers with export service beginning in the second half of 2020 the anticipated startup of this facility has generated significant interest from our customers and offtakers and pembina is pleased to announce an expansion of this terminal the prince rupert terminal expansion which will increase propane export capacity to approximately 40 000 bpd the prince rupert terminal expansion is expected to cost approximately 175 million and has an anticipated in service date in the first half of 2023 subject to regulatory and environmental approvals the incremental capacity from the expansion will closely match the proposed nebc fractionation facility s propane production and the in service dates of the respective facilities would be closely aligned ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals

more americans are in work than any time in the last five decades but a new job quality index finds there are 81 high quality jobs for every 100 low quality ones the numbers tell one story unemployment in the us is the lowest it s been in 50 years more americans have jobs than ever before wage growth keeps climbing people tell a different story long job hunts trouble finding work with decent pay a lack of predictable hours these accounts are hard to square with the record long economic expansion and robust labor market described in headline statistics put another way when you compare the lived reality with the data and it s clear something big is getting lost in translation but a team of researchers thinks they may have uncovered the rosetta stone of the us labor market they recently unveiled the us private sector job quality index or jqi for short a new monthly indicator that aims to track the quality of jobs instead of just the quantity the jqi measures the ratio of what the researchers call high quality versus low quality jobs based on whether the work offer more or less than the average income a reading of 100 means that there are equal numbers of the two groups while anything less implies relatively lower quality jobs here s what it looks like the decline of us job quality in the last 30 years image cornell university so what is this newfangled thing telling us right now the jqi is just shy of 81 which implies that there are 81 high quality jobs for every 100 low quality ones while that s a slight improvement from early 2012 the jqi s 30 year nadir it s still way down from 2006 the eve of the housing market crash when the economy regularly supported about 90 good jobs per 100 lousy ones or in plainer english the us labor market is nowhere near fully recovered from the great recession in fact the long term trend in the balance of jobs paints a more ominous picture the problem is that quality of the stock of jobs on offer has been deteriorating for the last 30 years says dan alpert an investment banker and cornell law school professor who helped create the index along with alpert the index is built and maintained by researchers at cornell university law school the coalition for a prosperous america the university of missouri kansas city and the global institute for sustainable prosperity the whole story told by the index he adds is the devaluation of american labor how low can you go to grasp the jqi s significance it s worth understanding how it s made the researchers take private sector non manager jobs which make up 82 of all private sector jobs and divvy them into two groups the high quality jobs that pay more than the average weekly wage and tend to have more hours per week and the low quality ones that pay less and offer fewer hours the index is a weighted ratio of the two averaged over the previous three months to cut out the noise 1 the prevalence of low quality jobs suggests that there s still a lot of slack in the labor market meaning people could be working more or using their skills more fully than they currently are this is pretty much the opposite conclusion you d draw from the ultra low unemployment rate robust job creation numbers and other conventional headline data us unemployment is at a 50 year low image bea that s why starting next month the jqi will be released on the same day as the closely watched monthly jobs data published by the bureau of labor statistics the hope is to offer policymakers a more granular picture of america s economic health says alpert take for instance the federal reserve had they viewed the market through this lens they might not have says alpert that s the type of policymaker we re trying to address it s a reality check on the conventional data america s shift to a crummy job economy since 1990 america has cumulatively added some 20 million low quality jobs versus around 12 million high quality ones in short the us economy has shifted toward creating more bad jobs than good since 1990 the us economy has shifted toward creating more bad jobs than good image cornell university this has significant implications for the economy for instance inflation adjusted income for workers with high quality jobs has grown at a brisker clip than it has for workers in low quality ones that point might seem a little tautological after all the researchers definition of high quality rests on average weekly wage a big factor in determining income however wage growth isn t what s really driving that divergence rather it s a sharp split in hours worked those in low quality jobs now clock a mere 30 hours a week on average down from 31 in 1999 that compares with an average 38 hours a week for high quality jobs on an individual basis that seven hour gap might not sound like a lot add it up however and it reveals the stunning scale of america s underemployment problem if the average low quality job offered the same number of hours as the typical high quality job it tallies up to about 480 million hours per year those unworked hours representing labor that could have contributed to the us economy represents around 12 million forgone jobs every year of course some of that decline may be due to workers seeking to curb their hours voluntarily another key reason is that employers sometimes limit hours to keep from having to pay benefits a problem that by the way european workers are facing too overall the hours worked deficit reflects a much larger problem the swelling share of jobs that offer lower than average incomes means that job growth as reflected by a super low unemployment rate implies less and less spending power than in the past as you create these jobs in lower quality areas says alpert the economy gets a lot less bang for its buck the dramatic rise and fall of a couple key industries brings this point into sharper focus the collapse of us manufacturing throughout the second half of the 20th century us manufacturing supported around 12 8 million production jobs then all of a sudden america started hemorrhaging factory jobs by 2010 the number had shrunk to levels last seen in 1939 when the us population was two fifths of its current size although it s recovered a bit since manufacturing jobs are still down more than a quarter since 2000 manufacturing jobs have declined by more than 25 since 2000 image bls nearly all of the manufacturing jobs lost say the jqi researchers have been replaced by just four service sector industries retail administration and waste services healthcare and leisure and hospitality in all of these industries jobs with lower than average income predominate if you travel around this country and manufacturing areas it is not hard in a restaurant to find somebody who was once a manufacturing worker says jeffrey ferry an economist at the coalition for a prosperous america a nonpartisan group representing labor and manufacturing interests this isn t just a problem for hard on their luck rust belt residents it hurts the whole economy factory jobs are good for economies for one they tend to pay well and offer steady hours and not just because of unions or tradition but because they produce a lot of value mechanization boosts the worth of people s labor by allowing them to produce way more than they otherwise could in the grand scheme of things this increased productivity the ability to produce more faster is what drives long term growth and ultimately raises people s living standards of course technology can boost human productivity in service sector jobs too for example how computers let bankers process payments much faster than when checks were cleared by hand so it might not matter if the lost factory jobs were replaced by high tech service sector jobs the knowledge economy and all that but alas this hasn t been the case waiting tables selling shoes mopping floors there s not much technology can do to improve on human labor required for these tasks so all else equal swapping out a factory position for one of these jobs strips the technological value boost from a person s exertions and in aggregate leaves the economy producing less than it otherwise could and indeed sluggish labor productivity growth since the end of the great recession tracks with the trend in jqi though there s not yet enough data to determine anything conclusive with a growing share of jobs producing less value from human labor it s hardly surprising that more workers are earning offers lower than average incomes the problem is workers are also consumers the less they earn the less they re able to spend the poorer they feel and the more they save this gets to how the jqi might help explain why the unemployment rate can slip to near record lows without powering faster growth and whipping up inflation what s worse this dynamic reinforces itself weaker spending discourages companies from investing in new equipment or technology as incomes stagnate workers grow increasingly desperate and accept lower wages the combination of cheap labor and ever fickler demand pushes firms to replace high quality jobs with low quality ones causing the economy itself to lose vitality the longer this goes on the harder it is to switch back because eventually the structure of the economy itself prevents demand from reviving growth the key to understanding how to escape this perilous feedback loop says alpert is to grasp what caused it to begin with a devastating double whammy on january 20 1981 in his first ever remarks as america s new president ronald reagan uttered one of his most famous phrases government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem more than simply a memorable line those words became a whole ideology one that alpert argues underlies many of today s economic woes the rise of this worldview nixed the us government s traditional role of supporting demand and investing in boosting productivity an authority it has yet to reclaim america s infrastructure took a big hit the damage began to appear as early as the 1990s when the us s infrastructure deficit started to emerge says alpert jobs building and maintaining that infrastructure have long provided high paying full time jobs for those who might otherwise struggle to find decent work which is why he suspects this is a key reason for the jqi s steady decline as unwise at this publish spending aversion was the timing of this shift was tragically unlucky coinciding as it did with something unprecedented in human history the initial blow came from the asian tigers south korea taiwan hong kong and singapore that emerged as manufacturing powerhouses in the late 1980s and early 1990s then following a fluky trio of events the fall of the berlin wall tiananmen square and india s sweeping economic reforms the opening up of eastern europe china and india added more than a billion workers to the world s labor pool under a single global capitalist system depending on how you count them alpert puts it closer to 3 5 billion this great doubling of the global workforce as harvard economist richard freeman wrote in 2006 pdf presented the us economy with its greatest challenge since the great depression on top of all that advanced economies experienced a steady upsurge of women joining their workforces throughout the 1980s and 1990s at the same time a series of us led trade and investment agreements most notably permanently normalizing trade relations with china in 2001 lifted the floodgates on foreign investment as us companies moved factories overseas en masse american manufacturing employment imploded though plenty of politicians economists and media still argue that automation and not trade caused most of this collapse research by economist susan houseman shows that trade was indeed the chief driver this would have been bad enough as it was but without public spending to replace the high quality jobs lost the mix in jobs shifted so severely that even near record low unemployment rates aren t enough to revive the us economy s former might low unemployment rates still aren t enough to revive the us economy image alpert ferry hockett and khaleghi quality time many think the china shock is mercifully over not alpert i m still looking at billions of people who aren t urbanized around the world who will continue to put downward pressure on global labor he says so what can be done to revive high quality job creation there are two possible approaches he says the first is protectionism and other more supply side measures basically the tack donald trump has taken this includes his trade wars as well as his tax bill and to a lesser extent deregulation as you can see in the chart above the president s policies or perhaps in some cases confidence in his policies managed to juice the jqi at three distinct points since trump won the election but those effects were fleeting likely because the problem isn t that businesses had too little money to spend rather the lack of demand gives them no good reason to spend it this brings us to the second option valorizing the traditional role of the government as a creator of demand and the ticket here argues alpert is big sustained increase in infrastructure spending
watch now sen elizabeth warren is one of the top tier democratic candidates for president near the head of the pack along with former vice president joe biden fellow progressive sen bernie sanders and upstart mayor pete buttigieg warren saw some of her momentum stall in national and state polls after she rolled out her proposal to pay for medicare for all in early november and a subsequent plan detailing how she would transition the american health care system to a single payer model she also got into high profile public battles with billionaires such as leon cooperman and lloyd blankfein with the iowa caucuses coming in early february the democratic presidential candidates particularly those at the top of the field are scrambling for support among the party s rank and file warren on saturday sat down with cnbc s john harwood at the erickson community center in clinton iowa to discuss the state of her campaign her vision for remaking american capitalism and what she thinks of impeachment proceedings against president donald trump an edited transcript of the interview follows john harwood do you see any lessons for yourself for democrats for american politics in the results of the british election the other day and what happened to jeremy corbyn watch now elizabeth warren well you know i think that the brexit part of that vote is a huge sway and it seems to me that it s clear that there was a real divide in the country and big part of what drove that vote john harwood you don t think it was a lesson that the liberal democratic equivalent shouldn t go too far left elizabeth warren brexit certainly wasn t the whole part but i think that this notion of left i don t think there s any such thing as a problem of government that works too much for the people and that s what this ultimately should always be about that s what all our governments should be doing that s what a democratically elected government should do it shouldn t just be there for the wealthy and the well connected it should be there to help strengthen middle class to help give opportunities to working people that s what government can do when it s working best john harwood one issue that came up in your recent transparency battle with mayor pete had to do with who his clients were at mckinsey in particular whether or not any of the advice that he gave was used to lay off workers he says he doesn t know he doubts it but if it did is there anything wrong with that elizabeth warren so look i m glad that the mayor agreed to disclose the information about his past clients because i think the american people have a right to know in effect where conflicts are potential conflicts of interest but for me this is a lot less about what was happening five years ago or 10 years ago or 15 years ago and a lot more about what s happening every day in this primary as we go into the 2020 election season so it s about who are your bundlers the people who get special access to the candidate s time in return for agreeing to raise 25 000 or a quarter of a million dollars who is putting together the big parties who s doing the political action committees watch now john harwood i was asking as an economic matter you say that you re a capitalist to your bones elizabeth warren i am john harwood isn t a consultancy that advises businesses on how to be more lean and efficient part of the creative destruction that makes capitalism capitalism elizabeth warren depends on the kind of capitalism we re talking about i am proposing something called accountable capitalism you may remember that for more than a century american corporations owed multiple duties they owed duties to their investors but also to their employees to their customers to the communities where they were located to our country and then in the late 70 an economist comes along and says hey here s a novel idea how about if you only owe any kind of duty to your investors which means make it all about profitability that means that american corporations today these giant corporations they have no loyalty to america or to american workers john harwood now jamie dimon and the business roundtable came out earlier this year and said the days of sole fealty to shareholders are over we re making some changes was that meaningful in your view watch now elizabeth warren can we just put that in a little bit of context i had come out with my accountable capitalism proposal that said that giant companies like the kind of company that jamie dimon runs should have to be chartered at the federal level their charter should actually say that they owe all of these multiple duties and that employees can elect 40 of the board of directors to make sure john harwood you think you caused them to make that decision elizabeth warren well all i m saying is that s what happened first there was a lot of conversation about it and then jamie dimon and the heads of some other very large corporations said oh we don t need a law we re just going to make that change voluntarily john harwood do you think they ll do it on their own elizabeth warren no i think that what ll happen is they ll say they re going to do it on their own and they may make some adjustments but understand this there s a reason you put laws in place because the one who doesn t follow voluntarily is the one who then gets a little short term comparative advantage gets to boost the share price just a little bit you put in rules so everybody competes on a level playing field that s what we should do with accountable capitalism if jamie dimon thinks it s a good idea for giant corporations like j p morgan chase to have multiple obligations he and i agree then let s make that the law john harwood let me go back to the mckinsey example your friend deval patrick the former governor worked at bain capital when he got into the race the other day he said he thought the obama campaign had given a bum rap to bain when he was running against mitt romney this is a part of how business works some deals go bad but it s not a bad thing do you think he s right is bain capital and what it represents in the economy a bad thing elizabeth warren when they re trying to tweak up corporate actions that are already aiming only toward increasing profitability perfectly willing to if they could save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country would do it in a heartbeat that is a problem in our economy even jamie dimon says so others who come in and help them do that that s not making our economy work any better and it s not making our country work any better john harwood do firms like that have a constructive role to play elizabeth warren they have a constructive role to play when we have accountable capitalism if what they were helping do is make that company work better for employees as well as shareholders for the communities where they re located as well as shareholders then sure but that s not what they re doing john harwood so you disagree with the governor you don t think that obama was giving a bad rap to bain elizabeth warren when they re just trying to say the only thing that matters is the bottom line profits profits profits and whoever you have to step over to get there and however many hardworking people you have to lay off to get there then i think that s a problem john harwood liberal critics of the president say about his immigration policies the cruelty is the point he s trying to deter behavior when you and your campaign sell mugs that say billionaire tears why shouldn t jamie dimon leon cooperman lloyd blankfein bill gates all the people who ve complained and ordinary voters why shouldn t they conclude that punishment is the point elizabeth warren no no no come on as i say in every one of my town halls if you made it big i mean really big i mean top one 10th of 1 big good for you that s great but pitch in 2 cents so everyone else gets a chance to make it big because for me that s what this is all about this year the bottom 99 they re going to pay about 7 2 of their total wealth in taxes the top one tenth of 1 those top millionaires and billionaires fortunes above 50 million they re going to pay less than half that about 3 2 and look it s not just about asking to pay taxes it s about what we do with those taxes that 2 cent wealth tax would mean we could pay for universal child care for every baby in this country that would be life transformative for those babies who got high quality early education experiences and get ready for kindergarten it would be life transformative for their mamas and their daddies who could finish school who could move to a part time job who could move from a part time job to a full time job the way i ve set it up it would be life transformative for all of the child care workers and preschool teachers who would see their wages go up substantially so they d be paid the professional wages they deserve and that would mean a lot of money back into the economy it s about values two cents with the millionaires and billionaires or invest that money in every one of our children and in growing our economy john harwood why do you think that those people believe that they re being vilified believe that you hate business believe that you re not a capitalist watch now elizabeth warren you d have to ask them but i will say this a lot of them just don t

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by kate duguid new york reuters the foreign exchange market held steady on monday with the u s dollar slightly lower in anticipation of further details on the u s china trade agreement the phase one trade deal between washington and beijing has been absolutely completed national economic council director larry kudlow told fox news channel on monday adding that u s exports to china will double under the agreement related stories the deal announced on friday after more than two and a half years of on off negotiations between washington and beijing will reduce some u s tariffs on chinese goods in exchange for increased chinese purchases of u s agricultural manufactured and energy products by some 200 billion over the next two years but although china s trade delegation expressed optimism about the deal some government officials were cautious the deal is a phased achievement and does not mean that the trade dispute is settled once and for all said a reuters source in beijing with knowledge of the situation caution over the future of trade talks pushed the dollar index down 0 15 last at 97 030 the trade sensitive chinese yuan and australian dollar were both off last week s four month peaks fx investors took one look at the semi conclusion of a phase one deal on dec 12 and were overjoyed but came back to the table on dec 13 with the feeling of having more questions than real answers said stephen gallo european head of foreign exchange strategy at bmo capital markets the euro which had spiked on friday to a four month high of 1 1199 against the dollar retraced most of those gains last at 1 1146 nevertheless up modestly over the course of monday s trade the yen a safe haven asset which benefits from market uncertainty reached a two week low on friday it was fractionally stronger on monday to last trade at 109 57 yen per dollar monday s muted moves may be evidence of investor caution of nobody really wanting to take too much of a large position going into the end of the year given the lack of liquidity so you re seeing just some continuation as well as some position squaring said charles tomes portfolio manager at manulife asset management elsewhere sterling remained bolstered by expectations that last week s resounding electoral win for british prime boris johnson s conservative party will end near term brexit uncertainty the pound was last trading at 1 335 0 19 firmer on the day reporting by kate duguid and dhara ranasinghe editing by nick macfie and david gregorio
there are three pieces of good news for the stock market in today s news and one that is not so good but is of longer term concern the three pieces of good news for the stock market pertain to the talks surrounding trade the results of the british parliamentary elections and the near term future of global economic growth the stock market has constantlyâ and consistentlyâ followed the development of trade talks with the market responding positively to signs that trade agreements will be signed and negatively when it appears as if talks are failing last week three agreements were reached particularly one with china and one producing a new nato replacing the old nato and the stock market responded positively the euphoria of the agreements masked some of the weaknesses in the deals cut new historic highs were reached last thursday and friday for all three major us stock indices and more records seem to be on the way for this week secondly boris johnson posted a crushing victory ending all uncertainty about whether or not the british will be leaving the european union whereas the size of the win focused on the fact that the labor party under the leadership of jeremy corbyn was soundly defeated much to the relief of many voters particularly in former areas of labor strength what remains and what was not really examined is the possible harm that brexit might bring to the united kingdom even extending to the breaking up of the common community third toward the end of last week there were signs that economic global economic growth might not be as bad in 2020 as many economists had thought some stronger showing in germany and china was behind some of this pickup in optimism we ll see so the stock market responded positively ira iosebashvili discusses in the new york times that these reductions in uncertainty shifted some investors away from safe haven investments into more growth oriented sectors mr iosebashvili writes investors piled into haven assets earlier this year pushed by worries over a thicket of global issues including ears of a sharp growth slowdown a continuing u s china trade war and uncertainty over the path of brexit i have written many posts over the course of this year about this very movement globally by risk averse investors who transferred assets from highly uncertain situations into areas of the world particularly the united states that were considered to be safe furthermore the federal reserve moved three times this year to lower interest rates to meet the policy changes taking place in other central banks around the world so as to maintain financial stability in u s markets investors seem to have a lot of confidence now about the fed s continued support of the stock market and this helps to underwrite the new historic highs the movement in the market mr iosebashvili highlights is away from dividend paying stocks like utilities and real estate for example this quarter so far the utilities sector is down about 3 percent and the real estate sector is down around 5 percent on the upside we find it stocks up about 11 percent this quarter financials up around 9 percent communications services 6 percent and consumer staples 2 percent these are all good solid sectors once the uncertainty mentioned above is relaxed and in the early stages of tuesday the s p 500 rose about 28 points and is in new historical high territory what is the one cloud hanging over this picture in today s news it is the explosion of government debt daniel kruger and kate davidson in the wall street journal point to the growth of the federal deficit in coming years the federal deficit is projected to average 1 2 trillion a year for the next decade right now investors in the stock market seem to have little or no concerns about how these deficits might impact future stock prices however in terms of today s world mr kruger and ms davidson ask the question about how such massive deficits will impact how the federal reserve operates the thing is the projection they present assumes that there are no economic problems in the near future remember we are in the eleventh year of the current economic recovery federal deficits are usually relatively low toward the end of an economic cycle if there is some kind of economic slowdown in the near future the federal deficit is likely to explode to much higher levels if the fed might face problems in managing interest rates given the current projections what might be the case if the fed has to face an environment in which the deficit swells say to 1 5 trillion or 1 8 trillion per year for the next decade this concern with the deficit is a longer term what if issue and does not seem to be high on the radar screen at the present time it is something however that we can no constantly ignore for now the three positive factors are dominating the news in the words of former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld the current reduction in uncertainty had to do with known unknowns we still have the uncertainty of unknown unknowns to deal with right now uncertainty has declined go with the flow but stay cautious

nebc montney infrastructure in addition pembina expects to place into service an additional 1 1 billion of projects during 2020 in 2020 the pipelines division will benefit from higher revenue volumes on the peace pipeline system from new projects including phase vi nebc montney infrastructure the wapiti lateral as well as increased volumes at existing locations the pipelines division will also benefit in 2020 from the contribution of the cochin pipeline and edmonton terminals acquired as part of the kinder morgan transaction the facilities division is expected to benefit from a full year of operations at duvernay ii and the redwater co generation facility as well as the start up of projects including duvernay sour treatment facilities prince rupert export terminal and empress fractionation 2020 guidance also reflects the contribution from the acquisition of vancouver wharves these factors are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues at select dry gas facilities the outlook for the marketing new ventures division is based on an expectation of lower year over year crude oil marketing revenue and narrower ngl frac spreads driven by lower ngl prices partially offset by pembina s hedging program the company has hedged approximately 50 percent of its 2020 frac spread exposure excluding aux sable with these hedges having been systematically entered into

returns further we continue to execute pembina s strategy within our financial guardrails stated scott burrows pembina s senior vice president and chief financial officer it takes commitment and discipline but pembina and its stakeholders have been rewarded and we intend to maintain our approach moving forward noted mr burrows business update pembina continues to be squarely focused on delivering transportation and midstream services that enable our customers to reach the best possible markets for their products at a competitive cost thus enhancing their netbacks collectively the following developments support the ongoing build out of our integrated value chain and highlight pembina s unique capability to quickly and cost effectively add up to 300 000 barrels per day bpd of incremental peace pipeline system capacity renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential incremental fractionation facilities prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion and ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s liquids pipelines are now connected to all major export facilities and world scale storage facilities in alberta including the 10 million barrels of storage acquired from kinder morgan further through the acquisition of the cochin pipeline pembina has strengthened its capabilities and connectivity within its condensate business in addition pembina s ngl pipeline systems are connected upstream to major pembina and third party gas processing facilities and downstream to all major ngl fractionation and storage facilities in the fort saskatchewan alberta area this connectivity provides our customers with unparalleled flexibility in reaching their desired markets renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts pembina continues to progress the renewal of the legacy peace pipeline phase i and ii contracts a portion of which were previously extended as part of the phase iii expansion pembina is engaged in ongoing discussions with customers and is highly confident that the majority of the remaining contracts nearing maturity will be renewed or their firm capacity resold given the tolls are substantially lower than current posted tolls this will allow us to maintain pembina s current earnings profile while providing exceptional value flexibility and reliability for customers not available elsewhere producer demand for pembina s transportation services across the liquids rich areas of the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb continues to grow since may 2019 pembina has continued to secure firm service commitments on the peace pipeline system while extending many in the process this continues pembina s recent track record of systematically growing and extending the contracted revenue profile of these pipelines in response to customer demand and in lock step with our announced expansions firm volume commitments now will reach approximately 1 1 million bpd in 2022 peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential once the first stage of phase ix is complete pembina will have 1 1 million bpd of market delivery capacity into edmonton alberta across the peace and northern systems and will have completed its objective of achieving segregated liquids transportation service for ethane plus propane plus crude and condensate between gordondale alberta and the edmonton alberta area full product segregation is a significant accomplishment that will drive operational and capital efficiencies strengthen pembina s competitive advantage and ultimately benefit our customers there are numerous advantages associated with product segregation including most notably the avoidance of product batching which increases pipeline utilization minimizes product interface and requires less operational storage finally it also supports potential capacity increases through optimization and more efficient and ultimately cost effective lateral connectivity to the pipeline as well as optimal flexibility in future mainline expansions the elimination of batching and other hydraulic optimization initiatives which pembina refers to as phase x could create up to an incremental 100 000 bpd of capacity with minimal capital spending in addition pembina continues to have the ability through a second stage of the phase ix expansion to add approximately 200 000 of capacity to its pipelines from fox creek alberta to namao alberta through the addition of pump stations on these mainlines land for these additional pump stations has been acquired and all the upstream infrastructure required to access this capacity will be in place with the completion of the peace phase vi ix expansions incremental fractionation facilities with the increasing amount of oil and condensate resource being developed along our pipeline systems and the anticipated startup of lng canada s phase i liquified natural gas project on canada s west coast pembina continues to receive customer requests for incremental fractionation services for associated natural gas liquids increasingly we are observing customer demand for incremental natural gas liquid barrels particularly from the montney play to move westward for export given this shift in wcsb product flows pembina is pursuing multiple developments in parallel both within the existing redwater fractionation complex as well as northeast british columbia nebc which will facilitate this movement and actively respond to producers evolving needs pembina currently has in excess of 1 500 acres at the company s existing redwater fractionation complex and has secured 540 acres in nebc where pembina is evaluating new fractionation facilities based on the design of the rfs ii and iii facilities and associated rail infrastructure the peace pipeline provides location optionality to construct required ngl fractionation facilities in multiple locations to meet customer demand for services and provide maximum diversification to premium ngl markets such as through pembina s prince rupert export terminal and its expansion or through value added upgrading to polypropylene prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion pembina continues to advance construction of its prince rupert lpg export terminal the project is on track to provide customers with export service beginning in the second half of 2020 the anticipated startup of this facility has generated significant interest from our customers and offtakers and pembina is pleased to announce an expansion of this terminal the prince rupert terminal expansion which will increase propane export capacity to approximately 40 000 bpd the prince rupert terminal expansion is expected to cost approximately 175 million and has an anticipated in service date in the first half of 2023 subject to regulatory and environmental approvals the incremental capacity from the expansion will closely match the proposed nebc fractionation facility s propane production and the in service dates of the respective facilities would be closely aligned ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s existing infrastructure ideally positions the company to be a significant supplier of ethane to support the government of alberta s petrochemicals diversification program this program is designed to provide government support and incentives to build facilities that may include a world scale ethane cracker in alberta through the continued expansion and hydraulic optimization of the peace pipeline system expansion and optimization efforts on the alberta ethane gathering system and the current capability of the vantage northern and brazeau systems pembina has concluded it can provide over 100 000 bpd of incremental highly reliable diversified low cost ethane transportation to the edmonton alberta area much of which may be sourced from existing or future pembina facilities this opportunity aligns with our customers needs and the government of alberta s goal to provide a made in alberta petrochemical solution resulting in significant investment and long term employment for thousands of albertans other important initiatives we are pursuing include alliance pipeline expansion pdh pp facility and jordan cove lng project alliance pipeline expansion alliance pipeline alliance continues to pursue an expansion from the bakken play in north dakota to the chicago area commercial discussions with customers are ongoing and alliance believes there is an opportunity for a phased expansion of up to 400 million cubic feet per day with initial commercial support for an initial expansion of up to 100 million cubic feet per day due to current extensive flaring of natural gas in the bakken and increasingly stringent regulations in north dakota restricting such flaring alliance believes it can provide a solution that will benefit customers and result in improved environmental performance pdh pp facility pembina continues to progress its pdh pp facility which is under development through its joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical corporation ckpc ckpc continues execution of the early works activities for the pdh pp facility in alberta s industrial heartland adjacent to pembina sredwater fractionation complex located in sturgeon county alberta ckpc has obtained all environmental and regulatory approvals to construct and operate the pdh pp facility all long lead equipment to support mechanical completion has been ordered and we are progressing as expected with multiple parties to secure lump sum engineering and construction agreements with an objective of locking down two thirds of the project cost jordan cove lng project on november 15 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc released the final environmental impact statement feis and recommended approval of the jordan cove lng terminal and pacific gas connector pipeline the feis is the result of ferc s comprehensive review process that began in september 2017 and includes complete and comprehensive environmental safety and security reviews developed with input from federal and state agencies tribes and many other stakeholders the feis issued by ferc represents the final step in the ferc environmental review process before an order is issued by the commission approving the project pembina looks forward to receiving our final certificate from ferc on february 13 2020 engagement with the oregon state regulatory authority continues state permits remain a critical component of the regulatory process for jordan cove and are

beirut a devastating war relentless sanctions a gutted economy under siege all these have ground the syrian pound down to a tenth of its value since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011 but it s the anti government protests in neighboring lebanon that may deliver the finishing blow to the pound this week it nose dived to its lowest level against the u s dollar since it began trading in 1919 threatening the collapse of syrian president bashar assad s government even as he and his allies have largely won the almost nine year civil war the pound had traded at 47 to the dollar before the war by the end of last year it had reached 500 it now hovers around 765 with much of the loss occurring in the last two months put another way 100 syrian pounds were worth about 2 in 2011 that same currency would be worth about 13 cents now the result has been grocery prices that change almost always upward with every passing day many syrians have been forced to take on two or three jobs to keep food on their tables shortages of staples and essential products such as medicines rice and flour are expected to hit soon the pound s latest downturn analysts say comes from the financial contretemps hitting lebanon in mid october more than a quarter of the country s 4 million people swarmed the streets to protest decades of colossal mismanagement by their leaders lebanese banks fearing a run on currency shuttered their doors weeks later they ve reopened but with tight limits spending on goods outside lebanon is capped at 150 per month and dollar transactions in the country are largely restricted advertising the measures have left millions of depositors stranded among them syrians who have used lebanon to circumvent far ranging u s and european union sanctions on the government of assad as well as those of his allies in iran and hezbollah the lebanese shiite paramilitary group and political party with the syrian central bank under sanctions along with much of the state s businesses many importers used lebanon s banking system as a conduit for their trade what does a syrian merchant who wants those dollars now do he gets some from the black market here and some in the black market in syria said jihad yazigi founder and editor of the syrian report a weekly economic digest in a phone interview on tuesday that s putting pressure on the syrian pound and the decline of both currencies go together the restrictions have also prevented syrians from repatriating funds much of them remittances from lebanese banks back to syria according to the syrian law journal an online publication covering the country s legal and economic issues there is no full accounting of the size of syrian deposits in lebanon s banks but estimates put them at some 30 billion almost a fifth of all deposits in the country advertising for months officials have blamed the pound s performance on the sanctions that have all but choked off syria s economy part of what the country s central bank governor said in an interview with state media in june was a systematic campaign to undermine the syrian pound and push people to abandon their national currency but the dismal conditions have emboldened domestic critics even in the country s usually docile parliament to excoriate the government for its lackluster response even as they call for a wide scale crackdown on corruption benefiting those they describe as parasites and cronies close to the ruling class is it reasonable for syrians to go to fortune tellers so they know where the exchange rate is heading said a member of parliament alan bakr in a contentious legislative session on monday according to a report from the pro government al watan daily he added the government had no initiatives and no vision to present to syrian citizens who had been patient during the war that patience has been sorely tested the civil war which has killed an estimated 500 000 people official tallies have long been suspended and left millions as refugees has also ravaged industrial powerhouses around aleppo and damascus it has left an economy with a gdp a third of the size it was in 2010 assad and his russian allies have declared the war to be essentially over with the government as the victor but victory hasn t ushered in a long promised reconstruction bonanza and a windfall from reopening trade routes with countries in the region hasn t materialized meanwhile some 90 of the country is under the poverty line according to the syrian center for policy research with money buying fewer goods every day and the government unable to manage structural reforms it s unclear how long authorities can contain the discontent advertising the conflict has also left the state starved for dollars to accommodate a rising need for imports its main sources of hard currency were tourism now virtually nonexistent and oil which is now controlled by the u s the trade deficit said the observatory of economic complexity an economic data organization has ballooned to 3 8 billion in the past the central bank had countered successive devaluations of the pound by selling dollars to local money changers at the official rate of 435 but it no longer has enough dollars for such interventions yazigi said syria s foreign currency reserves have dwindled to a scant 200 million according to estimates while oil exports and a credit line from iran have also tumbled one attempt to stave off growing discontent was a 20 000 pound increase in monthly state salaries roughly 27 the largest salary hike in the country s history announced by assad earlier this month the government has chased after black market money exchangers as well as traders for price gouging even as it has moved to restrict imports and reduce the money available for outside transactions the syrian law journal reported but the currency s plunge has hurt local producers as well most rely on materials imported from abroad for their products meanwhile the prices of basic goods including medicines are often set by the government meaning they re often sold at a loss when i sell in syrian pounds i m making a profit but to get any of the primary materials i need for production which i pay for in dollars it s a problem said ziad oubari an owner of a pharmaceutical company in a phone interview tuesday he added that if the situation didn t change he and others would have to reduce the variety of medicines they offered it s gotten to the point where you almost don t want the customer to buy something because its price is so much lower than the cost he said 2019

amid worries over slowing global economic growth central banks in the east african community eac are adopting monetary easing policies similar to their counterparts around the world reports show apex banks in the region have been lowering interest rates and cash reserve ratios crr as they try to stimulate economic growth through increased spending and private investment the bank of uganda bou last week decided to keep it s central bank rate cbr at 9 percent on the basis that there are likely to be headwinds to economic growth this is due to persistent global geopolitical tensions uncertainty around trade policies and weakening investment spending in the domestic private sector in november kenya s central bank lowered its cbr from 9 percent to 8 5 percent the move was aimed at unlocking credit to the private sector after the economy slowed down during the second quarter it grew at a rate of 5 6 percent as against 6 4 percent growth in the same period in 2018 meanwhile rwanda s monetary policy committee mpc in august decided to retain the benchmark lending rate at 5 percent with a similar objective of enhancing credit to the private sector in addition the bank of tanzania bot in june slashed its crr the proportion of deposits that banks are required to hold with the regulator as reserves from 8 percent to 7 percent with a view to increase the amount of money that banks can lend to the private sector and thus stimulate economic growth according to world bank projections average gross domestic product growth in eac countries is expected to decline to 5 9 percent this year from 6 percent last year based on the turbulent conditions in global markets experts say the rapid deterioration in global conditions is a huge risk to eac s economic growth prospects leading to a significant shift in policy by central banks and mpcs i believe it is because of the concerns about the global economic slowdown attributed to factors such as trade wars tax and legal leader at deloitte east africa fred omondi told the eastafrican the monetary policy committees mpc hope that the reduced rates will spur better economic growth but it is not just the region s central banks using monetary easing to support the economy the trend is a global one interest rates in major economies have been reduced in recent months as officials try to manage the risks that come with tariff actions in the trade war between the united states and china britain s exit from the european union eu and several other geopolitical issues the u s federal reserve in october slashed interest rates for the third time in four months a move meant to boost the economy which grew by just 1 9 percent in the third quarter of 2019 this came on the back of earlier cuts in lending rates by the european central bank ecb and its counterpart in turkey although targeted at stimulating the economy increasing the money supply by lowering interest rates sometimes comes with adverse effects such as inflation which is already an issue across east africa there are also concerns the current uncertainties may result in increased volatility in the global financial markets even though central banks in major advanced economies have adopted monetary policies to support growth forecasts estimate global growth will be lower at 3 2 percent for 2019 and 3 5 percent for 2020 a 0 1 percentage point downward revision from april 2019 forecasts meanwhile it remains to be seen if the measures by eac banks are enough to spur spending and boost economic growth in the region
source xinhua 2019 12 16 16 22 47 editor xuxin video player close by nguon sovan mao pengfei phnom penh dec 16 xinhua cambodia s economy remains robust this year despite concerns over the possible loss of everything but arms eba trade scheme with the european union officials and analysts said the eu started in february the 18 month process that could lead to the temporary suspension of cambodia s duty free trading access to the eu market under the eba scheme due to concerns over human rights and labor rights if suspended it is predicted the kingdom s growth could slow down in a short term the southeast asian country s economy is traditionally driven by garment and footwear exports mainly to the eu market tourism construction and agriculture robust growth expected this year economy and finance minister aun pornmoniroth said cambodia would be able to achieve the growth of 7 1 percent in 2019 making the gdp gross domestic product value increase to 26 8 billion u s dollars industrial sector mainly garment and construction is expected to grow by 10 7 percent this year as service sector tourism transport and telecom trade and real estate and agriculture are projected to increase by 6 7 percent and 1 6 percent respectively he told the parliament during a 2020 budget law debate in late november inflation is predicted to rise slightly to 2 8 percent this year from 2 5 percent last year he said pornmoniroth who is also the deputy prime minister said the gdp per capita is estimated to hit 1 679 dollars this year up 8 4 percent from 1 548 dollars last year mey kalyan a senior advisor to the supreme national economic council said the economic situation has been quite stable and rather robust this year although there were many negative elements such as the overall downward trend of global trade uncertainties of eba and the threat of the return of self exiled former opposition leader sam rainsy on the independence day nov 9 to create instabilities in channy chairman of the association of banks in cambodia agreed that the economy this year is quite good based on the healthy growth in the banking sector the economy and the banking industry complement each other this year the banking industry has grown well so has the economy he said channy who is also president of the acleda bank said foreign investors confidence particularly the chinese ones in cambodia s political stability and macroeconomic stability remained strong possible loss of eba could dampen growth prospect the eu is expected to decide on whether to withdraw the trade privilege from cambodia or not in february next year kalyan said if the eba is stripped it will have negative impacts on the economy in particular in the poor segment of the society it is our hope that this would not happen but this is beyond our control although i was informed that our government and eu have been working hard to resolve issues he said what we can do here is prepare policy measures to mitigate negative impacts should the worse situation arises as a least developed country cambodia has for decades enjoyed exports of all products except arms and ammunition to the eu markets with duty free the country s export to eu was valued at 5 86 billion dollars in 2018 about 95 percent of which entered the eu duty free taking advantage of eba preferences according to an eu data adding that garment and footwear products accounted for around three quarters of eu imports from the kingdom the garment and footwear industry is cambodia s biggest export sector employing about 750 000 people in some 1 100 factories the world bank said in a report released late last month that a possible withdrawal of the eba could substantially dampen cambodia s growth prospect if stripped tariffs on garment footwear and bicycle products to the eu market will increase 12 percent 16 percent and 10 percent respectively the report said the government in march announced a number of measures including lowering logistics and production costs cutting red tape and supporting businesses with a six day reduction in the number of public holidays to support local manufacturers and exporters in case the eu withdrew the eba from the kingdom cambodian prime minister samdech techo hun sen has said the measures had helped reduce operating costs for producers and exporters by about 400 million dollars per year he said losing the eba was just a matter of time because as cambodia s economic strength grows probably in 2025 or 2026 it will no longer be eligible under the eu s requirements now they eu have threatened us by asking us to do this and do that but we have responded that we cannot exchange our sovereignty for their aid or trade preferences he said last month channy said the possible loss of eba would have a short term impact on the country s growth prospect but he said the government had well prepared to cope with it we cannot rely on only one market i ve observed that the government has been working actively to open markets in other regions besides the eu and the united states he said it s vital to stand on our own feet rather than depending on the trade preferences if we rely on them they eu will threaten us all the time he said chheang vannarith president of the asian vision institute said cambodia s economy is quite resilient as it is embracing robust institutional reforms and diversification strategy the eu will not likely target textile industry given it will affect poverty reduction in cambodia and the progress towards the realization of the sustainable development goals 2030 he said growth predicted for 2020 still strong the growth is projected at 6 5 percent next year making the gdp value rise to 29 4 billion dollars said pornmoniroth adding that the gdp per capital is forecast to reach 1 816 dollars he said industrial sector is expected to grow by 8 9 percent service sector by 6 4 percent and agriculture by 1 7 percent kalyan who is also the chairman of the cambodia development resource institute said it is forecast that the economy will remain robust in the short to medium term cambodia needs to continue investing further in human resources technology infrastructure improving our climate for investment modernizing our agriculture and preserving our environment he said vannarith said to ensure a long term robust growth cambodia needs to keep reforming reducing production cost enhancing productivity and production capacity and expanding export markets reaching fta free trade agreement with china and other key asian economies will help cambodia to expand its export markets as well as attract foreign direct investment he said

25 3 55 billion 2020 guidance reflects the closing of the kinder morgan transaction the 440 million of new projects recently placed into service including duvernay ii wapiti condensate lateral and nebc montney infrastructure in addition pembina expects to place into service an additional 1 1 billion of projects during 2020 in 2020 the pipelines division will benefit from higher revenue volumes on the peace pipeline system from new projects including phase vi nebc montney infrastructure the wapiti lateral as well as increased volumes at existing locations the pipelines division will also benefit in 2020 from the contribution of the cochin pipeline and edmonton terminals acquired as part of the kinder morgan transaction the facilities division is expected to benefit from a full year of operations at duvernay ii and the redwater co generation facility as well as the start up of projects including duvernay sour treatment facilities prince rupert export terminal and empress fractionation 2020 guidance also reflects the contribution from the acquisition of vancouver wharves these factors are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues at select dry gas facilities the outlook for the marketing new ventures division is based on an expectation of lower year over year crude oil marketing revenue and narrower ngl frac spreads driven by lower ngl prices partially offset by pembina s hedging program the company has hedged approximately 50 percent of its 2020 frac spread exposure excluding aux sable with these hedges having been systematically entered into

investments advances to related parties relate to funding previously announced projects within our joint venture entities the majority of which relate to the integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility one of our highest priorities is prudent and disciplined capital allocation we invest in strong franchises with significant contractual underpinning and good counterparties all ingredients to delivering consistent industry leading returns further we continue to execute pembina s strategy within our financial guardrails stated scott burrows pembina s senior vice president and chief financial officer it takes commitment and discipline but pembina and its stakeholders have been rewarded and we intend to maintain our approach moving forward noted mr burrows business update pembina continues to be squarely focused on delivering transportation and midstream services that enable our customers to reach the best possible markets for their products at a competitive cost thus enhancing their netbacks collectively the following developments support the ongoing build out of our integrated value chain and highlight pembina s unique capability to quickly and cost effectively add up to 300 000 barrels per day bpd of incremental peace pipeline system capacity renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential incremental fractionation facilities prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion and ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s liquids pipelines are now connected to all major export facilities and world scale storage facilities in alberta including the 10 million barrels of storage acquired from kinder morgan further through the acquisition of the cochin pipeline pembina has strengthened its capabilities and connectivity within its condensate business in addition pembina s ngl pipeline systems are connected upstream to major pembina and third party gas processing facilities and downstream to all major ngl fractionation and storage facilities in the fort saskatchewan alberta area this connectivity provides our customers with unparalleled flexibility in reaching their desired markets renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts pembina continues to progress the renewal of the legacy peace pipeline phase i and ii contracts a portion of which were previously extended as part of the phase iii expansion pembina is engaged in ongoing discussions with customers and is highly confident that the majority of the remaining contracts nearing maturity will be renewed or their firm capacity resold given the tolls are substantially lower than current posted tolls this will allow us to maintain pembina s current earnings profile while providing exceptional value flexibility and reliability for customers not available elsewhere producer demand for pembina s transportation services across the liquids rich areas of the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb continues to grow since may 2019 pembina has continued to secure firm service commitments on the peace pipeline system while extending many in the process this continues pembina s recent track record of systematically growing and extending the contracted revenue profile of these pipelines in response to customer demand and in lock step with our announced expansions firm volume commitments now will reach approximately 1 1 million bpd in 2022 peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential once the first stage of phase ix is complete pembina will have 1 1 million bpd of market delivery capacity into edmonton alberta across the peace and northern systems and will have completed its objective of achieving segregated liquids transportation service for ethane plus propane plus crude and condensate between gordondale alberta and the edmonton alberta area full product segregation is a significant accomplishment that will drive operational and capital efficiencies strengthen pembina s competitive advantage and ultimately benefit our customers there are numerous advantages associated with product segregation including most notably the avoidance of product batching which increases pipeline utilization minimizes product interface and requires less operational storage finally it also supports potential capacity increases through optimization and more efficient and ultimately cost effective lateral connectivity to the pipeline as well as optimal flexibility in future mainline expansions the elimination of batching and other hydraulic optimization initiatives which pembina refers to as phase x could create up to an incremental 100 000 bpd of capacity with minimal capital spending in addition pembina continues to have the ability through a second stage of the phase ix expansion to add approximately 200 000 of capacity to its pipelines from fox creek alberta to namao alberta through the addition of pump stations on these mainlines land for these additional pump stations has been acquired and all the upstream infrastructure required to access this capacity will be in place with the completion of the peace phase vi ix expansions incremental fractionation facilities with the increasing amount of oil and condensate resource being developed along our pipeline systems and the anticipated startup of lng canada s phase i liquified natural gas project on canada s west coast pembina continues to receive customer requests for incremental fractionation services for associated natural gas liquids increasingly we are observing customer demand for incremental natural gas liquid barrels particularly from the montney play to move westward for export given this shift in wcsb product flows pembina is pursuing multiple developments in parallel both within the existing redwater fractionation complex as well as northeast british columbia nebc which will facilitate this movement and actively respond to producers evolving needs pembina currently has in excess of 1 500 acres at the company s existing redwater fractionation complex and has secured 540 acres in nebc where pembina is evaluating new fractionation facilities based on the design of the rfs ii and iii facilities and associated rail infrastructure the peace pipeline provides location optionality to construct required ngl fractionation facilities in multiple locations to meet customer demand for services and provide maximum diversification to premium ngl markets such as through pembina s prince rupert export terminal and its expansion or through value added upgrading to polypropylene prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion pembina continues to advance construction of its prince rupert lpg export terminal the project is on track to provide customers with export service beginning in the second half of 2020 the anticipated startup of this facility has generated significant interest from our customers and offtakers and pembina is pleased to announce an expansion of this terminal the prince rupert terminal expansion which will increase propane export capacity to approximately 40 000 bpd the prince rupert terminal expansion is expected to cost approximately 175 million and has an anticipated in service date in the first half of 2023 subject to regulatory and environmental approvals the incremental capacity from the expansion will closely match the proposed nebc fractionation facility s propane production and the in service dates of the respective facilities would be closely aligned ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s existing infrastructure ideally positions the company to be a significant supplier of ethane to support the government of alberta s petrochemicals diversification program this program is designed to provide government support and incentives to build facilities that may include a world scale ethane cracker in alberta through the continued expansion and hydraulic optimization of the peace pipeline system expansion and optimization efforts on the alberta ethane gathering system and the current capability of the vantage northern and brazeau systems pembina has concluded it can provide over 100 000 bpd of incremental highly reliable diversified low cost ethane transportation to the edmonton alberta area much of which may be sourced from existing or future pembina facilities this opportunity aligns with our customers needs and the government of alberta s goal to provide a made in alberta petrochemical solution resulting in significant investment and long term employment for thousands of albertans other important initiatives we are pursuing include alliance pipeline expansion pdh pp facility and jordan cove lng project alliance pipeline expansion alliance pipeline alliance continues to pursue an expansion from the bakken play in north dakota to the chicago area commercial discussions with customers are ongoing and alliance believes there is an opportunity for a phased expansion of up to 400 million cubic feet per day with initial commercial support for an initial expansion of up to 100 million cubic feet per day due to current extensive flaring of natural gas in the bakken and increasingly stringent regulations in north dakota restricting such flaring alliance believes it can provide a solution that will benefit customers and result in improved environmental performance pdh pp facility pembina continues to progress its pdh pp facility which is under development through its joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical corporation ckpc ckpc continues execution of the early works activities for the pdh pp facility in alberta s industrial heartland adjacent to pembina s redwater fractionation complex located in sturgeon county alberta ckpc has obtained all environmental and regulatory approvals to construct and operate the pdh pp facility all long lead equipment to support mechanical completion has been ordered and we are progressing as expected with multiple parties to secure lump sum engineering and construction agreements with an objective of locking down two thirds of the project cost jordan cove lng project on november 15 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc released the final environmental impact statement feis and recommended approval of the jordan cove lng terminal and pacific gas connector pipeline the feis is the result of ferc s comprehensive review process that began in september 2017 and includes complete and comprehensive environmental safety and security reviews developed with input from federal and state agencies tribes and many other stakeholders the feis issued by ferc represents the final step in the ferc environmental review process before an order is issued by the commission approving the project pembina looks forward to receiving our final certificate from ferc on february 13 2020 engagement with the oregon state regulatory authority continues

bank of canada governor stephen poloz s 1982 ph d thesis the demand for money in a multicurrency world generated three separate journal articles an uncommon achievement that helped him win a job at the central bank straight out of university poloz is wrapping up his professional career the way it began related stories the governor who will retire when his term ends in june has been spending considerable time at a keyboard churning out an uncommon amount of academic analysis for someone whose day job comes with a full daily calendar last month poloz published a paper that argues that the embrace of artificial intelligence ai is leading a so far undetectable productivity boom this week he supplemented that idea with a second paper that will hopefully be passed around in ottawa the provincial capitals and as many c suites as possible in the weeks and months ahead we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us stephen poloz the new paper is based on remarks he made in september at the annual spruce meadows changing fortunes roundtable a discrete gathering of carefully selected members of the global elite in calgary poloz imagines where canada could end up years from now as digital technology protectionist politics and unprecedented levels of debt converge to generate forces that will be unfamiliar to executives investors and policy makers the point of the exercise is to suggest that the future should turn out fine if different provided we don t get hung up on what barack obama might call stupid shit along the way this topic reflects my concern that we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us poloz wrote in the new paper by exercising the muscles of understanding alternative projections we can build the ability to adapt to whatever comes our way poloz reckons executives and investors should prepare an extended period of suboptimal policy he told reporters after a speech in toronto this week that the actual finalization and the ratification of the new north american free trade agreement is crucial for restoring business confidence and investment the backing of the democratic majority in the u s house of representatives and the subsequent signing of an updated agreement this week was positive but the process chilled investment for the better part of two years and unlike most trade agreements from the postwar era the new nafta restricts trade instead of making it broadly freer if this is the template for dealing with the world s largest economy then it s reasonable to predict that the growth rates to which we had accustomed during the most recent phase of globalization will no longer be possible therefore expectations should adjust accordingly as some growth is better than none at all by way of example poloz mentioned hurdle rates the return on an investment that executives require to justify the risk of deploying precious capital companies that are still working with hurdle rates from 10 years ago will find fewer investment opportunities that exceed those rates poloz wrote the implication is that companies need to adjust hurdle rates downward to reflect the new reality and then seek ways to manage elevated risk besides if they don t lower investment spending means slower economic growth now and it means that the economic potential of our economies will grow more slowly over the long term as well poloz has bought into the notion that we are in the early stages of an industrial revolution akin to the eras created by the steam engine electrification and the computer chip it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern the previous three industrial revolutions ended in misery as euphoria over the possibilities fuelled asset price bubbles that brought calamity when they burst but canada s central bank governor is a techno optimist even if some professions vanish overall employment always trends higher he also observes that policy makers have been getting better at managing the economy the third industrial revolution computer chips ended with the great recession a terrible outcome and yet an improvement on the depression of the 1930s poloz said central banks and others have studied the mistakes of the past few decades and have adjusted their approaches accordingly that doesn t mean there will never be another big recession but it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern if canada s economy crashes in the near future it probably won t be because the central bank raised interest rates too high too fast if policy mistakes were the trigger for previous recessions and policy makers have learned how to limit such mistakes then it s conceivable the current expansion could extend longer than those that have come before in poloz s previous paper he said the productivity gains from ai should allow central banks to leave interest rates relatively low for longer because inflation will remain contained that would help cushion the bumpy transition to a new economy in other words if canada s economy crashes in the near future it probably won t be because the central bank raised interest rates too high too fast a more likely cause would be debt at almost 180 per cent of disposable income canada s household debt will be a vulnerability for a long time arguably for a generation or at least until mom and dad leave behind their real estate and savings to help millennials pay off their debts poloz said the burden is manageable as servicing costs are reasonably low still the weight of it could cause voters and their elected representatives to seek ways to lighten the load poloz warned that a renewed tolerance for inflation could emerge something for which markets appear ill prepared we should at least consider the possibility of a confluence of incentives between indebted households and indebted governments to tolerate another inflationary episode like that of the late 1970s and 1980s poloz said financial markets appear to be attaching very low weight to this risk today poloz stressed that he could be wrong about where the arc of history is headed but his thinking makes for a good frame for bank of canada policy canadian policy makers surprised many on bay street by leaving interest rates unchanged this year as almost every other central bank cut one reason for the disconnect appears to be that the central bank is taking inflation more seriously than investors and yet poloz has sent a clear signal that he s comfortable letting the economy run a little hotter than rules designed for a pre revolutionary economy might allow in a way he s showing us we needn t fear the future call it a parting gift email twitter carmichaelkevin copyright postmedia network inc 2019

25 3 55 billion 2020 guidance reflects the closing of the kinder morgan transaction the 440 million of new projects recently placed into service including duvernay ii wapiti condensate lateral and nebc montney infrastructure in addition pembina expects to place into service an additional 1 1 billion of projects during 2020 in 2020 the pipelines division will benefit from higher revenue volumes on the peace pipeline system from new projects including phase vi nebc montney infrastructure the wapiti lateral as well as increased volumes at existing locations the pipelines division will also benefit in 2020 from the contribution of the cochin pipeline and edmonton terminals acquired as part of the kinder morgan transaction the facilities division is expected to benefit from a full year of operations at duvernay ii and the redwater co generation facility as well as the start up of projects including duvernay sour treatment facilities prince rupert export terminal and empress fractionation 2020 guidance also reflects the contribution from the acquisition of vancouver wharves these factors are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues at select dry gas facilities the outlook for the marketing new ventures division is based on an expectation of lower year over year crude oil marketing revenue and narrower ngl frac spreads driven by lower ngl prices partially offset by pembina s hedging program the company has hedged approximately 50 percent of its 2020 frac spread exposure excluding aux sable with these hedges having been systematically entered into

investments advances to related parties relate to funding previously announced projects within our joint venture entities the majority of which relate to the integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility one of our highest priorities is prudent and disciplined capital allocation we invest in strong franchises with significant contractual underpinning and good counterparties all ingredients to delivering consistent industry leading returns further we continue to execute pembina s strategy within our financial guardrails stated scott burrows pembina s senior vice president and chief financial officer it takes commitment and discipline but pembina and its stakeholders have been rewarded and we intend to maintain our approach moving forward noted mr burrows business update pembina continues to be squarely focused on delivering transportation and midstream services that enable our customers to reach the best possible markets for their products at a competitive cost thus enhancing their netbacks collectively the following developments support the ongoing build out of our integrated value chain and highlight pembina s unique capability to quickly and cost effectively add up to 300 000 barrels per day bpd of incremental peace pipeline system capacity renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential incremental fractionation facilities prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion and ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s liquids pipelines are now connected to all major export facilities and world scale storage facilities in alberta including the 10 million barrels of storage acquired from kinder morgan further through the acquisition of the cochin pipeline pembina has strengthened its capabilities and connectivity within its condensate business in addition pembina s ngl pipeline systems are connected upstream to major pembina and third party gas processing facilities and downstream to all major ngl fractionation and storage facilities in the fort saskatchewan alberta area this connectivity provides our customers with unparalleled flexibility in reaching their desired markets renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts pembina continues to progress the renewal of the legacy peace pipeline phase i and ii contracts a portion of which were previously extended as part of the phase iii expansion pembina is engaged in ongoing discussions with customers and is highly confident that the majority of the remaining contracts nearing maturity will be renewed or their firm capacity resold given the tolls are substantially lower than current posted tolls this will allow us to maintain pembina s current earnings profile while providing exceptional value flexibility and reliability for customers not available elsewhere producer demand for pembina s transportation services across the liquids rich areas of the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb continues to grow since may 2019 pembina has continued to secure firm service commitments on the peace pipeline system while extending many in the process this continues pembina s recent track record of systematically growing and extending the contracted revenue profile of these pipelines in response to customer demand and in lock step with our announced expansions firm volume commitments now will reach approximately 1 1 million bpd in 2022 peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential once the first stage of phase ix is complete pembina will have 1 1 million bpd of market delivery capacity into edmonton alberta across the peace and northern systems and will have completed its objective of achieving segregated liquids transportation service for ethane plus propane plus crude and condensate between gordondale alberta and the edmonton alberta area full product segregation is a significant accomplishment that will drive operational and capital efficiencies strengthen pembina s competitive advantage and ultimately benefit our customers there are numerous advantages associated with product segregation including most notably the avoidance of product batching which increases pipeline utilization minimizes product interface and requires less operational storage finally it also supports potential capacity increases through optimization and more efficient and ultimately cost effective lateral connectivity to the pipeline as well as optimal flexibility in future mainline expansions the elimination of batching and other hydraulic optimization initiatives which pembina refers to as phase x could create up to an incremental 100 000 bpd of capacity with minimal capital spending in addition pembina continues to have the ability through a second stage of the phase ix expansion to add approximately 200 000 of capacity to its pipelines from fox creek alberta to namao alberta through the addition of pump stations on these mainlines land for these additional pump stations has been acquired and all the upstream infrastructure required to access this capacity will be in place with the completion of the peace phase vi ix expansions incremental fractionation facilities with the increasing amount of oil and condensate resource being developed along our pipeline systems and the anticipated startup of lng canada s phase i liquified natural gas project on canada s west coast pembina continues to receive customer requests for incremental fractionation services for associated natural gas liquids increasingly we are observing customer demand for incremental natural gas liquid barrels particularly from the montney play to move westward for export given this shift in wcsb product flows pembina is pursuing multiple developments in parallel both within the existing redwater fractionation complex as well as northeast british columbia nebc which will facilitate this movement and actively respond to producers evolving needs pembina currently has in excess of 1 500 acres at the company s existing redwater fractionation complex and has secured 540 acres in nebc where pembina is evaluating new fractionation facilities based on the design of the rfs ii and iii facilities and associated rail infrastructure the peace pipeline provides location optionality to construct required ngl fractionation facilities in multiple locations to meet customer demand for services and provide maximum diversification to premium ngl markets such as through pembina s prince rupert export terminal and its expansion or through value added upgrading to polypropylene prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion pembina continues to advance construction of its prince rupert lpg export terminal the project is on track to provide customers with export service beginning in the second half of 2020 the anticipated startup of this facility has generated significant interest from our customers and offtakers and pembina is pleased to announce an expansion of this terminal the prince rupert terminal expansion which will increase propane export capacity to approximately 40 000 bpd the prince rupert terminal expansion is expected to cost approximately 175 million and has an anticipated in service date in the first half of 2023 subject to regulatory and environmental approvals the incremental capacity from the expansion will closely match the proposed nebc fractionation facility s propane production and the in service dates of the respective facilities would be closely aligned ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s existing infrastructure ideally positions the company to be a significant supplier of ethane to support the government of alberta s petrochemicals diversification program this program is designed to provide government support and incentives to build facilities that may include a world scale ethane cracker in alberta through the continued expansion and hydraulic optimization of the peace pipeline system expansion and optimization efforts on the alberta ethane gathering system and the current capability of the vantage northern and brazeau systems pembina has concluded it can provide over 100 000 bpd of incremental highly reliable diversified low cost ethane transportation to the edmonton alberta area much of which may be sourced from existing or future pembina facilities this opportunity aligns with our customers needs and the government of alberta s goal to provide a made in alberta petrochemical solution resulting in significant investment and long term employment for thousands of albertans other important initiatives we are pursuing include alliance pipeline expansion pdh pp facility and jordan cove lng project alliance pipeline expansion alliance pipeline alliance continues to pursue an expansion from the bakken play in north dakota to the chicago area commercial discussions with customers are ongoing and alliance believes there is an opportunity for a phased expansion of up to 400 million cubic feet per day with initial commercial support for an initial expansion of up to 100 million cubic feet per day due to current extensive flaring of natural gas in the bakken and increasingly stringent regulations in north dakota restricting such flaring alliance believes it can provide a solution that will benefit customers and result in improved environmental performance pdh pp facility pembina continues to progress its pdh pp facility which is under development through its joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical corporation ckpc ckpc continues execution of the early works activities for the pdh pp facility in alberta s industrial heartland adjacent to pembina s redwater fractionation complex located in sturgeon county alberta ckpc has obtained all environmental and regulatory approvals to construct and operate the pdh pp facility all long lead equipment to support mechanical completion has been ordered and we are progressing as expected with multiple parties to secure lump sum engineering and construction agreements with an objective of locking down two thirds of the project cost jordan cove lng project on november 15 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc released the final environmental impact statement feis and recommended approval of the jordan cove lng terminal and pacific gas connector pipeline the feis is the result of ferc s comprehensive review process that began in september 2017 and includes complete and comprehensive environmental safety and security reviews developed with input from federal and state agencies tribes and many other stakeholders the feis issued by ferc represents the final step in the ferc environmental review process before an order is issued by the commission approving the project pembina looks forward to receiving our final certificate from ferc on february 13 2020 engagement with the oregon state regulatory authority continues

on november 14th the canadian group wellington water watchers organized the all eyes on nestlé conference in the city of guelph ontario bringing together indigenous peoples and citizens movements fighting nestlé s water takings from canada the us france and brazil following this public event the representatives of the organizations involved met for a workshop to exchange information and discuss possible common strategies of resistance to this giant corporation water grabbing from the experiences and stories shared by groups as different as the collectif eau 88 from the city of vittel france save our water from elora canada or the michigan citizens for water conservation from the us it became clear that there is a common pattern in all these places where nestlé takes water for its bottling facilities contrary to this companies claim that any problem is always just a local issue this common pattern shows for instance that the amounts of water taken for which nestlé pays close to nothing usually causes groundwater levels to sink affects ecosystems and endangers the water supply of the local citizens in vittel for instance nestlé and the community take water from the same aquifer and french state institutions recognized that this situation put at risk the aquifer since the water takings went faster than its natural replenishing the solution proposed by the french authorities to build a pipeline of about 14 km to bring water from another place for the inhabitants of vittel so that nestlé could continue undisturbed its business pumping the groundwater from vittel thanks to the resistance of the collectif eau 88 the pipeline project was politically defeated and another solution has to be found to protect the aquifer but if it were not for this citizens movement the pipeline project would have been built with tax payers money in wellington county nestlé waters canada has permission to extract 4 7 million litres of water a day in wells at hillsburgh and aberfoyle and according to mike balkwill from wellington water watchers the company has applied to renew those permits while it extracts water without the consent of six nations on whose territory it operates and despite public opposition from several indigenous organizations and again thanks to the resistance of both six nations and other citizens movements the moratorium on water permits that would end on next january 1st was recently extended by the authorities to october 2020 the situation is the same in florida where although the local water authority considers that the water system is in recovery from overexploitation nestlé still wants to pump water from ginnie springs the common pattern emerging from these and other cases in the state of michigan or in the small city of são lourenço in brazil also shows that it is always local groups that defend water not the state s water or environmental authorities on the contrary another pattern that repeats itself in most of the cases governments very often side with the corporation against the citizens even worse in many places nestlé merges with the local authorities as in maine where a nestlé manager was on the state s environmental protection agency board or in vittel where a deputy mayor was sued for a conflict of interest concerning the pipeline project this deputy departmental councillor claudie pruvost was married to a nestlé executive from vittel president of an association that had been chosen to bring the water development and management project to the local water commission that mrs pruvost chaired the trial was delayed because the case had to be moved from the court in the city of epinal the closest to vittel to the city of nancy because the vice president of the court in epinal was also married to the director of nestlé waters in vittel nestlé always tries to establish alliances or partnerships with governments to protect itself and its bottling operations especially in its home country switzerland where its image has to be more carefully protected recently the ex nestlé s head of public affairs christian frutiger was appointed vice director of the swiss agency for development and cooperation sdc the swiss government agency responsible for development aid programmes where he will be responsible for sdc s global water program the ecological damage caused by nestlé s water takings and bottling facilities are not locally limited either pet water bottles are one of the main sources of plastic waste worldwide one single example suffices to give an idea of the contribution of nestlé to this problem according to wellington water watchers if the government approves nestlé s permits to take water from commercial bottling in wellington county the company will produce more than 3 billion 500 ml of plastic bottles per year laid end to end that number would circle the earth 16 times and this amount of plastic comes just from two sites in wellington county nestlé has dozens of such bottling facilities all over the world using huge amounts of fossil fuels to produce more billions of plastic bottles if we add to that all the fuel consumed to transport all these bottles mainly by truck we can also see the significant impact of nestlé on climate change such patterns are intrinsic to nestlé s bottling operations worldwide and to the economic and political power of this giant multinational corporation countries such as canada the us or france are among the wealthiest and most traditional democratic societies in our planet and still their citizens have to fight very hard and for very long just to achieve some minimum level of protection of ground and surface waters ecosystems and for their access to water in the future things that in a democracy we would take for granted as an obligation of the state but if nestlé can manage to have governments on its side and against the citizens even in such traditional democracies as the us canada and france what then may happen to communities facing nestlé s water grabbing in much less democratic and much more vulnerable societies in africa latin america or asia in our time multinational corporations became the main source of economic and political power as explained by paul a baran and paul m sweezy in their classic work monopoly capital votes are the nominal source of political power and money is the real source the system in other words is democratic in form and plutocratic in content suffice it to say that all the political activities and functions which may be said to constitute the essential characteristics of the system indoctrinating and propagandizing the voting public organizing and maintaining political parties running electoral campaigns can be carried out only by means of money lots of money and since in monopoly capitalism the big corporations are the source of big money they are also the main source of political power in fact some transnational corporations have profits bigger than the gnp of the large majority of the countries in the world one example may give a better view of the economic power of such corporations as compared to other international institutions in 2017 nestlé spent 7 2 billion us dollars on global advertising efforts the world health organization proposed budget for 2016 2017 was us 4 384 9 million it is important to understand as well that the modern transnational corporation is also the natural successor of the old colonial powers with the difference that while the old colonial powers concentrated in exploiting the global south their contemporary heirs are able to exploit the global north as well when the resources they need are located there as paul sweezy explained in this quote from modern capitalism and other essays there is no reason to suppose that a corporation would willingly exempt foreign markets and sources of supply from its planning horizon just because they happen to be outside a particular set of national boundaries in fact communities in canada france and the us trying to protect their water resources from nestlé are fighting the same battles that communities in the global south always had to fight in order to protect their own resources from colonial grabbing the old colonial powers used local oligarchies submissive to their politics and economic views as rulers in their colonies which became the governance model in most of the global south under neoliberalism this model has been exported to the global north where transnational corporations are gradually taking over the democratic space and the political power turning many places in the north into mirror images of colonised communities in the global south under this new colonial power governments in the south as in the north become willing servants of the corporate sector making sure that despite environmental and social damage the corporations get access to the resources they need but this fact creates an important new opening for communication solidarity understanding and common action between citizens groups fighting water privatization in the global north and in the global south the fight south or north is the same to keep water in public hands under democratic control and to fight for water is also to fight for our endangered democracies under the authoritarian threat of corporate control south or north a new alliance between south and north can emerge that will be a powerful movement challenging the corporate sector and its servants the corporations of course will fight back and nestlé again has already a long and successful history of fighting civil society in the 1970s an international boycott was launched against nestlé due to its practices of promoting bottle feeding and discouraging breast feeding causing infant illness and death in southern poorer countries this campaign known at the time as nestlé kills babies had an unprecedented impact on the company much damaging its image to fight this campaign nestlé hired raphael pagan an army intelligence officer at the us department of defence pagan advised us presidents nixon reagan and bush on third world policies which means on how to fight back third world liberation movements in fact nixon was the us president who gave support to general pinochet coup d état against elected president salvador allende in chile throwing this country in a murderous military dictatorship that lasted for years pagan received a life achievement award from president reagan the us president waging war against the nicaraguan sandinista government killing and terrorizing thousands of people in central america raphael pagan was very effective in fighting back the international boycott against nestlé mainly by designing a strategy to divide the civil society groups organizing the campaign this partnership with military intelligence to fight civil society organizations was so successful that nestlé went deeper in this collaboration in 2002 nestlé hired john hedley an ex mi6 agent british military intelligence as head of security among other things hedley was responsible for organizing an operation to spy on civil society groups critical to nestlé in switzerland mainly the attac group when this operation was unveiled by a swiss investigative journalist that denounced it in the swiss tv nestlé had to face a court case and was condemned by the swiss justice for it nestlé also developed what is known as the war room a high tech communication centre that tracks in real time any mention to nestlé in social media so that the company can react fast to any threats posed by people in 2011 nestlé organized its annual creating shared values conference in washington in partnership with the atlantic council a us based organization that brings together big business politicians and the military the atlantic council hence its name is a member of nato the north atlantic treaty organization more about it at the main panel discussion at this event was with nestlé s ceo peter brabeck and the president and ceo of the atlantic council frederick kempe with the title creating shared value in latin america opportunities obstacles and future directions in nutrition water rural development i guess that what the panel called obstacles was and still is civil society movements trying to keep their natural resources including water in public hands when challenged with this kind of resistance from society corporations like nestlé may find it very useful to have nato at their side to help convincing rebel governments to give away their natural resources for the corporate sector profit not for the development of the country nestlé also has a special program to hire ex us military men and women and maybe just to keep the close links with the us military since as far as i know there is no nestlé special program to hire ex swiss or ex french military people just us ones these examples suffice to show that nestlé has a leadership position in imposing corporate control over democratic institutions in order to have access to natural resources like water the examples also show that nestlé is far ahead in developing strategies and partnerships to fight back civil society resistance only united north and south can we hope to protect our waters from corporate grabbing and our democracies from corporate control there is no other way
skydance has made a unique pitch to paramount global s special committee in charge of accepting or rejecting transactions and its investors according to four people familiar with the parameters of the offer paramount global would continue to trade publicly skydance would own either a substantial minority stake or a majority stake in paramount global by merging its assets and raising new equity which it would acquire along with its private equity partners redbird capital partners and kkr the consortium s ownership percentage in the new company could be around 45 or just over 50 said the people who asked not to be named because the discussions are private
12 29pm dec 17 2019 back in october i looked at where i thought we were in the cycle pointing out that there was enough evidence emerging both qualitative and quantitative that investors were behaving like it was late cycle if this was like the 1990s there was longer to run in this bull market with potentially large upside moves remaining a few people have since asked what are the indicators that played out back then and may be relevant now to put the conclusion first it was always about the federal reserve and it will remain about the federal reserve when the pause ends history would suggest preparing for hibernation if we take the base case of now being analogous to 1998 the fed undertook a series of cuts in response to the asia crisis taking rates from 5 5 per cent to 4 75 per cent from september to november they were then on hold until june 1999 before they raised rates again hiking all the way through to the middle of 2000 the behaviour of equities was instructive whilst the highs were reached in march of 2000 most of the move upwards was achieved by july of 1999 other points to note were that us large cap equities alongside the fabled tech bubble were the leaders and whilst asian shares rebounded they never really kept up with the us market so if the fed changing its stance set in motion the end what caused their change in stance that may be able to guide us in 2020 read the full piece at afr com
watch now sen elizabeth warren is one of the top tier democratic candidates for president near the head of the pack along with former vice president joe biden fellow progressive sen bernie sanders and upstart mayor pete buttigieg warren saw some of her momentum stall in national and state polls after she rolled out her proposal to pay for medicare for all in early november and a subsequent plan detailing how she would transition the american health care system to a single payer model she also got into high profile public battles with billionaires such as leon cooperman and lloyd blankfein with the iowa caucuses coming in early february the democratic presidential candidates particularly those at the top of the field are scrambling for support among the party s rank and file warren on saturday sat down with cnbc s john harwood at the erickson community center in clinton iowa to discuss the state of her campaign her vision for remaking american capitalism and what she thinks of impeachment proceedings against president donald trump an edited transcript of the interview follows john harwood do you see any lessons for yourself for democrats for american politics in the results of the british election the other day and what happened to jeremy corbyn watch now elizabeth warren well you know i think that the brexit part of that vote is a huge sway and it seems to me that it s clear that there was a real divide in the country and big part of what drove that vote john harwood you don t think it was a lesson that the liberal democratic equivalent shouldn t go too far left elizabeth warren brexit certainly wasn t the whole part but i think that this notion of left i don t think there s any such thing as a problem of government that works too much for the people and that s what this ultimately should always be about that s what all our governments should be doing that s what a democratically elected government should do it shouldn t just be there for the wealthy and the well connected it should be there to help strengthen middle class to help give opportunities to working people that s what government can do when it s working best john harwood one issue that came up in your recent transparency battle with mayor pete had to do with who his clients were at mckinsey in particular whether or not any of the advice that he gave was used to lay off workers he says he doesn t know he doubts it but if it did is there anything wrong with that elizabeth warren so look i m glad that the mayor agreed to disclose the information about his past clients because i think the american people have a right to know in effect where conflicts are potential conflicts of interest but for me this is a lot less about what was happening five years ago or 10 years ago or 15 years ago and a lot more about what s happening every day in this primary as we go into the 2020 election season so it s about who are your bundlers the people who get special access to the candidate s time in return for agreeing to raise 25 000 or a quarter of a million dollars who is putting together the big parties who s doing the political action committees watch now john harwood i was asking as an economic matter you say that you re a capitalist to your bones elizabeth warren i am john harwood isn t a consultancy that advises businesses on how to be more lean and efficient part of the creative destruction that makes capitalism capitalism elizabeth warren depends on the kind of capitalism we re talking about i am proposing something called accountable capitalism you may remember that for more than a century american corporations owed multiple duties they owed duties to their investors but also to their employees to their customers to the communities where they were located to our country and then in the late 70 an economist comes along and says hey here s a novel idea how about if you only owe any kind of duty to your investors which means make it all about profitability that means that american corporations today these giant corporations they have no loyalty to america or to american workers john harwood now jamie dimon and the business roundtable came out earlier this year and said the days of sole fealty to shareholders are over we re making some changes was that meaningful in your view watch now elizabeth warren can we just put that in a little bit of context i had come out with my accountable capitalism proposal that said that giant companies like the kind of company that jamie dimon runs should have to be chartered at the federal level their charter should actually say that they owe all of these multiple duties and that employees can elect 40 of the board of directors to make sure john harwood you think you caused them to make that decision elizabeth warren well all i m saying is that s what happened first there was a lot of conversation about it and then jamie dimon and the heads of some other very large corporations said oh we don t need a law we re just going to make that change voluntarily john harwood do you think they ll do it on their own elizabeth warren no i think that what ll happen is they ll say they re going to do it on their own and they may make some adjustments but understand this there s a reason you put laws in place because the one who doesn t follow voluntarily is the one who then gets a little short term comparative advantage gets to boost the share price just a little bit you put in rules so everybody competes on a level playing field that s what we should do with accountable capitalism if jamie dimon thinks it s a good idea for giant corporations like j p morgan chase to have multiple obligations he and i agree then let s make that the law john harwood let me go back to the mckinsey example your friend deval patrick the former governor worked at bain capital when he got into the race the other day he said he thought the obama campaign had given a bum rap to bain when he was running against mitt romney this is a part of how business works some deals go bad but it s not a bad thing do you think he s right is bain capital and what it represents in the economy a bad thing elizabeth warren when they re trying to tweak up corporate actions that are already aiming only toward increasing profitability perfectly willing to if they could save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country would do it in a heartbeat that is a problem in our economy even jamie dimon says so others who come in and help them do that that s not making our economy work any better and it s not making our country work any better john harwood do firms like that have a constructive role to play elizabeth warren they have a constructive role to play when we have accountable capitalism if what they were helping do is make that company work better for employees as well as shareholders for the communities where they re located as well as shareholders then sure but that s not what they re doing john harwood so you disagree with the governor you don t think that obama was giving a bad rap to bain elizabeth warren when they re just trying to say the only thing that matters is the bottom line profits profits profits and whoever you have to step over to get there and however many hardworking people you have to lay off to get there then i think that s a problem john harwood liberal critics of the president say about his immigration policies the cruelty is the point he s trying to deter behavior when you and your campaign sell mugs that say billionaire tears why shouldn t jamie dimon leon cooperman lloyd blankfein bill gates all the people who ve complained and ordinary voters why shouldn t they conclude that punishment is the point elizabeth warren no no no come on as i say in every one of my town halls if you made it big i mean really big i mean top one 10th of 1 big good for you that s great but pitch in 2 cents so everyone else gets a chance to make it big because for me that s what this is all about this year the bottom 99 they re going to pay about 7 2 of their total wealth in taxes the top one tenth of 1 those top millionaires and billionaires fortunes above 50 million they re going to pay less than half that about 3 2 and look it s not just about asking to pay taxes it s about what we do with those taxes that 2 cent wealth tax would mean we could pay for universal child care for every baby in this country that would be life transformative for those babies who got high quality early education experiences and get ready for kindergarten it would be life transformative for their mamas and their daddies who could finish school who could move to a part time job who could move from a part time job to a full time job the way i ve set it up it would be life transformative for all of the child care workers and preschool teachers who would see their wages go up substantially so they d be paid the professional wages they deserve and that would mean a lot of money back into the economy it s about values two cents with the millionaires and billionaires or invest that money in every one of our children and in growing our economy john harwood why do you think that those people believe that they re being vilified believe that you hate business believe that you re not a capitalist watch now elizabeth warren you d have to ask them but i will say this a lot of them just don t want to pay the taxes and that s part of the problem we ve got here government listens disproportionately to rich guys who don t want to pay taxes for everybody who says that this government is caught in gridlock remember that when the question was cutting taxes for the richest and for the biggest corporations it took the republicans about five weeks in order to call everybody in and do a trillion and a half dollars in tax breaks tax breaks that went mostly to those at the top the folks at the top they get heard all the time in washington i want middle class families to get heard in washington john harwood you want to take a hammer to major structures in the american economy break up big tech break up big banks ban fracking end the private health insurance industry 21 trillion in new taxes i know why you want to do those things i know your arguments for them but are you concerned that you re going to end up breaking some things that don t need to be broken that unintended consequences could hurt the people you re trying to help watch now
corte madera california a year ago john bolton trump s short lived national security advisor invoked the 1823 monroe doctrine making explicit what has long been painfully implicit the dominions south of the rio grande are the empire s backyard yet 2019 was a year best characterized as the revolt of the dispossessed for a better world against the barbarism of neoliberalism as rafael correa points out latin america today is in dispute what follows is a briefing on this crossroads andean nations venezuela the leader for regional integration and 21st century socialism continued to be ground zero in the clash between the empire and those nations pursuing post neoliberal alternatives and a multipolar world on the evening of january 22 trained us security asset and head of the suspended venezuelan national assembly juan guaidó received a call from us vice president pence giving guaidó the green light to declare himself president of venezuela the next day guaidó proclaimed his presidency on a caracas street corner within minutes trump recognized the self appointment later followed by some fifty us allies still most nations in the world did not recognize guaidó and the united nations continues to recognize maduro as the constitutional president of venezuela guaidó called for harsher us sanctions on his own people and even the us military option gone was the pretext that sanctions targeted only the government the former us ambassador to venezuela william brownfield boasted that these measures would have an impact on everyone to accelerate the collapse from president barack obama s sanctions in 2015 trump progressively ratcheted up the pain to the current blockade this illegal collective punishment had already caused over 40 000 deaths by the beginning of the year according to the center for economic and policy research cepr in a war by economic means denying the venezuelan people vital food and medicine yet guaidó failed to come to power his publicity stunt on february 23 to bring humanitarian aid from colombia fizzled to make things worse envoys of guaidó in colombia were caught embezzling some of the very funds slated for humanitarian assistance soon after this debacle a staged coup on april 30 by guaidó and a few military officers on an overpass in eastern caracas aborted in november guaidó made an even more pathetic coup attempt his ability to garner support atrophied drawing the ire even of some hardline opposition who formerly backed him while the maduro government continued to rally substantial popular demonstrations and signed a peaceful coexistence agreement with some moderate opposition parties in september despite attempts by washington to incite ruptures within the venezuelan security forces the civic military union built by chavez and continued under maduro held firm and the ranks of the militias continue to grow and despite heavy lobbying by the trump administration venezuela was voted onto the un human rights council on october 27 in a bid to compensate for the diminished stature of the anti venezuela lima group on december 3 colombia convened a summit for the activation of the inter american treaty of reciprocal assistance tiar against venezuela to ratchet up sanctions even further and keep the military option on the table by the end of 2019 even the wall street journal conceded venezuela s nicolás maduro once thought ripe for ouster looks firmly in place in washington north american solidarity activists defended the venezuelan embassy from being taken over by guaidó collaborators april may 2019 with the permission of the venezuelan government and pursuant to international law the embassy protectors held out for 37 days until expelled by the secret service the four last defenders

charges the judge was rewarded by ironically being made minister of justice in the new bolsonaro government similarly dilma rousseff who was lula s left leaning successor as president of brazil had been deposed on a technicality by the right leaning congress in what amounted to a parliamentary coup in 2016 an international campaign to free lula finally succeeded in november but far too late for him to run against bolsonaro lula is free and fighting now but could be incarcerated again bolsonaro went about dismantling social welfare measures firing government workers and rewarding multinational corporations while the amazon burned predictably the popular sectors arose leading to an uncertain political situation in brazil chile the chilean people launched a general strike against austerity with slogans such as neoliberalism was born in chile and will die here reacting to the privatization of everything the uprising this fall has been truly from the grassroots with the

problems puerto rico experienced mass protests and a general strike in 2019 governor ricardo a rosselló was forced to resign on july 22 puerto rican liberation hero oscar lópez rivera observed even before the governor announced his resignation the fact is that he was not governing puerto rico haiti after the harsh 29 year us backed duvalier dictatorships and the subsequent military transition a brief flourishing of democracy ended in haiti when the us brazenly kidnapped president jean bertrand aristide and flew him into exile in 2004 since then a series of dubiously elected presidents some literally installed and all propped up by the us have produced human rights and social welfare conditions worse than under the dictatorships billions in relief after the 2010 earthquake and in

every day something crazy happens in alberta to illustrate how thoroughly oil politics have eroded the province s grip on reality judy aldous who hosts a province wide cbc radio noon show recently devoted an hour to one particularly crazy item orphaned and unreclaimed wells in alberta guest gary mar ceo of the petroleum services association of canada argued that federal taxpayers fund tax credits for the oilpatch worth 700 million over three years to help pay for the cleanup all canadians benefited from this industry and all canadians should be part of the solution he said an average listener unaware of the history of the province s derelict well pipeline and gas plant liability problem might have concluded mar was being reasonable but mar a former provincial conservative cabinet minister was really asking for taxpayer s money to make up for 43 years of misrule by tory governments they created the current crisis by failing to require oil and gas companies to provide security deposits to cover their cleanup responsibilities and by allowing them to put off remediation of inactive wells indefinitely that s how crazy the situation has become in alberta taxpayers are being asked to pay for the failures of government and oil and gas companies by a former politician whose party was responsible for the problem for the record companies can t get away with that kind of irresponsible nonsense in some other jurisdictions new mexico and north dakota both require upfront deposits and timely reclamation for inactive wells it s a massive problem the province has 107 000 wells that produce less than 10 barrels a day and are depleted beyond profitability it has another 93 000 inactive wells not producing at this time and another 77 000 abandoned ones that have been plugged but not reclaimed all need to be cleaned up bankrupt energy companies have already walked away from 3 500 orphan wells more than 40 per cent of the oil and gas wells in the province are not pumping hydrocarbons or generating revenue many are leaking methane co2 radon or hydrogen sulphide into the air ground or water table the cost of cleaning up the sites and decommissioning the wells can range from tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands depending on their age and type in a 2018 presentation robert wadsworth vice president of closure and liability for the scandal plagued alberta energy regulator estimated that the cleanup liability for the province s 400 000 oil and gas wells was likely at least 100 billion pipelines he added represented another 30 billion unfunded liability but the alberta energy regulator has only collected 226 million in security deposits to pay for cleanup if companies declare bankruptcy and won t pay that s bad news for taxpayers and for oil and gas investors the 100 billion unfunded liability combined with low commodity prices and the high costs of hydraulic fracking in shale formations has already scared investors away from the oil patch in the last four years more than 200 north american oil and gas companies at least 30 in alberta have declared bankruptcy laws in most canadian and u s jurisdictions require bankrupt or insolvent firms to cover cleanup costs before they pay unsecured creditors as the cleanup liabilities increase investors and some creditors face the risk they ll get nothing that principle was affirmed in a supreme court of canada ruling in january even alberta premier jason kenney has acknowledged that the ruling has done so much to restrict access to both capital and credit equity and credit for this industry the government industry revolving door mar who became president of the petroleum services association of canada in 2018 glossed over this reality in his cbc appearance mar served as a cabinet minister in five different ministries in ralph klein s conservative government between 1993 and 2007 he was also the province s representative in washington d c lobbying for oil sands projects and pipelines now he has a comfortable oilpatch job in the petro state of alberta revolving doors connect government and the oil and gas industry during the show mar joked in an aw shucks sort of way that he was a recovering politician but politicians rarely recover in fact mar s industry group now pumps out overtly political press releases that read as though they had been composed by kenney or the government s new energy propaganda wing a recent release thundered that the oil patch braces for continued uncertainty with new federal minority government it blamed forecasts of low drilling by oil and gas companies on liberal policies not on low methane prices or industry debt or the high cost and low returns from fracking trudeau may well be an unlikeable promise breaker but he isn t responsible for low oil and gas prices or the notoriously unsustainable economics of fracking the familiar sounding press release groaned on it s time our country had a vision for energy a vision that could inspire canadians to join together in support of our responsible energy development that benefits the lives of all canadians during the radio show mar offered his vision for a federal bailout he made a pitch for a 700 million resource environmental tax credit for energy corporations funded by canadian taxpayers what could be more reasonable than privatizing gains the money the companies made in the good years and socializing costs experts don t think mar s request for a federal handout is honest or reasonable darryl mcmahon an ottawa based expert on oil spill cleanup technologies said a fund just dumps industry s and government responsibilities on the public i very much believe the cleanup costs should be paid by the industry and the provinces who collected the oil royalty revenue and should have created a cleanup fund he said regan boychuk is one of the founders of reclaim alberta which advocates for an accountable industry funded cleanup program he said the scheme would enrich big companies by subsidizing their cleanup costs without helping small struggling firms that are more likely to abandon their cleanup obligations the little zombie companies going bankrupt don t do any cleanup he said so they d get little of the 700 million subsidy boychuk said the alberta government should create an agency to take over insolvent companies and dedicate revenues from their remaining economic wells to pay for reclamation there is still money coming out of the ground but it should be used to pay down reclamation costs he said a government created problem during the cbc broadcast aldous asked mar a simple question how much did the alberta energy regulator collect over the years in security deposits for cleanup costs mar said he couldn t answer the question he said it wasn t in his bailiwick but the answer is easy to find alberta has a paltry 220 million in deposits to cover an estimated 100 billion liability just for plugging and reclaiming old wells and that s because mar s political party never required upfront security deposits the province only collects deposits tiny ones when companies are already heading toward failure with liabilities exceeding their assets and the aer s wadsworth correctly characterized the system for monitoring liabilities as deeply flawed for security the problem is we collect or try to collect it when a licensee is already showing declining financial capacity he said in his presentation wadsworth also posed a good question why has there been no political will to make changes to the liability programs mar s non answer to aldous s question avoided the reality that his political party largely funded by the industry authored a colossal public policy failure the tory s ruinous liability scheme has endangered the province s credit rating and now these dirty old wells threaten the wallets of federal taxpayers and they re not the only risk the province s auditor general warned in 2015 that oil sands cleanup costs represent a 21 billion liability but the regulator has only required the profitable industry to set aside 1 6 billion the estimated liability has now grown to 28 billion while security deposits hover at 1 4 billion the u s based institute for energy economics and financial analysis recently summed up the dire nature of the industry s cleanup liabilities across north america both notley and kenney hiding from a 260 billion cleanup problem read more the oil and gas sector it reported faced severe financial stresses stemming from low energy prices poor financial returns and massive amounts of outstanding debt any additional pressures such as climate related legislation or litigation or lower oil or gas demand stemming from the boom in renewable energy could force companies to retire some of their assets far sooner than expected it noted and that would trigger the requirement for cleanup and remediation costs mar was part of a government that ignored the problem for decades now as an employee of the industry he wants taxpayers to foot the bill it is all rather convenient and crazy but here s what should be the incontestable reality polluters must pay to clean up their messes before they go bankrupt it is irresponsible for mar and the kenney government to not address the failures of the province s liability programs a fracking disaster bc failing to make polluters pay read more it is irresponsible to make canadians pay for the incompetence of alberta governments it is irresponsible to let zombie oil and gas companies with few assets the corporate walking dead endanger the province s economic security and credit rating and it is irresponsible for the alberta government to not establish a transparent cleanup fund and an independent inquiry into the extent of the oil and gas sector s underfunded environmental liabilities as recommended by university of calgary law professor martin olszynski but don t bank on any immediate outbreak of sanity in alberta and if you are a canadian taxpayer hang onto your wallet

nebc montney infrastructure in addition pembina expects to place into service an additional 1 1 billion of projects during 2020 in 2020 the pipelines division will benefit from higher revenue volumes on the peace pipeline system from new projects including phase vi nebc montney infrastructure the wapiti lateral as well as increased volumes at existing locations the pipelines division will also benefit in 2020 from the contribution of the cochin pipeline and edmonton terminals acquired as part of the kinder morgan transaction the facilities division is expected to benefit from a full year of operations at duvernay ii and the redwater co generation facility as well as the start up of projects including duvernay sour treatment facilities prince rupert export terminal and empress fractionation 2020 guidance also reflects the contribution from the acquisition of vancouver wharves these factors are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues at select dry gas facilities the outlook for the marketing new ventures division is based on an expectation of lower year over year crude oil marketing revenue and narrower ngl frac spreads driven by lower ngl prices partially offset by pembina s hedging program the company has hedged approximately 50 percent of its 2020 frac spread exposure excluding aux sable with these hedges having been systematically entered into

plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility one of our highest priorities is prudent and disciplined capital allocation we invest in strong franchises with significant contractual underpinning and good counterparties all ingredients to delivering consistent industry leading returns further we continue to execute pembina s strategy within our financial guardrails stated scott burrows pembina s senior vice president and chief financial officer it takes commitment and discipline but pembina and its stakeholders have been rewarded and we intend to maintain our approach moving forward noted mr burrows business update pembina continues to be squarely focused on delivering transportation and midstream services that enable our customers to reach the best possible markets for their products at a competitive cost thus enhancing their netbacks collectively the following developments support the ongoing build out of our integrated value chain and highlight pembina s unique capability to quickly and cost effectively add up to 300 000 barrels per day bpd of incremental peace pipeline system capacity renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential incremental fractionation facilities prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion and ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s liquids pipelines are now connected to all major export facilities and world scale storage facilities in alberta including the 10 million barrels of storage acquired from kinder morgan further through the acquisition of the cochin pipeline pembina has strengthened its capabilities and connectivity within its condensate business in addition pembina s ngl pipeline systems are connected upstream to major pembina and third party gas processing facilities and downstream to all major ngl fractionation and storage facilities in the fort saskatchewan alberta area this connectivity provides our customers with unparalleled flexibility in reaching their desired markets renewal of peace pipeline system phase i ii contracts and additional firm service contracts pembina continues to progress the renewal of the legacy peace pipeline phase i and ii contracts a portion of which were previously extended as part of the phase iii expansion pembina is engaged in ongoing discussions with customers and is highly confident that the majority of the remaining contracts nearing maturity will be renewed or their firm capacity resold given the tolls are substantially lower than current posted tolls this will allow us to maintain pembina s current earnings profile while providing exceptional value flexibility and reliability for customers not available elsewhere producer demand for pembina s transportation services across the liquids rich areas of the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb continues to grow since may 2019 pembina has continued to secure firm service commitments on the peace pipeline system while extending many in the process this continues pembina s recent track record of systematically growing and extending the contracted revenue profile of these pipelines in response to customer demand and in lock step with our announced expansions firm volume commitments now will reach approximately 1 1 million bpd in 2022 peace pipeline system expansions optimization and capacity potential once the first stage of phase ix is complete pembina will have 1 1 million bpd of market delivery capacity into edmonton alberta across the peace and northern systems and will have completed its objective of achieving segregated liquids transportation service for ethane plus propane plus crude and condensate between gordondale alberta and the edmonton alberta area full product segregation is a significant accomplishment that will drive operational and capital efficiencies strengthen pembina s competitive advantage and ultimately benefit our customers there are numerous advantages associated with product segregation including most notably the avoidance of product batching which increases pipeline utilization minimizes product interface and requires less operational storage finally it also supports potential capacity increases through optimization and more efficient and ultimately cost effective lateral connectivity to the pipeline as well as optimal flexibility in future mainline expansions the elimination of batching and other hydraulic optimization initiatives which pembina refers to as phase x could create up to an incremental 100 000 bpd of capacity with minimal capital spending in addition pembina continues to have the ability through a second stage of the phase ix expansion to add approximately 200 000 of capacity to its pipelines from fox creek alberta to namao alberta through the addition of pump stations on these mainlines land for these additional pump stations has been acquired and all the upstream infrastructure required to access this capacity will be in place with the completion of the peace phase vi ix expansions incremental fractionation facilities with the increasing amount of oil and condensate resource being developed along our pipeline systems and the anticipated startup of lng canada s phase i liquified natural gas project on canada s west coast pembina continues to receive customer requests for incremental fractionation services for associated natural gas liquids increasingly we are observing customer demand for incremental natural gas liquid barrels particularly from the montney play to move westward for export given this shift in wcsb product flows pembina is pursuing multiple developments in parallel both within the existing redwater fractionation complex as well as northeast british columbia nebc which will facilitate this movement and actively respond to producers evolving needs pembina currently has in excess of 1 500 acres at the company s existing redwater fractionation complex and has secured 540 acres in nebc where pembina is evaluating new fractionation facilities based on the design of the rfs ii and iii facilities and associated rail infrastructure the peace pipeline provides location optionality to construct required ngl fractionation facilities in multiple locations to meet customer demand for services and provide maximum diversification to premium ngl markets such as through pembina s prince rupert export terminal and its expansion or through value added upgrading to polypropylene prince rupert lpg export terminal expansion pembina continues to advance construction of its prince rupert lpg export terminal the project is on track to provide customers with export service beginning in the second half of 2020 the anticipated startup of this facility has generated significant interest from our customers and offtakers and pembina is pleased to announce an expansion of this terminal the prince rupert terminal expansion which will increase propane export capacity to approximately 40 000 bpd the prince rupert terminal expansion is expected to cost approximately 175 million and has an anticipated in service date in the first half of 2023 subject to regulatory and environmental approvals the incremental capacity from the expansion will closely match the proposed nebc fractionation facility s propane production and the in service dates of the respective facilities would be closely aligned ethane supply to support alberta s petrochemicals diversification program pembina s existing infrastructure ideally positions the company to be a significant supplier of ethane to support the government of alberta s petrochemicals diversification program this program is designed to provide government support and incentives to build facilities that may include a world scale ethane cracker in alberta through the continued expansion and hydraulic optimization of the peace pipeline system expansion and optimization efforts on the alberta ethane gathering system and the current capability of the vantage northern and brazeau systems pembina has concluded it can provide over 100 000 bpd of incremental highly reliable diversified low cost ethane transportation to the edmonton alberta area much of which may be sourced from existing or future pembina facilities this opportunity aligns with our customers needs and the government of alberta s goal to provide a made in alberta petrochemical solution resulting in significant investment and long term employment for thousands of albertans other important initiatives we are pursuing include alliance pipeline expansion pdh pp facility and jordan cove lng project alliance pipeline expansion alliance pipeline alliance continues to pursue an expansion from the bakken play in north dakota to the chicago area commercial discussions with customers are ongoing and alliance believes there is an opportunity for a phased expansion of up to 400 million cubic feet per day with initial commercial support for an initial expansion of up to 100 million cubic feet per day due to current extensive flaring of natural gas in the bakken and increasingly stringent regulations in north dakota restricting such flaring alliance believes it can provide a solution that will benefit customers and result in improved environmental performance pdh pp facility pembina continues to progress its pdh pp facility which is under development through its joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical corporation ckpc ckpc continues execution of the early works activities for the pdh pp facility in alberta s industrial heartland adjacent to pembina s redwater fractionation complex located in sturgeon county alberta ckpc has obtained all environmental and regulatory approvals to construct and operate the pdh pp facility all long lead equipment to support mechanical completion has been ordered and we are progressing as expected with multiple parties to secure lump sum engineering and construction agreements with an objective of locking down two thirds of the project cost jordan cove lng project on november 15 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc released the final environmental impact statement feis and recommended approval of the jordan cove lng terminal and pacific gas connector pipeline the feis is the result of ferc s comprehensive review process that began in september 2017 and includes complete and comprehensive environmental safety and security reviews developed with input from federal and state agencies tribes and many other stakeholders the feis issued by ferc represents the final step in the ferc environmental review process before an order is issued by the commission approving the project pembina looks forward to receiving our final certificate from ferc on february 13 2020 engagement with the oregon state regulatory authority continues state permits remain a critical component of the regulatory process for jordan cove and are necessary to enable the commercial viability of the project and allow this investment to move forward about

washington impeached or not president donald trump has a strong tailwind heading into his re election year the economy presidential contests tend to turn on it s the economy stupid as democratic strategist james carville summed up underdog bill clinton s win in 1992 and things look good for trump at this time unemployment is at a 50 year low stocks are at all time highs and forecasters project growth into 2020 especially as the trade war with china seems to be easing if the status quo continues he ll win said moody s analytics chief economist mark zandi referring to his presidential prediction model which is based on economic indicators including gas prices and the unemployment rate along with the president s approval rating and projected turnout zandi s is just one of several prediction models that favor trump who also has the benefit of incumbency the president never misses an opportunity to boast about the dow or the latest jobs report and those rosy indicators give other republicans something to run on no matter what s happening in washington for folks running for congress or senate it s something they can and will tout every single day said republican strategist matt gorman so should democrats worry yes said carville everything worries me with democrats in the midst of a presidential primary fight there s widespread agreement among the candidates and their biggest allies that many americans aren t feeling the benefits of a robust economy and that trump can be defeated by highlighting those inequities while liberal megacities are booming rust belt swing states such as pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin have lost thousands of manufacturing jobs this year after an earlier revival due in part to trade disputes and unemployment rates have begun to tick up a bit in dozens of battleground counties in the industrial midwest in wisconsin s marinette county which trump won by 34 points the unemployment rate has climbed a full percentage point in the past year though it s still low historically stocks are up but so are costs democrats say rising health and child care costs ballooning student debt and concerns about retirement savings have left many voters feeling anxious about the future even while others are enjoying the growth of their 401 k accounts half of americans 49 percent worry about an immediate financial need such as paying rent or bills while another quarter of the population have no immediate needs but are concerned about long term financial issues like retirement paying for a child s education and health care costs according to surveys taken by gallup virtually every cost in the life of a middle class family is up and that dynamic is frankly one of the reasons why he won the last election sen bob casey a democrat who represents the key battleground state of pennsylvania said of trump there was a frustration that neither party was addressing that basic problem those issues predated trump but democrats argue he not only failed to address them but also made things worse by undermining the affordable care act and squandering his biggest legislative opportunity on a tax cut that most americans think helped the wealthy and not them those messages have already started to appear in ads run by democratic super pacs like priorities usa which has spent 8 2 million since july on digital ads in swing states presidential candidates also have highlighted rising costs and sluggish wage growth in speeches and ads the idea that trump s strength is on the economy is false said patrick mchugh priorities usa executive director while macro indicators might suggest that the economy is doing all right everyday americans are not feeling that the super pac s extensive polling of battleground states has found voters satisfaction with their economic situation fell 8 percentage points from may to october and their approval of trump s handling of the economy dropped from a net 10 points to an equal number approving and disapproving some nonpartisan polling backs that up a new pew survey found that while 69 percent of americans think the economy is helping the wealthy just 32 percent say it s helping the middle class and only 27 percent say it s helping the poor and 58 percent say the economy is actually hurting the middle class and 64 percent say it s hurting the poor overall though a slight majority of americans 52 percent approve of trump s handling of the economy according to the last nbc news wall street journal poll which is stronger than his overall approval rating of course a lot could change in the next year resisting trump s temperament selling their economic case will depend on democrats not repeating their mistakes of 2016 when they focused on trump s temperament while he focused on telling workers he would bring their jobs back we took a big mirror and projected trump s face on it and said to voters look at how grotesque it is look at how despicable it is and we never really turned the mirrors around to focus on what s actually going on in peoples communities said bradley beychok the president of the democratic super pac american bridge the group plans to spend at least 50 million in 2020 trying to soften up trump s support in conservative areas after having compiled research on 77 counties to try to localize messages about how the president has driven things in the wrong direction on jobs health care costs and more lee saunders the president of the american federation of state county and municipal employees a union that represents 1 4 million mainly public sector workers said democrats have gotten better at talking about bread and butter issues but can t let impeachment take all the oxygen out of the room if you look at the democrats who are running for president right now these folks have started talking about how working families are being left behind he said they want to hear how you re going to help them and benefit them on a day to day level democrats were cautious in criticizing the economy when barack obama was in the white house but the 2020 presidential candidates have been relatively unified in dissecting the economy under trump look beyond the daily headlines about the stock market and the unemployment rate you ll see a grim long term picture of our economy sen elizabeth warren said in an economic speech thursday in new hampshire trump said he s going to take care of the forgotten man he got elected and forgot them former vice president joe biden said in an interview with cnbc last week trump is saying the economy is doing great just look at the stock market and a lot of folks around the country and around here in south bend say what about me mayor pete buttigieg told nbc news harry smith the democratic national committee and state parties plan to highlight what they call trump s broken promises to help forgotten workers for instance in 2017 he traveled to youngstown ohio to assure voters he would revive the struggling manufacturing sector and keep open a nearby g m plant the automaker was threatening to close those jobs have left ohio they re all coming back they re all coming back trump told a cheering crowd don t move don t sell your house g m shuttered the plant this year a recent quinnipiac survey found nearly 6 in 10 americans said they are better off financially now than they were in 2016 while a majority of wisconsin voters 53 percent say they approve of the way trump is handling the economy according to a new poll from marquette law school widely considered the best pollster in the state in fact americans are so deeply polarized that even their view of the economy not what they think should be done about it but just their appraisal of how well it s working today is tied to their partisan identity republicans view of the economy dramatically improved as soon as trump took office while democrats view of it declined even though the economy under the final months of obama s tenure and first few months of trump looked virtually identical today 75 percent of republicans say the economy is excellent or good versus just 41 percent of democrats who say the same according to pew findings like that make carville wonder if in 2020 it really still is the economy stupid trump is impervious to everything good or bad he just stays at 41 7 carville said referring to the president s approval rating in fivethirtyeight com s average i don t care how many good stories about the economy come i don t care about how many bad stories come it still comes up 41 7
