overview with many centers closed for the extended holiday the calm in the global capital markets has been punctuated by reports that the us is considering ending its exemption for eight countries to have bought iranian oil over the past six months the waivers were to end on may 2 but previously it was thought that a couple of waivers like for china and india would be extended oil prices have surged to new six month highs asian equities were mixed with losses in china india and indonesia and gains in japan korea and taiwan most european centers are closed the s p 500 is trading 0 3 lower after alternating last week between gains and losses benchmark bond yields were higher in asia with china s 10 year edging above 3 40 for the first time since the middle of last november european stock and bond markets are closed the us 10 year tested the 2 60 level last week and backed off the us dollar is narrowly mixed against the majors the canadian dollar and the norwegian krone are the strongest in an apparent oil play the euro sterling and yen are practically unchanged the liquid accessible emerging market currencies like the south african rand turkish lira and mexican peso are nursing losses the russian rouble is an exception and that too seems driven by the jump in oil prices asia pacific three japanese meetings this week will command attention the bank of japan meets a bloomberg poll found 45 of 48 surveyed do not expect a change in stance many do expect the boj to downgrade production and export components of its economic assessment bloomberg surveys found an increase in those economists that expect the next move to be easing policy a year ago less than one in five expected the boj to ease further note that before the weekend and before the 10 day holiday beginning at the end of this week the boj surprised the market by announcing a reduction in its long duration bond buying 10 years and beyond our concern is not immediate but later in the year japan faces disinflation pressure from initiative to make young children s education free and cuts in mobile phone service fees coupled with the retail sales tax increase oct 1 the other two meetings this week are prime minister abe s visit to europe and the us recall japan and europe s trade agreement went into effect feb 1 japan and us trade talks are just beginning abe is perceived to be trying to ingratiate himself with the mercurial american president and many note that his visit to the us at the end of the week also coincides with the first lady s birthday trump and abe will likely be meeting three times in as many months after meeting his week trump will visit tokyo next month and maybe the first foreign leader to meet the new emperor in june trump will return to japan osaka to attend the g20 meeting the high level meetings are hoped to facilitate the first part of a two part trade agreement japan s recent trade agreements tpp and with europe have left us producers at a self imposed disadvantage with will be remedied in the first part and then protracted negotiations over reducing japan s roughly 60 bln a year trade surplus with the us the dollar is confined to less than a 15 tick range below jpy112 00 today there is an option there that expires today for about 915 mln last week the dollar was confined to a jpy111 77 to jpy112 17 range according to bloomberg one of its tightest weekly ranges in years the australian dollar is in a quarter cent range but this is sufficient to trade on both sides of its pre weekend range the technical importance of the outside day lies with the close a close below the previous session low 0 7145 would be more negative nearby support is seen in the 0 7100 0 7110 area europe most centers are closed today the economic calendar is light this week following the disappointing flash pmi last week this week s economic feature is the german ifo in the middle of the week sweden s riksbank meets on april 25 no change is expected in its minus 25 bp repo rate and minus 100 bp deposit rate last week sweden reported an unexpected jump in march unemployment 7 1 vs 6 6 which reinforced the standpat outlook politics takes center stage spain s elections are on april 28 it is the third election in four years the critical issue has shifted from the push back against austerity to the catalan separatism the polls suggest the governing socialists may emerge as the largest party but may find it difficult to cobble together a center left coalition the center right appears equally challenged spanish asset markets have taken the political uncertainty in stride spanish bonds have outperformed italian bond though arguably this may say more about italy than spain spanish bonds have outperformed german bunds over the past month by easing half a basis point compared to the three basis point increase in germany with parliament s holiday break ending brexit returns the center ring the key development to note today is that the chair of the 1922 committee of backbenchers reportedly informed prime minister may that she either resigns by the end of june or the party will change the rules to allow it to try to force her out recall that she survived a previous party leadership challenge this will likely encourage may to double her efforts to seek a deal with labour which is the direction of a softer exit which at least until recently was seen as sterling positive sterling finished the last two sessions below 1 30 for the first time in two months it is confined to less than a fifth of a cent and has seen offers in the 1 30 area the euro has held below 1 1250 but has not been below 1 1235 either while there are no large options near the money that are set expire today there is a 1 8 bln euro option at 1 1250 that will be cut tomorrow which is also where the 20 day moving average is found additional resistance is pegged in the 1 1265 1 1275 area on the downside we note that dips below 1 12 have been bought america the economic highlight of the week comes ahead of the weekend in the form of the first look at q1 us gdp it looked dismal at the start of the quarter with the shock from the q4 equity meltdown the government shutdown and the bitterly cold weather however the economy gradually found better traction and most expect growth to be above what the fed regards as the long term average 1 8 today s data consists of the chicago fed s national economic index it is not the stuff the typically moves the market but it is expected to be consistent with the economic narrative of the us economy getting better traction the us also reports existing home sales for march after a nearly 12 surge in february some pullback is nearly inevitable the jump in february took it from a 3 5 year low to an almost one year high in terms of units the 12 month average is 5 29 mln and the 24 month average is 5 41 mln march is expected at 5 30 mln according to the median forecast in the bloomberg survey us earnings season focus shifts from the banks where retail did well to technology this week amazon facebook twitter and microsoft are among the highlights boeing also reports many economists expect boeing s woes to shave q2 gdp by 0 2 0 3 separately note that many large european banks will also report this week the bank of canada meets tomorrow there is no reason to expect a change in policy or the 1 75 overnight interest rate the weakness of non oil exports remains problematic but the labor market and consumption retail sales seem strong enough to keep in check concerns about the impact of housing prices meanwhile with the us no showing any indication of lifting the steel and aluminum tariffs canada remains unlikely to take up the new trade deal with the us and mexico next month is seen to be the last opportunity until after the october election which then may run into us political issue ahead of the 2020 election the us dollar closed last week knocking on cad1 34 which it has not closed above since late march it is testing the 20 day moving average a little below cad1 3360 the last time the dollar closed below cad1 33 was the end of february the challenge is that the tactics that allow one to make money in the range leave one vulnerable to a real breakout the dollar index is consolidating the gains it scored in the wake of the divergent news of disappointing emu and japan flash pmi and a jump in us retail sales it tested the 97 50 area on april 18 and has drifted lower june crude oil wti is pushing through the 65 cap of recent weeks to approach 66 a barrel we have been suggesting a 67 68 technical target since late january many are now talking about 70 if the us does eliminate the waivers around 1 1 mln barrels a day of iranian oil is at risk china and india may protest it may encourage more talk in europe about the need for another payment system outside of swift which is headquartered in europe recall that last year the us forced the bundesbank to block a large cash transfer from an iranian owned bank in hamburg to tehran europe chaffs under what it sees as extraterritoriality it will be another issue that and turkey s interest diverge disclaimer
in a few weeks i am off to britain again to participate in a series of events two of these events will be in scotland where we warren and i will discuss as outsiders issues pertaining to the monetary arrangements that might accompany a move to scottish independence it is a controversial issue in itself but unfortunately is also intertwined with the vexed issue of eu membership and the complication then becomes that progressives who might otherwise be attracted to the modern monetary theory mmt way of understanding the monetary system also exhibit the standard misconstrued europhile view that the eu neoliberal though it is can be reformed and that an independent scotland should be part of that mess and in doing so they then take problematic positions on the currency question so a sort of nest of vipers sort of situation from the aesop s fable the farmer and the viper as in the fable the europhiles embrace of the eu will always pay them back in grief anyway while i am always cautious discussing the pro and con of situations where i have no direct material stake and a less than full understanding of specific cultural and historical influences that are at work the scottish question is interesting and demonstrates many of points that nations should be cogniscant of when discussing monetary sovereignty and besides i have to get up in edinburgh and glasgow in a few weeks so as a researcher i am trained to be prepared and seek the best understanding that i can of the complexity of the situation i will be writing a few posts on the scottish issue as i prepare for that speaking tour my previous blog posts on scotland are 1 oh scotland don t you dare part 2 june 5 2018 2 oh scotland don t you dare part 1 june 4 2018 3 i would be voting no in scotland but with a lot of anger august 18 2014 4 bonnie scotland ignorance or denial either way it is fraught october 30 2013 5 scotland should vote yes in 2014 but only if september 27 2012 in other words i have been following the scottish debate for some years and have read a lot of literature and studied a lot of data my interest in scotland came early in life as i was friends with a lot of young scots who were accommodated in the migrant hostel camp just near to my childhood home in melbourne this was part of the post war migration push that the federal government pursued and the camp was a disgrace little tin sheds called nissen huts which in the melbourne summer became furnaces i was also particularly taken by the historical writing of john prebble who covered the jacobite uprising and the subsequent highland clearances in great detail that episode left an indelible impression on my perception of scotland right or wrong gordon brown s five neoliberal tests in october 1997 gordon brown the then labour chancellor in the blair government proposed five tests that should be conducted and passed before britain should contemplate joining the eurozone and abandoning the pound at the time tony blair who would later go on to lie about the reasons for britain joining the invasion of iraq was determined for britain to join the eurozone that alone tells you about his judgement why blair thought that anything would be different from the near disaster that befell britain as a result of its membership of the erm is beyond rational explanation but his pro euro position is emblematic of the denial that current day europhiles suffer from in their defense of the eu in general it is also one of the reasons that british labour is so betwixt on the brexit issue when in their historical pre neoliberal dna they should be leading the charge out of the eu as part of the process that would inform the required referendum on the euro membership issue gordon brown who as legend has it was apparently sitting in the back of a taxi during a us sojourn with his advisor ed balls came up with the so called five economic tests those tests informed the treasury analysis which concluded in its report soon after that was neither sufficiently converged with that of the rest of the eu nor sufficiently flexible to justify a recommendation of membership at that time an enquiry was set up within h m treasury to probe the issue further began in june 2001 and the resulting report government policy on emu and the five economic tests was published in june 2003 that study which was over 2 000 pages long if we include all the supporting work published concluded categorically that britain should not join the emu however if one reads that report it becomes clear that the blair treasury was neoliberal central it says the british government supports the direction in which the eu fiscal framework is evolving and the stability and growth pact it praised the ambitious programme to reform labour product and capital markets and the government supports policies to strengthen competition in the eu and the single market it also claimed that while britain was not quite ready to join the emu largely for reasons pertaining to the different structure of the housing market to enable britain to prosper inside the euro area the government is entering into a wide programme of economic reform the documented reforms were all characteristic neoliberal policy interventions designed to undermine worker security promote financial market deregulation and bias fiscal policy towards austerity in other words the european way the reason i introduce this piece of history is because it relates to benchmarks brown s five tests held out that the appropriate benchmarks were defined by the framework that the emu had established following the acceptance of the maastricht treaty that framework presented a highly articulated neoliberal vision for europe which as history tells us has delivered on its promise mass unemployment increased poverty risk rising inequality degradation of public infrastructure financial chaos and stagnant growth there is nothing in that framework and the resulting benchmarks it provides that should interest a progressive agenda so why any version of that sort of decision making framework should be used by progressives defies reason the scottish 6 tests on may 25 2018 the so called scottish growth commission set up by the snp government released its 354 page report scotland the new case for optimism a strategy for inter generational economic renaissance as i noted at the time the report could have been published by the imf given its adherence to the flawed neoliberal macroeconomic framework that that institution imposes on everything i concluded that it was too generous to call the growth commission s work analysis rather it was a series of unfounded assertions with logical extrapolation from that flawed basis is more accurate it was obvious that if scotland were to create an independent nation on the basis of the blueprint outlined in the growth commission s report then it would soon be heading into a mediocre oblivion a future where it would be unable to effectively counteract the fluctuations of non government sector spending and a future where fiscal policy was forced to be pro cyclical scotland would end up another failed austerity state you can read a summary of the overall report here a key part of the report is conclusion that scotland should retain the british pound until a series of tests for future currency decisions are met the brown testing environment back again and the same type of neoliberal benchmarking i discussed those tests in detail in the already cited blog post oh scotland don t you dare part 2 june 5 2018 i won t repeat that analysis here the report also recommended encumbering the new independent government with a series of ad hoc fiscal rules identical to those that have made the eurozone unworkable the response from the the snp first minister nicola sturgeon at the time of the growth commission s release denied that the blueprint set out by the growth commission would involve fiscal austerity she said source the report explicitly rejects austerity we have a choice stay as we are locked into the brexit spiral and continued austerity that the westminster parties offer no alternative to or decide to equip ourselves with the powers to build our way to a better future the problem with that assessment is that while the report does make those claims the framework it presents very similar to the emu s fiscal compact with six pack sgp etc makes it hard not to conclude that there would be a pro cyclical bias in fiscal policy settings in times of recession they talk continually of the journey to sustainable public finances and this is defined in terms of meaningless ratios such as debt limits of 50 per cent of gdp and deficits no larger than 3 per cent of gdp further the primary fiscal balance should be zero none of that sort of talk which is influencing the way the scots and their politicians are constructing the independence question challenge would be possible if the general public understood modern monetary theory mmt in other words my contention is that the likes of the growth commission only can only exhibit a seeming credibility in the eyes of the public because the latter are mesmerised by flawed neoliberal economic concepts introduced by the mainstream of my profession mmt in scotland mmt has become involved in the debate within scotland about whether to and how to achieve independence from britain unfortunately a series of articles in the pro independence daily newspaper the national has distorted the understanding that readers might have otherwise achieved if mmt had have been correctly represented on january 3 2019 the national published an article by one gordon macintyre kemp hot new economic theory is just one piece of the puzzle the author was the founder of the influential business network business for scotland so hardly an unbiased commentator it is interesting that his critique pre dates those of coming out of the american debate surrounding the green new deal it shows that the growing interest in our work is impacting on policy debates around the world which is as it should be in his article macintyre kemp straw person s mmt and then concludes it sounds too good to be true and guess what it is which shows he hasn t even arrived at square one in comprehension this conclusion amounts to a denial of reality mmt is true because it is about reality i know that is taking a realist view of phenomenon and i appreciate that position is itself debatable but i prefer to call a a if i see something resembling a unless there are good reasons not to take that position he initially tries the we knew it all along stance at the core of mmt is an accurate observation of how money works that any serious economist has been aware of since the end of the gold standard the creation of free floating currencies i considered that tactic in these blog posts among others 1 modern monetary theory what is new about it august 22 2016 2 modern monetary theory what is new about it part 2 august 23 2016 3 modern monetary theory what is new about it part 3 august 25 2016 the mainstream his serious economists plainly have not updated their theoretical structures and predictions to address the implications of the creation of free floating currencies i have just completed a two part interview with the new york times that i guess will come out in due course the topic was japan and the recent comments from government and bank of japan officials about how crazy mmt is if you asked a mainstream economists in the 1990s and you can do simple searches and find their answers back then what would happen to that country as a consequence of the growing deficits growing public debt ratio they would have and did predict ed that interest rates and the inflation rate would accelerate upwards and the bid to cover ratios in the bond auctions would fall until the bond investors refused to purchase government debt at any yield many predicted insolvency before the end of the 1990s mmters never predicted any of those things rather we knew that the observed outcomes which have been diametrically opposed to what an application of mainstream macroeconomics would have predicted would be more or less as they have been so if these serious economists knew it all along how do they explain that massive discrepancy mmt and the mainstream macro could not be further apart on our analysis of japan although the former have attempted to cover their tracks mistakes with rubbish about cultural peculiarities in japan macintyre kemp then pulls out the next trick in the anti mmt bag that is regularly used this is the politicians cannot be trusted or variation ruse he writes if a government can spend what it wants there is no restriction on unhinged leaders spending in a way that kills the planet so apparently governments would cause unparalleled environmental cost the world would further deplete it s finite natural resources driving us to the co2 tipping point disastrously quickly and so on okay so his solution is to keep everybody in the dark using the lies that mainstream macroeconomics perpetuates as if that will constrain crazy governments from destroying the planet so democracy has no meaning in this scheme people should be mislead politicians should adopt ridiculous voluntary constraints as if they are natural or immutable which are then politically leveraged by their political opponents to ensure that policies favour the top end of town and allow millions of workers to remain unemployed under the ruse there is not enough money and on the environmental theme we continue to promote coal based energy production for example because we cannot afford investments in renewables and we starve our health and educational systems of funding and deny third world countries essential aid because some debt ratio is too high meanwhile if some church burns down money springs up without limit unless of course it is three historically black churches in rural louisiana source although those cases recently received a funding boost on the back of the paris disaster people were guilt tripped into coughing up some cash the bottom line is that ultimately a capricious politician of the sort macintyre kemp thinks will destroy the planet is brought to account by the democratic process not by fiscal rules and the like that punish the workers more than the bosses and wealthy he builds on his politicians cannot be trusted theme by claiming that right wing populist leaders inspired by mmt might not bother taxing business at all or a socialist populist could cut income tax but maintain business taxes these sectional ideologies in politics already exhibit variations on this behaviour what an understanding of mmt would generate is a new awareness among the voting public which would force the political elites of any persuasion to construct the political narrative in a more open way stripped of the lies derived from an application of sound finance it goes from ridiculous to worse when he claims that mmt means no limit on military spending and effectively guarantees a new global arms race the fact that nuclear weapons are expensive to develop is one of the key reasons we are still breathing making this cheaper will have disastrous consequences any government now could if the populace was so inclined pursue the conflagration of the world the fact they do not is not because the governments haven t the capacity to equip their armies didn t sting sing something about hoping that the russians love their children too but the constraint stopping crazy martial behaviour from world governments is not dependent on whether the population understands mmt or not although as noted above such an understanding would probably better protect us from such behaviour further the real resource cost of building some nukes does not change if the population is aware that the government can buy whatever is for sale in the currency it issues including all idle labour it is ridiculous to leverage that sort of argument as a case against the public receiving an mmt education and being better informed about what governments can and cannot do further apparently nations might utilise mmt to replace taxation with the consequence that the value of its currency would sink like a stone how does an understanding of mmt generate that policy option replacing taxation replacing it with what what an understanding of mmt provides is a clear view of how modern fiat currency issuing governments spend and what the monetary operations that might accompany that spending might look like and their different impacts it ends the lie that taxpayers are funding the spending they are certainly still taxpayers and so if the taxpayers are not funding the government spending what are they doing mainstream economics provides no answers to that essential question nor an entree that would even lead to that question being posed that is a value of an understanding of mmt we get to ask better questions of government from a better informed basis no government that wants to maintain full employment and high levels of capacity utilisation in the economy would abandon taxes they are essential for creating the fiscal space within which government can utilise real productive resources to fullfil the political agenda for which it was elected and then the out of control money supply argument enters he quotes an alleged mmt evangelist as saying no problem we just print more money whether a person did say that to him is moot but if they did then they are no mmter no mmter who understands the body of work we have created and called mmt would say anything remotely like we just print more money that is a mainstream type construction that mmters would never use and they would never use it because it violates an accurate description of how governments spend when the government spends it does not print money that is a loaded term designed to create an emotional vision of crazy government officials in some basement churning out notes at ever increasing rates as hyperinflation means that people need wheelbarrows full of cash to buy a loaf of bread the more savvy commentators have become slightly more sophisticated and now claim that yes the printing is done via digital transfers but they still are trying to hang onto the imagery of the crazy printers the fact is that if any spending source government or non government household consumption business investment export sales pushes nominal spending growth well beyond the capacity of the productive sector to absorb it then accelerating inflation will be the result there are not many examples of that sort of behaviour in history but the point is that all expenditure carries an inflation risk why would a government try to push the economy beyond full employment and watch the price level accelerate upwards and the exchange rate start to plummet his final argument against mmt is just more of the same mmt removes all discipline in the economy from individuals corporations and politicians which would impact negatively on inflation the environment and the supply of labour inflation would accelerate and would end all civilisation when it crashes yep mmt is all that and more note all through his diatribe the reader is encouraged to think about mmt as a regime that an independent scotland has the option of adopting regular readers will know that that conception is plain wrong one might say it displays the height of ignorance about what our work is about anyone who promotes that sort of understanding about mmt is not qualified to hold themselves out as an expert on the topic scotland is a monetary economy mmt is alive and well in every nook and cranny in scotland right now it is just that the politicians choose to use and the public is encouraged to adopt an inferior misleading lens to view the operations of the monetary system they use a lens that promotes spurious causations wrongful conclusions about policy interventions and more presumably macintyre kemp thinks like many commentators that duping the public like this including himself obviously is best for the society i disagree because i prefer to educate people with knowledge acquisition so they can make better and more informed choices and hold the state to account in the democratic process on matters of substance not deception the point is that the policy insights that an understanding of mmt allows to develop focus very clearly on where the discipline in policy has to be the public gets a very clear idea that it is real resource constraints that impinge on government spending choices they come to realise that it is a political play before them when there are competing demands on the available resources the choice between one option use of resources and another becomes a political choice not one driven by a lack of money they come to realise that the national government chooses the unemployment rate once the non government sector s spending and saving decisions have been made and executed there would be no more toying by politicians that unemployment is a complex and difficult to solve problem when the public come to understand that the government could buy the services of all idle labour at any time it wanted by simply offering jobs and so on conclusion the point is that building an understanding of mmt would introduce a new sense of discipline on politicians to more accurately outline the policy choices they are entertaining for a newly independent scotland desperately wanting to free itself from the mindless austerity from london that must be an advantage by promoting an understanding of mmt as a superior way of looking into and comprehending the monetary system and the capacities of the currency issuing government within that system progressives would be helping the new scottish government see obvious differences between institutional and policy structures they would see 1 the imperative for scotland in introducing its own currency and floating that currency in foreign exchange markets 2 the folly of maintaining sterling as its currency and or pegging some new currency to sterling 3 the necessity to create its own central bank that has control over interest rate setting and can never become insolvent that is it would help progressives in scotland understand that the future laid out by the growth commission is nowhere the nation should be wanting to traverse they would also see that the tests benchmarks which it claims should be passed before the nation could introduce its own currency are just neoliberal conceptions and nothing that a progressive should consider to be of any standing and then they would see the absolute folly of joining the eu or worse the eurozone events page for details of all upcoming events go to the events page my next public event is on may day when i am speaking at a climate action newcastle event in newcastle that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights reserved
there are particular concerns around china large opaque and heavily indebted off balance sheet investment vehicles are highlighted as a source of particular vulnerability maturity and liquidity mismatches are rife the balance sheets of small and medium sized banks are weak and the risk of further policy easing to boost growth without deeper reforms are a cause for concern these risks aren t limited to china many banks firms households and governments in asia borrowed heavily when interest rates were low and are now feeling pressure as rates increase those which borrowed heavily in us dollars are feeling pressure as the us dollar appreciates those which borrowed through short term and portfolio lending to finance longer term investment are now feeling pressure as financial conditions tighten the trade war between the united states and china will hopefully come to an end in the not too distant future but the full cost of the trade war to asian supply chains flows of trade and investment and the rules based trading system will continue to be felt long after the ink on any deal has dried the threat of a real trade shock to the economies of the region is high policy uncertainty remains a serious threat to asian stability brexit the deepening globalisation backlash the possible collapse of the wto dispute settlement body and questions around us commitment to the global rules based order all pose serious risks to asian countries many of which grew their economies and reduced poverty on the basis of these systems and institutions if things go badly who will asian policymakers turn to for help the continued stigma and painful memories of the asian financial crisis mean few would dare turn to the imf regional mechanisms like the chang mai initiative multilaterization cmim are untested and potentially unworkable in practice regional mechanisms and development banks remain linked to the imf if any significant financial support is required bilateral currency swap lines are often small patchy and uncertain in asia and would be of little assistance if a shock was to affect many countries the message for many is asia is that if things go badly you re on your own this message has been received loud and clear by policymakers in indonesia the indonesian parliament passed the prevention and resolution of financial system crisis law in 2016 to ensure better cooperation collaboration and preparation between indonesia s regulators and institutions the objective of the new law is commendable but it also has serious deficiencies in this week s lead essay adam triggs febrio kacaribu and jiao wang report on their recent survey of indonesian officials regulators banks and academics which explored how indonesia would manage a financial crisis they remind us that when a financial crisis hits speed is everything if authorities are slow to act liquidity shortages can become solvency crises banking crises can become currency crises currency crises can become sovereign debt crises and what started as a financial crisis quickly becomes an economic and political crisis staying ahead of the curve they warn is critical speed and flexibility are the critical ingredients missing from indonesia s crisis management framework and it stands as a warning the rest of the region a bank suffering a liquidity shortage would ordinarily receive assistance from bank indonesia the central bank they note but under the new law the remedy is not so simple particularly given bank bailouts have now been outlawed triggs kacaribu and wang outline the long and bureaucratic process that would need to be followed in the event of a financial shock the process requires advice to be prepared for a new crisis committee by the financial services authority it requires agreement from multiple regulators before any support is provided it requires adequate collateral to be provided by the bank requesting assistance and would likely see other indonesian banks asked to chip in financial support and potentially require political approval from the president of indonesia they explain how the law s motivation dates back to the indonesian government s us 700 million bailout of bank century in 2008 indonesia s then 13th largest bank unexpected losses over the bailout of bank century led to riots outside parliament and numerous investigations against senior policymakers and officials this in turn has led nervous officials who facing inadequate legal protection were moved to create the current law giving themselves political and institutional cover at the cost of reduced speed and flexibility for its part indonesia in recent times has managed a challenging global environment well capital outflows have been relatively low indonesia s stock market has outperformed its peers growth forecasts are stable inflation is low unemployment is below its five year average and the government budget has improved through a smaller deficit and cheaper borrowing costs but with risks rising at home and abroad indonesia s crisis management framework like those in other asian economies could be tested sooner rather than later president joko widodo jokowi has comfortably won the recent presidential election over his more nationalistic rival former military man and former president suharto s son in law prabowo subianto but while jokowi clinched around 55 per cent of the vote indonesia s election focused more on personalities and political intrigue than the economy this is a problem risks are rising and indonesia s new crisis management framework has serious flaws if jokowi s next term as president is to be successful he d best fix these deficiencies sooner rather than later the eaf editorial board is located in the crawford school

global bond market bubbleâ s ultimate culmination historically speaking a normal fed tightening cycles consist of raising the fed funds rate ffr by 350 425bps it is at that point that the yield curve usually inverts thus disincentivizing future lending and closing down the credit conduit at that point the fed backs off from future rate hikes then about a year later a stock market meltdown begins and six months after that a recession ensues during this current cycle the fed open market committee fomc has raised rates by just 250bps before turning dovish therefore wall street takes solace in the view that this time around the fed stopped in time before it killed the business cycle however that 250bps of hiking is before you factor in the end of quantitative easing qe and the current quantitative tightening program qt which is still an ongoing process and won t end until september when you factor in the tightening that occurred when the fed ended qe in october of 2014 which amounted to 85b per month of newly printed money at its peak and added a total of 3 7 trillion to the fed s balance sheet the actual amount of tightening from ending qe is probably close to 300bps and the qt from the fed will end up draining nearly 1 trillion from its balance sheet and reached 40 50 billion per month at its peak a reduction in the fed s balance sheet of anything close to 1 trillion is completely unprecedented and amounted to a tremendous drain on liquidity nobody knows exactly the amount of rate hikes this equates to but it most likely added another 75bps of monetary tightening société générale calculates that the shadow fed s fund rate dropped to three percent and therefore the amount of rate hikes to date have been 525 550bps 300bps more than the stated ffr of 2 25 2 5 but that is before you add in the fed s qt program therefore when you add it all up you get the equivalent of 600 625bps of rate hikes in this current tightening cycle well above the high end of the historical range where the business cycle turns towards recession my friend and director of the national economic council larry kudlow recently stated that interest rates might not rise again in his lifetime he is 71 years old and i hope he lives for a very long time but you get the point larry believes interest rates won t rise for decades to come vice president mike pence said in an interview with cnbc that the fed should cut interest rates by 50bps and agrees with president trump about ending the qt program immediately pence also said this there s no evidence of inflation in this economy ok mr vp you don t have to be sherlock holmes to discover the evidence home prices have jumped 48 in the past six years all forms of insurance coverage have skyrocketed and college tuition has been rising 8x faster than wages but even if he took the time to view the manipulated government data on cpi and ppi he d see consumer prices are up 1 9 year year and producer prices have risen 2 2 year year nevertheless president trump is pushing for a return to qe and he may find out that he has more friends on the fed than he currently believes chicago fed president charles evans had this pithy bit of wisdom regarding how he views his responsibility to protect the purchasing power of the dollar inflation is weaker than i would like he said recently on a tv interview as to why more inflation would help grow the economy these lovers of counterfeiting can never clearly articulate with the ffr hovering at less than half its historical level and the fed s balance sheet at 4 trillion one would hope the government would think the last thing this economy needs is to cast more doubt on the faith in the us dollar s purchasing power inflation pushes the middle class further and faster along its inexorable path towards extinction to add to this distorted view our president recently tweeted that the dow would be 5 10k points higher if the fed had not engaged in qt one also has to wonder how much more unhinged the president wants the stock market to become in relation to the underlying economy after all the total market cap of equities now stands at an incredible and dangerous 1 5 times gdp the danger to the entire economy emanating from the inevitable crash from such lofty heights is growing exponentially meanwhile the debt dung pile in chinese debt just got a whole lot deeper again i don t blame the great people of china but rather its government for this the march total debt number was 80 higher than the year ago figure and the ytd debt increase was 40 higher than the year ago period aggregate financing in the first quarter amounted to 8 18 trillion yuan us 1 2 trillion which was an increase of 2 34 trillion yuan year year as to how wall street believes adding to china s debt at this point can be a viable and sustainable plan is inconceivable after all china s debt has already quadrupled in the past seven years so it is not as if beijing has not tried this stimulus trick before the government has indeed levered up many times before in a big way and has produced a more unstable and unhealthy economy with each iteration turning to the us our march fiscal year to date deficit came in at 691 billion that is for just the 1st half or the fiscal year so governments around the world have unbelievably and inconceivably taken fiscal and monetary madness a giant leap further and deeper into the depths of inescapable insolvency is it any wonder why stock prices are rallying there has been an absolute deluge of promises from global governments since the market collapse of q4 2018 that there will be more free money on offer even though they are fully aware that taking on more debt at this point guarantees the future will be beyond bleak for now the economy walks a very thin line along the cliff s edge unless you believe central banks can stay at the 0 bound interest rate range forever and never cause a reduction in a currency s purchasing power intractable inflation is inevitable once achieved it will produce an interest rate surge from all time lows that will engender an equally disastrous plunge in asset prices any fixed income instrument and equity that the government is not actively purchasing will crash in price this is exactly what occurred in october of 1987 where the dow lost 23 of its value in one day but unfortunately the carnage should be much worse than 1987 given the relative level of debt and overvaluation of equities that exists today the number and dollar amount of business defaults occurring as a result of such a meltdown should be unprecedented there is a real danger the economy will contract into a depression given the record level of debt it is lugging along the us carries total debt that is worth 350 of gdp which is the same pre great recession level this figure was 160 of gdp in 1980 and just over 200 in 1987 but this time around central banks have little to no room left to reduce borrowing costs and spur on new lending on the other hand a recession could begin even before inflation runs intractable the global economy is already slowing and earnings growth has slowed to a negative level if the amount of fed tightening i estimated earlier is anywhere near correct the business cycle should soon turn south following a stock market peak and crash that is only a few quarters away the massive re leveraging in china has served to hold off the carnage a bit longer but beijing now risks a crash in the yuan if you are investing in this market it is necessary to try and eke out any gains left and

economic renaissance by henry boyo 08052201997 the imf managing director christine lagarde recommended at the latest international monetary fund world bank annual spring meeting in washington united states that the removal of subsidy from petrol price would restrain nigeria s rapid debt accretion so that erstwhile trillions of naira subsidy allocations could be deployed annually to improve the quality of health education and infrastructure the above advice notwithstanding imf appears to wail more than the bereaved as nigeria s finance and budget ministers continue to soothe public anxiety with sweet assurances that all is well nevertheless in april 2019 the minister of state for petroleum resources ibe kachukwu confirmed that despite the sustenance of a pump price of n145 litre the actual landing cost of petrol is now n180 litre although petrol currently sells without subsidy for almost 1 0 litre i e over n300 litre at petrol filling stations in neighbouring ecowas countries the wide price variance has expectedly encouraged large scale cross border smuggling and pushed nigeria s imports from the regular volume of about 30 to over 50 million litres daily indeed when storage transportation and other ancillary costs including sales margins are consolidated nigeria may well be flushing out well over n100 litre as subsidy on the alleged 50 million litre per day consumption i e subsidy of n5bn day or n1 8trn annually with the petrol marketers outstanding and substantial subsidy claims which continue to earn interest charges it is no surprise that the nigerian national petrol corporation has now become the sole importer of petrol however minister of finance zainab ahmed obviously recognises the oppressive challenge of subsidy to prudent fiscal management after the federal executive council meeting held on april 17 2019 she noted we need to find how we can exit fuel subsidy but how do we do that ahmed added we have not found a way to do it on the subsidy issue it is everybody that is benefitting rather than the vulnerable that need the help therefore we have to find a formula that will work for nigeria until then we should not contemplate removing subsidy because there will be people that will suffer the critical question obviously is what do we do now that the federal government has admitted that it is clueless regarding the solution to the albatross of fuel subsidy the following are excerpts from the article titled fuel subsidy as a function of illegal exchange rate manipulation which was first published on 03 04 2013 the way out of the fuel subsidy dilemma is explained in that piece please read on see www lesleba com www betternigerianow com read also nigeria s oil exports threatened as aiteo declares force majeure the above narrative suggests that there is no imminent solution to fuel subsidy imbroglio however such conclusion can only be correct if the issue of naira exchange rate determination is deliberately excluded from the permutations of solutions a simple example will explain this observation for example if petrol pms sells at the international commodity price of about 1 litre and the naira rate is n160 1 this would translate to the domestic price of about n160 litre however if the naira exchanges for n80 1 then the price equation will become 1litre 1 n80 which is well below the current tolerated subsidised price of n97 litre in 2013 consequently n17 litre can be realised as sales tax to ultimately generate well over n20bn surplus in place of over n200bn frittered subsidy payments which will conversely now become available for positive infrastructural enhancement indeed if pump price of petrol remains unchanged at about 1 litre but if naira exchange rate falls to n200 1 the domestic pump price will invariably rise to n200 litre to deepen subsidy payments beyond n4tn i e if the price of petrol remains unchanged at n97 litre the obvious question therefore is how do we strengthen the naira rate so that domestic fuel prices will fall and make subsidy unnecessary the answer has been canvassed in several articles in this column notably however the naira exchange rate mechanism is clearly driven by the monopolistic posturing of the central bank of nigeria in the forex market the cbn s unconstitutional tradition of capturing distributable dollar revenue and deliberately substituting same with naira allocations at a contrived exchange rate gives the apex bank control of over 80 per cent of dollar values traded in the foreign exchange market and it creates therefrom those economic distortions peculiar to monopolistic markets everywhere the weaker naira rate which also evolves from the existing system ultimately compels higher fuel prices with the inevitable related humongous subsidy values nonetheless there are unassailable reasons to believe that if distributable dollar revenue is paid to constitutional beneficiaries with the instrument of dollar certificates rather than bloated naira allocations at contrived rates the naira exchange rate will become stronger and actually drive domestic fuel price below a level that will ultimately eliminate any subsidy and also thereafter open the door to the establishment of private refineries see also avoidable oppressive burden of fuel subsidy at www lesleba com www betternigerianow com the following excerpt is also from another article titled kill subsidy before it kills us that piece was published on 16 04 2018 please read on consequently our economic management team may have inadvertently boxed itself into a dilemma as we seem incapable of reducing the price of pms and kerosene consumption despite the very heavy leakages from massive cross border smuggling meanwhile government has understandably shied away from another confrontation with the masses particularly after the goodluck jonathan administration survived the charged and volatile social tension of the january 2012 pro subsidy strike thus we may not require a soothsayer to correctly predict as i have consistently maintained for almost 2 decades that inclusive economic growth or indeed diversification with rapidly enhanced social infrastructure will clearly remain unattainable so long as increasing debt service charges and fuel subsidy payments continue to account for the lion s share of budgeted annual national expenditure expectedly however a progressive upward evolution of naira exchange rate to about n80 1 will not only eliminate fuel subsidy but it will also enable government just as in the united kingdom and elsewhere to earn a reasonable sales tax of about 10 per cent per litre over n350m day minimum revenue in place of n40 litre subsidy on over 35 million litres of fuel that was allegedly locally consumed and smuggled from nigeria daily thus with the increasingly suicidal impact of fuel subsidy payments on economic growth and social welfare no well meaning nigerian can sincerely stand on the sideline especially if president jonathan and the legislature remain unfortunately lethargic about this reform despite the real possibility that our present oil revenue inflow can induce a stronger naira rate and precipitate much lower fuel prices devoid of any subsidy component if only dollar revenue from crude export are infused into the domestic economy via dollar warrants rather than the current poisonous system of creating fresh naira supply as allocations for distributable dollar revenue every month in conclusion the next excerpt is from another article titled fuel subsidy dilemma the sensible way out published on may 18 2015 see www lesleba com www betternigerianow com clearly subsidy values will rise further if the naira continues its downward slide or if fortuitously or unfortunately crude oil prices rebound once again for example if the naira is left to float as currently proposed by the banker s committee in december 2015 the naira will exchange for over n300 per 1 particularly if the instigation of systemic excess naira remains an abiding feature of the cbn s monetary strategy clearly with such naira depreciation fuel prices will inevitably spiral about 50 per cent above the price on which subsidy was initially calculated consequently unless pump prices are adjusted upwards the federal government s subsidy burden will balloon once again to bring us back to square one where subsidy values exceed 20 per cent of annual federal budgets postscript april 2019 nothing has obviously changed as we have continued our reckless journey towards economic armageddon regrettably the naira rate is as predicted now n305 n360 per 1 while the omens also portend that another devaluation of the naira may be imminent happy easter copyright punch all rights reserved this

benefits of adding this premier colorado franchise to our footprint the integration of the outstanding team and strategic locations has been smooth and our first quarter results reflect the beginnings of the value that is being added to our company brooks continued in addition we had another solid quarter of earnings and continued strong credit metrics based on this performance we were pleased to be able to return value to our shareholders through execution of our share repurchase program and by increasing our quarterly dividend first quarter 2019 operating results net interest income net interest income was 121 7 million for first quarter 2019 compared to 74 0 million for first quarter 2018 and 87 1 million for fourth quarter 2018 representing a 39 7 increase for the quarter the increase in net interest income from the previous year and linked quarter was primarily due to increased average earning assets resulting primarily from the acquisition of guaranty bancorp the acquisition of integrity bancshares in second quarter 2018 also contributed to the increase in net interest income from the prior year period the average balance of total interest earning assets grew by 4 7 billion and totaled 12 2 billion for the quarter ended march 31 2019 compared to 7 5 billion for the quarter ended march 31 2018 and increased 3 5 billion compared to 8 7 billion for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the increase from the prior year and linked quarter was primarily due to 3 4 billion in earning assets acquired in the guaranty transaction as well as organic growth earning assets of 718 9 million acquired in the integrity transaction also contributed to the increase from the prior year the yield on interest earning assets was 5 17 for first quarter 2019 compared to 4 77 for first quarter 2018 and 5 15 for fourth quarter 2018 the increase from the prior year was due primarily to higher rates on interest earning assets due to continued increases in the fed funds rate during these periods as well as increased acquired loan accretion due to the guaranty acquisition the small increase from the linked quarter is due to larger amounts of acquired loan accretion but was negatively impacted by guaranty s acquired interest earning assets which had lower effective interest rates the cost of interest bearing liabilities including borrowings was 1 59 for first quarter 2019 compared to 1 05 for first quarter 2018 and 1 64 for fourth quarter 2018 the increase from the prior year is primarily due to higher rates offered on our deposits primarily commercial money market accounts and certificates of deposit resulting both from market competition and general increases in interest rates on deposit products tied to fed funds rates as well as rate increases on short term fhlb advances and junior subordinated debt the decrease from the linked quarter is primarily related to the interest bearing liabilities acquired with the guaranty acquisition which had lower interest rates related to their deposit mix and subordinated debt the net interest margin was 4 05 for first quarter 2019 compared to 4 00 for first quarter 2018 and 3 98 for fourth quarter 2018 the adjusted non gaap net interest margin which excludes unexpected accretion on loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality was 4 01 for first quarter 2019 compared to 3 96 for first quarter 2018 and 3 93 for fourth quarter 2018 excluding accretion related to the guaranty acquisition interest rate mark the net interest margin would have been 3 82 for first quarter 2019 noninterest income total noninterest income increased 7 0 million compared to first quarter 2018 and increased 6 5 million compared to fourth quarter 2018 the increase from the prior year primarily reflects increases of 2 4 million in service charges 2 2 million in investment advisory and trust services 620 thousand in earnings on bank owned life insurance and 1 6 million in other noninterest income all resulting primarily from the additional accounts acquired in the guaranty transaction the investment management subsidiary and trust division were acquired with guaranty the increase in other noninterest income is primarily due to an increase in acquired loan recoveries during first quarter 2019 the increase from the linked quarter primarily reflects increases of 2 3 million in service charges 2 2 million in investment advisory and trust services 517 thousand in earnings on bank owned life insurance and 1 4 million in other noninterest income all resulting primarily from the acquisition of guaranty bancorp the increase in other noninterest income is primarily due to an increase in acquired loan recoveries during first quarter 2019 in addition mortgage revenue of 3 1 million in first quarter 2019 compared to 3 4 million in the linked quarter was negatively impacted by our hedging loss of 369 thousand versus fourth quarter income of 394 thousand noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased 41 6 million compared to first quarter 2018 and increased 34 7 million compared to fourth quarter 2018 the increase in noninterest expense compared to first quarter 2018 is due primarily to increases of 17 2 million in salaries and benefits 3 3 million in occupancy expenses 1 4 million in data processing 1 9 million in amortization of other intangibles 14 4 million in acquisition expenses and 1 9 million in other noninterest expense the overall increase in salaries and benefits occupancy data processing amortization of other intangibles and noninterest expense from the prior year is reflective of additional headcount branch locations and accounts acquired in the guaranty transaction in january 2019 and the integrity transaction in june 2018 as well as organic growth during the year the increase in other noninterest expense is primarily due to higher deposit and loan related expenses for the year over year period salaries and benefits expense is also elevated due to severance and retention payments made or accrued totaling 3 2 million related primarily to the guaranty transaction and our announced branch restructuring in second quarter 2019 as well as the company s increase in the 401 k contribution match in third quarter 2018 the increase in acquisition expenses in the first quarter was primarily due to 8 7 million in change in control payments as well as an increase in professional fees contract termination fees and conversion related expenses related to guaranty the increase from the linked quarter is primarily related to increases of 12 8 million in salaries and benefits 2 5 million in occupancy 876 thousand in data processing 1 7 million in amortization of intangibles 14 5 million in acquisition expenses and 1 2 million in other noninterest expense the increases were primarily due to the acquisition of guaranty and other increases as discussed above provision for loan losses provision for loan loss was 3 2 million for first quarter 2019 an increase of 529 thousand compared to 2 7 million for first quarter 2018 and an increase of 314 thousand compared to 2 9 million for fourth quarter 2018 provision expense is primarily reflective of organic loan growth as well as charge offs or specific reserves taken during the respective period the allowance for loan losses was 46 5 million or 0 43 of total loans at march 31 2019 compared to 42 0 million or 0 64 of total loans at march 31 2018 and compared to 44 8 million or 0 58 of total loans at december 31 2018 the dollar increases from prior periods are primarily due to additional general reserves for organic loan growth in addition the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans from prior year reflects that loans acquired in the guaranty and integrity transactions were recorded at fair value without an allowance at acquisition date income taxes federal income tax expense of 11 1 million was recorded for the quarter ended march 31 2019 an effective rate of 23 1 compared to tax expense of 6 8 million and an effective rate of 19 0 for the quarter ended march 31 2018 and tax expense of 8 3 million and an effective rate of 19 6 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 the higher effective tax rate in first quarter 2019 was due to 1 4 million in deductibility limitations related to the change in control payments made as part of the guaranty transaction and 203 thousand in nondeductible acquisition expenses first quarter 2019 balance sheet highlights loans total loans held for investment net of mortgage warehouse purchase loans were 10 7 billion at march 31 2019 compared to 7 7 billion at december 31 2018 and 6 5 billion at march 31 2018 loans held for investment increased 3 0 billion or 38 5 for the

quarter and compared to 114 4 million for the quarter ended march 31 2018 an increase of 13 5 million or 11 8 year over year the change from the linked quarter and prior year quarter is reflective of increased mortgage loan market activity related to seasonality and fluctuating interest rates during the respective periods commercial real estate cre loans were 5 8 billion at march 31 2019 compared to 4 1 billion at december 31 2018 and 3 5 billion at march 31 2018 or 53 3 52 3 and 52 4 of total loans respectively asset quality total nonperforming assets was unchanged at 16 9 million or 0 12 of

unchanged position of nonperforming assets and the net decrease in nonperforming loans from the linked quarter is primarily due to payoffs of two nonaccrual single family interim construction loans and one commercial real estate loan totaling 3 9 million nonaccrual charge offs totaling 402 thousand and a 544 thousand nonaccrual residential real estate loan placed in foreclosure offset by a 3 0 million commercial loan placed on nonaccrual status in addition during first quarter 2019 other real estate owned increased by three properties totaling 1 7 million as a result of the guaranty acquisition as well as the addition noted above off set by a 436 thousand impairment the decrease in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans from the prior year is primarily due to a net decrease in nonaccrual loans of 4 2 million offset by net additions of other real estate owned of 539 thousand for the year over year period charge offs were 0 06 annualized in the first quarter 2019 compared to 0 01 annualized in both the linked quarter and the prior year quarter charge offs were slightly increased in the first quarter primarily due to the charge offs noted above in addition to a partial

december 31 2018 and a decrease of 79 2 million from march 31 2018 the change in the linked quarter and prior year reflects the use of short term fhlb advances as needed for liquidity the change in

update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise except as may be required by law non gaap financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with gaap this press release contains certain non gaap financial measures these measures and ratios include adjusted net income adjusted earnings tangible book value tangible book value per common share adjusted efficiency ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets adjusted net interest margin return on tangible equity adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average equity and are supplemental measures that are not required by or are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we consider the use of select non gaap financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial operational decision making and useful in evaluating period to period comparisons we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non gaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting analyzing and comparing past present and future periods we believe that these measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with gaap however we acknowledge that our financial measures have a number of limitations relative to gaap financial measures certain non gaap financial measures exclude items of income expenditures expenses assets or liabilities including provisions for loan losses and the effect of goodwill other intangible assets and income from accretion on acquired loans arising from purchase accounting adjustments that we believe cause certain aspects of our results of operations or financial condition to be not indicative of our primary operating results all of these items significantly impact our financial statements additionally the items that we exclude in our adjustments are not necessarily consistent with the items that our peers may exclude from their results of operations and key financial measures and therefore may limit the comparability of similarly named financial measures and ratios we compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent gaap measures whenever we present the non gaap financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non gaap financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures is included

new york new york a boost in the price of energy stocks failed to ignite a flat market on wall street on easter monday with many investors still on vacation enjoying an extended easter break many markets globally were closed including australia and ireland which marked its annual bank holiday on monday hikes in oil prices drove a 2 1 increase in the s p energy index following the u s decision to end waivers to countries buying oil from iran these customers account for a large sector of the world s population including the powerhouse economies of india and china as well as japan egypt and south korea otherwise there was little enthusiasm for stocks despite many companies reporting better than expected earnings it s important at this point to sit back and reflect on what the prospects are that will take us forward it s appropriate to see what we re seeing today ryan larson head of u s equity trading at rbc global asset management in chicago told reuters thomson at the end of the day monday the dow jones industrial average was off 48 49 points or 0 18 at 26 511 05 the standard and poor s 500 rose 2 94 points or 0 10 to 2 907 97 the nasdaq composite did best of all rising 17 21 points or 0 22 to 8 015 27 the u s dollar went nowhere monday although it softened a touch against the euro which rose to 1 1260 the british pound was unchanged at 1 2981 as was the swiss franc at 1 0153 and the japanese yen at 111 93 the commodity currencies were little changed holding to their weak close last week the australian dollar was last quoted at 0 7138 the canadian dollar at 1 3345 and the new zealand dollar at 0 6682
photo by mario tama getty images u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez and sen ed markey are calling for a green new deal that would involve massive government spending to shift the u s economy away from its reliance on carbon their congressional resolution goes into great detail about the harms of climate change and what the u s government should do about it left unanswered however is how america would pay for it some commentators have been calling a green new deal unaffordable with some estimates putting the bill for complete decarbonization at as high as 12 3 trillion as the author of the united nations environment programme s global green new deal a plan to lift the world economy out of the 2008 2009 great recession i disagree i believe there are two straightforward ways to cover the cost and help accelerate the green revolution while lowering the overall price tag what would a green new deal cost before we talk about how to pay for it first we need a rough idea of how much it might actually cost for starters it s important to be realistic rather than putting a price tag on going 100 percent renewable which would take decades i believe we should figure out how much to spend over the next five years to build a greener economy ambitious efforts to foster green energy during the great recession are a good place to start in total the world s largest 20 economies and a few others spent 3 3 trillion to stimulate economic growth of that more than 520 billion was devoted to green investments such as pollution cleanup recycling and low carbon energy the u s share of that was about 120 billion or about 1 percent of its gross domestic product around half of this went toward energy conservation and other short term energy efficiency investments to quickly shore up the then nascent recovery and generate employment more expensive than the great recession the stimulus may have spurred some growth in renewable energy but it didn t do much on its own to reduce carbon emissions permanently another country that made fairly big green investments during the great recession was south korea which promoted low carbon green growth as its new long term development vision it allocated 60 billion or 5 percent of its 2007 gdp to a five year plan but in the end south korea may have spent only 26 billion on low carbon energy and failed to adopt pricing reforms and other incentives to foster renewables such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies pricing carbon and improving regulatory frameworks the result was only a modest improvement in energy efficiency and carbon emissions have continued to rise in other words the price tag of a green new deal that would make a difference would have to be much higher than what governments like the u s and korea actually spent during the great recession the original south korea five year plan however to spend 5 percent of gdp seems about right as a best guess of the public investment needed to decarbonize a major economy through a green growth strategy so if we use korea as a starting point that means the u s would need to spend around 970 billion over the next five years or 194 billion annually how to pay for it the first thing to bear in mind is that a green new deal should be covered by current rather than future revenue a common way for congress to pay for the cost of a new program or stimulus is by deficit spending so the u s borrows the money from investors and then eventually has to pay it back through taxes down the road a carbon tax of 40 per ton would raise 172 billion annually as well as reduce 17 5 billion metric tons of carbon by 2030 with the federal deficit projected to reach 1 trillion in 2019 increasing it by several hundred billion more even if for a good cause is not a great idea ballooning deficits add to the national debt which is already 22 trillion and counting saddling future generations of americans with unsustainable levels of national debt is just as dangerous as burdening them with an economy that is environmentally unsustainable deficit spending is warranted to boost overall demand for goods and services when unemployment rises when consumers do not spend or when private investment is down it must pay for itself when that is not the case i believe efforts to grow green sectors should pay for themselves so the u s would have to find new revenue sources to finance additional government support for clean energy research and development greening infrastructure smart transmission grids public transport and other programs under any green new deal two of the main ways to do that would be by raising new revenues or finding savings elsewhere in the budget on the revenue side i believe passing a carbon tax is one of the best ways to go a 20 tax per metric ton of carbon that climbs over time at a pace slightly higher than inflation would raise around 96 billion in revenue each year covering just under half the estimated cost of the green new deal at the same time it would reduce carbon emissions by 11 1 billion metric tons through 2030 in other words not only does it help raise money to pay for a transition to a green economy a carbon tax also helps spur that very change in terms of savings the removal of fossil fuel subsidies is a particularly appropriate target consumer subsidies for fossil fuels and producer subsidies for coal cost u s taxpayers nearly 9 billion a year these subsidies could be shifted instead to cover some expenditures under a green new deal and again doing this would accelerate the transition to cleaner energy so where might the other 89 billion come from one option is to simply impose a higher carbon tax a 20 tax would put the u s roughly in the middle among countries that currently impose carbon taxes but doubling it to 40 per ton would raise an additional 76 billion annually or 172 billion in total as well as reduce 17 5 billion metric tons of carbon by 2030 another idea is to raise taxes on the highest earning americans for example imposing a 70 percent tax on earnings of 10 million or more would bring in an additional 72 billion a year but it s also possible that the cost of decarbonizing the economy may fall over time for example the drop in emissions accompanying the carbon tax should lower the price tag in a way that s hard to estimate today the right policies and reforms would also help lower the costs the cost would fall over time in a sort of chicken and egg effect as economists ken gillingham and james stock have shown green innovations spur demand which leads to more innovation all of which ultimately reduce costs one illustration is electric vehicle purchases which will stimulate demand for charging stations once installed the stations will reduce the costs of running electric vehicles and further boost demand the green new deal as proposed by rep ocasio cortez and sen markey would be expensive but what policies are adopted and how we choose to pay for it could ultimately determine the plan s success and whether we can afford it this piece originally appeared in the conversation

sanctions are coming but also reportedly has made exceptions for 8 countries now what looks to be a major part of those exceptions is apparently going to be eliminated us won t renew sanctions waivers for importing iranian oil april 22 2109 the trump administration on monday told five nations including allies japan south korea and turkey that they will no longer be exempt from u s sanctions if they continue to import oil from iran president donald trump has decided not to reissue the waivers when they expire in early may white house press secretary sarah sanders said the decision is intended to bring iran s oil exports to zero denying its principal source of revenue sanders said in a statement secretary of state mike pompeo planned to provide details about the administration s decision not to renew sanctions waivers for the five countries when they expire on may 2 the other countries are china and india since november three of the eight italy greece and taiwan have stopped importing oil from iran the other five however have not and have lobbied for their waivers to be extended japan south korea and taiwan likely feel that they need the usa market and usa defense more than iranian oil turkey as a member of nato still will get usa defense even if it violates the sanctions india and china are likely to take various counter steps if the usa really does impose sanctions against them greece italy and other parts of europe are already frustrated with the usa because of iranian sanctions and other matters and this is one more irritant currently the usa benefits from most international trade as most of the time nations use us dollars for trade every time a nation stops doing that or reduces doing that it has a negative effect on the economy of the usa irrespective of what one thinks of the iranian nuclear deal there is a price to pay for us sanctions and they do affect the dollar notice a sanctions threat from donald trump last fall november 2 2018 trump said that in addition to the november sanctions the u s will pursue additional sanctions tougher than ever before to counter the entire range of iran s malign conduct any individual or entity who fails to comply with these sanctions will face severe consequences he warned that last comment from donald trump seems like a threat mainly to europeans other than italy which seems to have been exempted notice also the following since the president pulled out of the jcpoa the eu has been working feverishly behind the scenes to protect the relationship between europe and iran including publicly calling for a special purpose vehicle to help businesses avoid american sanctions and the implementation of a blocking statute also intended to protect european businesses the eu goal is to continue with the iran deal alone without the u s by creating a financial channel between their central banks with the central bank of iran the trump administration has made it clear however that they will compel the europeans to comply with the new sanctions either by carrot or by stick this means one more rift in the transatlantic alliance 11 01 18 donald trump s comments and actions related to all of this have upset many in europe here are three videos that you may wish to watch a recent headline was is trump pushing germany to russia there have been comments by german and russian leaders that they have aligned interests that donald trump opposes and need to take financial military and other steps to assist europe russia and the eu european union still support the iran nuclear deal paris climate accords and the world trade organization despite donald trump s actions against them have there been comments to replace the usa s swift system by the russians and germans what is russia s mir payment system what about talks for the eu to have trade and other arrangements with the eaeu eurasian economic union did the old radio church of god foretell of the development of a russian and german plan to eliminate the usa has russia indicated that it wants alaska back is the giving of usa territories to russia by a coming european leader consistent with a prophecy in the book of daniel here is a link to our video is donald trump pushing europe to russia the reaction of many leaders in europe to us president donald trump s trade statements and his withdrawal from the iranian nuclear arms deal has led some to state this is a revolt from europe some say america first should lead to europe first it has been reported that europe needs to be clever as it develops its military and economy to be less dependent upon the usa eu council president donald tusk tweeted that with friends like the usa who needs enemies eu commission president jean claude juncker said we have to replace the united states will some of the unintended consequences of donald trump s actions lead to world war three and the end of the usa does the bible teach this does the bible teach that friendly allies will become enemies will an ally that defeats the usa say it happened because of being clever are things the same or are we seeing real changes that align with properly understood biblical prophecies dr thiel addresses these issues and more here is a link will europe s revolt against donald trump lead to wwiii europe is looking for ways around the iranian sanctions see usa reimposing sanctions against iran while eu resists and european powers prepare to ditch dollar in trade with iran furthermore the usa does not seem to realize that it is undermining its position as the world s primary reserve currency through its sanctions and other policies this is an unintended consequence of donald trump s policies as is the pushing of the eu closer to russia and iran usa sanctions are pushing

here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news markets aren t as happy now the easter holiday is over although we were on holiday yesterday most asian markets weren t tokyo closed flat while hong kong was closed shanghai took it on the chin yesterday dropping 1 7 in turn that was because of fears beijing will wind back its stimulus and this morning wall street is barely able to find any direction or enthusiasm trading flat in the afternoon session in the us the latest update to the chicago fed s national activity index is a dull affair with the latest data slightly worse than expected but still better than in february existing home sales fell 5 in march despite falling mortgage rates and median prices are up only 3 8 the industry claims the weak market is because there are not enough houses available for sale especially at the cheaper end of the market about half of all homes sold within a month it is a puzzle as to why this demand pressure isn t raising prices it is a national puzzle that may say something about american confidence in housing it is not all negative retail sales in the us were up much more than analysts were expecting posting a 1 6 month on month annualised gain in march when half that was expected that is most of the 3 6 gain from the same month a year ago however given that us inflation is 1 9 this is a modest real rise in retail sales and their inventory to sales ratio surprised by not getting worse but us new housing start data wasn t so good for march down a concerning 15 from the same month a year ago and the early look at april business activity in the us shows it s growth is slowing sharply in fact that is now at a 31 month low driven by their giant services sector output new orders and hiring all show sharp pullbacks this downtrend is supported by the philadelphia feds regional index which also came in way below expectations it declined to a reading of 8 5 in april from 13 7 in march this index was at 32 3 in may 2018 so it has come a long way off over the border to the north canadian retail sales data also brought a stronger that expected rise in february data released overnight but to be fair most of this rise is accounted for by inflation trade over that border is supposed to be subject to the new updated nafta but a new official review casts doubt on the likely benefit for the us and that may reinforce the trouble the administration has getting congressional consent apparently its not a great deal at all for the americans even if it is for mexico and canada both the imf and oecd have warned china that excessive stimulus could undermine the country s attempts to deal with financial risks but after better than expected growth in q1 expectations are raised that beijing will now go ahead with important structural reforms and it is resilient enough to put up with the short term adjustment costs however china has lost a key wto ruling in a dispute with the us over tariff levels for wheat rice and corn which it continues to protect and the only indication coming out of beijing is that stimulus support will remain but may be scaled back globally ship orders have fallen to their lowest level in 15 years although those for lng gas tankers are a bright spot in australia a ray of hope for their manufacturing sector after declining for a many months the latest pmi data shows it expanding again but overall business activity indicators have deteriorated more seriously than indicators on employment according to the latest quarterly nab business survey just how stressed their apartment industry is has been revealed by new data on what developers are paying agents to try to get potential buyers over the line with a sales transaction the ust 10yr yield has drifted up by 3 bps over the holiday weekend and is now at 2 59 their 2 10 curve is firmer at 20 bps but their negative 1 5 curve is little changed at 7 bps the aussie govt 10yr is at 1 95 and up 3 bps the china govt 10yr is also up 3 bps to 3 42 but the nz govt 10 yr hasn t followed these others and is unchanged at 2 00 gold is marginally softer at us 1 274 us oil prices are a lot firmer today now just over us 65 50 bbl while the brent benchmark is just over us 74 bbl and that is a us 2 rise on an american statement they are set to tighten the screws on iran by ending waivers for its sanctions on the country the kiwi dollar is weaker at 66 8 usc on the cross rates we are at 93 6 auc against the euro we are at 59 3 euro cents that puts the twi 5 at 71 4 bitcoin is at us 5 365 and a gain of 2 7 overnight in local currency the price of bitcoin now exceeds nz 8 000 which is its highest point since mid november 2018 this rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here
when i was growing up my parents told me finish your dinner people in china and india are starving i tell my daughters finish your homework people in india and china are starving for your job thomas friedman the story is told of a woman who came to her younger sister s house to commiserate with her over the untimely demise of her little son at the age of 6 as other sympathizers wore a mournful look and were discussing in low tones this woman started shouting to the consternation of everyone in the room i knew it i knew it i knew it another woman rushed to her feeling she was almost losing it out of the shock of the loss and asked aunty what is it what do you know she went on i warned my sister about marrying this her chinese husband but she wouldn t listen the inquisitive lady then retorts what has your sister s husband got to do with her son s death her response shocked everyone in the room chinese products don t last many of the people had to temporarily suspend their grief to manage a laugh the preceding thomas friedman quote and the morbid humour that followed it should not be seen as sinophobic slurs but instead a compliment to the amazing transformation that has become the chinese story poor quality products imitation of original products fake products cheap and inferior products were until very recently associated with china the truth however is that china has made a lot of progress from the above characterisation before we dwell further on china it is apposite to briefly look at the experience of japan those who are old enough would remember that this was exactly how japanese products including cars were derided in those days when europe and america dominated the manufacturing sector of the global economy at the end of the 2nd world war following the crushing defeat of japan the hitherto warmongering nation was banned from keeping any significant army not to talk of waging wars japan was forced to become a pacifist nation and its hitherto world dominance waned japan was forced into industrialisation as a way of lifting its economy and reasserting her pride in the world diverting her warring skills into manufacturing it began making a range of items largely for domestic and personal use the first wave of such products were met with derision worldwide as the sobriquet fabrique au japon became synonymous with imitation and inferior products this did not deter the resilient japanese and with people like akio morita of sony honda toyota and suzuki leading the charge it did not take long before the hitherto substandard japanese products became the dominant brands in the world the hondas the toyotas the nissans and the mitsubishis took over the market they went further into the luxury premium brands like the lexus infiniti and acura to give mercedes and bavaria motor works a run for their money as if that was not enough other counties like south korea started making their own vehicles until very recently the market did not place a lot of premium on korean cars their brands like the hyundai daewoo kia and ssangyong have become popular not just because they come in cheaper than the more popular brands but because they are also efficient in terms of fuel consumption and maintenance back to china a country which has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a dizzying annual growth rate of close to 7 according to the world bank china s gdp grew from 150 billion in 1978 to 12 24 trillion by 2017 analysts had predicted that 2018 gdp growth figures would be lackluster this is because of the us trade war china however defied the projections of analysts throughout 2018 with average quarterly growth of 6 6 even though this was the worst performance in about 30 years it was still better than analysts expectation note that the us grew at an average of 2 9 in the same period so how come china s economy defied the prediction of experts by recording such spectacular growth even in the face of sustained aggressive us tariff warfare one needs to look more than four decades back to know why during the mao era china embarked on a cultural and economic revolution that was fundamental and comprehensive it gradually turned the socialist supertanker into a nimble capitalist freighter while the world overlooked the changes china dug deep into her capitalist past and prepared her society and people for global competition by the time carter was making approaches to open up the chinese economy to the west it was ready the latter day leaders like deng simply keyed into the reform blueprint that had been laid out years earlier to create an economy that the west could not overrun even in the area of free competition the first thing that the managers of the economy in china did was to roll out a stimulus package that focused on infrastructure projects they prepared their workforce for manufacturing and globalization they also invested in 5g telecommunications and encouraged investment in real estate all the investments yielded fruits as more money found their way into the hands of the people which in turn energized consumption the result is a consistent gdp growth even in the first quarter of 2019 china has been the world s second largest economy by nominal gdp since 2010 as it has remained the largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity ppp since 2014 china is also the world s largest exporter and second largest importer of goods in the area of armaments china is already a nuclear power maintaining the world s largest standing army and second largest defense budget it is a permanent member of the united nations security council it is also the most populous country in the word with over 1 4 billion people occupying a land space of about 9 3m square km second to russia with a land size of 16 3m square km china is obviously a behemoth of a country and you ignore it only at your own peril china s position has been consolidated in the international financial market as at the end of february 2019 the united states owes china a whopping 1 13 trillion this figure is 28 of the 4 02 trillion us treasury bills and bonds held by foreign countries china is closely followed by japan which holds 1 07 trillion the rest of the 22 trillion us national debt is held locally it is clear that this kind of country is a big challenge to the hegemony of the united states again cheap labour and efficiency have made the us and some parts of europe outsource a large chunk of its manufacturing to china between 2001 when it joined the world trade organisation and 2013 china sucked up about 3 2 million jobs from the us 75 of those jobs were in manufacturing trump had accused china of unfair market distorting trade practices manipulation of its currency to make exports cheaper suppression of labour rights and state enforcement of lower wages we shall leave the argument of whether trump is right or wrong for another day but one must point out that those are some of the challenges of the market economy which china had adopted let us examine the state of nigeria china relations formal diplomatic relationship started in 1971 during the military era the nigerian regime found common interest in the chinese regime which at that time was also unpopular with the international community strategic partnership did not start fully until 2005 trade between nigeria and china had steadily been on the increase from 7 8 billion in 2010 it rose to 12 5 billion in 2017 and further rose to 15 3b in 2018 at the moment nigeria is the biggest chinese investment destination in africa the second largest export market and the third largest trading partner of china in the whole of africa chinese banks and contractors have helped to fund and construct the 186 km abuja kaduna rail line which was delivered in 2016 less than a year ago we signed a contract of 6 68b with the china civil engineering construction corporation ccecc for the construction of the ibadan kaduna segment of the lagos kano rail line meanwhile a 1 685 billion contract was signed in 2016 to link kaduna with kano on the standard gauge rail system the 156km lagos ibadan segment started in march 2017 would be delivered this year at the cost 1 5 billion the total cost of the entire 2 733km project is 11 12 billion again chinese companies are working on the international terminals of four of our airports additionally they are handling roads bridges power and agriculture projects with funding of 4 4b the chinese are involved in the zungeru hydro electric power project fiber cables for internet infrastructure and lekki deep water port project there is no doubt that china has a lot to offer an infrastructure deficit nation like nigeria it has technology and skilled manpower in addition to excess industrial and manufacturing capacity most importantly china has funds which it is willing to release to needy economies at a reasonable cost however there have been concerns over increasing loans from china one major area of concern is what happens in case of default people always point to zambia as a case in point where default has led to asset swap also known as takeovers and seizures the fear is that most of the infrastructure built by chinese are at the risk of being taken over if there is default in meeting the terms of the loans zambian authorities have continued to deny these allegations for what it is worth we should not ignore this concern as it is always a possibility with loans again it is important that we use our clout to ensure we negotiate favorable conditions given how important we are to our partners in the global arena the second fear is that of dumping and crowding out of domestic manufacturers by cheap and sometimes poor quality goods this fear is not unfounded as it is on record that the entry of china led to the closure of about 65 textile mills in nigeria over a period of 10 years and the loss of over 150 000 jobs there is also the security concern it is alleged that the african union headquarters in addis ababa built by the chinese was bugged as construction was going on there is no confirmation of this allegation and china has come out to vehemently deny it furthermore the chinese are known to export their goods and technology with their people partnership to them requires that virtually everything including manual labour and basic raw materials which can be sourced locally are hardly allowed from the host country closely related to this is that there is hardly any room for technology transfer and the partner country would depend on china even for routine maintenance as we were completing this piece news came in that at the just concluded spring meetings of the world bank imf tobias andrian a director of the imf warned nigeria and other emerging markets taking loans from china to consider the terms of such facilities especially their compliance with the paris club of creditors conditions even though he did not condemn borrowing from china he was emphatic that the terms of loans from china are always questionable his worry was that if there is any debt restructuring in future the chinese may just take a pound of flesh according to andrian nigeria had been borrowing from international markets which gives the imf some worries at the moment funding conditions in economies such as nigeria and other sub saharan african countries are very favourable but that might change at some point and there is risk of rollovers and whether the need for refinancing can be met in future we consider the advice a good one even though one can argue that it is laced with some subtle political considerations in the first place following the trade war between the us and china the latter has to look for alternatives to compensate for the 500b trade with the us which had been placed at risk africa provides that alternative as total trade between africa and china is already heading towards the 200b mark with the right incentives and planning africa can replace us in china s trade equation soon africa also holds additional promise of being in a position to sell agricultural products to china replacing its reliance on the us and its partners so there is a perfect match recall that china has over 1trillion low yielding investment in us treasury bills and bonds it can comfortably reduce that and swap same for investments in africa this cause of action gives it two advantages the first is that china has been enduring low us interest rates for a long time now obviously because of the trade opportunities with the us africa has the appetite for funds at higher rates and can comfortably absolve the 1 trillion investment secondly if it is true that china deliberately reduces prices of its goods to dominate the the us market a reason the us imposed the 25 tariff on chinese goods then it can comfortably channel the same goods to africa with a population four times as large as that of the us and still come out much better africa particularly nigeria has a lot of natural resources waiting to be tapped and exploited and china has both the skills and technology to take full advantage of that given all these my take is that while we appreciate the brotherly advice of the imf and should do everything to ensure that we are not left with the short end of the stick in our relationship with china there are mutual economic interests in dealing with china china provides us with opportunities to trade provides us with funding and is also in a position to provide us with technology manpower and infrastructure to support our own growth as a former lender i can understand how it feels when disruptive competition is contemplated on the part of china their president xi jinping had pleaded their innocence thus some foreigners with full read pot bellies and nothing better to do engage in finger pointing at us first china does not export revolution second it does not export famine and poverty and third it does not mess around with you so what else is there to say permit me to use this opportunity to wish my christian readers a happy easter celebration

an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if the fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations preferred securities high yield securities corporate bonds government bonds municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk inflation risk and prepayment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives exchange traded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factors real estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that a mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a fund s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a fund s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fund a fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in kind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less tax efficient than an investment in an exchange traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in kind securities a fund s investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors certain funds may invest in other investment companies including closed end funds cefs etfs and affiliated etfs which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds a fund may invest in u s government obligations u s treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and u s government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government income from the first trust managed municipal etf fmb the first trust california municipal high income etf fcal the first trust municipal high income etf fmhi the first trust short duration managed municipal etf fsmb and the first trust ultra short duration municipal etf fumb may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax fmb fcal fmhi fsmb and fumb may invest in zero coupon bonds which may be highly volatile as interest rates rise and fall fcal invests principally in municipal debt securities from issuers located in california such concentration exposes the fund to political fiscal and economic conditions affecting california municipal issuers and may affect the value of the fund s investments short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns in times of unusual or adverse market economic regulatory or political conditions a fund may not be able fully or partially to implement its short selling strategy certain funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its books certain funds are classified as non diversified and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers

when i was growing up my parents told me finish your dinner people in china and india are starving i tell my daughters finish your homework people in india and china are starving for your job thomas friedman thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe the story is told of a woman who came to her younger sister s house to commiserate with her over the untimely demise of her little son at the age of 6 as other sympathizers wore a mournful look and were discussing in low tunes this woman started shouting to the consternation of everyone in the room i knew it i knew it i knew it another woman rushed to her feeling she was almost losing it out of the shock of the loss and asked aunty what is it what do you know she went on i warned my sister about marrying this her chinese husband but she wouldn t listen the inquisitive lady then retorts what has your sister s husband got to do with her son s death her response shocked everyone in the room chinese products don t last many of the people had to temporarily suspend their grief to manage a laugh the preceding thomas friedman quote and the morbid humour that followed it should not be seen as sinophobic slurs but instead a compliment to the amazing transformation that has become the chinese story poor quality products imitation of original products fake products cheap and inferior products were until very recently associated with china the truth however is that china has made a lot of progress from the above characterisation before we dwell further on china it is apposite to briefly look at the experience of japan those who are old enough would remember that this was exactly how japanese products including cars were derided in those days when europe and america dominated the manufacturing sector of the global economy at the end of the 2nd world war following the crushing defeat of japan the hitherto warmongering nation was banned from keeping any significant army not to talk of waging wars japan was forced to become a pacifist nation and its hitherto world dominance waned japan was forced into industrialisation as a way of lifting its economy and reasserting her pride in the world diverting her warring skills into manufacturing it began making a range of items largely for domestic and personal use the first wave of such products were met with derision worldwide as the sobriquet fabrique au japon became synonymous with imitation and inferior products this did not deter the resilient japanese and with people like akio morita of sony honda toyota and suzuki leading the charge it did not take long before the hitherto substandard japanese products became the dominant brands in the world the hondas the toyotas the nissans and the mitsubishis took over the market they went further into the luxury premium brands like the lexus infiniti and acura to give mercedes and bavaria motor works a run for their money as if that was not enough other counties like south korea started making their own vehicles until very recently the market did not place a lot of premium on korean cars their brands like the hyundai daewoo kia and ssangyong have become popular not just because they come in cheaper than the more popular brands but because they are also efficient in terms of fuel consumption and maintenance back to china a country which has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a dizzying annual growth rate of close to 7 according to the world bank china s gdp grew from 150 billion in 1978 to 12 24 trillion by 2017 analysts had predicted that 2018 gdp growth figures would be lackluster this is because of the us trade war china however defied the projections of analysts throughout 2018 with average quarterly growth of 6 6 even though this was the worst performance in about 30 years it was still better than analysts expectation note that the us grew at an average of 2 9 in the same period so how come china s economy defied the prediction of experts by recording such spectacular growth even in the face of sustained aggressive us tariff warfare one needs to look more than four decades back to know why during the mao era china embarked on a cultural and economic revolution that was fundamental and comprehensive it gradually turned the socialist supertanker into a nimble capitalist freighter while the world overlooked the changes china dug deep into her capitalist past and prepared her society and people for global competition by the time carter was making approaches to open up the chinese economy to the west it was ready the latter day leaders like deng simply keyed into the reform blueprint that had been laid out years earlier to create an economy that the west could not overrun even in the area of free competition the first thing that the managers of the economy in china did was to roll out a stimulus package that focused on infrastructure projects they prepared their workforce for manufacturing and globalization they also invested in 5g telecommunications and encouraged investment in real estate all the investments yielded fruits as more money found their way into the hands of the people which in turn energized consumption the result is a consistent gdp growth even in the first quarter of 2019 china has been the world s second largest economy by nominal gdp since 2010 as it has remained the largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity ppp since 2014 china is also the world s largest exporter and second largest importer of goods in the area of armaments china is already a nuclear power maintaining the world s largest standing army and second largest defense budget it is a permanent member of the united nations security council it is also the most populous country in the word with over 1 4 billion people occupying a land space of about 9 3m square km second to russia with a land size of 16 3m square km china is obviously a behemoth of a country and you ignore it only at your own peril china s position has been consolidated in the international financial market as at the end of february 2019 the united states owes china a whopping 1 13 trillion this figure is 28 of the 4 02 trillion us treasury bills and bonds held by foreign countries china is closely followed by japan which holds 1 07 trillion the rest of the 22 trillion us national debt is held locally it is clear that this kind of country is a big challenge to the hegemony of the united states again cheap labour and efficiency have made the us and some parts of europe outsource a large chunk of its manufacturing to china between 2001 when it joined the world trade organisation and 2013 china sucked up about 3 2 million jobs from the us 75 of those jobs were in manufacturing trump had accused china of unfair market distorting trade practices manipulation of its currency to make exports cheaper suppression of labour rights and state enforcement of lower wages we shall leave the argument of whether trump is right or wrong for another day but one must point out that those are some of the challenges of the market economy which china had adopted let us examine the state of nigeria china relations formal diplomatic relationship started in 1971 during the military era the nigerian regime found common interest in the chinese regime which at that time was also unpopular with the international community strategic partnership did not start fully until 2005 trade between nigeria and china had steadily been on the increase from 7 8 billion in 2010 it rose to 12 5 billion in 2017 and further rose to 15 3b in 2018 at the moment nigeria is the biggest chinese investment destination in africa the second largest export market and the third largest trading partner of china in the whole of africa chinese banks and contractors have helped to fund and construct the 186 km abuja kaduna rail line which was delivered in 2016 less than a year ago we signed a contract of 6 68b with the china civil engineering construction corporation ccecc for the construction of the ibadan kaduna segment of the lagos kano rail line meanwhile a 1 685 billion contract was signed in 2016 to link kaduna with kano on the standard gauge rail system the 156km lagos ibadan segment started in march 2017 would be delivered this year at the cost 1 5 billion the total cost of the entire 2 733km project is 11 12 billion again chinese companies are working on the international terminals of four of our airports additionally they are handling roads bridges power and agriculture projects with funding of 4 4b the chinese are involved in the zungeru hydro electric power project fiber cables for internet infrastructure and lekki deep water port project there is no doubt that china has a lot to offer an infrastructure deficit nation like nigeria it has technology and skilled manpower in addition to excess industrial and manufacturing capacity most importantly china has funds which it is willing to release to needy economies at a reasonable cost however there have been concerns over increasing loans from china one major area of concern is what happens in case of default people always point to zambia as a case in point where default has led to asset swap also known as takeovers and seizures the fear is that most of the infrastructure built by chinese are at the risk of being taken over if there is default in meeting the terms of the loans zambian authorities have continued to deny these allegations for what it is worth we should not ignore this concern as it is always a possibility with loans again it is important that we use our clout to ensure we negotiate favorable conditions given how important we are to our partners in the global arena the second fear is that of dumping and crowding out of domestic manufacturers by cheap and sometimes poor quality goods this fear is not unfounded as it is on record that the entry of china led to the closure of about 65 textile mills in nigeria over a period of 10 years and the loss of over 150 000 jobs there is also the security concern it is alleged that the african union headquarters in addis ababa built by the chinese was bugged as construction was going on there is no confirmation of this allegation and china has come out to vehemently deny it furthermore the chinese are known to export their goods and technology with their people partnership to them requires that virtually everything including manual labour and basic raw materials which can be sourced locally are hardly allowed from the host country closely related to this is that there is hardly any room for technology transfer and the partner country would depend on china even for routine maintenance as we were completing this piece news came in that at the just concluded spring meetings of the world bank imf tobias andrian a director of the imf warned nigeria and other emerging markets taking loans from china to consider the terms of such facilities especially their compliance with the paris club of creditors conditions even though he did not condemn borrowing from china he was emphatic that the terms of loans from china are always questionable his worry was that if there is any debt restructuring in future the chinese may just take a pound of flesh according to andrian nigeria had been borrowing from international markets which gives the imf some worries at the moment funding conditions in economies such as nigeria and other sub saharan african countries are very favourable but that might change at some point and there is risk of rollovers and whether the need for refinancing can be met in future we consider the advice a good one even though one can argue that it is laced with some subtle political considerations in the first place following the trade war between the us and china the latter has to look for alternatives to compensate for the 500b trade with the us which had been placed at risk africa provides that alternative as total trade between africa and china is already heading towards the 200b mark with the right incentives and planning africa can replace us in china s trade equation soon africa also holds additional promise of being in a position to sell agricultural products to china replacing its reliance on the us and its partners so there is a perfect match recall that china has over 1trillion low yielding investment in us treasury bills and bonds it can comfortably reduce that and swap same for investments in africa this cause of action gives it two advantages the first is that china has been enduring low us interest rates for a long time now obviously because of the trade opportunities with the us africa has the appetite for funds at higher rates and can comfortably absolve the 1 trillion investment secondly if it is true that china deliberately reduces prices of its goods to dominate the the us market a reason the us imposed the 25 tariff on chinese goods then it can comfortably channel the same goods to africa with a population four times as large as that of the us and still come out much better africa particularly nigeria has a lot of natural resources waiting to be tapped and exploited and china has both the skills and technology to take full advantage of that given all these my take is that while we appreciate the brotherly advice of the imf and should do everything to ensure that we are not left with the short end of the stick in our relationship with china there are mutual economic interests in dealing with china china provides us with opportunities to trade provides us with funding and is also in a position to provide us with technology manpower and infrastructure to support our own growth as a former lender i can understand how it feels when disruptive competition is contemplated on the part of china their president xi jinping had pleaded their innocence thus some foreigners with full read pot bellies and nothing better to do engage in finger pointing at us first china does not export revolution second it does not export famine and poverty and third it does not mess around with you so what else is there to say email

photo by mario tama getty images u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez and sen ed markey are calling for a green new deal that would involve massive government spending to shift the u s economy away from its reliance on carbon their congressional resolution goes into great detail about the harms of climate change and what the u s government should do about it left unanswered however is how america would pay for it some commentators have been calling a green new deal unaffordable with some estimates putting the bill for complete decarbonization at as high as 12 3 trillion as the author of the united nations environment programme s global green new deal a plan to lift the world economy out of the 2008 2009 great recession i disagree i believe there are two straightforward ways to cover the cost and help accelerate the green revolution while lowering the overall price tag what would a green new deal cost before we talk about how to pay for it first we need a rough idea of how much it might actually cost for starters it s important to be realistic rather than putting a price tag on going 100 percent renewable which would take decades i believe we should figure out how much to spend over the next five years to build a greener economy ambitious efforts to foster green energy during the great recession are a good place to start in total the world s largest 20 economies and a few others spent 3 3 trillion to stimulate economic growth of that more than 520 billion was devoted to green investments such as pollution cleanup recycling and low carbon energy the u s share of that was about 120 billion or about 1 percent of its gross domestic product around half of this went toward energy conservation and other short term energy efficiency investments to quickly shore up the then nascent recovery and generate employment more expensive than the great recession the stimulus may have spurred some growth in renewable energy but it didn t do much on its own to reduce carbon emissions permanently another country that made fairly big green investments during the great recession was south korea which promoted low carbon green growth as its new long term development vision it allocated 60 billion or 5 percent of its 2007 gdp to a five year plan but in the end south korea may have spent only 26 billion on low carbon energy and failed to adopt pricing reforms and other incentives to foster renewables such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies pricing carbon and improving regulatory frameworks the result was only a modest improvement in energy efficiency and carbon emissions have continued to rise in other words the price tag of a green new deal that would make a difference would have to be much higher than what governments like the u s and korea actually spent during the great recession the original south korea five year plan however to spend 5 percent of gdp seems about right as a best guess of the public investment needed to decarbonize a major economy through a green growth strategy so if we use korea as a starting point that means the u s would need to spend around 970 billion over the next five years or 194 billion annually how to pay for it the first thing to bear in mind is that a green new deal should be covered by current rather than future revenue a common way for congress to pay for the cost of a new program or stimulus is by deficit spending so the u s borrows the money from investors and then eventually has to pay it back through taxes down the road a carbon tax of 40 per ton would raise 172 billion annually as well as reduce 17 5 billion metric tons of carbon by 2030 with the federal deficit projected to reach 1 trillion in 2019 increasing it by several hundred billion more even if for a good cause is not a great idea ballooning deficits add to the national debt which is already 22 trillion and counting saddling future generations of americans with unsustainable levels of national debt is just as dangerous as burdening them with an economy that is environmentally unsustainable deficit spending is warranted to boost overall demand for goods and services when unemployment rises when consumers do not spend or when private investment is down it must pay for itself when that is not the case i believe efforts to grow green sectors should pay for themselves so the u s would have to find new revenue sources to finance additional government support for clean energy research and development greening infrastructure smart transmission grids public transport and other programs under any green new deal two of the main ways to do that would be by raising new revenues or finding savings elsewhere in the budget on the revenue side i believe passing a carbon tax is one of the best ways to go a 20 tax per metric ton of carbon that climbs over time at a pace slightly higher than inflation would raise around 96 billion in revenue each year covering just under half the estimated cost of the green new deal at the same time it would reduce carbon emissions by 11 1 billion metric tons through 2030 in other words not only does it help raise money to pay for a transition to a green economy a carbon tax also helps spur that very change in terms of savings the removal of fossil fuel subsidies is a particularly appropriate target consumer subsidies for fossil fuels and producer subsidies for coal cost u s taxpayers nearly 9 billion a year these subsidies could be shifted instead to cover some expenditures under a green new deal and again doing this would accelerate the transition to cleaner energy so where might the other 89 billion come from one option is to simply impose a higher carbon tax a 20 tax would put the u s roughly in the middle among countries that currently impose carbon taxes but doubling it to 40 per ton would raise an additional 76 billion annually or 172 billion in total as well as reduce 17 5 billion metric tons of carbon by 2030 another idea is to raise taxes on the highest earning americans for example imposing a 70 percent tax on earnings of 10 million or more would bring in an additional 72 billion a year but it s also possible that the cost of decarbonizing the economy may fall over time for example the drop in emissions accompanying the carbon tax should lower the price tag in a way that s hard to estimate today the right policies and reforms would also help lower the costs the cost would fall over time in a sort of chicken and egg effect as economists ken gillingham and james stock have shown green innovations spur demand which leads to more innovation all of which ultimately reduce costs one illustration is electric vehicle purchases which will stimulate demand for charging stations once installed the stations will reduce the costs of running electric vehicles and further boost demand the green new deal as proposed by rep ocasio cortez and sen markey would be expensive but what policies are adopted and how we choose to pay for it could ultimately determine the plan s success and whether we can afford it this piece originally appeared in the conversation

with the china civil engineering construction corporation ccecc for the construction of the ibadan kaduna segment of the lagos kano rail line meanwhile a 1 685 billion contract was signed in 2016 to link kaduna with kano on the standard gauge rail system the 156km lagos ibadan segment started in march 2017 would be delivered this year at the cost 1 5 billion the total cost of the entire 2 733km project is 11 12 billion again chinese companies are working on the international terminals of four of our airports additionally they are handling roads bridges power and agriculture projects with funding of 4 4b the chinese are involved in the zungeru hydro electric power project fiber cables for internet infrastructure and lekki deep water port project advertisement there is no doubt that china has a lot to offer an infrastructure deficit nation like nigeria it has technology and skilled manpower in addition to excess industrial and manufacturing capacity most importantly china has funds which it is willing to release to needy economies at a reasonable cost however there have been concerns over increasing loans from china one major area of concern is what happens in case of default people always point to zambia as a case in point where default has led to asset swap also known as takeovers and seizures the fear is that most of the infrastructure built by chinese are at the risk of being taken over if there is default in meeting the terms of the loans zambian authorities have continued to deny these allegations for what it is worth we should not ignore this concern as it is always a possibility with loans again it is important that we use our clout to ensure we negotiate favorable conditions given how important we are to our partners in the global arena the second fear is that of dumping and crowding out of domestic manufacturers by cheap and sometimes poor quality goods this fear is not unfounded as it is on record that the entry of china led to the closure of about 65 textile mills in nigeria over a period of 10 years and the loss of over 150 000 jobs there is also the security concern it is alleged that the african union headquarters in addis ababa built by the chinese was bugged as construction was going on there is no confirmation of this allegation and china has come out to vehemently deny it furthermore the chinese are known to export their goods and technology with their people partnership to them requires that virtually everything including manual labour and basic raw materials which can be sourced locally are hardly allowed from the host country closely related to this is that there is hardly any room for technology transfer and the partner country would depend on china even for routine maintenance as we were completing this piece news came in that at the just concluded spring meetings of the world bank imf tobias andrian a director of the imf warned nigeria and other emerging markets taking loans from china to consider the terms of such facilities especially their compliance with the paris club of creditors conditions even though he did not condemn borrowing from china he was emphatic that the terms of loans from china are always questionable his worry was that if there is any debt restructuring in future the chinese may just take a pound of flesh according to andrian nigeria had been borrowing from international markets which gives the imf some worries at the moment funding conditions in economies such as nigeria and other sub saharan african countries are very favourable but that might change at some point and there is risk of rollovers and whether the need for refinancing can be met in future we consider the advice a good one even though one can argue that it is laced with some subtle political considerations in the first place following the trade war between the us and china the latter has to look for alternatives to compensate for the 500b trade with the us which had been placed at risk africa provides that alternative as total trade between africa and china is already heading towards the 200b mark with the right incentives and planning africa can replace us in china s trade equation soon africa also holds additional promise of being in a position to sell agricultural products to china replacing its reliance on the us and its partners so there is a perfect match recall that china has over 1trillion low yielding investment in us treasury bills and bonds it can comfortably reduce that and swap same for investments in africa this cause of action gives it two advantages the first is that china has been enduring low us interest rates for a long time now obviously because of the trade opportunities with the us africa has the appetite for funds at higher rates and can comfortably absolve the 1 trillion investment secondly if it is true that china deliberately reduces prices of its goods to dominate the the us market a reason the us imposed the 25 tariff on chinese goods then it can comfortably channel the same goods to africa with a population four times as large as that of the us and still come out much better africa particularly nigeria has a lot of natural resources waiting to be tapped and exploited and china has both the skills and technology to take full advantage of that given all these my take is that while we appreciate the brotherly advice of the imf and should do everything to ensure that we are not left with the short end of the stick in our relationship with china there are mutual economic interests in dealing with china china provides us with opportunities to trade provides us with funding and is also in a position to provide us with technology manpower and infrastructure to support our own growth as a former lender i can understand how it feels when disruptive competition is contemplated on the part of china their president xi jinping had pleaded their innocence thus some foreigners with full read pot bellies and nothing better to do engage in finger pointing at us first china does not export revolution second it does not export famine and poverty and third it does not mess around with you so what else is there to say

our website at lincolnelectric com and with that i ll turn the call over to chris mapes christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer thank you amanda good morning everyone i m pleased to report that we achieved good earnings growth in the quarter by successfully mitigating inflation pressures and executing on our growth investments first quarter sales held steady on a year over year basis at 759 2 million a 90 basis point improvement in organic sales growth and a 2 4 benefit from recent acquisitions were largely offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation volume declines narrowed sequentially to 3 6 in the quarter and substantially represented the impact of our integration activities in international welding as well as declines in us exports and a slower pace of growth in automation primarily in the automotive segment we successfully mitigated lower volumes inflation and higher growth investments with good price management and favorable mix in our business this resulted in a 20 basis point improvement in our adjusted operating income to 13 moving to earnings adjusted net income increased 2 3 and adjusted earnings per share increased 6 4 to 1 17 returns remained strong with roic up 450 basis points to 21 2 we also returned 106 million to shareholders through a combination of our 21 higher dividend payout rate and 76 million in share repurchases in the quarter this elevated rate reflects our confidence in the business strong cash flow generation and its track record of superior returns moving to slide 4 looking at organic sales trends in the first quarter both the americas welding and harris products group segments outperformed our international welding segment international welding s organic sales declines narrowed in the quarter but continued to reflect integration activities as well as softening european macroeconomic conditions notably in key industrial economies such as italy and france china also continued to weaken in the quarter looking at products both consumables and automation organic sales increased at a low single digit percent rate both product areas faced challenging prior year volume comparisons equipment system organic sales declined by a low single digit percent substantially from international welding end market sectors remained generally healthy in the quarter led by double digit percent organic sales growth on a global basis in heavy industries construction infrastructure and in oil and gas rising commodity costs and the related uptick in mining construction and rolling stock equipment needed to support construction activity and oil and gas infrastructure are all drivers contributing to this demand we anticipate these inspectors ph will continue to grow through the balance of the year general fabrication and automotive transportation were relatively steady versus the prior year period general fabrication is typically indicative of broad industrial production which had a slow start to the year our automotive transportation performance exceeds the auto industry s plateauing vehicle production rates and a weak capital investment cycle model changeover schedules in north america suggest a stronger project pipeline in late 2019 and quoted ph activity in this area is strong given new solutions that are helping us win in this sector turning to slide 5 we re excited about several recent solutions that are showing excellent reception in the market by engineering solutions that combine best in class consumable products with proprietary coded waveform software in our leading equipment systems we are winning in the marketplace enriching our mix our new ranger engine drive does exactly that we redesigned this product from the ground up and redefined customers expectations this product is now 31 smaller 25 lighter and 60 quieter even quieter than a standard home generator set launched in late february we re hearing great feedback on this product introduced late last year at fabtech and formally launched in the quarter our hyperfill solution provides heavy industry customers with a very efficient and easy to use welding process that doubles the deposition of weld metal which can increase productivity by at least 50 for these applications in our harris products group aluminum consumables are in high demand especially in the hvac space harris s new brazing aluminum alloys are formulated to deliver better performance measurable improvement in quality and an average 5 reduction in customers total cost in use this is an area we have been investing in at harris and finally we re excited about the development of our new metal additive manufacturing business which we will formally launch to customers in mid 2019 on april 1st we announced our acquisition of baker industries near detroit michigan along with the build out of a new additive development center near our headquarters here in cleveland together these facilities will represent the initial sites that were broadened over time in targeted locations across the united states these sites will offer large scale metal additive printing and machining of parts tooling and prototypes for industrial aerospace and automotive customers the additive business leverages our leadership competencies in consumables automation and software to print large scale parts using wire based consumables versus metal powders and a robotic arm versus a printing bed provides unparalleled versatility in build size shape and complexity lincoln electric is an innovator of this technology this is an exciting proprietary solution that we believe can be a leading solution in today s developing metal additive market which is expected to grow at four times to six times the core welding market rate over the next five years this represents an accelerated growth strategy within automation which is expected to grow at about two times the core welding growth rate while we are still in the early stages we expect to achieve over 1 billion in combined automation and additive sales by 2025 today we are actively working with leading aerospace industrial and construction equipment oems and are excited to expand capacity in 2019 to address a growing list of active opportunities and now i will pass the call to vince vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you chris moving to slide 6 our consolidated first quarter sales increased 20 basis points on 4 5 higher price and a 2 4 benefit from acquisitions offset by 3 6 lower volumes and a 3 2 unfavorable impact from foreign exchange first quarter gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 34 due to positive price cost and favorable mix our sg a expense was relatively flat in dollar terms but decreased 20 basis points to 21 1 of sales as we implement annual merit wage increases in april we expect the business to incur an additional 3 million in salary and wage costs per quarter for the balance of 2019 reported operating income increased 10 9 to 94 5 million or 12 4 of sales operating income results included approximately 4 3 million in special item charges related to rationalization and asset impairments and acquisition transaction and integration costs primarily from our international welding integration activities excluding special items adjusted operating income increased 1 6 to 98 8 million or 13 of sales a 20 basis point improvement versus the prior year unfavorable foreign exchange reduced adjusted operating income by 1 9 million our first quarter effective tax rate was 23 1 compared with 27 8 in the prior year period excluding special items our first quarter tax rate was 22 9 this compares with a 24 5 rate in the prior year period the lower current year tax rate was due to the benefit of discrete tax items we continue to expect our full year average 2019 effective tax rate to be in the mid 20 range subject to the future mix of earnings and the timing and extent of discrete tax items including stock option exercises first quarter diluted earnings per share increased 21 7 to 1 12 compared with 0 92 in the prior year on an adjusted basis diluted earnings per share increased 6 4 to 1 17 benefiting from the lower effective tax rate and share repurchases unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced eps by 0 02 now moving to the geographical segments on slide 7 americas welding segments first quarter adjusted ebit dollars rose 5 6 to 81 8 million the adjusted ebit margin held steady at 16 8 as positive price cost and favorable mix helped offset lower volumes and higher salary and wage costs looking at the top line americas welding achieved 3 4 organic sales growth in the quarter against a challenging prior year comparison of 12 1 organic sales growth the business demonstrated seasonal strengthening through the quarter however growth rates narrowed in march due to a challenging prior year comparison in that month the segments 6 3 higher price reflects prior pricing actions and a reduction in tariff surcharges we expect americas welding segments price to narrow further in the second quarter as we recognized less contribution from tariff surcharges volumes declined 2 9 in the quarter on challenging comparisons lower exports out of the us and softening and automation from weaker automotive end markets direct channel end market demand trends were solid in the quarter with organic sales growth up in all sectors except general fabrication which was down modestly we saw the greatest strength in heavy industries oil and gas and the construction and infrastructure sector first quarter organic sales and consumables increased mid single digit percent and equipment held relatively steady with prior year performance americas welding sales benefited 2 9 from the two automation acquisitions we announced in the fourth quarter we also announced the acquisition of baker industries on april 1st these acquisitions are expected to add a total of approximately 85 million in revenue through the balance of the year moving to slide 8 the international welding segment s adjusted ebit decreased 10 9 to 13 3 million and the adjusted ebit margin improved 10 basis points to 6 price cost management improved mix and benefits from integration activities helped to mitigate the impact of lower volumes in europe unfavorable foreign exchange translations reduced ebit by approximately 1 3 million organic sales decreased 4 6 with 2 6 higher price and a 7 2 decline in volumes volumes reflect acquisition integration activities and the weakening macroeconomic conditions in europe notably in france and italy from an end market perspective organic sales in construction and infrastructure as well as oil and gas increased at a double digit percent rate in the quarter international welding organic sales are expected to continue to be soft but at a narrowing rate as we anniversary the start of our integration activities moving to the harris products group first quarter adjusted ebit increased 14 to 10 5 million the adjusted ebit margin increased 40 basis points to 12 3 on volume leverage favorable mix acquisitions and productivity improvements harris achieved 3 9 higher volumes from solid demand in the oem channel and in their aluminum products against a challenging prior year comparison of 9 3 volume growth harris also recognized a 7 6 benefit from the acquisition of the worthington industries soldering business on december 31st moving to slide 10 we generated approximately 26 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter reflecting seasonal uses of cash and working capital needs cash flows from operations included a higher discrete tax payment of 13 million in the quarter moving to slide 11 we returned 106 million to shareholders reflecting the 21 higher dividend payout rate and an acceleration in share repurchases to 76 million in the quarter we also invested in the business with 16 million in capital expenditures we now estimate full year capital spending to be in the range of 65 million to 75 million we expect to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy in 2019 prioritizing growth investments and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend program and our share repurchases with that i would like to turn the call over for questions carmen questions and answers operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question is from rob wertheimer with melius research your line is open rob wertheimer melius research analyst hey good morning i actually wanted to start with some exciting announcements on additive and i know you ve been putting together assets and technologies for a long time but maybe could you give us little more color on what the initial applications may be if it s cost effective for a wide range of prototyping or only a few narrow things if people are considering it for out of stock or out of production parts right now or that few years in advance i mean it s an exciting sort of upshift in your capability just to hear any more detail about what the initial stages are like christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes well look thanks look we re very excited about the growth opportunities and the long term opportunity that we think that we can have this present at lincoln electric again as we stated it s a natural expansion of competencies that we have within the business within robotics and metallurgical technologies to be able to make these products but the real area that lincoln electric is focused on is making larger parts those larger parts may be for production parts those larger parts may be for replacement parts those larger parts may be for prototype parts we have seen and are having conversations with a multitude of industry participants across the aerospace general industrial automotive that believe that this technology can be something that can be very interesting for them relative to creating value for their business and that value is generally created in a couple of ways one of the ways that the value is created is through speed to market and ability to potentially manufacture and machine a part for an application that might be completed in days that today might take months or several weeks for them to be able to get from the external marketplace another great example to begin to help to give you context relative to the types of applications you might have a part today that is machined from a solid material the example i think of is that when i was at our baker industries business i saw where they were machining a very large block of aluminum a block that was probably three feet wide and three feet high and 20 feet long and they were probably taking out 85 of the metal in the manufacture of that particular part we believe that with these technologies long term we can manufacture that part and then maybe only machine out 3 to 5 of the material creating a much greater value proposition both for the oem as well as from an ability to manufacture that part more quickly so we have seen a host of opportunistic applications for us again very focused on large part large process applications and as we stated we are we re launching that business in mid 2019 we already have a couple of orders for some applications and believe that it can be a larger portion of our growth profile as we build that out over the next several years rob wertheimer melius research analyst great that s fantastic i ll get back in line chris for regular questions thanks operator thank you our next question is from saree boroditsky with jefferies your line is open saree boroditsky jefferies analyst good morning i appreciate the end market color earlier but i believe a lot of the commentary was geared toward organic growth which includes positive price so could you just help us understand what end markets you re seeing higher or lower volume activity and then there s been lot of talk so far this earnings season about the negative impact from weather so is this something that you also saw christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes saree i would tell you from a volume perspective we still saw a strong growth year over year in heavy fabrication in structural and in oil and gas i mean those all those categories were up double digits and reflect a strong volume growth on the weather question we wouldn t sight weather as a contributing factor to the performance in the quarter we actually saw our biggest monthly challenge was in march when we had very challenging comparisons on a year over year basis we just had a very strong march of 2018 and that strength was moderated in march of 2019 saree boroditsky jefferies analyst okay and then building on the additive question so on the 1 billion in sales from additive and automation by 2025 could you just help split that out between the two categories christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer at this point we re not splitting out the two obviously the baker industries acquisition is an acquisition which really is a scale up of just the additive portion of the business it will really depend on how successful we are between now and 2025 in building out those businesses and the acquisitions that we ll continue to try to identify between automation and additive but we re going to actually view those businesses as one entity as we talk about them and continue to build them out internally saree boroditsky jefferies analyst okay thanks that was helpful operator thank you our next question is from joe o dea with vertical research your line is now open joe o dea vertical research partners analyst hi good morning christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning joe joe o dea vertical research partners analyst could you talk about the export trends in the quarter the degree to which that s concentrated in china and then just any color specifically on china in end markets where you might be seeing some of the softness concentrated whether or not you see your performance in that market as being kind of in line with your competitors or if you re seeing other trends that might suggest a little bit of underperformance vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes joe so from an export perspective we were down over 7 million close to 8 million on exports about a 19 decline over the prior year and china was one of the leading reasons for the decline it was asia in general and china in particular were down significantly on a year over year basis i would attribute much of that slowdown in china to the trade issues that have been discussed for some time now and as far as understanding how our performance compares to our competitors i wouldn t be able to comment on that other than i think they are probably also affected by the same macroeconomic conditions that faced lincoln from a trade perspective so i wouldn t be surprised if other us industrial companies are facing the same kind of export challenges in the china joe o dea vertical research partners analyst got it that s helpful and then if you could just talk about the organic growth cadence set up for the remainder of the year and specifically really in the americas segment i think the second quarter has a pretty similar comp to the first quarter i don t know if you re seeing anything to suggest 2q volume trends a little bit better than what we saw in the first quarter but then also just you know what s embedded in your full year expectations is there the expectation for underlying activity to improve as we get into the back half of the year or is it more a matter of first half comps are just really tough vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer it s a good observation joe we see it that way the second quarter again will have a challenging comparison when you look at the growth in the prior year was significant although it did moderate slightly off of the first quarter so we see the second quarter unfolding largely in line with what we experienced in the first quarter we hope to narrow that decline a little bit but we wouldn t be surprised if we see something similar and a slight decline in volumes but a slight improvement in organics as we finish off the first half of the year then the second half will be a little bit easier from a comparison perspective we will see in the americas those comparisons become a little bit easier we will have challenges we think in europe if the macroeconomic environment continues to soften and weaken as we ve seen at the outset of the first quarter now starting into the second quarter of 2019 but i think we re going to have challenging comparisons certainly in the second quarter joe o dea vertical research partners analyst i appreciate the details thanks operator thank you our next question is from nathan jones with stifel your line is now open nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst good morning everyone christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning nathan nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst vince just following up on one of those last comments there on europe maybe you could talk in a little bit more detail about what you guys are seeing on the ground there in terms of maybe daily order rates on the consumable side obviously the macro data out of europe is not very good at this point just any color you can give us on what you guys are seeing on the ground over there vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer right thanks nathan so we do we do have some we have some headwinds from the macroeconomic activity there we did see meaningful decline year over year in a couple of countries in france and italy there are some smaller declines in some other economies including the big engine of europe being germany but certainly those three countries are the biggest contributors we have some tailwinds from the perspective of easier comparisons though nathan as i ve said i think we will see a narrowing of the international year over year performance as we continue to anniversary the heavy integration activities that we ve been executing on in europe with the air liquide welding acquisition so that 7 plus volume decline in the first quarter we think we ll narrow in the second quarter and continue to narrow as we finish off the second half of the year but what s pushing a headwind against that though is clearly the trends that we ve been seeing the last few months from a macro perspective the purchasing manager index continues to soften and industrial activity is softening in europe so we re growing more concerned about how we finish off from that perspective in the second half of the year and then our own internal initiatives to continue to integrate the businesses nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst is it possible for you to split what you think the volume decline is voluntarily related to the acquisition integration versus softening underlying markets vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer that s an interesting question i would have said last year that the markets the macros were relatively flattish if not growing slightly and the bulk of our declines were because of the integration activity i think this year some of the declines i would attribute to the overall softness in the markets i would be hesitant to give you a split this time but i think the welding markets and the steel markets in europe are showing some volume declines as we exit the first quarter nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst and then one quick one as a follow up to a previous question regarding volume in the americas you gave us three markets there that were strong they were up double digits can you give us some any color on the markets that were less strong maybe down vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you know the markets that were down were only down in modest terms so general fabrication was one of those where a very modest amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars so i m reluctant to say that s a meaningful trend there couple other areas that were subcategories of oil and gas including power gen and shipbuilding were down but again nothing that was significant and then lastly offshore was down but those all those categories collectively don t outweigh for example heavy fabrication that was up significantly in the quarter in the americas so there were modest year over year declines but not meaningful nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst great thanks for taking my questions vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you re welcome operator thank you our next question is from mig dobre with baird your line is open mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst thank you good morning good morning guys christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning mig mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst good morning a couple of margin questions for me so i think i heard you say that starting with april you re looking at another round of salary and wage increases it was 3 million per quarter am i to sort of does that imply that q1 19 was not really impacted by the wage inflation that you kind of called out going forward vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer no there was underlying wage inflation in the first quarter as well but that was instituted in almost a year ago so we re highlighting the incremental increases in sg a that will be affecting us as the year unfolds so those prior year increases are certainly in our cost base in 2019 s first quarter mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay so i m asking because when i m looking at the incremental margin in the americas right i mean we re talking something like 17 and going forward in the quarter you also had the benefit from mix and from price cost so going forward if we re talking about an additional drag from wages how should folks think about your incremental margin for the year or quarters however you want to frame it vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah so incremental margins i would expect to be in the same range that we ve been disclosing heretofore mig we were about 18 19 i believe in the americas and our expectations are to be somewhere in the 20 to 25 range as a group wide number mainly driven by that americas segment so we re going to have to continue to drive productivity through the business and hope to offset those escalating wage costs it have to see some improvements in input costs outside of wage inflation but certainly we will have the headwinds from the higher wage costs affecting our business for the rest of 2019 and the offsets will have to come again through productivity improvements or an easing in input costs outside of wages which is primarily raws mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst understood and then shifting to international again our margin i understand the volume decline comment and obviously that has an impact on profitability as well but we re not really seeing a lot of margin improvement still on a year over year basis here so i guess i m wondering can you maybe separate what s going on at alw versus your core business and then put maybe i m looking out to 2020 is it still fair for us to think that a double digit target for this segment is appropriate margin wise christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes that s a great question i can tell you mig that we re still very focused on our phase one of our integration process which we believe that we ll complete by the time we get to the back half of 2019 really positioning that business at that point to be able to grow from the completion of phase 1 we still got a couple more systems integrations to complete before that period of time as well as a host of other strategic projects i can share with you that we are not moving off our current target that we set up for the integration of that business our margin profile has not moved as quickly as i would have liked to have seen it but i do like the work that the team is doing in positioning the business we do have a little bit of a headwind now from the macroeconomics that are going on there within europe and we ll certainly have to see how that impacts our ability to execute on that target as we re moving forward but we are holding to the target of 10 operating profit that we had set out for that business as we entered into the integration work in bringing that business into lincoln electric now 18 months ago or so mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst i appreciate it thank you chris operator thank you and our next question is from matt trusz with g research your line is open matthew trusz gabelli analyst good morning thank you for taking my question christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning matt matthew trusz gabelli analyst can you discuss the additive business model in greater detail do you plan that this is going to stay inaudible service or do you anticipate selling equipment systems too looking into the mid 2020s and can you provide any early take on how you would compare this to equipment sales as far as margins go thank you christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer well first i d say that as we re executing on this piece of the strategy our intention is to be a service provider of this innovation technology into the marketplace our experience in building out the global automation portfolio and certainly having the largest welding automation portfolio here in the united states has given us experience in recognizing that bringing those technologies to the marketplace too quickly can create other challenges within the business model and i think that would only be enhanced as we re talking about the additive strategy that lincoln is deploying because we are really at the front end of this innovation there are only a handful of people around the world who are utilizing this type of technology as it relates to making these types of parts and building out this business model so our intention is that this would be a service model we may very well have a handful of units that are in r d centers or technical centers around the world but our intention again is for it to be a service model for us i would expect that as we re building that model out that the margins associated with this would be at or slightly favorable to our overall margins in the portfolio at this point in time we just really need to see exactly what types of opportunities are coming toward us but we see the value that can be created when you re creating that type of value you should be able to extract really a substantial portion of that profit pool so we re excited about what the margin profile can look for this business longer term but probably too early for us to determine exactly what that might be for our additive business as we re building it out matthew trusz gabelli analyst thank you and just to follow up on that how robust is the patent protection there and i get that this is better than laser and powder but for competitors who might have laser hot wire would you view that as being able to compete with this christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes we look we believe first of all we were one of the early innovators in laser hot wire so we understand that technology very well we believe we ll not only be able to compete but quite frankly could be a component within our broad additive strategy so and i think what s important to think about the value proposition and the mote ph that we re building around this technology is that look there are some proprietary ip that we have that we ll be able to leverage but as importantly is the competencies that we bring to this the competencies in understanding utilization robotics with metallurgy the building out of the software capabilities around that and so we re very confident that although there may be other participants who can be in the marketplace that this is a challenging innovation tool and that quite frankly we believe we ll be able to deliver and develop capabilities that will be very difficult for others to be able to match in the marketplace as we build out this business matthew trusz gabelli analyst thank you i appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from walter liptak with seaport global your line is open walter liptak seaport global analyst hi thanks good morning guys christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer hey good morning walt walter liptak seaport global analyst i want to ask a follow up on the international operating margin question especially with regard to air liquide welding in your comments i understand the macro may have gotten a little bit worse but is there a step up that can happen are there costs from these systems upgrades or are there integration costs that go away from the p l and help that margin step up later on this year vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer look i think we can get an improvement in the operating profit margins actually confident that we can as the restructuring and integration process has unfolded walt what s happened is that the sales declines are leading the cost decline so we re chasing the sales and costs down and so those sales declines will in my opinion begin to moderate and stabilize and restore themselves while cost will continue to decline after the top line stabilizes so we are continuing to spend on integration activities and new systems implementations and restructuring the manufacturing and sg a footprint and activities and i think that will catch up to the top line and expand margins as we exit this first half of the year walter liptak seaport global analyst okay as the sales stabilize do you think we will see growth as it s stabilized or do you think we ll continue to see declines through the back half of the year vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer well no as we had stated getting to that back half of the year where we get to a stable business environment and preparing ourselves for growth the only caution i have is that obviously not understanding what our macro economic position will be there in that particular market as we re in the back half of the year if we were to see a broad headwind across europe that would be difficult for us to say that we would drive the level of growth that we re looking for but i do believe that if we get to a stable business model and business structure there late in the back half of 19 we ll position that business for growth and even with that we ll be able to drive some of our solutions and technologies into that marketplace so and still expecting that then we will have executed on what we were looking for from the integration and then want to determine what those macros look like as we re moving in the back half of 19 walter liptak seaport global analyst okay great all right thank you christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you operator instructions our next question is from rob wertheimer with melius research your line is open rob wertheimer melius research analyst hello again thanks for the follow up my question is just on pricing in your perception of how it was absorbed by customers whether there was any hesitation ordering or buying inaudible would stick or not and then even though you ve kind of addressed this just more generally whether you feel some of the weakness that you saw was any of that related to lack of confidence or do you think it was genuinely end market weakness thank you vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so on the first one i don t think we observed any significant movement in order patterns as a result of pricing changes particularly in the first quarter of 2019 and i don t view there weren t a really significant pricing changes across our portfolio of companies both geographically and on a product line basis so i don t see that there was a big impact from that rob wertheimer melius research analyst and then just more generally on whether you can tell by customer by customer on flow versus equipment or any other way whether you felt like there was just an air pocket from hesitation or whether it was really just that s where the end markets are vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes i think it s where the end markets are and i can t emphasize enough what an unusually strong march of 2018 that we had march is generally the strongest month of the quarter and one of the stronger of the year and we had a bump up in march of 2018 i think part of that was to your question on pricing dynamics if there was an impact on order patterns and sales in any particular period it would have been in the prior year because the prior year had price increases coming out in april we raised prices in february in 18 as well as in april and they were escalating raw material prices and tariff discussions so if anything the prior year might have had a little bit extra bump in it over and above what a strong march might look like and then this year they doesn t have any of that as well as maybe a few markets including automotive being a little bit softer for us but i don t think the current year certainly has any meaningful order pattern changes from pricing rob wertheimer melius research analyst okay thank you very much vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you re welcome operator thank you and our next question is from steve barger with keybanc capital your line is open steve barger keybanc capital analyst hey thanks good morning christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning steve steve barger keybanc capital analyst just a follow up to the conversation around becoming a service provider in additive is there any thought to pushing more into helping customers with other non welding automation applications like material handling or machine tending to leverage the investments you ve made there christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes steve look that s something that i would tell you we ve been doing so when we ve been acquiring these automation businesses across our portfolio rarely are these automation businesses 100 welding and cutting automation systems and if and if one of those businesses already has a competency or a capability around material handling or press transfer units or something else that they ve already got within their portfolio we ve not moved that business outside of the outside of the automation business we ve kept that business so we have competencies and capabilities in those other areas i would share with you that our focus is still welding and cutting but where we find complementary skill sets or capabilities within the portfolio we ve been willing to continue to utilize those capabilities and at times expand those capabilities so some of those competencies already exist inside of our automation business and we would and we would accept those opportunities in working with our customers as we re as we re doing that now what we have not done at this point is necessarily say that we would target unique opportunities outside of our portfolio that are 100 focused on those types of capabilities we might we have looked at some acquisition opportunities in that area but it s just finding the right ones if we view that that s a skill set that we want to bring in or if they bring some unique value proposition that we think would add to our overall automation and additive business steve barger keybanc capital analyst so when you think about growing automation and additive to 1 billion in 2025 two questions one do you is that going to look like the current portfolio in your mind and how much of that is driven by m a versus organic christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer well i don t think it s going to look like the current portfolio because quite frankly the additive portfolio needs to be a significant piece of that 1 billion and that s a new business model for us so and it is clearly going to have some uniqueness so that in itself steve i think creates at looking like a different portfolio there needs to be an m a component to that but as when we see the growth opportunities within these market place both in the automation piece and the additive piece there also needs to be a very significant growth perspective just because of those markets so i think we ll see a complement of both obviously if we were successful in bringing in a multitude of acquisitions in that space then we might come back out and adjust that number but today we re seeing that and believing that can be accomplished with some minor m a and more material organic growth within those businesses steve barger keybanc capital analyst got it and then just one last one in the press release you called this a cautious period of the cycle and are you saying that around the trends we ve already discussed on the call today in europe and china or are you seeing customers in north america express caution about demand trends christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer no i think as vince said earlier we re not seeing any necessary broad caution between our customers here in the americas piece so i think it s just our perspective on this point in the cycle for lincoln electric and where we see the business steve barger keybanc capital analyst understood thanks operator thank you our next question is from nathan jones with stifel your line is open nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst morning again hoping you can give us some color on the growth investments you pointed to that as a drag to margins can you maybe tell us how much more you re putting into growth investments this year and then any color you can give us on on where it s going i m sure additive and automation are some of those places and then i think you took the capex guidance down 5 million just what s behind that thanks vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes nathan so the growth investments are really primarily around the additive conversation that we ve been having this morning and that s the bulk of the increase in cost and we estimate that to be around a run rate of 2 million per quarter during the course of 2019 operator all right and our last question is coming from jason rodgers with great lakes review your line is open jason rodgers great lakes review analyst my questions are already asked thanks operator thank you and i m not showing any questions in the queue this concludes our q a session i would like to turn the call back to vincent petrella for closing remarks vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you carmen and thank everyone

on monday after a lack of republican support in the senate doomed his prospects for confirmation trump made the announcement on twitter writing my friend herman cain a truly wonderful man has asked me

have needed near unanimous republican backing in the senate for confirmation but four republicans have said they would not vote for the nominee effectively killing his chances since republicans hold 53 seats in the senate and no democrats were expected to support him cain had maintained as recently as late last week that he d continue to vie for the role trump s plan to pick cain a 2012 gop presidential primary candidate and restaurant industry executive was immediately controversial when the president announced cain was his choice earlier this month some lawmakers economists and wall street investors questioned his qualifications for the central bank and noted the multiple allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct that derailed his campaign cain has denied the allegations casting them as old news but one of the accusers said she would testify at his confirmation hearing if given the chance many also had concerns that the nomination of a close political ally of the president who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for trump and lashed out a trump s critics would threaten the bank s independence cain s withdrawal is a setback in trump s effort to install political allies on the fed board part of a broader tug of war between the central bank s leaders and the president over the fed s stewardship of the economy trump was irate after the fed raised interest rates multiple times in 2018 hikes that wound down the central bank s decadelong effort to boost economic growth and fight unemployment after the great recession the increases were aimed at guarding against future inflation and preserving the fed s ability to fight a future downturn but trump accused the central bank of unnecessarily constraining growth and triggering the stock market sell off late last year cain and stephen moore trump s other planned pick to fill the remaining seats on the seven member fed board and another friend of the president s said they support lowering interest rates a move that would boost growth in the run up to the president s reelection campaign trump has launched a series of attacks on the fed exhorting it to change course in a break with his immediate predecessors who typically refrained from publicly weighing in on central bank policy to protect the fed s credibility fed chair jerome powell has said the bank has no plans to raise rates again this year citing some uncertainty about the pace of future growth the white house never formally nominated cain and has yet to nominate moore typically nominees undergo an extensive vetting process before the president announces them but trump appears to have announced cain as his planned nominee without fully coordinating with gop leaders that approach appeared to come up short thursday when sen kevin cramer of north dakota on thursday joined three other republicans sens mitt romney of utah lisa murkowski of alaska and cory gardner of colorado in announcing opposition to cain s nomination i don t think herman cain would be confirmed by the senate and i think the president would be wise to find someone who is less partisan and more experienced in the world of economics romney said thursday in explaining why he did not support the nominee with cain out the focus shifts to moore who was an adviser on trump s campaign and called for powell to be fired democratic senator and presidential candidate elizabeth warren of massachusetts sent moore a scathing letter this month accusing him lacking a good grasp on basic mathematical and economic concepts the letter included nine questions for moore that attempt to clarify whether he still holds some of his more iconoclastic views in a cnn appearance moore claimed he had never been in favor of the gold standard where every dollar is backed by some gold but the network proceeded to play clips from three different speech where moore clearly supported the policy which cain also endorses moore also called for interest rates to rise in the midst of the financial crisis a policy that many believe would have caused the country more harm moore started calling for a cut in interest rates once trump took office recently moore has said there is deflation in the united states even though government statistics and the white house council of economic advisers all say inflation is rising at about 2 percent a year this is not the first time trump has opted to first publicize a pick and then push the party to go along with it after trump named rear adm ronny jackson the presidential physician to be secretary of veteran affairs last year only to watch the nomination fall apart as allegations of misconduct surfaced his original choice for labor secretary andrew puzder also had to withdrawal after it surfaced that he had an undocumented housekeeper moore has faced similar criticisms about a lack of qualifications and past personal issues including his failure to pay his ex wife child support and alimony in 2013 but while republicans have largely expressed support or at least openness to moving forward with moore cain was a bridge too far for some in the president s party accusations against cain cain has taken an adversarial stance against some gop incumbents the chairman of cain s america fighting back pac in march sent an email saying 12 gop senators including romney and murkowski were traitors for voting against trump s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border cain said the senate banking committee which would handle his nomination was full of yahoos cain s nomination was immediately controversial on multiple fronts his presidential campaign which drew notice early in the gop primary for a 9 9 9 tax plan unraveled in 2011 amid multiple accusations of past sexual misconduct and harassment the national restaurant association cain s employer at the time of the accusations settled sexual harassment claims against cain with two women the fed board has often had business leaders on its board in addition to ph d economists and wall street bankers but cain s views were seen an outside the mainstream in the 1990s cain served on the federal reserve bank of kansas city s board of directors a group of business and community leaders who advise the head of the kansas city fed on how the economy is doing but he has supported controversial ideas such as a return to the gold standard system the united states abandoned nearly a half century ago the system would have made it almost impossible for the central bank to undertake many of the rescue measures it did during and after the 2008 2009 financial crisis trump s other nominees for the fed were imminently qualified people but all of a sudden trump has gone off the rails with stephen moore and herman cain said robert brusca chief economist at consulting firm fact and opinion economics a number of republicans however have expressed interest in having a wider variety of views on the fed board and seem open to taking a close look at moore who has been a big proponent of tax cuts ron paul a former republican congressman from texas and presidential candidate called cain and moore a basic improvement over many of the people who have served in the fed in recent years it s a good idea to have cain and moore at the fed they at least have knowledge and respect for a different way of doing things said paul a libertarian and vocal advocate for a return to the gold standard the fed plays a large role in steering the economy and overseeing banks the central bank s leaders a committee of 12 made up of the fed governors and five heads of regional fed banks from across the country decide whether to raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating or lower rates to try stimulate the economy at the moment interest rates are at a level that is considered neutral because it neither spurs growth nor holds it back the fed is tasked with making the best long term decisions for the economy steering clear of political calls to make short term moves that favor certain constituencies we are an organization devoted to public service we are professional we make decision based on facts and evidence and analysis and we stay out of politics said former fed chair janet yellen at a forum at the dallas fed nothing we do is political
leco earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 lincoln electric holdings inc leco 0 42 q1 2019 earnings call 10 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator greetings and welcome to the lincoln electric 2019 first quarter financial results conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode and this call is being recorded it is now my pleasure to introduce your host amanda butler vice president of investor relations and communications thank you and you may begin amanda butler vice president of investor relations and communications thank you carmen and good morning everyone welcome to lincoln electric s 2019 first quarter conference call we released our financial results earlier today and you can find our release as an attachment to this call s slide presentation as well as on the lincoln electric website at lincolnelectric com in the investor relations section joining me on the call today is chris mapes lincoln s chairman president and chief executive officer as well as our chief financial officer vince petrella chris will begin the discussion with an overview of first quarter results and vince will cover the quarter performance in more detail following our prepared remarks we re happy to take your questions before we start our discussion please note that certain statements made during this call may be forward looking and actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risk factors a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results are provided in our press release and in our sec filings on forms 10 k and 10 q in addition we discuss financial measures that do not conform to us gaap a reconciliation of non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measure is found in the financial tables in our earnings release which again is available in the investor relations section of our website at lincolnelectric com and with that i ll turn the call over to chris mapes christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer thank you amanda good morning everyone i m pleased to report that we achieved good earnings growth in the quarter by successfully mitigating inflation pressures and executing on our growth investments first quarter sales held steady on a year over year basis at 759 2 million a 90 basis point improvement in organic sales growth and a 2 4 benefit from recent acquisitions were largely offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation volume declines narrowed sequentially to 3 6 in the quarter and substantially represented the impact of our integration activities in international welding as well as declines in us exports and a slower pace of growth in automation primarily in the automotive segment we successfully mitigated lower volumes inflation and higher growth investments with good price management and favorable mix in our business this resulted in a 20 basis point improvement in our adjusted operating income to 13 moving to earnings adjusted net income increased 2 3 and adjusted earnings per share increased 6 4 to 1 17 returns remained strong with roic up 450 basis points to 21 2 we also returned 106 million to shareholders through a combination of our 21 higher dividend payout rate and 76 million in share repurchases in the quarter this elevated rate reflects our confidence in the business strong cash flow generation and its track record of superior returns moving to slide 4 looking at organic sales trends in the first quarter both the americas welding and harris products group segments outperformed our international welding segment international welding s organic sales declines narrowed in the quarter but continued to reflect integration activities as well as softening european macroeconomic conditions notably in key industrial economies such as italy and france china also continued to weaken in the quarter looking at products both consumables and automation organic sales increased at a low single digit percent rate both product areas faced challenging prior year volume comparisons equipment system organic sales declined by a low single digit percent substantially from international welding end market sectors remained generally healthy in the quarter led by double digit percent organic sales growth on a global basis in heavy industries construction infrastructure and in oil and gas rising commodity costs and the related uptick in mining construction and rolling stock equipment needed to support construction activity and oil and gas infrastructure are all drivers contributing to this demand we anticipate these inspectors ph will continue to grow through the balance of the year general fabrication and automotive transportation were relatively steady versus the prior year period general fabrication is typically indicative of broad industrial production which had a slow start to the year our automotive transportation performance exceeds the auto industry s plateauing vehicle production rates and a weak capital investment cycle model changeover schedules in north america suggest a stronger project pipeline in late 2019 and quoted ph activity in this area is strong given new solutions that are helping us win in this sector turning to slide 5 we re excited about several recent solutions that are showing excellent reception in the market by engineering solutions that combine best in class consumable products with proprietary coded waveform software in our leading equipment systems we are winning in the marketplace enriching our mix our new ranger engine drive does exactly that we redesigned this product from the ground up and redefined customers expectations this product is now 31 smaller 25 lighter and 60 quieter even quieter than a standard home generator set launched in late february we re hearing great feedback on this product introduced late last year at fabtech and formally launched in the quarter our hyperfill solution provides heavy industry customers with a very efficient and easy to use welding process that doubles the deposition of weld metal which can increase productivity by at least 50 for these applications in our harris products group aluminum consumables are in high demand especially in the hvac space harris s new brazing aluminum alloys are formulated to deliver better performance measurable improvement in quality and an average 5 reduction in customers total cost in use this is an area we have been investing in at harris and finally we re excited about the development of our new metal additive manufacturing business which we will formally launch to customers in mid 2019 on april 1st we announced our acquisition of baker industries near detroit michigan along with the build out of a new additive development center near our headquarters here in cleveland together these facilities will represent the initial sites that were broadened over time in targeted locations across the united states these sites will offer large scale metal additive printing and machining of parts tooling and prototypes for industrial aerospace and automotive customers the additive business leverages our leadership competencies in consumables automation and software to print large scale parts using wire based consumables versus metal powders and a robotic arm versus a printing bed provides unparalleled versatility in build size shape and complexity lincoln electric is an innovator of this technology this is an exciting proprietary solution that we believe can be a leading solution in today s developing metal additive market which is expected to grow at four times to six times the core welding market rate over the next five years this represents an accelerated growth strategy within automation which is expected to grow at about two times the core welding growth rate while we are still in the early stages we expect to achieve over 1 billion in combined automation and additive sales by 2025 today we are actively working with leading aerospace industrial and construction equipment oems and are excited to expand capacity in 2019 to address a growing list of active opportunities and now i will pass the call to vince vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you chris moving to slide 6 our consolidated first quarter sales increased 20 basis points on 4 5 higher price and a 2 4 benefit from acquisitions offset by 3 6 lower volumes and a 3 2 unfavorable impact from foreign exchange first quarter gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 34 due to positive price cost and favorable mix our sg a expense was relatively flat in dollar terms but decreased 20 basis points to 21 1 of sales as we implement annual merit wage increases in april we expect the business to incur an additional 3 million in salary and wage costs per quarter for the balance of 2019 reported operating income increased 10 9 to 94 5 million or 12 4 of sales operating income results included approximately 4 3 million in special item charges related to rationalization and asset impairments and acquisition transaction and integration costs primarily from our international welding integration activities excluding special items adjusted operating income increased 1 6 to 98 8 million or 13 of sales a 20 basis point improvement versus the prior year unfavorable foreign exchange reduced adjusted operating income by 1 9 million our first quarter effective tax rate was 23 1 compared with 27 8 in the prior year period excluding special items our first quarter tax rate was 22 9 this compares with a 24 5 rate in the prior year period the lower current year tax rate was due to the benefit of discrete tax items we continue to expect our full year average 2019 effective tax rate to be in the mid 20 range subject to the future mix of earnings and the timing and extent of discrete tax items including stock option exercises first quarter diluted earnings per share increased 21 7 to 1 12 compared with 0 92 in the prior year on an adjusted basis diluted earnings per share increased 6 4 to 1 17 benefiting from the lower effective tax rate and share repurchases unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced eps by 0 02 now moving to the geographical segments on slide 7 americas welding segments first quarter adjusted ebit dollars rose 5 6 to 81 8 million the adjusted ebit margin held steady at 16 8 as positive price cost and favorable mix helped offset lower volumes and higher salary and wage costs looking at the top line americas welding achieved 3 4 organic sales growth in the quarter against a challenging prior year comparison of 12 1 organic sales growth the business demonstrated seasonal strengthening through the quarter however growth rates narrowed in march due to a challenging prior year comparison in that month the segments 6 3 higher price reflects prior pricing actions and a reduction in tariff surcharges we expect americas welding segments price to narrow further in the second quarter as we recognized less contribution from tariff surcharges volumes declined 2 9 in the quarter on challenging comparisons lower exports out of the us and softening and automation from weaker automotive end markets direct channel end market demand trends were solid in the quarter with organic sales growth up in all sectors except general fabrication which was down modestly we saw the greatest strength in heavy industries oil and gas and the construction and infrastructure sector first quarter organic sales and consumables increased mid single digit percent and equipment held relatively steady with prior year performance americas welding sales benefited 2 9 from the two automation acquisitions we announced in the fourth quarter we also announced the acquisition of baker industries on april 1st these acquisitions are expected to add a total of approximately 85 million in revenue through the balance of the year moving to slide 8 the international welding segment s adjusted ebit decreased 10 9 to 13 3 million and the adjusted ebit margin improved 10 basis points to 6 price cost management improved mix and benefits from integration activities helped to mitigate the impact of lower volumes in europe unfavorable foreign exchange translations reduced ebit by approximately 1 3 million organic sales decreased 4 6 with 2 6 higher price and a 7 2 decline in volumes volumes reflect acquisition integration activities and the weakening macroeconomic conditions in europe notably in france and italy from an end market perspective organic sales in construction and infrastructure as well as oil and gas increased at a double digit percent rate in the quarter international welding organic sales are expected to continue to be soft but at a narrowing rate as we anniversary the start of our integration activities moving to the harris products group first quarter adjusted ebit increased 14 to 10 5 million the adjusted ebit margin increased 40 basis points to 12 3 on volume leverage favorable mix acquisitions and productivity improvements harris achieved 3 9 higher volumes from solid demand in the oem channel and in their aluminum products against a challenging prior year comparison of 9 3 volume growth harris also recognized a 7 6 benefit from the acquisition of the worthington industries soldering business on december 31st moving to slide 10 we generated approximately 26 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter reflecting seasonal uses of cash and working capital needs cash flows from operations included a higher discrete tax payment of 13 million in the quarter moving to slide 11 we returned 106 million to shareholders reflecting the 21 higher dividend payout rate and an acceleration in share repurchases to 76 million in the quarter we also invested in the business with 16 million in capital expenditures we now estimate full year capital spending to be in the range of 65 million to 75 million we expect to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy in 2019 prioritizing growth investments and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend program and our share repurchases with that i would like to turn the call over for questions carmen questions and answers operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question is from rob wertheimer with melius research your line is open rob wertheimer melius research analyst hey good morning i actually wanted to start with some exciting announcements on additive and i know you ve been putting together assets and technologies for a long time but maybe could you give us little more color on what the initial applications may be if it s cost effective for a wide range of prototyping or only a few narrow things if people are considering it for out of stock or out of production parts right now or that few years in advance i mean it s an exciting sort of upshift in your capability just to hear any more detail about what the initial stages are like christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes well look thanks look we re very excited about the growth opportunities and the long term opportunity that we think that we can have this present at lincoln electric again as we stated it s a natural expansion of competencies that we have within the business within robotics and metallurgical technologies to be able to make these products but the real area that lincoln electric is focused on is making larger parts those larger parts may be for production parts those larger parts may be for replacement parts those larger parts may be for prototype parts we have seen and are having conversations with a multitude of industry participants across the aerospace general industrial automotive that believe that this technology can be something that can be very interesting for them relative to creating value for their business and that value is generally created in a couple of ways one of the ways that the value is created is through speed to market and ability to potentially manufacture and machine a part for an application that might be completed in days that today might take months or several weeks for them to be able to get from the external marketplace another great example to begin to help to give you context relative to the types of applications you might have a part today that is machined from a solid material the example i think of is that when i was at our baker industries business i saw where they were machining a very large block of aluminum a block that was probably three feet wide and three feet high and 20 feet long and they were probably taking out 85 of the metal in the manufacture of that particular part we believe that with these technologies long term we can manufacture that part and then maybe only machine out 3 to 5 of the material creating a much greater value proposition both for the oem as well as from an ability to manufacture that part more quickly so we have seen a host of opportunistic applications for us again very focused on large part large process applications and as we stated we are we re launching that business in mid 2019 we already have a couple of orders for some applications and believe that it can be a larger portion of our growth profile as we build that out over the next several years rob wertheimer melius research analyst great that s fantastic i ll get back in line chris for regular questions thanks operator thank you our next question is from saree boroditsky with jefferies your line is open saree boroditsky jefferies analyst good morning i appreciate the end market color earlier but i believe a lot of the commentary was geared toward organic growth which includes positive price so could you just help us understand what end markets you re seeing higher or lower volume activity and then there s been lot of talk so far this earnings season about the negative impact from weather so is this something that you also saw christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes saree i would tell you from a volume perspective we still saw a strong growth year over year in heavy fabrication in structural and in oil and gas i mean those all those categories were up double digits and reflect a strong volume growth on the weather question we wouldn t sight weather as a contributing factor to the performance in the quarter we actually saw our biggest monthly challenge was in march when we had very challenging comparisons on a year over year basis we just had a very strong march of 2018 and that strength was moderated in march of 2019 saree boroditsky jefferies analyst okay and then building on the additive question so on the 1 billion in sales from additive and automation by 2025 could you just help split that out between the two categories christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer at this point we re not splitting out the two obviously the baker industries acquisition is an acquisition which really is a scale up of just the additive portion of the business it will really depend on how successful we are between now and 2025 in building out those businesses and the acquisitions that we ll continue to try to identify between automation and additive but we re going to actually view those businesses as one entity as we talk about them and continue to build them out internally saree boroditsky jefferies analyst okay thanks that was helpful operator thank you our next question is from joe o dea with vertical research your line is now open joe o dea vertical research partners analyst hi good morning christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning joe joe o dea vertical research partners analyst could you talk about the export trends in the quarter the degree to which that s concentrated in china and then just any color specifically on china in end markets where you might be seeing some of the softness concentrated whether or not you see your performance in that market as being kind of in line with your competitors or if you re seeing other trends that might suggest a little bit of underperformance vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes joe so from an export perspective we were down over 7 million close to 8 million on exports about a 19 decline over the prior year and china was one of the leading reasons for the decline it was asia in general and china in particular were down significantly on a year over year basis i would attribute much of that slowdown in china to the trade issues that have been discussed for some time now and as far as understanding how our performance compares to our competitors i wouldn t be able to comment on that other than i think they are probably also affected by the same macroeconomic conditions that faced lincoln from a trade perspective so i wouldn t be surprised if other us industrial companies are facing the same kind of export challenges in the china joe o dea vertical research partners analyst got it that s helpful and then if you could just talk about the organic growth cadence set up for the remainder of the year and specifically really in the americas segment i think the second quarter has a pretty similar comp to the first quarter i don t know if you re seeing anything to suggest 2q volume trends a little bit better than what we saw in the first quarter but then also just you know what s embedded in your full year expectations is there the expectation for underlying activity to improve as we get into the back half of the year or is it more a matter of first half comps are just really tough vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer it s a good observation joe we see it that way the second quarter again will have a challenging comparison when you look at the growth in the prior year was significant although it did moderate slightly off of the first quarter so we see the second quarter unfolding largely in line with what we experienced in the first quarter we hope to narrow that decline a little bit but we wouldn t be surprised if we see something similar and a slight decline in volumes but a slight improvement in organics as we finish off the first half of the year then the second half will be a little bit easier from a comparison perspective we will see in the americas those comparisons become a little bit easier we will have challenges we think in europe if the macroeconomic environment continues to soften and weaken as we ve seen at the outset of the first quarter now starting into the second quarter of 2019 but i think we re going to have challenging comparisons certainly in the second quarter joe o dea vertical research partners analyst i appreciate the details thanks operator thank you our next question is from nathan jones with stifel your line is now open nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst good morning everyone christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning nathan nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst vince just following up on one of those last comments there on europe maybe you could talk in a little bit more detail about what you guys are seeing on the ground there in terms of maybe daily order rates on the consumable side obviously the macro data out of europe is not very good at this point just any color you can give us on what you guys are seeing on the ground over there vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer right thanks nathan so we do we do have some we have some headwinds from the macroeconomic activity there we did see meaningful decline year over year in a couple of countries in france and italy there are some smaller declines in some other economies including the big engine of europe being germany but certainly those three countries are the biggest contributors we have some tailwinds from the perspective of easier comparisons though nathan as i ve said i think we will see a narrowing of the international year over year performance as we continue to anniversary the heavy integration activities that we ve been executing on in europe with the air liquide welding acquisition so that 7 plus volume decline in the first quarter we think we ll narrow in the second quarter and continue to narrow as we finish off the second half of the year but what s pushing a headwind against that though is clearly the trends that we ve been seeing the last few months from a macro perspective the purchasing manager index continues to soften and industrial activity is softening in europe so we re growing more concerned about how we finish off from that perspective in the second half of the year and then our own internal initiatives to continue to integrate the businesses nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst is it possible for you to split what you think the volume decline is voluntarily related to the acquisition integration versus softening underlying markets vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer that s an interesting question i would have said last year that the markets the macros were relatively flattish if not growing slightly and the bulk of our declines were because of the integration activity i think this year some of the declines i would attribute to the overall softness in the markets i would be hesitant to give you a split this time but i think the welding markets and the steel markets in europe are showing some volume declines as we exit the first quarter nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst and then one quick one as a follow up to a previous question regarding volume in the americas you gave us three markets there that were strong they were up double digits can you give us some any color on the markets that were less strong maybe down vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you know the markets that were down were only down in modest terms so general fabrication was one of those where a very modest amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars so i m reluctant to say that s a meaningful trend there couple other areas that were subcategories of oil and gas including power gen and shipbuilding were down but again nothing that was significant and then lastly offshore was down but those all those categories collectively don t outweigh for example heavy fabrication that was up significantly in the quarter in the americas so there were modest year over year declines but not meaningful nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst great thanks for taking my questions vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you re welcome operator thank you our next question is from mig dobre with baird your line is open mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst thank you good morning good morning guys christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning mig mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst good morning a couple of margin questions for me so i think i heard you say that starting with april you re looking at another round of salary and wage increases it was 3 million per quarter am i to sort of does that imply that q1 19 was not really impacted by the wage inflation that you kind of called out going forward vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer no there was underlying wage inflation in the first quarter as well but that was instituted in almost a year ago so we re highlighting the incremental increases in sg a that will be affecting us as the year unfolds so those prior year increases are certainly in our cost base in 2019 s first quarter mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst okay so i m asking because when i m looking at the incremental margin in the americas right i mean we re talking something like 17 and going forward in the quarter you also had the benefit from mix and from price cost so going forward if we re talking about an additional drag from wages how should folks think about your incremental margin for the year or quarters however you want to frame it vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah so incremental margins i would expect to be in the same range that we ve been disclosing heretofore mig we were about 18 19 i believe in the americas and our expectations are to be somewhere in the 20 to 25 range as a group wide number mainly driven by that americas segment so we re going to have to continue to drive productivity through the business and hope to offset those escalating wage costs it have to see some improvements in input costs outside of wage inflation but certainly we will have the headwinds from the higher wage costs affecting our business for the rest of 2019 and the offsets will have to come again through productivity improvements or an easing in input costs outside of wages which is primarily raws mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst understood and then shifting to international again our margin i understand the volume decline comment and obviously that has an impact on profitability as well but we re not really seeing a lot of margin improvement still on a year over year basis here so i guess i m wondering can you maybe separate what s going on at alw versus your core business and then put maybe i m looking out to 2020 is it still fair for us to think that a double digit target for this segment is appropriate margin wise christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes that s a great question i can tell you mig that we re still very focused on our phase one of our integration process which we believe that we ll complete by the time we get to the back half of 2019 really positioning that business at that point to be able to grow from the completion of phase 1 we still got a couple more systems integrations to complete before that period of time as well as a host of other strategic projects i can share with you that we are not moving off our current target that we set up for the integration of that business our margin profile has not moved as quickly as i would have liked to have seen it but i do like the work that the team is doing in positioning the business we do have a little bit of a headwind now from the macroeconomics that are going on there within europe and we ll certainly have to see how that impacts our ability to execute on that target as we re moving forward but we are holding to the target of 10 operating profit that we had set out for that business as we entered into the integration work in bringing that business into lincoln electric now 18 months ago or so mircea dobre robert w baird co analyst i appreciate it thank you chris operator thank you and our next question is from matt trusz with g research your line is open matthew trusz gabelli analyst good morning thank you for taking my question christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning matt matthew trusz gabelli analyst can you discuss the additive business model in greater detail do you plan that this is going to stay inaudible service or do you anticipate selling equipment systems too looking into the mid 2020s and can you provide any early take on how you would compare this to equipment sales as far as margins go thank you christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer well first i d say that as we re executing on this piece of the strategy our intention is to be a service provider of this innovation technology into the marketplace our experience in building out the global automation portfolio and certainly having the largest welding automation portfolio here in the united states has given us experience in recognizing that bringing those technologies to the marketplace too quickly can create other challenges within the business model and i think that would only be enhanced as we re talking about the additive strategy that lincoln is deploying because we are really at the front end of this innovation there are only a handful of people around the world who are utilizing this type of technology as it relates to making these types of parts and building out this business model so our intention is that this would be a service model we may very well have a handful of units that are in r d centers or technical centers around the world but our intention again is for it to be a service model for us i would expect that as we re building that model out that the margins associated with this would be at or slightly favorable to our overall margins in the portfolio at this point in time we just really need to see exactly what types of opportunities are coming toward us but we see the value that can be created when you re creating that type of value you should be able to extract really a substantial portion of that profit pool so we re excited about what the margin profile can look for this business longer term but probably too early for us to determine exactly what that might be for our additive business as we re building it out matthew trusz gabelli analyst thank you and just to follow up on that how robust is the patent protection there and i get that this is better than laser and powder but for competitors who might have laser hot wire would you view that as being able to compete with this christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes we look we believe first of all we were one of the early innovators in laser hot wire so we understand that technology very well we believe we ll not only be able to compete but quite frankly could be a component within our broad additive strategy so and i think what s important to think about the value proposition and the mote ph that we re building around this technology is that look there are some proprietary ip that we have that we ll be able to leverage but as importantly is the competencies that we bring to this the competencies in understanding utilization robotics with metallurgy the building out of the software capabilities around that and so we re very confident that although there may be other participants who can be in the marketplace that this is a challenging innovation tool and that quite frankly we believe we ll be able to deliver and develop capabilities that will be very difficult for others to be able to match in the marketplace as we build out this business matthew trusz gabelli analyst thank you i appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from walter liptak with seaport global your line is open walter liptak seaport global analyst hi thanks good morning guys christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer hey good morning walt walter liptak seaport global analyst i want to ask a follow up on the international operating margin question especially with regard to air liquide welding in your comments i understand the macro may have gotten a little bit worse but is there a step up that can happen are there costs from these systems upgrades or are there integration costs that go away from the p l and help that margin step up later on this year vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer look i think we can get an improvement in the operating profit margins actually confident that we can as the restructuring and integration process has unfolded walt what s happened is that the sales declines are leading the cost decline so we re chasing the sales and costs down and so those sales declines will in my opinion begin to moderate and stabilize and restore themselves while cost will continue to decline after the top line stabilizes so we are continuing to spend on integration activities and new systems implementations and restructuring the manufacturing and sg a footprint and activities and i think that will catch up to the top line and expand margins as we exit this first half of the year walter liptak seaport global analyst okay as the sales stabilize do you think we will see growth as it s stabilized or do you think we ll continue to see declines through the back half of the year vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer well no as we had stated getting to that back half of the year where we get to a stable business environment and preparing ourselves for growth the only caution i have is that obviously not understanding what our macro economic position will be there in that particular market as we re in the back half of the year if we were to see a broad headwind across europe that would be difficult for us to say that we would drive the level of growth that we re looking for but i do believe that if we get to a stable business model and business structure there late in the back half of 19 we ll position that business for growth and even with that we ll be able to drive some of our solutions and technologies into that marketplace so and still expecting that then we will have executed on what we were looking for from the integration and then want to determine what those macros look like as we re moving in the back half of 19 walter liptak seaport global analyst okay great all right thank you christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you operator instructions our next question is from rob wertheimer with melius research your line is open rob wertheimer melius research analyst hello again thanks for the follow up my question is just on pricing in your perception of how it was absorbed by customers whether there was any hesitation ordering or buying inaudible would stick or not and then even though you ve kind of addressed this just more generally whether you feel some of the weakness that you saw was any of that related to lack of confidence or do you think it was genuinely end market weakness thank you vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so on the first one i don t think we observed any significant movement in order patterns as a result of pricing changes particularly in the first quarter of 2019 and i don t view there weren t a really significant pricing changes across our portfolio of companies both geographically and on a product line basis so i don t see that there was a big impact from that rob wertheimer melius research analyst and then just more generally on whether you can tell by customer by customer on flow versus equipment or any other way whether you felt like there was just an air pocket from hesitation or whether it was really just that s where the end markets are vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes i think it s where the end markets are and i can t emphasize enough what an unusually strong march of 2018 that we had march is generally the strongest month of the quarter and one of the stronger of the year and we had a bump up in march of 2018 i think part of that was to your question on pricing dynamics if there was an impact on order patterns and sales in any particular period it would have been in the prior year because the prior year had price increases coming out in april we raised prices in february in 18 as well as in april and they were escalating raw material prices and tariff discussions so if anything the prior year might have had a little bit extra bump in it over and above what a strong march might look like and then this year they doesn t have any of that as well as maybe a few markets including automotive being a little bit softer for us but i don t think the current year certainly has any meaningful order pattern changes from pricing rob wertheimer melius research analyst okay thank you very much vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you re welcome operator thank you and our next question is from steve barger with keybanc capital your line is open steve barger keybanc capital analyst hey thanks good morning christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer good morning steve steve barger keybanc capital analyst just a follow up to the conversation around becoming a service provider in additive is there any thought to pushing more into helping customers with other non welding automation applications like material handling or machine tending to leverage the investments you ve made there christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer yes steve look that s something that i would tell you we ve been doing so when we ve been acquiring these automation businesses across our portfolio rarely are these automation businesses 100 welding and cutting automation systems and if and if one of those businesses already has a competency or a capability around material handling or press transfer units or something else that they ve already got within their portfolio we ve not moved that business outside of the outside of the automation business we ve kept that business so we have competencies and capabilities in those other areas i would share with you that our focus is still welding and cutting but where we find complementary skill sets or capabilities within the portfolio we ve been willing to continue to utilize those capabilities and at times expand those capabilities so some of those competencies already exist inside of our automation business and we would and we would accept those opportunities in working with our customers as we re as we re doing that now what we have not done at this point is necessarily say that we would target unique opportunities outside of our portfolio that are 100 focused on those types of capabilities we might we have looked at some acquisition opportunities in that area but it s just finding the right ones if we view that that s a skill set that we want to bring in or if they bring some unique value proposition that we think would add to our overall automation and additive business steve barger keybanc capital analyst so when you think about growing automation and additive to 1 billion in 2025 two questions one do you is that going to look like the current portfolio in your mind and how much of that is driven by m a versus organic christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer well i don t think it s going to look like the current portfolio because quite frankly the additive portfolio needs to be a significant piece of that 1 billion and that s a new business model for us so and it is clearly going to have some uniqueness so that in itself steve i think creates at looking like a different portfolio there needs to be an m a component to that but as when we see the growth opportunities within these market place both in the automation piece and the additive piece there also needs to be a very significant growth perspective just because of those markets so i think we ll see a complement of both obviously if we were successful in bringing in a multitude of acquisitions in that space then we might come back out and adjust that number but today we re seeing that and believing that can be accomplished with some minor m a and more material organic growth within those businesses steve barger keybanc capital analyst got it and then just one last one in the press release you called this a cautious period of the cycle and are you saying that around the trends we ve already discussed on the call today in europe and china or are you seeing customers in north america express caution about demand trends christopher l mapes chairman president and chief executive officer no i think as vince said earlier we re not seeing any necessary broad caution between our customers here in the americas piece so i think it s just our perspective on this point in the cycle for lincoln electric and where we see the business steve barger keybanc capital analyst understood thanks operator thank you our next question is from nathan jones with stifel your line is open nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst morning again hoping you can give us some color on the growth investments you pointed to that as a drag to margins can you maybe tell us how much more you re putting into growth investments this year and then any color you can give us on on where it s going i m sure additive and automation are some of those places and then i think you took the capex guidance down 5 million just what s behind that thanks vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes nathan so the growth investments are really primarily around the additive conversation that we ve been having this morning and that s the bulk of the increase in cost and we estimate that to be around a run rate of 2 million per quarter during the course of 2019 operator all right and our last question is coming from jason rodgers with great lakes review your line is open jason rodgers great lakes review analyst my questions are already asked thanks operator thank you and i m not showing any questions in the queue this concludes our q a session i would like to turn the call back to vincent petrella for closing remarks vincent k petrella executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you carmen and thank everyone for joining us on the call today and for your continued interest in lincoln electric we look forward to discussing the progression of our strategic programs and at the end of the second quarter of 2019 thank you very much operator and with that ladies and gentlemen we thank you for participating in today s conference this concludes the program and you may all disconnect have a wonderful day

washington herman cain president trump s planned nominee for the federal reserve withdrew from consideration on monday after a lack of republican support in the senate doomed his prospects for confirmation trump made the announcement on twitter writing my friend herman cain a truly wonderful man has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the federal reserve board i will respect his wishes herman is a great american who truly loves our country cain would have needed near unanimous republican backing in the senate for confirmation but four republicans have said they would not vote for the nominee effectively killing his chances since republicans hold 53 seats in the senate and no democrats were expected to support him cain had maintained as recently as late last week that he d continue to vie for the role my friend herman cain a truly wonderful man has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the federal reserve board i will respect his wishes herman is a great american who truly loves our country donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 22 2019 trump s plan to pick cain a 2012 republican presidential primary candidate and restaurant industry executive was immediately controversial when the president announced cain was his choice earlier this month some lawmakers economists and wall street investors questioned his qualifications for the central bank and noted the multiple allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct that derailed his campaign cain has denied the allegations casting them as old news but one of the accusers said she would testify at his confirmation hearing if given the chance advertisement many also had concerns that the nomination of a close political ally of the president who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for trump and lashed out a trump s critics would threaten the bank s independence cain s withdrawal is a setback in trump s effort to install political allies on the fed board part of a broader tug of war between the central bank s leaders and the president over the fed s stewardship of the economy trump was irate after the fed raised interest rates multiple times in 2018 hikes that wound down the central bank s decade long effort to boost economic growth and fight unemployment after the great recession the increases were aimed at guarding against future inflation and preserving the fed s ability to fight a future downturn but trump accused the central bank of unnecessarily constraining growth and triggering the stock market sell off late last year cain and stephen moore trump s other planned pick to fill the remaining seats on the seven member fed board and another friend of the president s said they support lowering interest rates a move that would boost growth in the run up to the president s re election campaign trump has launched a series of attacks on the fed exhorting it to change course in a break with his immediate predecessors who typically refrained from publicly weighing in on central bank policy to protect the fed s credibility fed chairman jerome powell has said the bank has no plans to raise rates again this year citing some uncertainty about the pace of future growth advertisement the white house never formally nominated cain and has yet to nominate moore typically nominees undergo an extensive vetting process before the president announces them but trump appears to have announced cain as his planned nominee without fully coordinating with republican leaders that approach appeared to come up short thursday when sen kevin cramer of north dakota joined three other republicans sens mitt romney of utah lisa murkowski of alaska and cory gardner of colorado in announcing opposition to cain s nomination i don t think herman cain would be confirmed by the senate and i think the president would be wise to find someone who is less partisan and more experienced in the world of economics romney said thursday in explaining why he did not support the nominee with cain out the focus shifts to moore who was an adviser on trump s campaign and called for powell to be fired democratic senator and presidential candidate elizabeth warren of massachusetts sent moore a scathing letter this month accusing him of lacking a good grasp on basic mathematical and economic concepts the letter included nine questions for moore that attempt to clarify whether he still holds some of his more iconoclastic views in a cnn appearance moore claimed he had never been in favor of the gold standard where every dollar is backed by some gold but the network proceeded to play clips from three different speeches where moore clearly supported the policy which cain also endorses advertisement moore also called for interest rates to rise in the midst of the financial crisis a policy that many believe would have caused the country more harm moore started calling for a cut in interest rates once trump took office recently moore has said there is deflation in the united states even though government statistics and the white house council of economic advisers all say inflation is rising at about 2 percent a year this is not the first time trump has opted to first publicize a pick and then push the party to go along with it after trump named rear adm ronny jackson the presidential physician to be secretary of veteran affairs last year only to watch the nomination fall apart as allegations of misconduct surfaced his original choice for labor secretary andrew puzder also had to withdrawal after it surfaced that he had an undocumented housekeeper moore has faced similar criticisms about a lack of qualifications and past personal issues including his failure to pay his ex wife child support and alimony in 2013 but while republicans have largely expressed support or at least openness to moving forward with moore cain was a bridge too far for some in the president s party cain has taken an adversarial stance against some republican incumbents the chairman of cain s america fighting back pac in march sent an email saying 12 republican senators including romney and murkowski were traitors for voting against trump s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border cain said the senate banking committee which would handle his nomination was full of yahoos cain s potential nomination was immediately controversial on multiple fronts his presidential campaign which drew notice early in the republican primary for a 9 9 9 tax plan unraveled in 2011 amid multiple accusations of past sexual misconduct and harassment the national restaurant association cain s employer at the time of the accusations settled sexual harassment claims against cain with two women advertisement the fed board has often had business leaders on its board in addition to ph d economists and wall street bankers but cain s views were seen an outside the mainstream in the 1990s cain served on the federal reserve bank of kansas city s board of directors a group of business and community leaders who advise the head of the kansas city fed on how the economy is doing but he has supported controversial ideas such as a return to the gold standard system the united states abandoned nearly a half century ago the system would have made it almost impossible for the central bank to undertake many of the rescue measures it did during and after the 2008 2009 financial crisis trump s other nominees for the fed were eminently qualified people but all of a sudden trump has gone off the rails with stephen moore and herman cain said robert brusca chief economist at consulting firm fact and opinion economics a number of republicans however have expressed interest in having a wider variety of views on the fed board and seem open to taking a close look at moore who has been a big proponent of tax cuts ron paul a former republican congressman from texas and presidential candidate called cain and moore a basic improvement over many of the people who have served in the fed in recent years advertisement it s a good idea to have cain and moore at the fed they at least have knowledge and respect for a different way of doing things said paul a libertarian and vocal advocate for a return to the gold standard the fed plays a large role in steering the economy and overseeing banks the central bank s leaders a committee of 12 made up of the fed governors and five heads of regional fed banks from across the country decide whether to raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating or lower rates to try stimulate the economy at the moment interest rates are at a level that is considered neutral because it neither spurs growth nor holds it back the fed is tasked with making the best long term decisions for the economy steering clear of political calls to make short term moves that favor certain constituencies we are an organization devoted to public service we are professional we make decision based on facts and evidence and analysis and we stay out of politics said former fed chairwoman janet yellen at a forum at the dallas fed nothing we do is political related headlines opposition by 4 senate republicans may sink herman cain s chance to win seat on fed send questions comments to the editors previous next
inequality sunk costs and climate justice by frank ackerman march april 2019 this article is from dollars sense real world economics available at this article is from the march april 2019 issue climate change is at once a common problem that threatens us all and a source of differential harms based on location and resources we are all on the same boat in perilous waters but some of us have much nicer cabins than others what is the relationship of inequality to climate policy the ultimate economic obstacle to climate policy is the long life of so many investments housing can last for a century or more locking residents into locations that made sense long ago business investments often survive for decades these investments in the not so distant past assumed continuation of cheap oil and minimally regulated coal thereby building in a commitment to high carbon emissions now in a climate aware world we need to treat all fossil fuels as expensive and maintain stringent regulation of coal and it is impossible to repurpose many past investments for the new era they are sunk costs valuable only in their original location or industry if we could wave a magic wand and have a complete do over on urban planning we could create a new more comfortable and more sustainable way of life transit centered housing complexes surrounded by green spaces and by local amenities and services could offer convenient car free links to major employment sites absent a magic wand the challenge is how to get there from here in a short enough time frame to matter for climate policy space is the final frontier in energy use instead of shared public spaces for all an ever more unequal society allows the rich to enjoy immense private spaces such as mcmansions situated on huge exurban lots this leads to higher heating and cooling costs for oversized housing and to higher infrastructure costs in general longer pipes wires and travel distances between houses and it locks in a commitment to low population density and long individual commutes outside of the biggest cities much of the united states is too sparsely settled for mass transit pushing toward clean energy carbon prices and other incentives are designed to push people and businesses out of the most emissions intensive locations and activities along with the wealthy exurbs cold rural states with high heating and transportation requirements per person will become more expensive so too will investment in emissions intensive production processes whether in electricity generation heavy industry or agriculture the art of policymaking requires a delicate balance too much pressure to make fuel expensive can produce a backlash as in the yellow vests protests in france which successfully blocked an increase in the price of gasoline too little pressure leads to complacency and to the false belief that enough is already being done subsidies to support the transition may be useful but must be time limited to avoid becoming a permanent entitlement the green new deal the hopeful if still vague political vision that is now drawing widespread attention calls for a transition to clean energy investment in low carbon infrastructure and a focus on equality and workers rights a massive jobs program is inseparable from this proposal clean energy requires huge amounts of work in construction steelmaking all those wind turbines many branches of electronics new technologies for motor vehicles and more it would create substantial net benefits for the country and the economy a more fine grained analysis is needed however to identify those who might lose from a green new deal their losses will loom large in the policy debate regardless of the benefits to the rest of society for example as robert pollin and his colleagues have pointed out after years of seniority based cutbacks many of the remaining workers in legacy energy industries coal mines oil wells fossil fueled power plants are nearing retirement age pension guarantees combined with additional funding to allow early retirement may be more important to these workers new green jobs will be more important to their children to the small number of younger workers in at risk jobs and to those who have historically been excluded or under represented in industrial employment older residents who have spent their lives and invested their savings in a rural community or have no assets except a farm should be welcome to remain in those communities but the lingering mystique of an almost vanished rural america should not lead to new initiatives to attract younger residents back to an energy intensive emissions intensive lifestyle responding to inequality energy use and carbon emissions are quite unequally distributed within as well as between countries in all but the poorest countries the rich spend more on energy in absolute dollar terms but less than others as a percentage of income as a result any carbon price introduced in the united states or other high income countries will be regressive taking a greater percentage of income from lower income households to address this problem economist james boyce proposes refunding carbon revenues to households on an equal per capita basis in a cap and dividend system boyce s calculations show that most people could come out ahead on a cap and dividend plan only the richest 20 of u s households would lose from paying a relatively high carbon price if the revenues were refunded via equal per capita dividends other authors have proposed that some of the revenues could go to basic research or to infrastructure development accelerating the arrival of sustainable energy use any use of the revenues except distribution in proportion to individual fuel use or emissions preserves the incentive effect of a carbon price the question of cap and dividend versus investment in sustainable energy is largely a debate about what will make a regressive carbon price politically acceptable stranded assets it is not only households that have invested too heavily in now obsolete patterns of energy use the same pattern arises in a different context in the energy sector itself electric utilities have often invested in fossil fuel burning plants expecting to recover their investment over 20 to 30 years of use now as changing prices and priorities shut down some of those plants before the end of their planned lifetimes the unrecovered investment is a stranded asset no longer useful for producers or customers the problem is further complicated by the regulatory bargains made in many states depending on utility regulations which differ from state to state a utility may have formally agreed to allow state regulators to set its rates in exchange for an opportunity to recover its entire investment over a long period of years what happens to that regulatory bargain when a regulated plant becomes uneconomic to operate businesses whose investments have gone badly do not elicit the same degree of sympathy as individuals stuck in energy intensive homes and careers indeed milton friedman the godfather of modern conservative economics used to emphasize that private enterpirse is a profit and loss system where losses are even more important than profits in forcing companies to use their resources effectively despite friedman s praise of losses demanding that a utility absorb the entire loss on its stranded assets could provoke political obstacles to clean energy and climate policy neither zero recovery nor full recovery of a utility s stranded assets may be appropriate in theory once again it is the political art of the deal not any fixed economic formula that determines what should be done offering utilities too little provokes opposition and delay offering them too much is unfair to everyone else and could encourage similar mistaken investments in the future what does global sustainability look like climate change is a global problem that can only be solved by cooperation among all major countries the challenge for american policy is not only to reduce our own emissions but to also play a constructive role in global climate cooperation u s leadership in cooperation with china and europe is crucial to the global effort to control the climate reviving that leadership which had barely surfaced under obama before being abandoned by trump is among the most important things we can do for the world today in the longer run questions of climate justice and international obligations are among the most difficult aspects of climate policy high income countries such as the united states and northern europe bear substantial responsibility for the climate crisis worldwide among other approaches the greenhouse development rights framework combines historical responsibility for emissions and current ability to pay for mitigation in assigning shares of the global cost of climate stabilization in the current political climate there is no hope of achieving complete consensus about international burden sharing before beginning to address the climate crisis the urgency of climate protection requires major initiatives as soon as possible in parallel with not waiting for the conclusion of discussions of international equity u s actions on both fronts are essential for global progress toward climate stabilization significant steps toward equity and burden sharing may be required to win the support of emerging economies such as india indonesia and brazil assuming it succeeds what would global sustainable development look like in view of the rapid urbanization of emerging economies the key question is what kind of low carbon urban life can the world afford the sprawling car intensive and carbon intensive expanse of los angeles phoenix or houston seems like an amazingly expensive mistake the compact energy efficient transit based urbanism of tokyo or hong kong is at least a contender a high income life with much lower resource use per person the american example matters around the world if our vision of the good life remains one of extravagant sprawl others will try to imitate it if we develop a more sustainable vision of our own future the whole world will be watching is principal economist at synapse energy economics in cambridge mass and one of the founders of dollars sense dollars sense maintains james

herman cain president trump s planned nominee for the federal reserve withdrew from consideration monday a recognition that too many senate republicans had announced they would vote against him trump made the announcement on twitter writing my friend herman cain a truly wonderful man has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the federal reserve board i will respect his wishes herman is a great american who truly loves our country despite the setback trump is not planning to back away from his plan to name allies to the two remaining openings on the fed according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity cain s withdrawal is a setback in trump s effort to install political allies on the fed board part of a broader tug of war between the central bank s leaders and the president over the fed s stewardship of the economy advertisement cain called the white house on monday morning to say he did not want to be considered for the position anymore according to cain and a person familiar with the call cain expressed concern that he would be taking a pay cut fed governors are paid 183 100 a year and that he would not be as free to speak publicly as he is on his radio show last week cain insisted that he would continue to vie for the role saying it was not in my dna to drop out but he said in an online column monday that he prayed about it over the weekend and felt god was giving me my answer it was an honor to be considered he wrote the white house is considering a number of other candidates to fill the final opening on the seven member board while fed and white house leaders continue to speak on a regular basis as is typical the fed is no longer being consulted on nominations according to two people familiar with the matter advertisement cain would have needed near unanimous republican backing in the senate for confirmation but four republicans have said they would not vote for the nominee effectively killing his chances because republicans hold 53 seats in the senate and no democrats were expected to support him with cain out the focus now shifts to stephen moore trump s other planned nominee for the board moore was an adviser to the trump campaign and has been a prominent supporter of the president democratic leaders see moore as an equally problematic and unqualified nominee but republicans remain open to him with none saying they would vote against him herman cain was woefully unqualified to be on the federal reserve and his failure to garner adequate support should not be used as a pathway by senate republicans to approve stephen moore who is equally unqualified and perhaps more political senate minority leader charles e schumer d n y said in a statement monday mr moore like mr cain poses a danger to the economic stability of our country advertisement moore is still going through the vetting process and has not been formally nominated yet by the white house which continues to advocate for moore we back moore wholeheartedly said larry kudlow trump s top economic adviser trump was irate after the fed raised interest rates multiple times in 2018 hikes that wound down the central bank s decade long effort to boost economic growth and fight unemployment after the great recession the increases were aimed at guarding against inflation and preserving

it has been important to pay attention to the bond market over the past two years or so because a lot of what is going on in the investment world is impacting bond yields in was in fact in december 2017 that i first called attention to the role the bond market might play in 2018 and beyond again looking at the bond market from the fall of 2018 to the present i believe helps us to further understand some of the changes that are going on today on november 8 2018 the yield on the 10 year us treasury note closed at 3 24 percent the near term high for this security on friday april 18 2019 the yield on the 10 year us treasury note closed at 2 56 percent showing a 68 basis point drop from the earlier date breaking this yield up to its â assumedâ components we can argue that the real expected yield on the 10 year security as proxied by the yield on the 10 year us treasury inflation protected securities tips dropped from 1 14 percent at the earlier date to 0 60 percent on the april date a drop of 54 basis points inflationary expectations calculated by subtracting the tips yield from the nominal yield dropped over this time period by 14 basis points from 2 10 percent to 1 96 percent so there was a little rise in inflationary expectations but the real change in market behavior seems to have been connected with the decline in the yield on the tips it is interesting to note however that these changes were not consistent throughout the time period being examined for example inflationary expectations fell from the 2 10 percent on september 8 2018 to 1 66 percent on december 31 2018 a decline of 44 basis points over this time period the yield on the 10 year tips dropped only 11 basis points from 1 14 percent to 1 03 percent what was going on here one could argue that the investors were reflecting new data coming out that indicated the changes taking place in how they perceived the economy was behaving the yield on the tips is often associated with the marketâ s expectations about future economic growth thus it does not appear that much change took place in how the economy was perceived to be growing but over this time period the price of oil dropped at the end of october 2018 a barrel of oil cost around 67 toward the end of december 2018 oil was trading below 46 as cited above inflationary expectations dropped precipitously note also at this time the us stock market fell the s p 500 hit a historical high on september 20 2018 by december 24 2018 the s p 500 dropped to 2 351 what was going on in the oil market seemed to be impacting how investors perceived inflation was going to influence the global economic situation one might add that the value of the us dollar strengthened during this time period as the us economy was showing strength relative to other parts of the world the us dollar index as published by the wall street journal rose from 93 9 in late september to rest just above 96 0 in late december then things turned around the price of oil began to rise after the first of the year and now resides around 64 per barrel inflationary expectations picked up in the bond market rising from 1 66 percent to the current level of 1 96 percent not much different than before the rise in the price of oil in the fall what got hit was the yield on the 10 year tips going from a yield of 1 03 percent on december 31 2018 to 0 60 percent on april 18 2019 represents a major change in expectations one of the factors impacting this drop in the â realâ yield has been the revision of growth expectations especially for europe but also for the united states as well this decline in growth expectations has impacted the behavior of central banks both in europe and in the united states in europe for example the european central bank has backed off from raising rates as the economies of the eurozone have shown greater weakness furthermore growth expectations for the united states have also been reduced but there is another thing that has happened a concern over the risk associated with the eurozone has also risen again this really became apparent in the middle of february as the yields on european bonds dropped as some bad news began to spread most notably the yield on the 10 year german bund which traded near 0 20 percent in january became negative toward the end of march and has only just gone into positive territory again not too long ago movements like these indicated that â risk averseâ monies were leaving the eurozone area and moving into â safe havensâ in other parts of the world in the united states especially these monies tended to cause the yield on the 10 year tips to go lower than they would otherwise to back up this hypothesis we also see the us dollar getting stronger in world markets during the same time period the us dollar index mentioned above ended the day on friday at 97 5 and on friday one euro could only buy 1 12 whereas in the fall one euro could buy almost 1 18 the demand for the us dollar certainly picked up during this time period one could also add onto this that the s p 500 stock index is now about 2 902 on monday morning april 22 2019 not too far below its historic high of 2 931 one reason for the volatility of the markets over the last six months or so has been this swing in investor expectations but just jumping from the middle of the fall until now it appears that the biggest worry for investors is world economic growth and the riskiness that is associated with the uncertainty now present globally politically as well as economically inflationary expectations are about the same this picture is the backdrop for the current monetary policy dilemma it seems as if there will not be another interest rate increase on the part of the federal reserve this year but market concern is focused upon how the fed will actâ or reactâ going forward i still think it is very valuable to keep an eye on the bond market to see how investors are reacting to not only the economic data that will be forthcoming but also to see how they are anticipating policy changes
see also equity oriented workforce strategies for a progressive infrastructure plan by livia lam advancing a large scale plan to rebuild america s crumbling roads and bridges is at the top of many federal lawmakers 2019 agenda 1 after president donald trump s failed attempt to advance such a bill in 2018 progressive policymakers should move forward with a bold plan to invest in america s 21st century competitiveness a goal that will require prioritizing investment in green energy broadband and targeted support for struggling communities alongside support for the nation s existing physical infrastructure 2 equally important lawmakers must ensure that any major infrastructure investment also helps secure the nation s long term prosperity this means that the jobs supported by the plan must pay fair wages provide good benefits and a voice on the job and offer american workers from all walks of life a pathway to the middle class 3 over the past century pro worker lawmakers have sought to uphold the basic guarantee that government spending will create good jobs this has been accomplished through a variety of measures such as prevailing wage and benefits laws that ensure workers receive fair compensation as well as protections to prevent discrimination support equal pay and ensure that workers are able to exercise their right to form unions 4 yet it is far from guaranteed that the jobs created through the infrastructure plan will be good ones today job quality standards are frequently under attack republicans in congress have introduced legislation to repeal or weaken prevailing wage protections over the past several sessions 5 as one of his first acts in office president trump signed legislation that weakened standards to ensure that federal contractors obey existing workplace laws 6 the administration also is establishing a new apprenticeship program for industries outside of construction that will allow sponsors to avoid existing anti discrimination protections and will likely result in workers having less of a say in how training is conducted 7 indeed trump never committed to ensuring that his own infrastructure plan would support only decent jobs with good pay benefits and protections for workers 8 moreover existing protections cover less than half of all federal spending 9 while workers on jobs funded through federal contracting dollars enjoy numerous job quality protections these policies usually do not apply to jobs funded through federal grants loans loan guarantees and tax incentives in addition current laws are often too weak to lift workers out of poverty protect workers attempting to form a union or otherwise change the behavior of companies that do not respect their workers 10 without adequate job quality protections jobs funded through any new infrastructure investments could be of low quality pay substandard wages provide too few opportunities for advancement particularly for women people of color and other historically disadvantaged communities and do little to correct the decadeslong problem of stagnating u s wages weak job standards not only harm american workers but also put responsible businesses that pay fair wages and respect employees at a competitive disadvantage moreover research finds that when corporations receiving government contracts pay poverty wages or violate workplace laws they often deliver poor quality products to taxpayers and require taxpayers to bear hidden costs through federal and state governments provision of services to supplement workers incomes such as medicaid nutrition assistance and refundable tax credits 11 pro worker lawmakers must not only fight to ensure that any major infrastructure investments carry existing job quality protections but they also must use the infrastructure debate to strengthen and expand on these protections and ensure that all workers particularly those from historically disadvantaged groups are able to participate doing so will help raise standards for workers whose jobs are directly funded by the investment and particularly in a tight labor market such as the one the united states is experiencing today raise standards for private sector workers as companies compete for skilled employees in addition attaching strong job quality standards to the infrastructure investment can help build momentum for federal actions to raise standards for all workers such as bills to raise the minimum wage to 15 per hour and eliminate loopholes for agricultural and tipped workers as well as americans with disabilities provide essential benefits such as comprehensive paid family and medical leave and medicare extra for all and support all workers right to join a union during the last congressional session democrats in both chambers expressed a strong commitment to ensuring that the jobs created through an infrastructure plan pay decent wages and benefits and progressive policymakers are beginning to move in that direction this session 12 for example in their better deal agenda senate democrats endorsed protections on all government spending to help ensure that workers who want to form unions are able to do so 13 this issue brief outlines the essential protections that policymakers must adopt to ensure that all jobs created through federal infrastructure spending provide family supporting wages and benefits opportunities for advancement and a voice for workers on the job these jobs include those funded through federal grants loans contracts and public private partnerships that include federal participation moreover these standards should apply not only to initial construction work but to ongoing maintenance service and operations jobs as well as is the case with existing protections for the contracted workforce job quality standards would also flow down to the workforce of subcontractors finally to ensure that recipients of infrastructure funds comply with these standards policymakers should include funding for monitoring and enforcement efforts require recipients to report on compliance through publicly accessible databases and partner with trusted worker and community organizations to educate workers on their rights and help them feel comfortable coming forward if their rights are violated in this way the infrastructure package can help raise standards for workers throughout the economy 6 essential protections to ensure infrastructure investment creates good jobs 1 pay nonpoverty wages and provide decent benefits the davis bacon act and the mcnamara o hara service contract act help ensure that federal spending does not drive down standards in the construction and service sectors by setting required wage and benefit rates for contracted workers at existing market levels the federal government has regularly acted to extend davis bacon act prevailing wage requirements to construction jobs funded through grants loans loan guarantees and even some types of tax credits 14 yet the wage protections enumerated under the service contract act have never been extended beyond direct federal contracting in the more than 50 years since the law was enacted 15 even when davis bacon standards apply to construction work ongoing service and maintenance work associated with a project for example may not be covered 16 moreover prevailing wage rates for a range of jobs across the country fall below the living wage needed to sustain a family for example the prevailing wage and benefit rate for a laborer in atlanta is just 45 percent of the area s living wage for an adult with one child while the prevailing wage and benefit rate for a guard for example a building security officer in milwaukee is equivalent to only 74 percent of the area s living wage 17 in order to help combat poor pay and working conditions among federal contractors former president barack obama signed an executive order to raise the minimum wage for contracted workers to 10 10 per hour and index it to inflation in 2014 in 2015 he signed an executive order that required contractors to provide workers at least seven days of paid sick leave so that they could care for themselves or family members including chosen family members 18 raising the contractor minimum wage to 15 per hour would ensure that hard work pays and would build on obama s actions companies receiving taxpayer support should be required to pay the area s prevailing wage or a 15 minimum wage whichever is higher in addition companies as noted above should be required to comply with the health and welfare benefits required by existing prevailing wage laws and provide at least seven days of paid sick leave finally prevailing wage calculations should be strengthened to foster strong industry standards for example new york maryland and jersey city new jersey have adopted policies to help ensure that collectively bargained wage rates are also the prevailing wage rates 19 federal policymakers should follow the leads of these locations by setting the wage that prevails under both davis bacon and the service contract act to the wage paid to 30 percent of workers in an industry in a locality 20 2 prevent discrimination and enforce equal pay protections in 1964 president lyndon b johnson signed executive order 11246 to prevent discrimination among contractors on the basis of race color religion or national origin 21 the order applied not only to the positions directly funded through federal spending but also to all employees of companies with federal contracts regardless of whether their work was funded through procurement spending the order also allowed for the creation of an enforcement body the office of federal contract compliance programs ofccp whose mission was later expanded to include enforcing protections for workers and preventing discrimination on the basis of sex sexual orientation gender identity disability and status as a protected veteran 22 this includes protections against sexual harassment pay discrimination and family caregiving discrimination as well as requirements to provide accommodation to workers with disabilities and pregnant workers research shows that through its power to withhold future contracts and require affirmative action plans the ofccp significantly increased equal opportunity for women and people of color in companies receiving federal contracts 23 more recently the obama administration combated pay discrimination among federal contractors by boosting pay transparency and prohibiting retaliation when workers discuss pay it also undertook efforts to surface pay disparities by collecting more government data from large companies on worker pay by race gender and ethnicity 24 however the ofccp s jurisdiction extends only to federal contractors companies receiving grants loans or loan guarantees are not subject to the agency s oversight moreover the trump administration halted corporate reporting requirements on pay data and has weakened protections for lgbtq workers 25 in 2017 trump granted former u s attorney general jeff sessions sweeping authority to enact religious exemptions from nondiscrimination protections for federal contractors 26 all companies receiving federal infrastructure funds should be subject to ofccp enforcement authority as well as obama era pay transparency requirements in order to ensure that they do not discriminate or retaliate against employees or applicants because of their race color gender religion national origin sexual orientation or gender identity disability or veteran status in order to support enforcement efforts the infrastructure investment must allocate funding to the ofccp sufficient to support targeted investigations into industries and occupations with high levels of disparities as well as reviews of employee movement from entry and mid level jobs into higher earning positions 27 finally all companies receiving federal support should be required to report on the pay and demographic data of their workforces 3 expand access to apprenticeship and paid training registered apprenticeships are a proven training model that combines structured classroom instruction with paid on the job training employers in the building and construction industry have long used registered apprenticeships to provide a steady pipeline of highly qualified workers who meet federal and state standards for safety and training for workers earning an industry issued nationally recognized credential through apprenticeship leads not only to high paying jobs but also to opportunities for career advancement yet for too long women people of color and workers with disabilities were excluded from these jobs while community organizations labor organizations training intermediaries and the public workforce system have made significant progress in recent decades to expand access to construction trades more can be done to expand the scope of high quality apprenticeship programs and increase access and pay for historically disadvantaged communities 28 for example washington state and alaska have both adopted policies to ensure that 15 percent of the work on publicly supported construction projects is performed by apprentices 29 in addition cities and states are increasingly adopting targeted hire standards and pre apprenticeship programs to ensure that local residents and historically disadvantaged residents such as women people of color low income residents and residents with past involvement with the criminal justice system are able to obtain the construction and permanent jobs created with the support of public expenditures 30 san francisco for example has significantly expanded access to publicly supported construction projects by mandating that local residents complete 30 percent of a project s total work hours and 50 percent of its apprenticeship hours as well as by partnering with industry labor and community nonprofits to create an 18 week pre apprenticeship program 31 and the los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority adopted a policy in 2012 that requires that 20 percent of employees on construction projects be apprentices and that 10 percent be from disadvantaged communities 32 however president trump is undermining the power of these sorts of programs to raise standards for working people in 2017 the trump administration announced that it was ending a pilot program at the u s department of transportation that allowed communities to establish local hire preferences 33 also the administration is establishing a parallel apprenticeship system that will allow third party industry groups outside of construction to develop apprenticeship programs without having to meet existing federal registered apprenticeship standards 34 lawmakers should require that 15 percent or more of labor hours on large scale infrastructure projects be performed by apprentices participating in programs that meet federal and state registered apprenticeship standards they should also require these projects to adopt a targeted hire initiative that establishes mandatory hiring requirements and partners with local community groups to ensure that affected groups such as local residents women people of color workers with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups are able to access these jobs in industries and regions with few established registered apprenticeship programs or where established apprenticeship programs have little capacity to fulfill necessary training the bill should ensure partnership with the public workforce system and provide funding to labor management intermediaries to develop apprenticeship or paid work based learning programs these new projects would assess the training needs of the sector customize the training and apprenticeships to fit local needs and be accessible and cultivate partners to help provide training and recruit participation among women people of color and other disadvantaged communities 4 respect workers rights to join a union president obama signed several executive orders to support workers bargaining rights these orders took actions requiring contract recipients to post notices informing employees of their right to bargain collectively requiring successor service contractors to provide a right of first refusal to workers employed on the previous contract encouraging government agencies to use project labor agreements on large construction projects and preventing companies from using federal funds to fight the efforts of workers to form a union 35 these protections should apply broadly to all companies receiving support through the federal infrastructure package yet it is still far too easy for anti union corporations to fight workers efforts to come together in unions and negotiate for better pay and benefits although existing government policies prohibit contractors from using federal funds to fight workers efforts to form unions they are free to use their own funds to do so employers often engage in sophisticated campaigns to prevent workers from forming unions which can include forcing workers to attend anti union meetings including one on one conversations with supervisors and pressuring workers to reveal their private preferences for the union 36 when anti union employers break the law penalties are weak and insufficient workers are fired in one quarter to one third of union organizing campaigns but they can at best hope to recover their lost wages and get reinstated in their jobs often after years of legal battles 37 to ensure that workers who want to form a union have a fair shot at doing so companies should be prohibited from attempting to persuade workers employed on taxpayer supported work to exercise or not exercise the right to organize a union and when a majority of workers demonstrate their support for a union corporations should be required to bargain with them 5 comply with existing workplace laws numerous government reports have found that government contractors face few consequences when they break federal workplace laws designed to ensure that workers are paid what they are owed are safe on the job and do not face discrimination a 2017 report from the office of sen elizabeth warren d ma found that two thirds of the government s 100 largest contractors have been caught breaking workplace wage and safety laws 38 previous reports by the nonpartisan government accountability office and a senate committee have found similar results for example the senate committee on health education labor and pensions found that the worst violators of workplace laws receive 81 billion in federal contracts in a single year 39 although president obama took executive action to ensure that companies comply with health and safety standards wage laws and antidiscrimination protections before they receive federal contracts president trump signed legislation to roll back these protections before they were fully implemented 40 lawmakers in congress should require companies that apply for federal infrastructure funds to report on their record of compliance with workplace laws if they have a poor track record lawmakers should require them to come into compliance before they are able to receive any federal funding 6 create jobs in the united states laws designed to ensure that the federal government purchases american made products and that federally supported infrastructure projects use american made inputs are too often poorly enforced and cover a limited number of spending programs as well as a limited number of end products 41 looking only at contracting for example the u s government opens a far greater share of its procurement market to foreign goods than do its largest foreign trade partners covered under the world trade organization s agreement on government procurement 42 in 2017 president trump called for a review of current agency procedures governing buy american and buy america policies 43 he subsequently issued an executive order to encourage stronger enforcement of existing buy america laws covering infrastructure projects such as roadways broadband and pipelines 44 these aspirational actions have highlighted the glaring deficiencies in domestic content laws but they fall short by not ensuring any tangible change all assistance to states and other recipients of infrastructure funds should be covered by strong domestic content standards 45 to strengthen the monitoring and enforcement of existing standards these efforts must ensure that all federal agencies provide clear domestic content definitions and guarantee transparent and thorough audit processes 46 congress should make these issues a priority as it advances an infrastructure package the federal government should establish high thresholds for granting waivers of domestic content preferences ensure that low bid contracting procedures do not undercut the ability to source domestically produced content expand the application of buy american and buy america preferences to other types of federal spending programs and federal assistance programs identified as not being covered such as aid programs for waterworks infrastructure and when practicable add key industries to protected trade lists 47 job quality standards improve conditions for workers taxpayers and business owners by implementing the reforms listed above policymakers would significantly raise standards for working people studies of wage standards for example find that these protections raise wages lower poverty rates and reduce inequality in affected industries 48 for example one study found that construction workers in states with strong or average prevailing wage laws made nearly 12 000 more per year on average than construction workers in states with weak or no prevailing wage laws 49 in addition a recent report from the illinois economic policy institute found that participation in registered apprenticeship programs results in an average annual earnings gain of more than 3 400 and a lifetime earnings gain of nearly 120 000 50 similarly efforts to reduce workplace discrimination through federal procurement programs have been shown to be successful after president johnson adopted affirmative action requirements for federal contractors studies show that demand for african americans and women increased significantly in contractor establishments compared with noncontractor establishments 51 and by ensuring that workers who want to form a union are able to do so lawmakers can support a thriving american middle class since research shows that unions reduce wage inequality and increase economic mobility 52 for example children who grow up in areas with a high union density typically rank relatively higher in income distribution as adults than those from areas with few union members 53 these sorts of job standards can also provide better results for businesses that respect their workers for example research finds that paid sick leave boosts economic efficiency as workers are more likely to stay home when sick thereby preventing the spread of illness and to seek preventive care 54 also after san francisco international airport adopted contracting standards annual turnover among security screeners fell from nearly 95 percent to 19 percent saving employers thousands of dollars per employee per year in restaffing costs 55 finally job quality standards can also help ensure that taxpayers receive good value for their investment as discussed above job quality standards are key to ensuring that taxpayers do not bear the hidden cost of providing services to supplement contract workers incomes a study reviewing the effects of prevailing wage laws found that the 16 4 percent of construction workers in states with no or weak prevailing wage laws receive the earned income tax credit compared with 11 3 percent of construction workers in states with average or strong prevailing wage laws 56 moreover research finds that contractors that violate workplace laws often deliver poor quality to taxpayers a report from the center for american progress action fund found that a quarter of companies that committed the worst violations and later received federal contracts had significant performance issues those problems ranged from contractors submitting fraudulent billing statements to the federal government to cost overruns performance problems and schedule delays during the development of major weapons systems that cost taxpayers billions of dollars to contractors falsifying firearms safety test results for federal courthouse security guards to an oil rig explosion that spilled millions of barrels of oil into the gulf of mexico 57 higher job quality standards also encourage more companies to bid for contracts since they no longer have to compete against low road firms willing to pay poverty wages after maryland implemented a contractor living standard the average number of bids for contracts in the state increased 27 percent and approximately half of contracting companies interviewed by the state said that the new living wage standard encourage them to bid on state contracts because it levels the playing field 58 conclusion a major infrastructure investment holds the promise to jump start american investment in key sectors such as clean energy transit and broadband yet such a plan could spur a massive investment in human infrastructure by attaching robust quality standards to all jobs created by the plan lawmakers can help bolster high wage job growth throughout the economy and offer american workers from all walks of life a pathway to the middle class karla walter is the director of employment policy at the center for american progress
with new sources of uncertainty seemingly proliferating by the day a broad economic slowdown should come as no surprise and as long as the rules and institutions governing the global economy remain in doubt continued underperformance is to be expected by dr a michael spence william r berkley professor in economics and business stern school of business new york university the global economy is weakening in no small measure because of a deep widespread sense of uncertainty and a major source of that uncertainty is the ongoing sino american trade war as lawrence j lau of stanford university has shown the problem is not that tit for tat tariffs have had an especially large impact except perhaps on particular us and chinese economic sectors rather the conflict has cast doubt on the future of global economic connectivity which has led to lower investment and consumption in china and the united states and among their respective trading partners moreover the chinese state has expanded its role in the economy state owned enterprises are back in favor among young jobseekers and in the eyes of the largely state owned banking sector even though many soes really should be restructured rather than kept afloat at the same time many private sector firms are finding credit scarce and very expensive and bankruptcies appear to be on the rise periodic policy interventions to reverse these longstanding public private asymmetries have proved insufficient as for the us the economy is coming down from a pro cyclical fiscal stimulus that was bound to leave a mild hangover and until very recently the us federal reserve has been tightening monetary policy with the effects of higher interest rates probably delayed by the trump administration s december 2017 tax cuts meanwhile according to a recent council on foreign relations report jobs in manufacturing construction and mining have become relatively scarce while unfilled openings in a range of higher productivity service industries are increasing more generally productivity growth has been trending downward undercutting long term growth a mckinsey global institute report notes that this trend is partly due to lags in the implementation of new digital technologies another factor is the growing skills mismatch which has also contributed to labor immobility between traditional blue collar jobs and services political developments are adding to the uncertainty in the us no one knows if the 2020 presidential election will result in a second term for donald trump or a new democratic administration governing from either the center or the far left the range of possible policy scenarios from antitrust actions against major digital platforms to universal health care schemes and major changes in the tax system is more expansive than it has been in decades the situation in europe is not very different with nationalism and populism of the left and right on the rise anti establishment parties have either gained ground or taken power in many countries in light of these developments the european union seems increasingly unlikely to undertake sorely needed structural reforms the only two leaders who could push through such measures german chancellor angela merkel and french president emmanuel macron have been weakened politically merkel has announced that this term will be her last and macron has had to contend with widespread and in many cases violent protests since november come may all eyes will be on the european parliament elections which could result in a radical reshuffling of personnel at the european council and commission and complicating matters further the united kingdom has fallen down the rabbit hole of brexit adding to the climate of uncertainty on the economic front germany s troubles owing to its sizeable industrial sector and significant exposure to developments in china have had spillover effects across europe italy remains in a two decade period of subdued growth with youth unemployment at an intolerably high 32 worse the italian government has taken a confrontational approach to the eu over fiscal rules but lacks a convincing plan to achieve long term growth with italian sovereign debt having ticked back up toward 140 of gdp there is reason to worry that a spike in yields for government bonds as happened in 2010 2012 could provoke a fiscal crisis should that happen it is unclear how the european central bank would respond in any case the absence of strong growth will add to the fragility of the italian banking sector as nonperforming loans tend to rise with growth headwinds that in turn will result in tighter credit and damage to still healthy sectors of the italian economy more broadly europe is lagging behind other powers in terms of innovation and the adoption of new digital technologies but digital technologies themselves are also contributing to global uncertainty the extent to which digital platforms can influence political processes is unclear but there is ample evidence to suggest that they have amplified social fault lines and made democratic elections easier to exploit beneath those fault lines are powerful economic trends not least the labor market and income polarization that is observable across the developed economies the global economy is undergoing a major transition owing to the rise of emerging economies especially in asia and the digital transformation of business models and global supply chains services constitute a growing shareof global trade and the search is on for new sources of comparative advantage the location of final markets and the configuration of supply chains are in flux or being upended entirely and while it is obvious that global governance structures and rules need an overhaul existing international institutions lack the power to push through such changes on their own and the governments of the world s leading economic powers do not seem up to the task taken together these diverse economic and political trends may or may not lead to another global crisis or sudden stop either way they will sustain a prolonged period of radical uncertainty under such conditions caution may seem like the best policy for companies investors consumers and even governments but caution carries its own costs companies and countries that fail to invest enough in for example new digital technologies may well fall by the wayside and as long as the rules and institutions governing the global economy remain in doubt continued underperformance is to be expected originally published by project

but despite solid fundamentals our recent survey shows that there are serious risks for indonesia on the horizon the us china trade war is doing some squeezing of its own it is unclear how the trade war will end but the long term damage it will do to asian trade and supply chains is crystal clear the global policy environment is highly uncertain the 2016 brexit referendum caused volatility in asian financial markets and the probability of a no deal brexit is rising the trump administration continues to weaken the global rules and institutions which have underpinned much of asia s prosperity particularly the world trade organization the imf downgraded its global growth forecasts in january particularly for emerging economies and the advanced economies could soon follow the united states will likely enter recession in 2020 and limited monetary policy space may see the federal reserve return to unconventional monetary policy sending a fresh wave of volatility towards asia advertisement while growth has been steady and supported by infrastructure investments and with inflation also under control indonesia nevertheless has challenges at home too sixty per cent of jokowi s infrastructure promises were to be funded by state owned enterprises and the private sector but to date state owned enterprises have funded almost 100 per cent and have become substantially more indebted as a result there are concerns in what has been a relatively stable banking system in the past decade high demand for loans in 2018 and portfolio capital outflow have drained liquidity from indonesia s banks particularly smaller banks increased short term borrowing by non financial corporations and the large stock of government debt held by foreigners similarly creates vulnerabilities the indonesian parliament passed the prevention and resolution of financial system crisis law in 2016 to ensure better cooperation collaboration and preparation between indonesia s regulators and institutions the objective of the new law is commendable but it has serious weaknesses as indonesian policymakers know from experience when a financial crisis hits speed is everything if authorities are slow to act liquidity shortages can become solvency crises banking crises can become currency crises currency crises can become sovereign debt crises and what started as a financial crisis quickly becomes an economic and political crisis staying ahead of the curve is critical advertisement indonesia s new law needs improvement a bank suffering a liquidity shortage would ordinarily receive assistance from bank indonesia the central bank under the new law the remedy is not so simple particularly given bank bailouts have now been outlawed currency crises can become sovereign debt crises and what started as a financial crisis quickly becomes an economic and political crisis reuters the law creates a crisis committee comprising bank indonesia the financial services authority the deposit insurance agency and the ministry of finance if a troubled bank needs emergency assistance there must be agreement between all four the bank must request assistance the financial services authority must prepare advice for the committee on whether support is necessary all four agencies must agree that liquidity support is appropriate bank indonesia must confirm to the committee that the bank has adequate collateral although not prescribed in law our survey of officials suggests two other steps are likely first the crisis committee would request that other banks in indonesia or foreign parent banks or shareholders provide the assistance rather than bank indonesia historically this has been unsuccessful second there is a high probability that the committee will seek political cover and brief the president directly on the situation seeking presidential approval before any decision is made advertisement this process is slow and bureaucratic to say the least why would such a law be created the law s motivation dates back to the government s us700 million 980 bailout of bank century in 2008 indonesia s then 13th largest bank unexpected losses over the bailout of bank century led to riots outside parliament and numerous investigations against senior policymakers and officials these are real concerns for indonesian policymakers they do not have the legal protections enjoyed by those elswhere revision of the law is needed to protect officials who are acting in good faith to help officials do their jobs quickly and effectively and to reinstate bank indonesia as the lender of last resort with risks rising at home and abroad indonesia s crisis management framework could end up tested sooner rather than later indonesia s macroeconomic management has been strong and has weathered storms well strengthening its crisis management framework should jokowi s top priority adam triggs is director of research at the asian bureau of economic research at the australian

washington herman cain president donald trump s planned nominee for the federal reserve withdrew from consideration on monday after a lack of republican support in the senate doomed his prospects for confirmation trump made the announcement on twitter writing my friend herman cain a truly wonderful man has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the federal reserve board i will respect his wishes herman is a great american who truly loves our country cain would have needed near unanimous republican backing in the senate for confirmation but four republicans have said they would not vote for the nominee effectively killing his chances since republicans hold 53 seats in the senate and no democrats were expected to support him cain had maintained as recently as late last week that he d continue to vie for the role trump s plan to pick cain a 2012 gop presidential primary candidate and restaurant industry executive was immediately controversial when the president announced cain was his choice earlier this month some lawmakers economists and wall street investors questioned his qualifications for the central bank and noted the multiple allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct that derailed his campaign cain has denied the allegations casting them as old news but one of the accusers said she would testify at his confirmation hearing if given the chance many also had concerns that the nomination of a close political ally of the president who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for trump and lashed out a trump s critics would threaten the bank s independence cain s withdrawal is a setback in trump s effort to install political allies on the fed board part of a broader tug of war between the central bank s leaders and the president over the fed s stewardship of the economy trump was irate after the fed raised interest rates multiple times in 2018 hikes that wound down the central bank s decade long effort to boost economic growth and fight unemployment after the great recession the increases were aimed at guarding against future inflation and preserving the fed s ability to fight a future downturn but trump accused the central bank of unnecessarily constraining growth and triggering the stock market sell off late last year cain and stephen moore trump s other planned pick to fill the remaining seats on the 7 member fed board and another friend of the president s said they support lowering interest rates a move that would boost growth in the run up to the president s reelection campaign trump has launched a series of attacks on the fed exhorting it to change course in a break with his immediate predecessors who typically refrained from publicly weighing in on central bank policy to protect the fed s credibility fed chair jerome powell has said the bank has no plans to raise rates again this year citing some uncertainty about the pace of future growth the white house never formally nominated cain and has yet to nominate moore typically nominees undergo an extensive vetting process before the president announces them but trump appears to have announced cain as his planned nominee without fully coordinating with gop leaders that approach appeared to come up short thursday when sen kevin cramer of north dakota on thursday joined three other republicans sens mitt romney of utah lisa murkowski of alaska and cory gardner of colorado in announcing opposition to cain s nomination i don t think herman cain would be confirmed by the senate and i think the president would be wise to find someone who is less partisan and more experienced in the world of economics romney said thursday in explaining why he did not support the nominee with cain out the focus shifts to moore who was an adviser on trump s campaign and called for powell to be fired democratic senator and presidential candidate elizabeth warren of massachusetts sent moore a scathing letter this month accusing him lacking a good grasp on basic mathematical and economic concepts the letter included nine questions for moore that attempt to clarify whether he still holds some of his more iconoclastic views in a cnn appearance moore claimed he had never been in favor of the gold standard where every dollar is backed by some gold but the network proceeded to play clips from three different speech where moore clearly supported the policy which cain also endorses moore also called for interest rates to rise in the midst of the financial crisis a policy that many believe would have caused the country more harm moore started calling for a cut in interest rates once trump took office recently moore has said there is deflation in the united states even though government statistics and the white house council of economic advisers all say inflation is rising at about 2 percent a year this is not the first time trump has opted to first publicize a pick and then push the party to go along with it after trump named rear adm ronny jackson the presidential physician to be secretary of veteran affairs last year only to watch the nomination fall apart as allegations of misconduct surfaced his original choice for labor secretary andrew puzder also had to withdrawal after it surfaced that he had an undocumented housekeeper moore has faced similar criticisms about a lack of qualifications and past personal issues including his failure to pay his ex wife child support and alimony in 2013 but while republicans have largely expressed support or at least openness to moving forward with moore cain was a bridge too far for some in the president s party cain has taken an adversarial stance against some gop incumbents the chairman of cain s america fighting back pac in march sent an email saying 12 gop senators including romney and murkowski were traitors for voting against trump s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border cain said the senate banking committee which would handle his nomination was full of yahoos cain s nomination was immediately controversial on multiple fronts his presidential campaign which drew notice early in the gop primary for a 9 9 9 tax plan unraveled in 2011 amid multiple accusations of past sexual misconduct and harassment the national restaurant association cain s employer at the time of the accusations settled sexual harassment claims against cain with two women the fed board has often had business leaders on its board in addition to phd economists and wall street bankers but cain s views were seen an outside the mainstream in the 1990s cain served on the federal reserve bank of kansas city s board of directors a group of business and community leaders who advise the head of the kansas city fed on how the economy is doing but he has supported controversial ideas such as a return to the gold standard system the united states abandoned nearly a half century ago the system would have made it almost impossible for the central bank to undertake many of the rescue measures it did during and after the 2008 2009 financial crisis trump s other nominees for the fed were imminently qualified people but all of a sudden trump has gone off the rails with stephen moore and herman cain said robert brusca chief economist at consulting firm fact and opinion economics a number of republicans however have expressed interest in having a wider variety of views on the fed board and seem open to taking a close look at moore who has been a big proponent of tax cuts ron paul a former republican congressman from texas and presidential candidate called cain and moore a basic improvement over many of the people who have served in the fed in recent years it s a good idea to have cain and moore at the fed they at least have knowledge and respect for a different way of doing things said paul a libertarian and vocal advocate for a return to the gold standard the fed plays a large role in steering the economy and overseeing banks the central bank s leaders a committee of 12 made up of the fed governors and five heads of regional fed banks from across the country decide whether to raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating or lower rates to try stimulate the economy at the moment interest rates are at a level that is considered neutral because it neither spurs growth nor holds it back the fed is tasked with making the best long term decisions for the economy steering clear of political calls to make short term moves that favor certain constituencies we are an organization devoted to public service we are professional we make decision based on facts and evidence and analysis and we stay out of politics said former fed chair janet yellen at a forum at the dallas fed nothing we do is political

mechanism demanded by washington to ensure that china abides by the deal assuming we resolve these final issues what will the ultimate deal look like will it rectify lingering structural problems that have devastated u s manufacturing with genuine enforcement provisions or will the deal simply represent yet another faux bargain in which china essentially bribes u s officialdom via purchases of some additional soybeans and wide bodied aircraft to make cosmetic reductions in beijing s bilateral trade surplus there s no question that a simple restoration of the status quo ante would not constitute a trade win for the president by any stretch that would be an epitomic case of sound and fury signifying nothing at the same time it would be highly unrealistic to expect beijing to eliminate its elaborate system of state subsidies for industry the basis for its state capitalist growth model which has accelerated china s quantum leap up the technology curve in this regard the president s current trade representative robert lighthizer will play a crucial role in determining the outcome although questions still linger as to whether he will ultimately be undermined by trump in the latter s quest to secure a win at any cost especially if this win comes with the usual pledges to purchase much higher quantities of american goods and nothing else behind it by the same token even if beijing goes beyond that and pledges to open up more sectors of china s domestic economy to u s investment tighten laws on intellectual property etc such additional promises do not really help american workers quite the contrary if it means that companies like gm keep shutting down domestic facilities and making increasingly large bets on the chinese market as they appear to be doing already using trump s simplistic metric of success the actual bilateral trade figures between the united states and china investing more in china will not reduce america s trade deficit with beijing and indeed might add to it as these chinese manufactured goods are re exported back to the american market the granting of a permanent normal trading relationship pntr and then the subsequent accession to the world trade organization wto in 2001 have been a boon for china but the persistence of ongoing american trade deficits have led many including the current president to judge the united states a loser in ongoing trade negotiations with beijing it s not a totally irrational judgment china s wto accession hasn t been great for u s manufacturers part of the problem stems from the extraordinary fact that washington has seldom deployed a negotiator who is actually well versed in trade issues since the days of the clinton administration it has been the u s treasury secretary as opposed to the country s chief trade representative who has consistently directed trade negotiations with the resultant and eminently predictable impact that financial interests have superseded those of any other economic sector that pattern was briefly disrupted when president george w bush appointed alcoa s ceo paul o neill to head the treasury and then csx president john w snow but ultimately the wall street uber alles mentality again prevailed with the appointment of hank paulson to be followed by tim geithner jack lew and now steve mnuchin all of whom have finance centric backgrounds for all of the supposed financial sophistication of america s wall street based treasury secretaries it is indeed ironic that china has consistently been able to play them for fools with the implied threat of its so called nuclear option a highly flawed narrative that alleges that as a final resort beijing would dump its huge stockpile of u s treasuries thereby driving up u s rates and creating a catastrophic depression for the u s economy that so called threat to the bond market is the traditional reason why successive treasury secretaries have been hesitant to resort to the blunt trauma force of trade sanctions or tariffs when it came to negotiating with beijing they were also comforted by the idea that as it modernized china would increasingly abide by traditional norms of free trade doctrine against all available evidence that shows that it has not played by the same rules let s leave aside the internal incoherence of the nuclear option china exiting dollar denominated assets could well create downward pressure on the external value of the free floating currency but that would enhance u s export competitiveness assuming of course that america has anything left to export an unfortunate legacy of the treasury s malign neglect of u s manufacturing it s also operationally wrong see here for further detail and mistakenly assumes against all historical evidence to the contrary that beijing would pursue an economic policy that is the functional equivalent of cutting its own nose to spite its face as paul krugman among others notes even if paulson geithner lew mnuchin etc didn t truly believe in the nuclear option they have been happy to tamp down the possibility of a trade war in order to keep the capital markets stable each trade deal has therefore largely sustained the status quo the price for which sees beijing usually offering up a few well timed purchases of soybeans or boeing aircraft although the latter will be more problematic in light of the 737 fiasco but china s policy makers have never been forced to deal with the economic consequences of their country s mercantilism which has resulted in the steady erosion of america s rust belt as the u s economy gave back the considerable employment gains it achieved during the 1990s via a historic contraction in manufacturing employment things have changed markedly since trump seized the china trade portfolio from the treasury s steve mnuchin and placed it under the control of robert lighthizer the current trade representative unusually for a member of the trump administration lighthizer actually knows his brief he has had literally decades of experience in trade issues dating from his days as a deputy u s trade representative in 1983 when japan was widely perceived as the main trade threat to his current role as america s chief trade negotiator as trump s u s trade representative ustr he has provided policy flesh and bones to the president s robustly unilateral approach in trade if anything lighthizer s trade hawkishness has become even more pronounced over the years as he has shifted his attention away from japan to china in his 2010 congressional testimony he argued that u s policy makers gravely underestimated the threat posed to american manufacturing by virtue of china s entry into the wto marshaling an array of evidence to cast doubt on the idea that its entry had brought any significant economic benefits to u s workers and businesses he also highlighted the mercantilist nature of beijing s state capitalism and noted that the country s administrative complexity likely precluded it embracing wto rules even if wanted to do so which he doubted as part of china s system specific large companies receive government patronage in the form of credit contracts and subsidies the chinese government in turn sees these national champions as a means of competing with foreign rivals and encourages their dominant role in the domestic economy and in export markets cholars have questioned whether given its lack of institutional capacity and the complexity of its constitutional administrative and legal system china is even capable of complying with its wto obligations no doubt in thrall to the prevailing free trade ideology washington s policy passivity made it loath to use available tools such as the wto s 421 special safeguards to counter the resultant trade shock in that same testimony lighthizer also signaled that he was uninterested in the niceties of wto style multilateralism more inclined to the use of aggressive unilateralism via executive orders diplomatic pressure and most importantly the use of section 232 of the 1962 trade expansion act to levy tariffs on various products premised on the notion that the targeted country in today s case china represented a national security threat most significant from the lighthizer perspective is an explicit rejection of the idea that china needs to do more than just buy more u s goods before the two countries strike a permanent trade deal which in any case is highly problematic if the end objective is to bring the bilateral trade balance between the two countries to zero you can understand why for one thing the math doesn t add up even if china were to raise its agricultural purchases by 30 billion as it has reportedly pledged to do this is pretty small beer in the context of a 300 billion bilateral trade deficit as the economist brad setser highlights the scope for explosive growth in soybeans is actually fairly limited as the pre tariff base for soybeans was quite high the united states was supplying 12 billion of china s almost 40 billion in oil seed imports a huge tilt away from brazil might cause u s beans exports to double but getting much more than that would be difficult there is a natural seasonality to soybean trade that favors alternating supply from the southern and northern hemispheres the real growth would need to come in sectors where china doesn t buy much now corn rice perhaps pork and beef getting really big numbers there though would risk pushing up u s prices and getting china to abandon its goal of self sufficiency in basic grains so u s farm prices would be pushed up which would hurt u s domestic consumers even as it cosmetically dresses up america s trade position vis a vis china setser adds china has signaled it is willing to let foreign firms take majority stakes in a few more sectors and has reiterated its belief that technology transfer isn t a legal requirement for entry into the chinese market there are likely to be settlements on some long standing disputes as well the rating agencies have gotten approval to enter the chinese market visa american express and mastercard likely will finally get approval too mastercard through a joint venture not everything changes and some tariffs introduced as retaliation in the past may get dropped but how does the entry into china of consumer credit card companies or the ratings agencies help americans ironically this looks precisely like the kind of sop to finance that trump said he would eschew however because of corporate wall street pressure the trump agenda pivoted a few months ago from selective decoupling and protection of american strategic industries to opening up china for u s investment and pushing china to treat american companies doing business in china more equally that is why leading u s companies have become friendlier and increasingly less critical of the president s trade policy even as the economic commentariat has continued to blast him trump himself needs to understand that a third to a half of trade is really transnational production with inputs from suppliers coordinated by mostly third party manufacturers in asia notably in semiconductors the purpose of modern mercantilism particularly as it is practiced in china today is not just to sell more finished goods but to try to monopolize the high value added rungs of supply chains it is unclear that targeting china s bilateral trade surplus with the united states will ultimately disrupt these entrenched supply chains it almost certainly won t bring semiconductor manufacturing back to america s shores in the end therefore pushing china s leadership to make structural changes to open up china to american companies is probably an illusion beijing is unlikely to rip up the model that has seen it create national champions that can now compete successfully with america s biggest corporations it may make token promises to curtail cybertheft or the subsidies that the administration complains create an uneven playing field for american companies but as noted above even lighthizer himself has cast doubt that beijing could enforce those promises given the administrative complexity of its system of governance in his eagerness to claim a win therefore trump ironically might end up settling for the usual faustian bargain more large chinese purchases selective decoupling of supply chains as american companies rethink their reliance on china and increased domestic protection for certain sectors such as 5g on national security grounds lighthizer s considerable efforts notwithstanding we may have reached the peak as far as this particular tariff war goes but the longer term trade tensions will almost certainly persist well beyond this hollow victory which mr art of the deal will no doubt claim for himself when the negotiations do officially end this article was produced by economy for all a project of the

washington herman cain president donald trump s planned nominee for the federal reserve withdrew from consideration on monday after a lack of republican support in the senate doomed his prospects for confirmation trump made the announcement on twitter writing my friend herman cain a truly wonderful man has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the federal reserve board i will respect his wishes herman is a great american who truly loves our country cain would have needed near unanimous republican backing in the senate for confirmation but four republicans have said they would not vote for the nominee effectively killing his chances since republicans hold 53 seats in the senate and no democrats were expected to support him cain had maintained as recently as late last week that he d continue to vie for the role trump s plan to pick cain a 2012 gop presidential primary candidate and restaurant industry executive was immediately controversial when the president announced cain was his choice earlier this month some lawmakers economists and wall street investors questioned his qualifications for the central bank and noted the multiple allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct that derailed his campaign cain has denied the allegations casting them as old news but one of the accusers said she would testify at his confirmation hearing if given the chance many also had concerns that the nomination of a close political ally of the president who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for trump and lashed out a trump s critics would threaten the bank s independence cain s withdrawal is a setback in trump s effort to install political allies on the fed board part of a broader tug of war between the central bank s leaders and the president over the fed s stewardship of the economy trump was irate after the fed raised interest rates multiple times in 2018 hikes that wound down the central bank s decade long effort to boost economic growth and fight unemployment after the great recession the increases were aimed at guarding against future inflation and preserving the fed s ability to fight a future downturn but trump accused the central bank of unnecessarily constraining growth and triggering the stock market sell off late last year cain and stephen moore trump s other planned pick to fill the remaining seats on the seven member fed board and another friend of the president s said they support lowering interest rates a move that would boost growth in the run up to the president s reelection campaign trump has launched a series of attacks on the fed exhorting it to change course in a break with his immediate predecessors who typically refrained from publicly weighing in on central bank policy to protect the fed s credibility fed chair jerome powell has said the bank has no plans to raise rates again this year citing some uncertainty about the pace of future growth the white house never formally nominated cain and has yet to nominate moore typically nominees undergo an extensive vetting process before the president announces them but trump appears to have announced cain as his planned nominee without fully coordinating with gop leaders that approach appeared to come up short thursday when sen kevin cramer of north dakota on thursday joined three other republicans sens mitt romney of utah lisa murkowski of alaska and cory gardner of colorado in announcing opposition to cain s nomination i don t think herman cain would be confirmed by the senate and i think the president would be wise to find someone who is less partisan and more experienced in the world of economics romney said thursday in explaining why he did not support the nominee with cain out the focus shifts to moore who was an adviser on trump s campaign and called for powell to be fired democratic senator and presidential candidate elizabeth warren of massachusetts sent moore a scathing letter this month accusing him lacking a good grasp on basic mathematical and economic concepts the letter included nine questions for moore that attempt to clarify whether he still holds some of his more iconoclastic views in a cnn appearance moore claimed he had never been in favor of the gold standard where every dollar is backed by some gold but the network proceeded to play clips from three different speech where moore clearly supported the policy which cain also endorses moore also called for interest rates to rise in the midst of the financial crisis a policy that many believe would have caused the country more harm moore started calling for a cut in interest rates once trump took office recently moore has said there is deflation in the united states even though government statistics and the white house council of economic advisers all say inflation is rising at about 2 percent a year this is not the first time trump has opted to first publicize a pick and then push the party to go along with it after trump named rear adm ronny jackson the presidential physician to be secretary of veteran affairs last year only to watch the nomination fall apart as allegations of misconduct surfaced his original choice for labor secretary andrew puzder also had to withdrawal after it surfaced that he had an undocumented housekeeper moore has faced similar criticisms about a lack of qualifications and past personal issues including his failure to pay his ex wife child support and alimony in 2013 but while republicans have largely expressed support or at least openness to moving forward with moore cain was a bridge too far for some in the president s party cain has taken an adversarial stance against some gop incumbents the chairman of cain s america fighting back pac in march sent an email saying 12 gop senators including romney and murkowski were traitors for voting against trump s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border cain said the senate banking committee which would handle his nomination was full of yahoos cain s nomination was immediately controversial on multiple fronts his presidential campaign which drew notice early in the gop primary for a 9 9 9 tax plan unraveled in 2011 amid multiple accusations of past sexual misconduct and harassment the national restaurant association cain s employer at the time of the accusations settled sexual harassment claims against cain with two women the fed board has often had business leaders on its board in addition to ph d economists and wall street bankers but cain s views were seen as outside the mainstream in the 1990s cain served on the federal reserve bank of kansas city s board of directors a group of business and community leaders who advise the head of the kansas city fed on how the economy is doing but he has supported controversial ideas such as a return to the gold standard system the united states abandoned nearly a half century ago the system would have made it almost impossible for the central bank to undertake many of the rescue measures it did during and after the 2008 2009 financial crisis trump s other nominees for the fed were imminently qualified people but all of a sudden trump has gone off the rails with stephen moore and herman cain said robert brusca chief economist at consulting firm fact and opinion economics a number of republicans however have expressed interest in having a wider variety of views on the fed board and seem open to taking a close look at moore who has been a big proponent of tax cuts ron paul a former republican congressman from texas and presidential candidate called cain and moore a basic improvement over many of the people who have served in the fed in recent years it s a good idea to have cain and moore at the fed they at least have knowledge and respect for a different way of doing things said paul a libertarian and vocal advocate for a return to the gold standard the fed plays a large role in steering the economy and overseeing banks the central bank s leaders a committee of 12 made up of the fed governors and five heads of regional fed banks from across the country decide whether to raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating or lower rates to try to stimulate the economy at the moment interest rates are at a level that is considered neutral because it neither spurs growth nor holds it back the fed is tasked with making the best long term decisions for the economy steering clear of political calls to make short term moves that favor certain constituencies we are an organization devoted to public service we are professional we make decisions based on facts and evidence and analysis and we stay out of politics former fed chair janet yellen said at a forum at the dallas fed nothing we do is political

by we don t seem to understand or we ve neglected the specter of what is beneath and pushing all of these things to the surface the specter of militarism and colonialism and all the things that hawaiians experienced through colonialism we have that same experience to the point right now where one of the islands in micronesia in the northern marianas is proposed to be a target for military bombing kind of reminds you a lot of kahoʻolawe joakim jojo peter beingmicronesian in hawaii april 6 2019 the timing of the announcement was curious the supreme court declined to hear the appeal challenging the state of hawaii s exclusion of migrants from the compacts of free association nations from its medicaid program on monday nov 3 2014 by that afternoon the administration of gov neil abercrombie announced its intentions to remove patients who had been enrolled in medicaid the hawaii department of human services had a plan ready for rollout those 18 and under and pregnant women would continue to receive medicaid the aged blind and disabled would continue to receive state funded benefits under a medicaid like plan those 19 through 64 years of age were moved onto private insurance plans via affordable healthcare act mechanisms of note abercrombie was a lame duck by nov 3 he had lost in the democratic party primary to david ige who went on to defeat republican james duke aiona and independent mufi hannemann the next day tuesday nov 4 2014 what was the reason for the alacrity to announce the plan to remove cofa migrants from medicaid rolls abercrombie had previously noted that he had to pursue the case in federal court because of his fiduciary responsibility presumably to the taxpayers of hawaii to minimize entitlements he had said that as long as he was governor micronesians would continue to be covered by medicaid personal communication april 8 2014 they were indeed removed from medicaid rolls only immediately after his tenure ended however it could not have escaped his notice that denying medicaid to indigent people as one must be below 133 of federal poverty levels to qualify for medicaid would result in adverse health outcomes for them on the face of it this would seem to belie his reputation as a liberal perhaps abercrombie was taking one for the team in the sense that he sought to fix a troublesome public policy and budgetary conundrum prior to fellow democrat gov david ige s taking the reins ige thereby didn t have to appear to be a heartless chief executive during his first days in office while the children of cofa migrants born in the u s are u s citizens cofa migrants cannot vote in hawaii thus hawaii politicians need not pay attention to micronesians as a voting constituency the general populace of hawaii had been subjected for years to political pronouncements about the cost of cofa migrants and a commonly held belief is that this cost should be borne by the federal government such logic ignores the fact that employed cofa migrants pay both federal and state payroll taxes and all participants in the economy pay the state general excise and use tax the inability of cofa migrants to vote is thus a form of taxation without representation their exclusion from medicaid means that they are taxed while being barred from benefitting from the social commons abercrombie s disdain for micronesians is evident in a recent pronouncement people come here they have no job they don t even have to have a job they don t have to pay any taxes if they get enough to get airfare they can go from the airport to queen s hospital the exclusion of cofa migrants from medicaid in hawaii had been first proposed by republican gov linda lingle in mid 2009 in the wake of the great recession during this period the hawaii delegation to the u s congress including then rep abercrombie worked to reinstate cofa migrant eligibility for medicaid at the federal level attempting to insert such language into the affordable care act on july 1 2010 during the waning days of the lingle administration cofa migrants were placed on a severely limited program called basic health hawaii in december 2010 however circuit court judge michael seabright placed an injunction against basic health hawaii agreeing with the plaintiffs that they had a constitutional right to equal protection under the law having defeated republican duke aiona in the general election of november 2010 as abercrombie was inaugurated as governor in december 2010 it was his prerogative to allow judge seabright s decision to stand given abercrombie s liberal reputation cofa migrants and their friends and allies were hopeful that he would do so the state however appealed to the federal circuit court which decided in favor of the state s power to exclude cofa migrants from medicaid the circuit court decision became the final word when the supreme court declined to hear an appeal the legal battle is over the only way in which cofa migrants could participate in medicaid now is via an act of the u s congress should one interpret gov abercrombie s actions then as his taking one for the team the power elite of the state the power elite believes in neoliberal market solutions that is to say they want to minimize the public commons they want to shrink public services such as public education or public health care the power elite sends its children to private schools they would not set foot in a community health center or a county hospital they want to pay less tax because they don t want their tax dollars going to educate the poor or caring for the poor as civil rights organizer joakim jojo peter noted a few days before his passing my issue has always been that if there s a lot of this structural discrimination or structural barriers against you that starts with the government the state government and the federal government and it filters down to the community and it s all crashing in on you you have very little recourse for the power elite it matters little which party is in power as long as their interests are taken care of as noam chomsky notes about national politics in the u s there is basically one party the business party it has two factions called democrats and republicans which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies the power elite prefers that their a team the republicans be in power when the a team makes a major mess of things and to demonstrate the pretense that the country remains a democracy it s time to call in the b team the democrats when the casinos of wall street go broke it s time for a bipartisan bailout by the taxpayers when the numbers of uninsured in america becomes a national disgrace the solution is to subsidize the premiums to enroll more people with private insurance companies liberals talk about caring for everybody but when it comes down to it they take care of their corporate backers for hawaii its polity dominated by the democrats it is expected that even the liberal wing of the democratic party will take care of the power elite within polite these days less so discourse regarding migrants in the u s ranging from a wall building to b high tech border patrolling cofa migrants forever remain migrants the compacts of free association allow citizens of the marshall islands the federated states of micronesia and palau free entry to the u s and the right to work without a visa but there is no pathway to permanent residency or u s citizenship many scientists are calling the present the anthropocene epoch because human activity is changing the physical nature of the planet the energy intensive neoliberal free trade hyper capitalism of recent decades is accelerating the pace of this change in the coming decades climate change will force many more to seek higher ground the mean elevation in the marshall islands is 2 meters above sea level making it particularly susceptible to sea level rise historically the human rights of the marshallese have been run over roughshod by nuclear testing and human experimentation the main lagoon of chuuk in the federated states of micronesia is severely polluted from the u s bombing campaign of world war ii the island of peleliu of palau remains densely littered with debris from the fierce world war ii battle fought there kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands remains under u s military jurisdiction despite having assumed responsibility for the health and welfare of micronesians after world war ii the united states failed its responsibilities to the islanders who consequently continue to suffer from inadequate health care limited education opportunities and marginal economic development the compacts were negotiated to preserve u s strategic interests in the pacific with limited benefit to micronesians themselves who might not need to seek education employment and health care here in the u s had the u s fulfilled its responsibilities inevitably more people of the cofa nations will migrate to the u s will americans continue to exclude cofa migrants from access to health care will we build walls or tear them down in the present day the denial of the human right to health is an insidious step toward the denial of other human rights the first clause of article 25 of the universal declaration of human rights adopted by the united nations in 1948 reads everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and of his family including food clothing housing and medical care meanwhile exclusion from medicaid by making it clear to all concerned that cofa migrants are non qualified aliens per the language of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 the cofa migrant is redefined as the other despite their legal right to live in hawaii in this way the erosion of the human right to health underscores the fact that cofa migrants are not quite equal to americans and can be treated differently by the state conversely the fact that cofa migrants are not american citizens justifies the denial of the human right to health we would do well to keep in mind the words of jojo peter who spoke at the honolulu civil beat s recent beingmicronesian in hawaii event the most basic core of all of this is we have to respect each other s human rights and the right to access like everybody else and i think if we can just commit to being open minded to support the human rights regardless of national origin and the other protected classes i think that s a very good start seiji yamada is a family physician practicing and teaching in hawaii gregory g maskarinec is a cultural anthropologist who directs the university of hawaii john a burns school of medicine s office of global health and international medicine a version of this essay originally appeared in the honolulu civil beat
beijing and washington have been engaged in long standing negotiations to resolve an increasingly contentious trade dispute it looks like we are approaching the endgame but as james politi and lucy hornby report in the financial times the two sides remain apart on two key issues the fate of existing us levies on chinese goods which beijing wants to see removed and the terms of an enforcement mechanism demanded by washington to ensure that china abides by the deal assuming we resolve these final issues what will the ultimate deal look like will it rectify lingering structural problems that have devastated u s manufacturing with genuine enforcement provisions or will the deal simply represent yet another faux bargain in which china essentially bribes u s officialdom via purchases of some additional soybeans and wide bodied aircraft to make cosmetic reductions in beijing s bilateral trade surplus there s no question that a simple restoration of the status quo ante would not constitute a trade win for the president by any stretch that would be an epitomic case of sound and fury signifying nothing at the same time it would be highly unrealistic to expect beijing to eliminate its elaborate system of state subsidies for industry the basis for its state capitalist growth model which has accelerated china s quantum leap up the technology curve in this regard the president s current trade representative robert lighthizer will play a crucial role in determining the outcome although questions still linger as to whether he will ultimately be undermined by trump in the latter s quest to secure a win at any cost especially if this win comes with the usual pledges to purchase much higher quantities of american goods and nothing else behind it by the same token even if beijing goes beyond that and pledges to open up more sectors of china s domestic economy to u s investment tighten laws on intellectual property etc such additional promises do not really help american workers quite the contrary if it means that companies like gm keep shutting down domestic facilities and making increasingly large bets on the chinese market as they appear to be doing already using trump s simplistic metric of success the actual bilateral trade figures between the united states and china investing more in china will not reduce america s trade deficit with beijing and indeed might add to it as these chinese manufactured goods are re exported back to the american market the granting of a permanent normal trading relationship pntr and then the subsequent accession to the world trade organization wto in 2001 have been a boon for china but the persistence of ongoing american trade deficits have led many including the current president to judge the united states a loser in ongoing trade negotiations with beijing it s not a totally irrational judgment china s wto accession hasn t been great for u s manufacturers part of the problem stems from the extraordinary fact that washington has seldom deployed a negotiator who is actually well versed in trade issues since the days of the clinton administration it has been the u s treasury secretary as opposed to the country s chief trade representative who has consistently directed trade negotiations with the resultant and eminently predictable impact that financial interests have superseded those of any other economic sector that pattern was briefly disrupted when president george w bush appointed alcoa s ceo paul o neill to head the treasury and then csx president john w snow but ultimately the wall street uber alles mentality again prevailed with the appointment of hank paulson to be followed by tim geithner jack lew and now steve mnuchin all of whom have finance centric backgrounds for all of the supposed financial sophistication of america s wall street based treasury secretaries it is indeed ironic that china has consistently been able to play them for fools with the implied threat of its so called nuclear option a highly flawed narrative that alleges that as a final resort beijing would dump its huge stockpile of u s treasuries thereby driving up u s rates and creating a catastrophic depression for the u s economy that so called threat to the bond market is the traditional reason why successive treasury secretaries have been hesitant to resort to the blunt trauma force of trade sanctions or tariffs when it came to negotiating with beijing they were also comforted by the idea that as it modernized china would increasingly abide by traditional norms of free trade doctrine against all available evidence that shows that it has not played by the same rules let s leave aside the internal incoherence of the nuclear option china exiting dollar denominated assets could well create downward pressure on the external value of the free floating currency but that would enhance u s export competitiveness assuming of course that america has anything left to export an unfortunate legacy of the treasury s malign neglect of u s manufacturing it s also operationally wrong see here for further detail and mistakenly assumes against all historical evidence to the contrary that beijing would pursue an economic policy that is the functional equivalent of cutting its own nose to spite its face as paul krugman among others notes even if paulson geithner lew mnuchin etc didn t truly believe in the nuclear option they have been happy to tamp down the possibility of a trade war in order to keep the capital markets stable each trade deal has therefore largely sustained the status quo the price for which sees beijing usually offering up a few well timed purchases of soybeans or boeing aircraft although the latter will be more problematic in light of the 737 fiasco but china s policy makers have never been forced to deal with the economic consequences of their country s mercantilism which has resulted in the steady erosion of america s rust belt as the u s economy gave back the considerable employment gains it achieved during the 1990s via a historic contraction in manufacturing employment things have changed markedly since trump seized the china trade portfolio from the treasury s steve mnuchin and placed it under the control of robert lighthizer the current trade representative unusually for a member of the trump administration lighthizer actually knows his brief he has had literally decades of experience in trade issues dating from his days as a deputy u s trade representative in 1983 when japan was widely perceived as the main trade threat to his current role as america s chief trade negotiator as trump s u s trade representative ustr he has provided policy flesh and bones to the president s robustly unilateral approach in trade if anything lighthizer s trade hawkishness has become even more pronounced over the years as he has shifted his attention away from japan to china in his 2010 congressional testimony he argued that u s policy makers gravely underestimated the threat posed to american manufacturing by virtue of china s entry into the wto marshaling an array of evidence to cast doubt on the idea that its entry had brought any significant economic benefits to u s workers and businesses he also highlighted the mercantilist nature of beijing s state capitalism and noted that the country s administrative complexity likely precluded it embracing wto rules even if wanted to do so which he doubted as part of china s system specific large companies receive government patronage in the form of credit contracts and subsidies the chinese government in turn sees these national champions as a means of competing with foreign rivals and encourages their dominant role in the domestic economy and in export markets cholars have questioned whether given its lack of institutional capacity and the complexity of its constitutional administrative and legal system china is even capable of complying with its wto obligations no doubt in thrall to the prevailing free trade ideology washington s policy passivity made it loath to use available tools such as the wto s 421 special safeguards to counter the resultant trade shock in that same testimony lighthizer also signaled that he was uninterested in the niceties of wto style multilateralism more inclined to the use of aggressive unilateralism via executive orders diplomatic pressure and most importantly the use of section 232 of the 1962 trade expansion act to levy tariffs on various products premised on the notion that the targeted country in today s case china represented a national security threat most significant from the lighthizer perspective is an explicit rejection of the idea that china needs to do more than just buy more u s goods before the two countries strike a permanent trade deal which in any case is highly problematic if the end objective is to bring the bilateral trade balance between the two countries to zero you can understand why for one thing the math doesn t add up even if china were to raise its agricultural purchases by 30 billion as it has reportedly pledged to do this is pretty small beer in the context of a 300 billion bilateral trade deficit as the economist brad setser highlights the scope for explosive growth in soybeans is actually fairly limited as the pre tariff base for soybeans was quite high the united states was supplying 12 billion of china s almost 40 billion in oil seed imports a huge tilt away from brazil might cause u s beans exports to double but getting much more than that would be difficult there is a natural seasonality to soybean trade that favors alternating supply from the southern and northern hemispheres the real growth would need to come in sectors where china doesn t buy much now corn rice perhaps pork and beef getting really big numbers there though would risk pushing up u s prices and getting china to abandon its goal of self sufficiency in basic grains so u s farm prices would be pushed up which would hurt u s domestic consumers even as it cosmetically dresses up america s trade position vis a vis china setser adds china has signaled it is willing to let foreign firms take majority stakes in a few more sectors and has reiterated its belief that technology transfer isn t a legal requirement for entry into the chinese market there are likely to be settlements on some long standing disputes as well the rating agencies have gotten approval to enter the chinese market visa american express and mastercard likely will finally get approval too mastercard through a joint venture not everything changes and some tariffs introduced as retaliation in the past may get dropped but how does the entry into china of consumer credit card companies or the ratings agencies help americans ironically this looks precisely like the kind of sop to finance that trump said he would eschew however because of corporate wall street pressure the trump agenda pivoted a few months ago from selective decoupling and protection of american strategic industries to opening up china for u s investment and pushing china to treat american companies doing business in china more equally that is why leading u s companies have become friendlier and increasingly less critical of the president s trade policy even as the economic commentariat has continued to blast him trump himself needs to understand that a third to a half of trade is really transnational production with inputs from suppliers coordinated by mostly third party manufacturers in asia notably in semiconductors the purpose of modern mercantilism particularly as it is practiced in china today is not just to sell more finished goods but to try to monopolize the high value added rungs of supply chains it is unclear that targeting china s bilateral trade surplus with the united states will ultimately disrupt these entrenched supply chains it almost certainly won t bring semiconductor manufacturing back to america s shores in the end therefore pushing china s leadership to make structural changes to open up china to american companies is probably an illusion beijing is unlikely to rip up the model that has seen it create national champions that can now compete successfully with america s biggest corporations it may make token promises to curtail cybertheft or the subsidies that the administration complains create an uneven playing field for american companies but as noted above even lighthizer himself has cast doubt that beijing could enforce those promises given the administrative complexity of its system of governance in his eagerness to claim a win therefore trump ironically might end up settling for the usual faustian bargain more large chinese purchases selective decoupling of supply chains as american companies rethink their reliance on china and increased domestic protection for certain sectors such as 5g on national security grounds lighthizer s considerable efforts notwithstanding we may have reached the peak as far as this particular tariff war goes but the longer term trade tensions will almost certainly persist well beyond this hollow victory which mr art of the deal will no doubt claim for himself when the negotiations do officially end

born in 2008 in response to the global banking and credit crisis bitcoin has found its patient zero a decade later in venezuela faced with hyperinflation a worthless local currency and a risky black market for dollars venezuelans are increasingly turning to bitcoin as a tool for survival in the world s worst performing economy in most countries bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies still struggle for visibility and operate mainly within niche online circles of tech or finance savvy speculators and enthusiasts but in venezuela brick and mortar retailers including restaurants and shoe shops post signs in their stores inviting customers to actually spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as venezuelans seek to skirt capital controls and a crumbling financial system it is not difficult to see the appeal of a decentralized digital currency that can function beyond banks and any central authority the location app criptolugares venezuela for example points users to at least 180 retailers that accept payment in cryptocurrencies crypto is also a common payment method on the country s top e commerce platform mercado libre venezuela on social media freelancers and companies often price their services in crypto in the venezuelan capital caracas big blue billboards have sprung up in recent months along the highways they promote dash a lesser known cryptocurrency boasting only the 15th largest market capitalization in the space that has fostered a network of merchants accepting the digital asset dash s poignant promotion reads it is more than money the crypto trend in venezuela is so strong that the government even tried to get in on the act issuing with little credibility the petro coin as an alternative to the official currency still despite the wide embrace there remain barriers to mainstream crypto adoption in venezuela the country may be one of the world s most active markets for peer to peer cryptocurrency transactions according to localbitcoins a popular bitcoin trading platform but poor internet connectivity amid persistent blackouts and a lack of affordable smartphones can thwart potential participants for now then the u s dollar remains the favored currency many venezuelans trade their venezuelan bolivars via middlemen and foreign accounts even though the practice is officially illegal and not without risk but coinbase the largest u s cryptocurrency exchange hopes to shift the balance aiming to donate cryptocurrency to 100 000 venezuelans over the next year it has been developing workarounds to the electricity and smartphone problems i want to see if we can spark a bunch of uses there and actually have a country in the world tip in other words have 50 percent of all transactions in the economy happening in crypto ceo brian armstrong said venezuela home of the biggest oil reserves in the world and once a regional economic powerhouse didn t fall into crisis overnight from my years reporting on venezuela as reuters caracas bureau chief i vividly remember the day in 2007 when president hugo chávez chopped three zeros off currency bills a 1 000 bolivar note became a single bolivar and a sad symbol of the government s hapless policies the monetary conversion was intended to psychologically reinforce the local currency s value which chávez dubbed without irony strong bolivar but the result was the opposite and consumer prices ballooned more than 30 percent to an 11 year high and the top inflation rate in latin america some groceries such as powdered milk corn flour and toilet paper began periodically disappearing from supermarket shelves those were just early signs of the colossal economic distortion to come the seeds had been sown around 2003 when chávez imposed currency controls that gave him the power to arbitrarily fix the bolivar exchange rate limit venezuelans access to foreign currencies and control the prices of dozens of basic goods what were supposed to be temporary measures to avoid capital flight in a moment of political and financial turmoil became a hallmark of chávez s self styled socialism manipulating the local currency in the face of market forces ended up eroding trust in the bolivar and there lay the foundations of the economic catastrophe and humanitarian emergency that we see today while venezuela was making monetary policy based on zeroes on its currency bills an anonymous computer coder or team of coders published a white paper under the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto it proposed a revolutionary peer to peer electronic cash system bitcoin few in venezuela paid attention at the time after all record global oil prices and chávez s profligate spending created a temporary economic mirage that fueled consumption underpinned by the artificially controlled price of the dollar nowadays though with 90 percent of venezuelans living in poverty the words of satoshi nakamoto resonate more than ever the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that s required to make it work but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust a decade after chávez lopped three zeros off the currency the bolivar was subject to another monetary conversion touted again as a solution to the country s devaluation pains ignoring the past failure chávez s heir nicolas maduro eliminated five zeros from bills it did not work the inflation rate has surpassed 1 million percent this is why more and more venezuelans will find their way to cryptocurrencies in venezuela bitcoin is no longer a choice it is a lifeline saul hudson is

pension expenses have crept up to more than 35 million per year at this point it s just piling logs he said it s one more thing on top of everything else colorado s public pension system is one of the most underfunded in the country with a shortfall totaling an estimated 29 billion in 2017 about half of that comes from school district employee pensions since 2010 the state legislature has twice passed bills to shore up the pension system and keep it from bankruptcy the reforms have required school districts and other local government agencies to contribute more of their budgets toward paying down the pension debt while also obligating workers to make financial sacrifices and cutting benefits for current retirees the most recent legislation passed in 2018 required the state to chip in more money from its general fund related are teachers losing their grip on the middle class combined with other steep cuts to education following the great recession rising pension costs have led to an agonizing budget squeeze that has forced layoffs salary freezes for teachers and the elimination of school programs across the state and there s no relief to come as the requirements of the 2018 pension bill approved in the final few minutes of the legislative session last may start to kick in at the end of the day it s just this big item that needs to be paid if we didn t have to pay all these pension debts we could use it for other educational expenses colorado s share the pain approach to pension reform is one that more states may turn to as they seek to prevent their pension funds from going bankrupt and leaving retirees holding the bag yet the attempt at solvency could further depress teacher pay which is already so low that it has prompted recent teacher walkouts in a number of places around the country including pueblo and denver and crowd out money for things like school supplies and building repairs with no simple solutions in sight pension debt may be a millstone on many school district budgets and teacher salaries for decades to come at the end of the day it s just this big item that needs to be paid said cory koedel an associate professor of economics and public policy at the university of missouri who studies public pensions if we didn t have to pay all these pension debts we could use it for other educational expenses school districts squeezed during the bull market of the 1990s with pension funds big investment returns multiplying employer and employee contributions colorado joined many states in making benefits more generous then in 2008 the stock market tumbled swallowing billions in pension investments around the country some states slashed their payments into the pension systems and relied on overly optimistic investment projections that masked the growing gaps in funding traditional pensions differ from 401 k style retirement plans because they guarantee retirees a set amount of money annually for life as of 2016 state pension systems were on average just 66 percent funded according to an analysis by the pew charitable trusts while experts say a pension system that is even 80 percent funded can be considered healthy only 12 states hit or exceeded that level in 2016 you re still seeing just really unsustainable amounts of money being required to cover these systems said sandi jacobs principal at education counsel an education consulting group related while the rest of the world spends more in education the u s spends less in recent years as more states have required employers to pitch in more to pension plans costs to school districts have gone up in 2004 school districts around the country were paying an average of 530 per pupil to teacher retirement benefits by 2018 that figure had risen to 1 312 as of 2016 state pension systems were on average just 66 percent funded at the same time teacher salaries have stagnated nationwide averaging 58 950 in the 2016 17 school year compared to 59 924 in 1999 2000 after adjusting for inflation spending on instructional supplies dropped 10 percent per pupil between 2000 and 2013 while money for school facilities and equipment fell by 26 percent according to one study in colorado the 2010 pension reform gradually phased in increases to the amount of money school districts had to contribute to pensions for each dollar spent on employee salaries from 13 85 percent that year to more than 20 percent in 2018 it s getting so expensive said gustafson he said he is already stretching the district s 300 million budget to cover necessities and has a wish list of things he d love to do with more money gut renovate some of the district s tired buildings install air conditioning in buildings that don t have it and most importantly lift teacher salaries to ensure his district can retain people we re desperately worried about competitive salaries he said noting that he has struggled to fill maintenance positions because he can t pay enough to attract workers educators in his district got some relief in 2017 for the first time in more than a decade when voters approved a ballot measure granting voters a rare significant cost of living raise the 2018 pension legislation required yet more money from school districts for pensions though this time the increase was modest from 20 15 percent to 20 4 but as gustafson learned from the state pension director during that february meeting the change came with a catch in an effort to keep the state pension fund from falling short of projections as happened after the 2010 reform the state introduced an automatic trigger that will up the share to 20 9 percent if the fund seems off track of meeting its goal the stock market decline in early 2018 is expected to trigger that increase causing gustafson and other cfos across the state to go looking for their scalpels once again it s just like your boss cuts your paycheck a little bit but you re renting your house the landlord raises your rent it hits in both directions such increases may seem relatively small but they add up that s especially true when combined with other steep cuts to education in colorado where statewide voters have been resistant to raise taxes to plug holes in school budgets despite a booming economy related la s school counselors strike back dave tecklenburg had to eliminate 45 positions from the school district he leads lamar re 2 in southeastern colorado during his first month as superintendent in 2011 credit sarah butrymowicz the hechinger report dave tecklenburg learned this the hard way when he became superintendent of the lamar re 2 school district in southeastern colorado in 2011 two years prior the state legislature had passed a measure called the negative factor later renamed the budget stabilization factor and sometimes referred to as the bs factor by educators which spreads the state s education budget shortfalls across all school districts in the state even though the economy has improved the state can t collect more tax revenue because of limits set by decades old legislation as things stand school districts continue to get hundreds of millions less per year than they are due under a state funding formula tecklenburg said that in his first year he was forced to cut 1 million from the district s 17 5 million budget he stopped buying textbooks froze teacher salaries and eliminated 45 positions or nearly 20 percent of the workforce it was the toughest thing professionally i ve ever had to deal with he said while the negative factor was the biggest driver of the cuts pension costs exacerbated the problem it s just like your boss cuts your paycheck a little bit but you re renting your house the landlord raises your rent it hits in both directions teachers feel the pinch whereas the 2010 pension changes hit school budgets the hardest last year s legislation targeted the pocketbooks of teachers and retirees as well as the state government s coffers under the 2018 reform the state will kick in 225 million a year from its general fund meaning less money for other services meanwhile retirees will have to forgo cost of living increases for two years and then will receive smaller increases in future years teachers will have to contribute another 2 percent of their pay to pensions or 10 percent total by 2021 the retirement age for new teachers was also raised from 58 to 64 all of this has been a difficult pill to swallow for the state s teachers who are already among the lowest paid educators in the nation when cost of living is taken into account lisa cleland works with a student in her special education classroom at washington elementary school in lamar colorado credit sarah butrymowicz the hechinger report it means we re going to have to cut back on something said lisa cleland a special education teacher at lamar s washington elementary school i don t know what but we ll figure it out when cleland turned down an engineering job at boeing in the late 80s to follow her passion for teaching she knew she d be giving up a nice salary but with 10 years to go until she retires cleland earns just 43 000 and wonders if she ll ever be able to buy a house to leave to her son thank goodness for a credit card once in a while because i need to go to the grocery store cleland said as she sat in the school s small breakroom with a group of colleagues on a cold february day i live paycheck to paycheck i think most teachers do said kara ratzlaff a first grade teacher at the 275 student school related school counselors keep kids on track why are they the first to be cut teachers in colorado along with roughly 40 percent of public school teachers nationwide are not covered by social security meaning they only have their pensions to fall back on even those who are dreading the additional money being taken out of their paychecks said they were relieved that the pension fund was being saved from insolvency in 2004 school districts around the country were paying an average of 530 per pupil for retirement benefits by 2018 that figure had risen to 1 312 in the long run when i retire i suppose it will be there said ratzlaff who is 49 and plans on working until she turns 65 but it s hard right now the colorado education association the state s teachers union pushed back unsuccessfully against the financial hikes on teachers but it did score one big victory persuading the legislature not to extend the option of a 401 k style plan to teachers as it did for all other public employees the union argued that the guaranteed benefits that the current pension plan provides are among the few perks available to teachers and that eliminating them would drive people from the profession at least 15 states have already altered their pensions to include 401 k style plans known as defined contribution plans some states have given employees the option of choosing between traditional and 401 k style plans or have developed hybrid plans alaska has gone the furthest moving all newly hired public employees into defined contribution plans which means that the taxpayers bear none of the investment risk such a move creates its own set of problems though because it means that new employees aren t contributing money to the old plans which need to continue to make payments to current and near future retirees and critics argue the defined contribution plans will provide teachers with worse benefits given the size of colorado s pension shortfall gustafson thinks the action taken by the legislature was necessary even if his district will be helping to pay for it for years to come he also says retiree benefits grew overly generous in the 90s and it made sense to trim some from current pensions too but as he sat listening to the presentation on the state pension fund his mind wandered to the future well past his own retirement what will happen 30 years from now he asked the fund s director if the state s pension system is solvent once again will there finally be some relief for school districts like his he says he didn t get an answer this story about teacher pensions was produced by the hechinger

they have been hailed as natural implacable enemies mongoose and cobra hatfields and mccoys red sox and yankees fans now add to this list the folks who support democratic gov ned lamont s tolls plan and those who favor the republican legislators alternative the tolls free prioritize progress ever since lamont reversed himself and endorsed tolls for all vehicles three months ago the two sides have been at odds each proposal has its advantages and its weaknesses both of which have been subjected to a withering storm of public debate now with just seven weeks left in the legislative session lawmakers must choose one or subject connecticut to another year of the status quo an inadequate capital transportation program eventually headed for a congestion nightmare or worse so first here s a short primer on how connecticut pays for road bridge and rail upgrades followed by a breakdown of the competing plans how ct pays for transportation the department of transportation s capital program is a separate entity outside of the state budget but they are related and affect one another connecticut pumps hundreds of millions of dollars into the capital program each year by borrowing selling bonds on wall street gov ned lamont by the i 84 viaduct in hartford two weeks ago flanked by budget chief melissa mccaw and transportation commissioner joseph giulietti credit mark pazniokas ctmirror org recently that borrowing has hovered between 700 million and 800 million per year the federal government adds another 750 million to that in matching grants giving the state between 1 4 billion and 1 5 billion in new capital resources each year the problem is connecticut short changed its transportation capital program for decades prior to now and 1 5 billion in new money each year isn t anywhere near enough to do the job dot commissioner joe giulietti recently told lawmakers he needs at least 2 billion to make a difference and then that annual number would need to grow throughout the 2020s and 30s lastly that money connecticut borrows has to be paid back and that s where the state budget comes in every year the state makes payments principal and interest on billions of dollars of accumulated transportation bond issuances from years past that debt service line item eats up about 650 million of the budget s 1 6 billion special transportation fund the rest goes to pay for dot operations winter snow removal rail subsidies and bus and other transit programs so if the state wants to borrow more money to rebuild roads bridges and rail lines then it needs more dollars to pay off the debt which brings us to lamont s tolling plan proposed tolling corridors in connecticut the governor would order electronic tolls on interstates 84 91 and 95 and on the merritt parkway with a base charge of 4 4 cents per mile before discounts are offered to connecticut motorists this would raise 800 million per year for the budget by 2024 or 2025 the administration says with 30 to 40 percent coming from out of state motorists this would easily cover the debt payments on more annual borrowing but it would also give connecticut the option of shifting toll receipts directly into the capital program and paying in cash not borrowed dollars for hundreds of millions of dollars in work according to lamont budget director melissa mccaw over the next two decades connecticut could save billions of dollars in interest costs with this debt avoidance approach giulietti said he also believes a reliable long term revenue source like tolls could help connecticut control its debt costs down the road if we can lock in what the future revenue streams can be then it really allows for some creativity he added this is not just about getting a fund to balance this is about positioning connecticut for economic growth this is about making the case for families to be here in connecticut melissa mccaw budget director more importantly mccaw said it would finally allow connecticut to rebuild an aging overcrowded transportation system that s an impediment to a healthy future the bottom line here is that connecticut needs to make a decision about the path forward for transportation she said this is not just about getting a fund to balance this is about positioning connecticut for economic growth this is about making the case for families to be here in connecticut speeding up our rail service from hartford to new haven to stamford and new york city with more frequent service to waterbury and new london with easier access to bradley airport and an upgraded tweed airport lamont told legislators in his feb 20 budget address these transportation upgrades are the building blocks of our economic future but tolls aren t the only idea for financing an infrastructure rebuild there s also prioritized progress the democrats and the governor have some people convinced the only way to do this is with tolls and that s simply a fallacy said house minority leader themis klarides r derby in 2015 republican legislators noted democrats had massively increased borrowing for non transportation purposes and not just for schools and economic development house minority leader themis klarides and senate minority leader len fasano credit ctmirror org rather than simply cut programs out of the state budget democratic legislators and gov dannel p malloy were putting them on the credit card connecticut was borrowing more than 100 million per year to make payments on borrowing and a steady stream of community based projects often in democratic legislators districts consistently found their way into the bonding program between 2012 and 2015 bonds issued for non transportation purposes and repaid out of the budget s general fund not its special transportation fund grew from 1 1 billion to 2 billion per year republicans asked a logical question what if connecticut redirected about 700 million per year of this borrowing away from these other areas and into transportation if connecticut combined 700 million in annual borrowing repaid out of the general fund with the 700 million to 800 million it s already borrowing and paying off out of the special transportation fund and 750 million per year in federal grants it would have more than 2 1 billion each year to spend on transportation projects and no one would have to pay tolls this is about a reallocation of bonding said senate minority leader len fasano r north haven these simply are choices but some people don t want to make them these are the basic advantages of each program but no plan is without its flaws can roads and bridges last until toll receipts arrive with toll receipts not due for three or four years lamont nonetheless has no intention to bolster funding for transportation to cover the interim he even wants to cancel additional resources legislators pledged to the special transportation fund over the next few years the dot warned in a february memo that the governor s plan would have significant impacts on our capital program severely constricting the number of new projects that advance in the current and future years when pressed to elaborate on what he could do under the lamont plan until toll receipts arrive giulietti promised only that he could maintain the average condition or roads bridges and rail lines using a series of short term patches transportation advocates insist lamont s plan would put the capital program on a near starvation diet in the short term by comparison prioritize progress would elevate spending on projects right away and by more than 500 million per year by the time toll receipts arrive in 2024 or 2025 the gop plan already would have a massive head start on lamont s having invested 2 billion to 2 5 billion more over the next four years the democrats and the governor have some people convinced the only way to do this is with tolls and that s simply a fallacy house minority leader themis klarides r derby why haven t more advocates for transportation both among the legislature and outside of state government jumped at the republican minority s plan given its massive advantage in transportation investment i would hate to think the reason is it s a republican plan fasano said adding he believes more legislators would back the gop plan if they reviewed it closely i really believe many people who criticize it haven t even read it the administration says that provided tolls are approved now it could respond if a transportation construction emergency arises in the next four or five years how by borrowing against future toll receipts lamont already is talking about borrowing against future toll receipts to cover the projected 213 million capital cost to install gantries and other toll infrastructure mccaw couldn t say what interest rates the state would expect to pay under that scenario and if public opposition to tolls is strong now it would only be worse if motorists learn future toll receipts are being pledged to a private investor in exchange for a smaller lump sum payment to fix roads or install toll gantries now but prioritize progress has its own problems with debt and other fiscal issues would gop plan collapse under debt fiscal insolvency one of the reasons lamont and others want toll revenues for the special transportation fund is because the rest of the state budget is in even worse shape surging pension costs and payments on non transportation borrowing consume almost one third of the general fund compared with 10 percent two decades ago this is siphoning resources away from education health care social services and municipal aid lyle wray executive director of the capitol region council of governments what happens if and when the general fund has to pay off a significant chunk of transportation borrowing within a decade mccaw says annual debt service costs will have grown by 600 million that s one third of the entire cost of today s state program to fund local education and this burden is 100 percent born by connecticut taxpayers with nothing from out of state motorists she added making matters worse the special transportation fund still is headed for insolvency even if the general fund is used to pay off some transportation debt the stf would go belly up without toll receipts by 2026 but transportation advocates say the problems both with lamont s plan and with the republicans are solvable how so by putting them together could tolls and prioritize progress complement each other we see a tremendous amount of opportunity if the two proposals were somehow merged said don shubert president of the connecticut construction industry association shubert has endorsed lamont s tolls proposal but also said the governor s plan for the next four years likely would mean not treading water but actually falling backward in infrastructure repair lyle wray executive director of the capitol region council of governments and another advocate of tolls has referred to prioritize progress as a potential bridge to tolls how do we get from here to there wray said referring to the potential four or five year gap until toll receipts come in i would explore a merger for sure major projects such as the widening of i 95 in fairfield county or repairing the elevated section of i 84 in hartford could proceed as planned or maybe even faster shubert said why couldn t connecticut redirect some of the bonding earmarked for schools economic development or community based projects and shift it to transportation for the next four or five years advocates ask and then phase it out as toll revenues become available the answer some say is principle others say it s politics can you compromise with the toll monster rep laura devlin r fairfield credit keith m phaneuf ctmirror org the lamont administration insists there is middle ground as long as there is a sustainable long term funding source for transportation involved mccaw said the administration would consider an interim plan that temporarily redirects borrowing for transportation purposes we are happy to engage in a discussion on what the short term opportunities are mccaw said adding the plan must be fiscally sustainable but republicans say it s the democratic governor who won t give ground lamont should recognize fasano says that the public simply doesn t trust the toll monster i say no tolls period he said rep laura devlin of fairfield ranking house republican on the transportation committee said tolls are a flat out money grab for a state grasping at straws to solve it fiscal dilemma don shubert president of the connecticut construction industries association file photo credit keith m phaneuf ctmirror org file photo the reason for this hard line in the sand republicans say can be found within state government s track record connecticut spent 1 3 billion in fuel tax receipts on non transportation programs between the 2006 and 2014 fiscal years even as the wholesale gasoline tax rose four times during that period and residents still are reeling from major state tax hikes in 2011 and 2015 what isn t in doubt transportation advocates add is that time is running out if a long term transportation rebuild with a new funding source isn t adopted this year the odds of it getting done in 2020 when legislators are up for re election are slim they say similarly once connecticut and the nation slide into recession which some economists warn could happen as soon as next year the odds of a transportation rebuild also shrink by the time the political and economic smoke clears the state might not be ready to do anything new for four or five more years and no one wants that shubert said that s a catastrophe you don t want that

beijing china should fine tune monetary policy in a pre emptive way based on economic growth and price changes the official xinhua news agency said on monday citing a top level meeting chaired by president xi jinping monetary policy needs to be neither too tight nor too loose and should be fine tuned in a timely and pre emptive way based on economic growth and changes in price situations xinhua quoted the central financial and economic affairs commission as saying the report was the fourth from a top ranking policymaking body in china in less than two weeks and comes as financial markets debate how much more additional support beijing will provide to the world s second largest economy after surprisingly resilient data released last week the economy expanded at a steady 6 4 percent pace in the first quarter defying expectations for a further slowdown with industrial output retail sales and investment in march all growing faster than expected following a raft of growth boosting measures rolled out in recent months china s growth last year cooled to a near 30 year low of 6 6 percent weighed down by weak investment and the escalating trade war with the united states the xinhua report on monday did not give more details on the reference to watching price changes producer and consumer price gauges in china have picked up easing concerns about deflationary risks but broader inflation levels are still modest the policy comments from the financial commission meeting largely echoed those from meetings of china s politburo the state council and the central bank in the past two weeks a statement on friday from the politburo a top decision making body of the communist party said china will maintain policy support for the economy which still faces downward pressure and difficulties despite better than expected first quarter growth it said authorities will strike a balance between stabilising economic growth promoting reforms controlling risks and improving people s livelihoods adding that china would forward with structural efforts to control debt levels and prevent speculation in the property market it said chinese stock markets fell sharply on monday as investors feared the government will temper the pace of further policy easing if the economy continues to improve china s major stock indexes have surged around 30 percent so far this year on expectations stimulus will stabilise the economy while analysts cautioned it was too early to call a turnaround some market watchers bumped up their china growth forcasts after last week s data and lowered their expectations of further support measures monday s comments from the financial commision also reiterated that china will step up fiscal policy and strengthen macro counter cyclical adjustments a phrase that usually refers to efforts to reduce pressure on the economy in march the government announced billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending to help businesses and protect jobs regulators are likely to keep up efforts to keep credit available to smaller firms at more affordable rates though there are concerns that a recent surge in bank lending could fuel another jump in bad loans and speculation in property markets the key takeaway from the policy meetings is that there is limited room for further marginal monetary easing however we don t see a u turn of its monetary policy any time soon analysts at ocbc said in a note reuters

princeton n j april 22 2019 prnewswire the bank of princeton the bank nasdaq bprn today reported unaudited results of operations and financial condition for the quarter ended march 31 2019 the bank reported net income of 229 thousand or 0 03 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to net income of 3 8 million or 0 55 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 and net income of 3 6 million or 0 52 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2018 the decrease in net income when comparing the three months ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the bank s provision for loan losses of 4 2 million the decrease in net income when comparing the three months ended march 31 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the bank s provision for loan losses of 3 9 million during the first quarter of 2019 the bank identified three separate borrowing relationships that required the bank to record charge offs one relationship a commercial and industrial participation loan with six other banks with our portion totaling 1 9 million was fully charged off due to significant operating losses resulting from the loss of several large contracts which fully negated the value of the collateral this loan was placed on non accrual status in the fourth quarter of 2018 the remaining charge offs totaling 2 4 million were associated with two separate commercial real estate loans with the primary portion being delinquent taxes associated with the properties and selling costs we are disappointed with the credit loss performance during the quarter however the bank s fundamental performance remained strong as evidenced by our loan growth stated edward dietzler president ceo chairman richard gillespie noted that it was unfortunate to report the credit losses but the bank continues to progress in line with its growth expectations and anticipates opening two new branches in the 3rd quarter and closing on the acquisition of five branches being purchased from beneficial bank in the 2nd quarter all of which will enhance shareholder value balance sheet review total assets were 1 30 billion at march 31 2019 an increase of 45 7 million or 3 6 when compared to 1 25 billion at the end of 2018 the primary reason for the increase in total assets was an increase of 33 6 million in net loans and the addition of a 12 5 million right of use asset resulting from the adoption of fasb update no 2016 02 leases the loan growth excluding the 4 2 million in charge offs represented a 13 99 increase on an annualized basis total deposits at march 31 2019 increased by 5 3 million or 0 5 when compared to december 31 2018 the increase in deposits consists of increases of 30 7 million in interest checking and 24 4 million in time deposits partially offset by a 38 5 million decrease in money markets and decreases of 10 0 million in non interest deposits and 1 3 million in savings accounts in addition during the quarter the bank borrowed 79 8 million in short term advances to fund the loan growth total stockholders equity increased 1 9 million or 1 0 when compared to the end of 2018 this increase was primarily due to exercises of stock options from the bank s equity incentive plans and an increase in the fair value of the available for sale investment portfolio the ratio of equity to total assets was 14 4 compared to 14 7 at december 31 2018 asset quality at march 31 2019 non performing assets were 9 5 million an increase of 3 8 million or 65 7 when compared to 5 7 million at december 31 2018 this increase was primarily due to the addition of a large commercial real estate loan partially offset by the 4 2 million in charge offs recorded during the quarter total troubled debt restructuring tdr balance totaled 1 3 million at march 31 2019 a decline of 8 thousand from year end 2018 all tdr s are performing to their agreed upon terms review of quarterly financial results net interest income was 9 9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 10 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 9 9 million for the first quarter of 2018 the decrease from the previous quarter was a result of an increase in interest expense of 484 thousand or 12 5 partially offset by an increase in interest income of 88 thousand the net interest margin for the first quarter 2019 was 3 34 declining 13 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 this decrease was primarily due to a 19 basis point increase on the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities when comparing the same three month period ended march 31 2019 and 2018 net interest income increased 15 thousand the provision for credit losses was 4 2 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 the comparable amounts were 0 and 255 thousand for the three months ended december 31 2018 and march 31 2018 respectively the primary reason for the provision in the first quarter of 2019 was due to 4 3 million in charge offs recorded against three separate borrower relationships discussed above the rate of allowance for credit losses to period end loans was 1 07 at march 31 2019 compared to 1 10 at december 31 2018 and 1 19 at march 31 2018 which reflects management s assessment of the credit quality in the loan portfolio total non interest income for the first quarter of 2019 was 785 thousand compared to 786 thousand for the same period in 2018 and 601 thousand for the previous quarter when comparing march 31 2019 to the prior quarter non interest income increased 184 thousand or 30 6 which was due to an increase in loan fees collected during the respective periods total non interest expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased 286 thousand or 4 7 when compared to the same period in 2018 this increase was primarily due to increases in occupancy and equipment expense and data processing expenses due to our growth when comparing march 31 2019 to the prior quarter non interest expense increased 23 thousand or 0 4 primarily due to growth related increases in salaries and employee benefits expense occupancy and equipment expense and data processing expense partially offset by a reduction in both

an income tax expense of 801 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 18 3 for the three month period ended december 31 2018 and compared to an income tax expense of 790 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 18 1 for the three month period ended march 31 2018 the effective tax rate for the three months ending march 31 2019 was positively impacted by the exercise of stock option from

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire beijing reuters china should fine tune monetary policy in a pre emptive way based on economic growth and price changes the official xinhua news agency said on monday citing a top level meeting chaired by president xi jinping monetary policy needs to be neither too tight nor too loose and should be fine tuned in a timely and pre emptive way based on economic growth and changes in price situations xinhua quoted the central financial and economic affairs commission as saying related stories the report was the fourth from a top ranking policymaking body in china in less than two weeks and comes as financial markets debate how much more additional support beijing will provide to the world s second largest economy after surprisingly resilient data released last week the economy expanded at a steady 6 4 percent pace in the first quarter defying expectations for a further slowdown with industrial output retail sales and investment in march all growing faster than expected following a raft of growth boosting measures rolled out in recent months china s growth last year cooled to a near 30 year low of 6 6 percent weighed down by weak investment and the escalating trade war with the united states the xinhua report on monday did not give more details on the reference to watching price changes producer and consumer price gauges in china have picked up easing concerns about deflationary risks but broader inflation levels are still modest the policy comments from the financial commission meeting largely echoed those from meetings of china s politburo the state council and the central bank in the past two weeks a statement on friday from the politburo a top decision making body of the communist party said china will maintain policy support for the economy which still faces downward pressure and difficulties despite better than expected first quarter growth it said authorities will strike a balance between stabilizing economic growth promoting reforms controlling risks and improving people s livelihoods adding that china would forward with structural efforts to control debt levels and prevent speculation in the property market it said chinese stock markets fell sharply on monday as investors feared the government will temper the pace of further policy easing if the economy continues to improve china s major stock indexes have surged around 30 percent so far this year on expectations stimulus will stabilize the economy while analysts cautioned it was too early to call a turnaround some market watchers bumped up their china growth forecasts after last week s data and lowered their expectations of further support measures monday s comments from the financial commission also reiterated that china will step up fiscal policy and strengthen macro counter cyclical adjustments a phrase that usually refers to efforts to reduce pressure on the economy in march the government announced billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending to help businesses and protect jobs regulators are likely to keep up efforts to keep credit available to smaller firms at more affordable rates though there are concerns that a recent surge in bank lending could fuel another jump in bad loans and speculation in property markets the key takeaway from the policy meetings is that there is limited room for further marginal monetary easing however we don t see a u turn of its monetary policy any time soon analysts at ocbc said in a note reporting by stella qiu and kevin yao editing by kim coghill
princeton n j april 22 2019 prnewswire the bank of princeton the bank nasdaq bprn today reported unaudited results of operations and financial condition for the quarter ended march 31 2019 the bank reported net income of 229 thousand or 0 03 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to net income of 3 8 million or 0 55 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 and net income of 3 6 million or 0 52 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2018 the decrease in net income when comparing the three months ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the bank s provision for loan losses of 4 2 million the decrease in net income when comparing the three months ended march 31 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the bank s provision for loan losses of 3 9 million during the first quarter of 2019 the bank identified three separate borrowing relationships that required the bank to record charge offs one relationship a commercial and industrial participation loan with six other banks with our portion totaling 1 9 million was fully charged off due to significant operating losses resulting from the loss of several large contracts which fully negated the value of the collateral this loan was placed on non accrual status in the fourth quarter of 2018 the remaining charge offs totaling 2 4 million were associated with two separate commercial real estate loans with the primary portion being delinquent taxes associated with the properties and selling costs we are disappointed with the credit loss performance during the quarter however the bank s fundamental performance remained strong as evidenced by our loan growth stated edward dietzler president ceo chairman richard gillespie noted that it was unfortunate to report the credit losses but the bank continues to progress in line with its growth expectations and anticipates opening two new branches in the 3rd quarter and closing on the acquisition of five branches being purchased from beneficial bank in the 2nd quarter all of which will enhance shareholder value balance sheet review total assets were 1 30 billion at march 31 2019 an increase of 45 7 million or 3 6 when compared to 1 25 billion at the end of 2018 the primary reason for the increase in total assets was an increase of 33 6 million in net loans and the addition of a 12 5 million right of use asset resulting from the adoption of fasb update no 2016 02 leases the loan growth excluding the 4 2 million in charge offs represented a 13 99 increase on an annualized basis total deposits at march 31 2019 increased by 5 3 million or 0 5 when compared to december 31 2018 the increase in deposits consists of increases of 30 7 million in interest checking and 24 4 million in time deposits partially offset by a 38 5 million decrease in money markets and decreases of 10 0 million in non interest deposits and 1 3 million in savings accounts in addition during the quarter the bank borrowed 79 8 million in short term advances to fund the loan growth total stockholders equity increased 1 9 million or 1 0 when compared to the end of 2018 this increase was primarily due to exercises of stock options from the bank s equity incentive plans and an increase in the fair value of the available for sale investment portfolio the ratio of equity to total assets was 14 4 compared to 14 7 at december 31 2018 asset quality at march 31 2019 non performing assets were 9 5 million an increase of 3 8 million or 65 7 when compared to 5 7 million at december 31 2018 this increase was primarily due to the addition of a large commercial real estate loan partially offset by the 4 2 million in charge offs recorded during the quarter total troubled debt restructuring tdr balance totaled 1 3 million at march 31 2019 a decline of 8 thousand from year end 2018 all tdr s are performing to their agreed upon terms review of quarterly financial results net interest income was 9 9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 10 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 9 9 million for the first quarter of 2018 the decrease from the previous quarter was a result of an increase in interest expense of 484 thousand or 12 5 partially offset by an increase in interest income of 88 thousand the net interest margin for the first quarter 2019 was 3 34 declining 13 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 this decrease was primarily due to a 19 basis point increase on the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities when comparing the same three month period ended march 31 2019 and 2018 net interest income increased 15 thousand the provision for credit losses was 4 2 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 the comparable amounts were 0 and 255 thousand for the three months ended december 31 2018 and march 31 2018 respectively the primary reason for the provision in the first quarter of 2019 was due to 4 3 million in charge offs recorded against three separate borrower relationships discussed above the rate of allowance for credit losses to period end loans was 1 07 at march 31 2019 compared to 1 10 at december 31 2018 and 1 19 at march 31 2018 which reflects management s assessment of the credit quality in the loan portfolio total non interest income for the first quarter of 2019 was 785 thousand compared to 786 thousand for the same period in 2018 and 601 thousand for the previous quarter when comparing march 31 2019 to the prior quarter non interest income increased 184 thousand or 30 6 which was due to an increase in loan fees collected during the respective periods total non interest expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased 286 thousand or 4 7 when compared to the same period in 2018 this increase was primarily due to increases in occupancy and equipment expense and data processing expenses due to our growth when comparing march 31 2019 to the prior quarter non interest expense increased 23 thousand or 0 4 primarily due to growth related increases in salaries and employee benefits expense occupancy and equipment expense and data processing expense partially offset by a reduction in both professional fees and advertising expenses for the three month period ended march 31 2019 the bank recorded an income tax benefit of 74 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 47 7 compared to an income tax expense of 801 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 18 3 for the three month period ended december 31 2018 and compared to an income tax expense of 790 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 18 1 for the three month period ended march 31 2018 the effective tax rate for the three months ending march 31 2019 was positively impacted by the exercise of stock option from

saudi arabia and the united arab emirates said on sunday they had agreed to send sudan 3bn worth of aid throwing a lifeline to the country s new military leaders after protests led to the ousting of president omar al bashir the two gulf arab countries will deposit 500m with the sudanese central bank and send the rest in the form of food medicine and petroleum products their state news agencies said in parallel statements the aid comes amid wrangling between the transitional military council tmc and protesters and opposition groups who are demanding that civilians lead a two year transitional period the protesters who have kept up a sit in outside the defence ministry since bashir was removed on april 11 they have demonstrated in large numbers over the past three days pressing for a rapid handover to civilian rule tmc head abdel fattah al burhan told state tv that the formation of a joint military civilian council one of the activists demands was being considered the issue has been put forward for discussion and a vision has yet to be reached he said the role of the military council complements the uprising and the blessed revolution said burhan adding that the tmc was committed to handing power over to the people but a coalition of protesters and opposition groups said the tmc was not serious about handing over power to civilians describing the council as an extension of the old regime we have decided to opt for escalation with the military council not to recognise its legitimacy and to continue the sit in and escalate the protests on the streets mohamed al amin abdel aziz of the sudanese professional association told one of the largest crowds outside the defence ministry kobar prison burhan also confirmed for the first time that bashir and a number of former officials including presidential aide nafie ali nafie acting party head ahmed haroun and former first vice president ali osman taha are being held at a high security prison in khartoum north all of them are at kobar prison he said adding that a large number of symbols of the former regime suspected of corruption will stand trial burhan said authorities had found 7m euros 7 8m in bashir s home along with 350 000 slightly more than previously reported the aid from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates is the first major publicly announced assistance to sudan from gulf states in several years this is to strengthen its financial position ease the pressure on the sudanese pound and increase stability in the exchange rate the saudi press agency said sudan s state news agency said the central bank strengthened the sudanese pound to 45 pounds to the dollar from 47 5 in a measure that coincided with the sharp rise in the price of the pound against the dollar on the parallel market the two gulf states have ties with burhan and his deputy mohamed hamdan dagalo through their participation in the saudi led coalition fighting in yemen sudan has been suffering from a deepening economic crisis that has caused cash shortages and long queues at bakeries and petrol stations analysts have blamed the crisis on economic mismanagement corruption and the impact of u s sanctions as well as the loss of oil revenue when south sudan seceded in 2011 in october 2017 the united states lifted some trade and economic sanctions on sudan but sudan remained on the list of countries that the united states considers to be sponsors of terrorism burhan said a committee could travel to the united states for discussions about lifting sudan from the list by next week washington has said sudan will not be removed from the list as long as the military is in power the designation makes sudan ineligible for desperately needed debt relief and financing from international lenders the united states agreed in november to talks with bashir s government on how to get sudan removed from the list but no resolution was reached before his overthrow over the last few years sudan s cash short government expanded money supply to cover the cost of expensive subsidies on fuel wheat and pharmaceuticals causing annual inflation of 73 percent and the sudanese pound to plunge against the dollar

n24 39tr debt nigeria not in debt crisis says fed govt nigeria is not in any way near a debt crisis despite its n24 39 trillion about 79 44 billion debts the federal government has said the debt figure which as at december 31 2018 comprised eurobond loans facilities from the world bank group china and africa development bank group constitute over 80 per cent of the total debt stock it represents a year on year growth of 12 25 per cent and is higher than the 2017 figure by n2 662 billion finance minister mrs zainab ahmed who made the disclosure at the sidelines of the just concluded international monetary fund world bank spring meetings in washington d c explained that despite warnings by the multilateral institutions the country was not in any way near a debt crisis her position was collaborated by fsdh research latest report on nigeria s debt position titled is nigeria public debt too high analysts at the lagos based investment company argued that since nigeria s public debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio was still under 20 per cent precisely 18 89 per cent it can still get more loans to reach the 25 per cent benchmark set for itself and the 56 per cent international threshold set for countries in nigeria s peer group the analysts at fsdh research said nigeria still has room to borrow an additional n7 89 trillion before reaching a threshold of about n32 trillion fsdh research data showed that countries like china south africa india uk brazil and the united states u s all have high debt to gross domestic product gdp of 50 per cent 57 per cent 70 per cent 87 per cent 88 per cent 91 per cent and 106 per cent respectively it however stressed that these countries have successfully managed to deploy their borrowings into activities that can stimulate revenue generation including education transportation construction security technology and other growth enhancing infrastructure the fshd report explained that by utilising the borrowed funds in areas that improve the ease of doing business in their countries they have been able to grow their economies further create job opportunities and create more avenues for their governments to grow their revenue it said the 25 per cent benchmark gives nigeria a leeway to borrow an additional n7 89 trillion given her level of gdp but before you are quick to celebrate there is the need to consider one very important factor the ability of the country to service the debt without causing untold hardship on the country in measuring the ability of a country to service her debt obligations we look at the ratio of domestic debt service to federal government of nigeria federation accounts allocation committee faac allocation the imf had during the spring meetings warned nigeria and other emerging market countries taking excessive loans from china to consider the terms of such facilities especially their compliance to the paris club arrangements related posts experience the ultimate celebration xiaomi fan festival promotion director imf monetary and capital markets department tobias andrian said there was nothing bad in borrowing from china except that the terms of such loans are always questionable he said loans from china are good but the countries should consider the terms of the loans and we urge countries that when they borrow from abroad that the terms are favorable for the borrower and should be conforming to the paris club arrangements continuing andrian who spoke on the global financial stability report gfsr said let me reiterate that in many frontier markets we see that the share of debt that is not conforming to the paris club standards is on the rise and that means that if there is any debt restructuring down the road one day that can be very unfavorable to those countries so the borrowing terms the covenants are extremely important and we do see a deterioration in that aspect but mrs ahmed explained that while government borrows to deliver on its promises it is also mindful of rising debt burden which eats up about 25 per cent of the country s annual earnings the minister said the world bank and imf are cautioning us on the rate at which we are borrowing they are also cautioning us on the need to build fiscal buffers because the global economy is going to be facing some risks and we agree with that we are very mindful of the level of our borrowings our borrowing is very much within fiscal limits right now what we are doing is to increase our revenue generating capacity to make it easier for us to meet our debt obligations routine and capital expenditure responding to concerns on chinese loans to finance the idu kaduna lagos ibadan and abuja light rail projects expansion of four airport terminals and some hydroelectric projects across the country the minister said to borrow we go through several processes of assessments as well as negotiations we make sure we get the best possible terms and whether we are borrowing from financial institutions or in europe or china or anywhere else we try to get the best rates of borrowing so far the conditions we have got are very good ones mrs ahmed said the government of president muhammadu buhari is committed to ensuring that the country grows in a manner that would bring many people out of poverty according to her it is for this reason that the government takes its social investment programmes like the school feeding conditional cash transfers to the poor and vulnerable and tradermoni programme very seriously

argentina s dollar debt is getting hammered by global investors prices hovering below 75 cents on the dollar and an average yield of 11 08 percent for its international bonds shows investors are uneasy despite an unprecedented us 56 billion credit agreement with the international monetary fund img and us 76 7 billion of reserves at the central bank during a year in which emerging market notes posted their best quarter since 2012 argentina s return of 2 1 percent year to date is one third the average for peers moreover credit default swaps are pricing in a 49 percent probability of non payment over the next five years compared with just 22 percent a year ago the extra yield investors demand to hold the dollar debt over us treasuries 8 58 percentage points is the highest since 2014 when the country was in default and before mauricio macri boosted optimism with a presidential campaign that promised a return to economic normalcy debt due in 2021 is trading below 90 cents and yielding 13 5 percent if investors in that security are worried about getting paid pity the creditors of the 100 year bond issued at the peak of foreign investor exuberance for macri in june 2017 they re currently priced at 71 cents ecuador which has historically traded close to argentina among high yield credits is deemed more than 300 basis points safer in the bond market than its south american peer despite a history of defaults and a imf programme a fraction of the size here s how that relationship has evolved over the past year macri is now up for re election in october after a first term that most investors consider to have produced mixed results and cristina fernández de kirchner who oversaw the country from 2007 to 2015 is mulling a comeback the prospects of a run off in november between the former president and macri appears to be the most likely scenario according to pollsters who currently see it as a coin toss on who would emerge victorious given that fernández de kirchner nationalised the private pension system installed currency controls and blasted the imf and foreign debt investors it s understandable that bondholders are unsettled macri s approval rating has slipped below 30 percent for the first time since taking office and the bitter recession and stubbornly high inflation 54 7 percent year on year are making it hard for even some supporters to justify another four years in office aware of the poll numbers macri rolled out measures last week to freeze prices on some consumer goods increase lending and lessen the blow of some planned utility rate hikes whether those moves along with the central bank s uber restrictive monetary policy will bolster the outlook enough to let him squeak by for re election remains to be seen by by daniel cancel bloomberg

establishment democrats have always hated bernie most people are unaware that when bernie first ran for congress as an independent the democratic party ran establishment candidates against him in his first congressional campaign 1988 the democrats ran a conservative spoiler paul poirier state house majority leader who allowed a republican peter smith win the seat some in the democratic party didn t give a rat s ass they opposed bernie as vigorously as they opposed smith maybe more so and in 1990 they ran an african american woman dolores sandoval in the hope of pulling away votes from bernie whose popularity was surging they knew she had no chance to win but they preferred to see the republican incumbent reelected than the independent socialist win but the independent socialist did win and by a lot bernie entered congress in january of 1991 and began caucusing with the democrats the party didn t like his influence and the democratic establishment wanted to get rid of him asap he talked about how the democrats and the republicans represented the interests of wealthy donors not the interests of working families it hit a nerve with the democrats because it was true and it was embarrassing for them in 1991 he founded the congressional progressive caucus which he hoped would offer progressives a way of distinguishing themselves from democrats brief tangent the current co chair mark pocan a more conventional liberal democrat must have lost sight of that when he started recruiting new dems into the caucus watering it down and wrecking its credibility in 1992 the democrats ran lewis young in the hope of taking away enough votes from bernie to allow the seat to flip back to the gop the disgusting strategy failed again and bernie s popularity soared howard dean then governor of vermont had had enough and persuaded the state democratic party to back bernie nonetheless four years later the establishment democrats were flipping out about the socialist and tried the same tired trick which once again flopped that pretty much ended it although democrat larry drown ran against bernie in 2004 his last run for congress and bernie clobbered him and the republican taking 205 774 votes 67 5 people in vermont liked him more than they liked either of the establishment political parties and their crappy candidates today the wealthy donor class hates bernie as much as they ever did whether the gop wealthy donors or the democratic party wealthy donors they know that when he says he s for change it s real and profound change not a few tweaks around the edges obama change last week writing for the alex shephard noted that bernie s loudest opponents are party insiders who don t represent a political constituency of any significance and their strategy is self defeating bernie is the frontrunner and entering the white house in january of 2021 both seem increasingly possible maybe even probable most vocal opponents in the party are an assemblage of establishmentarians and familiar beltway hands none of whom speak for a political constituency of any size or significance moreover far from hurting sanders this impotent assault is self defeating fueling the narrative that party gatekeepers want at all costs to keep a political revolution from taking over the democratic party there s another possible if unintended effect of the growing challenges to sanders from democratic establishment circles however trump s best chance at victory doesn t come from a democratic socialist claiming the nomination but from a third party candidate splitting the vote claims from democratic stalwarts that sanders can t unseat the president are fool s gold to self funding candidates like howard schultz who argues that a majority of voters are clamoring for a centrist corporate candidate if anyone is splitting the party and undercutting democrats chances if anyone is paving the way for a second trump term it isn t sanders it s his most obstinate and obstreperous opponents while there s a growing backlist of articles detailing the resistance within democratic fundraising circles most of the criticisms of sanders center around the question of electability media matters founder david brock told politico last month that he believed that sanders would struggle to unite the democratic party s many unruly factions and that his sizable war chest would make it easy for him to stay in the race even if there were little chance he could win former missouri senator claire mccaskill echoed this sentiment to the times saying one thing we have now that we didn t in 16 is the uniting force of trump there will be tremendous pressure on bernie and his followers to fall in line because of what trump represents there is undoubtedly an ideological component of the anti sanders wing of the party that is often framed in practical terms attacks on sanders and other high profile democrats like rep alexandria ocasio cortez often contend that left wing goals like socialized medicine will be an electoral albatross dooming the party to failure in battleground states these arguments are rarely presented in policy terms but it s easy to draw a line between an opposition to sanders rooted in the democratic party s donor class and sanders s high tax proposals and class war rhetoric and that brings us right to greg jaffe spiece from yesterday capitalism in crisis u s billionaires worry about the survical of the system that made them rich for decades he wrote democrats and republicans have hailed america s business elite especially in silicon valley as the country s salvation the government might be gridlocked the electorate angry and divided but america s innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain free way out of the mess their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the u s economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country s most vexing problems government s role was to stay out of the way now that consensus is shattering for the first time in decades capitalism s future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for america s business elite in places such as silicon valley the slopes of davos switzerland and the halls of harvard business school there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made america an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart americans still loved technology khanna said but too many of them felt locked out of the country s economic future and were looking for someone to blame what happened to us he imagined people in these left behind places asking part of khanna s solution was to sign on as co chairman of the presidential campaign of sen bernie sanders i vt the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against the handful of billionaires who control the economic and political life of this nation and who disproportionately live in khanna s district the other part of khanna s solution was to do what he was doing now talking to billionaire tech executives like larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and silicon valley was unsustainable boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year larsen s net worth had briefly hit 59 billion making him the fifth richest person in the world before the currency s value fell without an intervention he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in silicon valley and anger in the country would continue to grow it seems like every company in the world has to be here larsen said it s just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger at some point larsen and khanna worried something was going to break the 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of american capitalism but it was donald trump s election and the pent up anger it exposed that left america s billionaire class fearful for capitalism s future khanna was elected in 2016 just as the anxiety started to spread in europe far right nationalist parties were gaining ground closer to home socialists and trump inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections conversations of the sort that khanna was having with larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism s most rarefied circles including harvard business school where last fall seth klarman a highly influential billionaire investor delivered what he described as a plaintive wail to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late the setting was the opening of klarman hall a new 120 million conference center built with his family s donation it s a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can he told the audience gathered in the 1 000 seat auditorium it s a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions or harsh ones to offer good benefits or paltry ones if business leaders didn t ask hard questions about capitalism he warned that they would be asked by ideologues seeking to point fingers assign blame and make reckless changes to the system six months after that speech klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass leading politicians such as trump sanders and sen elizabeth warren d ma were advocating positions on tariffs wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago klarman wasn t opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation but he worried that these new proposals went much too far i think we re in the middle of a revolution not a guns revolution but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up and good things don t happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution he said he wasn t the only one who felt a sense of alarm one of the most popular classes at harvard business school home to the next generation of fortune 500 executives was a class on reimagining capitalism seven years ago the elective started with 28 students now there were nearly 300 taking it during that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government said rebecca henderson the harvard economist who teaches the course what the trust surveys say is what i see she said they are really worried about the direction in which the u s and the world is heading a few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading winners take all a book by anand giridharadas a journalist and former mckinsey consultant that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like silicon valley davos and harvard business school giridharadas book was a withering attack on america s billionaire class and the notion that america s iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government this spring giridharadas took his argument to klarman hall he slammed mark zuckerberg taking aim at the facebook founder s 100 million effort to fix newark s faltering schools and his 3 billion push to end disease in a generation i m glad he s trying to get rid of all the diseases i wish facebook wasn t a plague giridharadas said he trashed starbucks ceo howard schultz s independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber wealthy and he lambasted the notion frequently championed by the likes of bill gates and barack obama that silicon valley s innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism s rewards really giridharadas asked now five companies control america instead of 100 and a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted for many of the students schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place giridharadas ideas were both energizing and disorienting erika uyterhoeven a second year student recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when giridharadas was finished so what should we do her colleague asked is he saying we shouldn t go into banking or consulting added another student there was a palpable sense of personal desperation khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district he grew up in an overwhelmingly white middle class suburb of philadelphia after college and yale law school he moved to silicon valley in 2003 hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world in 2014 backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors khanna challenged an eight term incumbent in a democratic primary and lost the defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed in particular the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district where the median home value in formerly blue collar cities surged past 2 million the best thing that happened to me was that i lost my 2014 election he said had i won maybe i would ve been a traditional neoliberal it really forced my self reflection and it pointed out every weakness i ever had in california khanna s home is a small apartment around the corner from a dollar tree one of only two in his district his wife and two children live most of the year in washington where home values are cheaper his days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid silicon valley s success i am an 11 year renter with a master s degree a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees her question wasn t about whether she would ever be able to afford a home but about a fellow teacher who couldn t afford health insurance a few days earlier he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf the billionaires in khanna s district meanwhile were consumed by a different worry mixed in with the valley s usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism the digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era the result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands as technology advanced some feared things were only going to get worse robots were eliminating much factory work online commerce was decimating retail and self driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers the next step was computers that could learn and think what happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor said greg brockman chairman of openai a company backed by several silicon valley billionaires such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research said brockman 30 they could displace a large number of office jobs eventually he said the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live only andrew yang a long shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income but the idea of a universal basic income was discussed regularly in the valley the prospect was both energizing and terrifying openai had recently added an ethicist brockman sometimes referred to her as a philosopher to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations to brockman a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing my expectation is that we re going to look back at eating meat as this terrible immoral thing he said the same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence we ll look back and say wow that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive he said khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci fi fantasy his focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today he often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies the tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent on a warm spring evening khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen silicon valley tech executives software engineers and venture capitalists the group gathered at a 5 million mediterranean style villa perched atop a hill overlooking cupertino which glittered in the valley below khanna described a december trip he organized to tiny jefferson iowa for a group of tech executives that included microsoft s chief technology officer and a linkedin co founder the executives donated to the community college s scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs starting at 65 000 a year khanna had made similar trips to west virginia ohio and kentucky the total number of jobs these trips produced was small and the pay wasn t great still khanna believed they served a larger purpose they proved that people in silicon valley cared about places like jefferson a rural town of only 4 200 they gave people hope that even the remotest parts of america could take part in the country s tech revolution the next step khanna told the executives at the mansion in cupertino california was a 100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes similar to land grant colleges to train workers in left behind parts of america khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass but that wasn t really the point it sets a blueprint he said khanna s blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country many democrats blamed trump s victory and the country s divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions khanna had a different view he saw the country s problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity sometimes khanna imagined what people in these left behind parts of the country were thinking their grandparents had fought in world war ii and helped build the country s industrial age economy now they worried people like khanna whose parents emigrated from india were surging past them they just got here and they are doing really really well khanna imagined these people saying what happened to us a few days after the meeting at the cupertino mansion khanna was standing in front of 16 000 amped up sanders supporters the san francisco skyline rose in front of him and the golden gate bridge spanned the bay behind him in his gray suit and pressed white shirt the two term congressman looked a bit out of place an emissary from establishment washington crashing someone else s revolution khanna gave a brief speech introducing sanders who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 democratic primaries he bashed the billionaire class and its influence over american elections democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections sanders yelled in his brooklyn growl we say no to oligarchy he continued yes to democracy khanna s eyes fixed on steve spinner a big tech investor in silicon valley and major fundraiser for obama s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns spinner who chaired khanna s congressional win was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest we dragged him out here khanna said he s about as far from bernie as you can get many of khanna s billionaire supporters even those who worried about capitalism and inequality seemed genuinely puzzled by khanna s affection for sanders for khanna it was simple in sanders khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country s most vexing problems inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism sanders wasn t a perfect match for khanna sanders didn t really understand the tech industry though he wasn t calling for the breakup of big tech companies like warren and some other candidates warren s proposal if executed would hurt companies in khanna s district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers khanna wished sanders would talk more about the greatness of the american economy and the power of the tech industry when properly taxed and regulated to lift people out of poverty but on that score khanna believed he could help sanders we can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue khanna said but i have no doubt that if bernie sanders was in the white house he d wake up every day thinking how do i solve structural inequality in america the 77 year old socialist s speech had passed the one hour mark and the crowd was still laughing cheering hooting and shouting we re probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations sanders said a voice in the crowd screamed an expletive that s ok sanders continued i don t need and we don t want their support the congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd which stretched to the back of the park khanna saw sanders revolution as an imperfect solution to a near impossible problem for now though it was the best he could find
