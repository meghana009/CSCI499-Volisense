published monday 1 april 2019 print disqus cracks appearing first domino constrained hiring tariff trouble a virtual pass to the sic rip andrew marshall the last warrior cleveland chicago dallas austin dallas and back home to puerto rico this month the federal reserve joined its global peers by turning decisively dovish jerome powell and friends haven t just stopped tightening soon they will begin actively easing by reinvesting the fed s maturing mortgage bonds into treasury securities it s not exactly quantitative easing i ii and iii but it will have some of the same effects why are they doing this one theory which i admit possibly plausible was that powell simply caved to wall street pressure the rate hikes and qt were hitting asset prices and liquidity much to the detriment of bankers and others to whom the fed pays keen attention but that doesn t truly square with his 2018 speeches and actions the fed s march 20 announcement suggests more is happening i think two other factors are driving the fed s thinking one is increasing recognition of the same slowing global growth that made other central banks turn dovish in recent months the other is the fed s realization that its previous course risked inverting the yield curve which was violently turning against its fourth quarter expectations and possibly toward recession see chart below courtesy of wsj s daily shot that would not have looked good in the history books hence the backtracking on the second point too late the yield curve inverted and recession forecasts became suddenly de rigueur among the same financial punditry that was wildly bullish just weeks ago my own position has been consistent recession is approaching but not just yet yet like the fed i am data dependent and the latest data are not encouraging today we ll examine this and consider what may have changed cracks appearing let s start with a step back the global economy clearly hasn t recovered from the last recession like it did in previous cycles yes the stock market performed well so has real estate we ve seen some economic growth which in a few places you might even call a boom but for the most part it s been pretty mild unemployment is low but wage growth has been sluggish at best rising asset prices fueled by almost a decade of easy monetary policy also contributed to wealth and income inequality which fueled populist and now semi socialist movements around the world this slow recovery began fading in the last few quarters the first cracks appeared overseas leaving the us as an island of stability not coincidentally we also had slightly positive interest rates and thus attracted capital from elsewhere this let our growth continue longer but now signs of weakness are mounting here too recall this follows years of astonishing amazing unprecedented and astronomically huge monetary stimulus by the federal reserve bank of japan european central bank and others in various and sundry ways they opened the spigots and left them running full speed for almost a decade and all it produced was the above mentioned weak recovery chart below from my friend jim bianco again via the daily shot that alone should tell you that putting your faith in central bankers is probably a mistake we can t know how much worse the last decade would have been without their help but does this feel like success yet here we are with millions still in the hole from the last recession and another one possibly looming we also can t rely on historical precedent to identify where when or why it will start but we can make some educated guesses first domino earlier i called the us an island of stability other such islands exist too and australia is high on the list the last down under recession was 27 yes 27 years ago in 1991 no other developed economy can say the same the long streak has a lot to do with being one of china s top raw material suppliers during that country s historic boom but australia has done other things right too alas all good things come to an end while not officially in recession yet australia s growth is slowing university of new south wales professor richard holden says it is in effective recession with per capita gdp having declined in both q3 and q4 of 2018 by the way italy is similarly in a technical recession expect more such euphemisms as governments try to avoid uttering the r word as often happens real estate is involved australia s housing boom bubble could unravel badly last week grant williams highlighted a video by economist john adams digital finance analytics founder martin north and irish financial adviser eddie hobbs who say australia s economy looks increasingly like ireland s just before the 2007 housing collapse the parallels are a bit spooky australia s household debt to gdp was 120 5 per cent as of september last year according to the bank for international settlements one of the highest in the world in 2007 ireland was sitting at around 100 per cent at the same time the rba puts australia s household debt to disposable income at 188 6 per cent ireland was 200 per cent in 2007 while the us was only 116 3 per cent at the start of 2008 rba figures also show more than two thirds of the country s net household wealth is invested in real estate in 2008 that figure was 83 per cent in ireland and 48 per cent in the us meanwhile 60 per cent of all lending by australian financial institutions is in the property sector in 2007 the international monetary fund gave the irish economy and banking system a clean bill of health and suggested that a soft landing was the most likely outcome last month the imf said australia s property market was heading for a soft landing house prices in sydney and melbourne have fallen nearly 14 per cent and 10 per cent from their respective peaks in july and november 2017 coinciding with sharp drop off in credit flowing into the housing sector both for owner occupiers and investors real estate is by nature credit driven few people pay cash for land homes or commercial properties so when credit dries up so does demand for those assets falling demand means lower prices which is bad when you are highly leveraged it gets worse from there as the banking system gets dragged into the fray losses can quickly spread as defaults affect lenders far from the source this is not only an australian problem similar slowdowns are unfolding in new zealand canada europe and china it s a global problem and one company reveals the impact constrained hiring shipping and transport stocks are kind of a canary in the coal mine because they are among the first to signal slowing growth last week fedex reported its international shipping revenue was down and cut its full year earnings guidance its cfo blamed the economy reported cnbc slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue as seen in the year over year decline in our fedex express international revenue alan b graf jr fedex corp executive vice president and chief financial officer said in statement despite a strong u s economy fedex said its international business weakened during the second quarter especially in europe fedex express international was down due primarily to higher growth in lower yielding services and lower weights per shipment graf said to compensate for lower revenue graf said fedex began a voluntary employee buyout program and constrained hiring it is also limiting discretionary spending and is reviewing additional actions fedex shares have dropped roughly 27 percent in the past year lagging the xli industrial etf s 1 percent decline this little snippet overflows with implications let s unpack some of them revenue fell due to higher growth in lower yielding services so those who ship international packages have decided lower costs outweigh speed likewise lower weights per shipment signals they are shipping only what they must when they must fedex is responding with an employee buyout program and constrained hiring the company is overstaffed for its present requirements this might also reflect increased automation of work once done by humans in any case it won t help the employment stats in addition fedex is limiting discretionary spending i m not sure what that means every business always limits discretionary spending or it doesn t stay in business long if fedex is taking additional steps then whoever would have received that spending will also see lower revenues they might have to constrain hiring too obviously fedex is just one company although a large and critically positioned one but statements like this add up to recession if they grow more common and they are tariff trouble one reason fedex is in the vanguard is that it s uniquely exposed to world trade the growth of which is diminishing for multiple reasons part of it is technology the things we ship internationally are increasingly digital and they travel via wires and satellite links instead of ships and planes these sorts of goods aren t easily valued for inclusion in the trade stats energy is another factor between us shale production and renewable energy sources we don t import as much oil and gas from across the seas as we otherwise would that shows up in both trade and currency values the us dollar is stronger now in part because we send fewer dollars to opec note the massive and stealthy growth in lng liquified natural gas exports in the past few years think what this will look like in a few years with not one but four lng export terminals on the us coasts natural gas is also the basis for much of the chemical and fertilizer industry abundant us supplies and prices less than half the cost of russian gas in germany help many us industries compete those are just signs of normal progress and change the economy can adapt to them the greater threat is artificially constrained international trade which is what the trump administration s trade war is creating last year i explained how trade wars can spark recession and trade deficits are nothing to fear i won t repeat all that here but we have since seen several market swoons rallies as harsher trade restrictions looked more less likely whether you like it or not asset values depend on the relatively free flow of goods and services across international borders interfere with that and all kinds of assets become less valuable starting a trade war at the same time growth is slowing for other reasons is more than a little unwise agricultural tariffs have already ripped through us farm country to devastating effect leaving losses some farmers may never recover the president s tariff threats had other impact as well companies raced to import foreign supplied components and inventory before the tariffs took effect this jammed ports and highways last year not with new demand but futuredemand shifted forward in time this is important and i think we will see the impact soon if we are not already transport and logistics companies geared up for last year s surge expanding their facilities and hiring new workers importers built up inventory in an effort to avoid tariffs that were supposed to take effect in january the deadline was extended but the threat is still alive at some point all this has to stop carrying inventory is expensive and will eventually outweigh the benefit of avoiding tariffs then the boom will come to a screeching halt imports will fall as companies work down inventory all those jobs and construction projects will disappear that combined with the other cyclical factors and high debt loads everywhere could easily add up to a recession exactly when is hard to say recessions usually get pronounced in hindsight so there s some possibility we are in one right now but i still think we ll avoid it this year getting into this box took a long time and so will getting out of it regardless we ll have a recession at some point i think the next subprime crisis will be in corporate debt next week we ll look deeper into the timing question what the yield curve tells us and why the next decade will bring little or no economic growth i realize this is not a happy conclusion but i call them as i see them i ll leave you with one final but critically important thought prepare don t despair tough times are coming but we can handle them you have a chance to get ready i highly suggest you take it a virtual pass to the sic time flies monday is already april fool s day and the strategic investment conference is only a month and a half away i m really looking forward to this year s sic the lineup of speakers is truly phenomenal some of them confirmed they were coming at the last minute like my old friend kyle bass who enriches and energizes every conference he speaks at i can t wait to hear what he ll talk about on our china panel the sic is completely sold out at this point but you can still attend virtually like last year we re offering our virtual pass at a steep pre sic discount thanks to the live stream feature a huge hit with passholders in 2018 when we introduced it you will be able to watch most of the conference live as it happens you ll even be able to ask questions and vote on the best questions for the speakers and panelists to answer it s the next best thing to actually being there and after the sic is over you will receive video and audio recordings slide shows and transcripts to enjoy at your leisure on your smartphone tablet or computer again and again you ll find all the details on this page i hope you ll decide to join us at the sic via your virtual pass rip andrew marshall the last warrior andy marshall who for the last 50 years has often been called the most important strategic thinker you ve never heard of quietly passed away last tuesday at age 97 starting at the rand think tank in 1949 he was persuaded to move from california by henry kissinger who wanted his intellect at the white house national security council in 1973 secretary of defense james schlesinger with whom he worked at rand brought him over to the defense department to set up the enigmatically titled office of net assessment it was basically a think tank designed to analyze long term threats and problems and help shape military strategy to deal with them he was reappointed by every president and defense secretary until his retirement in 2014 at the age of 94 in the 1970s andy famously contradicted the cia and the foreign policy establishment about the strength of russia s economy and predicted its collapse in the 1990s he quietly circulated his first memo saying china should become the main strategic focus of the us military like his russia analysis it was ignored at first called yoda within the military establishment andy s influence was enormous i first met him over 10 years ago as he hosted small gatherings of economists and strategists to talk about their views of the future i would find myself sitting at the table with names you would easily recognize but for some reason he kept asking me back he invited me to two of his famous week long sessions at the naval war college where he would mix an eclectic group of thinkers with high ranking military professionals to consider alternative futures he asked questions and then put us in a room for 12 hours a day plus long dinners afterward to discuss the opportunities and problems the scenarios might entail it was personally exhilarating and foundational for me at his retirement party a former vice president multiple defense secretaries abundant military brass and strategists gathered to honor this singular man s 40 years of continuous government service he spent 65 years focused on keeping our military prepared for the future i don t have enough room to properly pay tribute to one of the great futurists of our times andy brought the model of competitive thinking that he learned at the university of chicago to military strategy he basically invented the arena of inferential analysis you can read much better reviews of andy s career here by his biographer how is yoda and at the new york times and washington post his life was chronicled in his biography the last warrior andrew marshall and the shaping of modern american defense strategy just a few weeks ago andy again invited me to his apartment near the pentagon crammed full of books and journals to meet with other analysts andy was still mentally vigorous and primarily focused on china there in his room the net assessment of the potential problems with china were not sanguine i once asked andy why he kept inviting me back to his meetings and forums i truly had no idea every time i was in a room with him and the others he gathered i felt well out of my league he smiled and said because you don t think like other economists coming from andy that may be the finest and greatest compliment i have ever received andy marshall requiescat in pace cleveland chicago dallas austin dallas and back home to puerto rico starting sunday i will basically spend the night in each of the above cities before returning to puerto rico in cleveland we will check my eyes but i can tell you the surgery went very well i have some last minute meetings in chicago technically wisconsin then overnight in dallas before i fly to austin and then dallas for presentations click here for more information and to register i have been on the road too much this year but other than the sic in mid may my travel schedule looks rather tame for a few months we ll see have a great week think of a friend or two who you really need to connect with and then make it happen your thinking about possible

welcome to the last trading day of the quarter and what a quarter it s been we ve seen quite a turnaround after the market tanked late last year on worries about global economic growth stemming from the u s china trade war and concerns about a potentially too aggressive fed one leg of the market s recovery this quarter has come from increasing optimism that the u s and china can get a deal done to normalize trade relations affecting billions of dollars of goods flowing around the globe that optimism extended into this morning after treasury secretary steven mnuchin tweeted that talks in beijing had been constructive advertisement advertisement the other major leg of support has been a fed that has adopted a decidedly dovish stance helping boost the s p 500 by more than 12 this year through thursday s close one reason the central bank has given for holding off on more rate hikes has been muted inflation the latest inflation data from this morning showed the core personal consumption expenditures price index which strips out volatile food and energy prices and is the fed s preferred measure of inflation increased 0 1 month over month in january that s a lower reading than a briefing com consensus expectation of 0 2 and continues to reinforce what the fed has been saying about muted inflation meanwhile ride hailing service lyft is hitting public trading this morning beating its rival uber to an initial public offering the company now valued at about 24 billion has priced its shares at the top of its range at 72 per share shares will trade on the nasdaq under the ticker lyft in other corporate news carmax inc nyse kmx shares were up more than 5 8 this morning after the used car retailer s earnings beat expectations revenue was below analyst estimates advertisement advertisement optimism on trade after taking a back seat recently the optimism on the trade front was rekindled on thursday as mnuchin and u s trade representative robert lighthizer were in beijing for a fresh round of talks between the world s two largest economies reuters reported that china has made unprecedented proposals on issues including forced technology transfer but that there wasn t a definite timetable for a deal another round of negotiations is scheduled for next week in washington story continues this continues a pattern we ve been seeing where drips of seemingly good news come out and the market reacts positively but continues to be in the dark about the exact nature of where the negotiations are at and what key issues are getting hammered out president trump has already extended a deadline that could have seen the u s increase tariffs on chinese goods and it remains to be seen how much longer the talks will drag on it s possible that investor fatigue about the trade issue has set in limiting thursday s gains pessimism on the economy but it also appears that worries about the economy probably put a cap on any upside for wall street yesterday as well advertisement advertisement even as the fed has adopted a dovish stance and european central bankers have also stood pat on interest rates keeping relatively easy money flowing to companies monetary policy makers on both sides of the atlantic ocean have also reduced their economic forecasts in line with the sobering assessments the u s government on thursday said the economy expanded less than previously thought in the final quarter of last year with its third estimate of q4 gdp showing an annualized rate of increase of 2 2 compared with a previous reading of 2 6 a briefing com consensus had expected a reading of 2 5 inversion in the yield curve the worry about economic growth has been tempering some of the enthusiasm on wall street recently with the recent concerns coming from the u s treasury market as investors don t expect an interest rate hike from the fed anytime soon and indeed have been increasing their bets in the futures markets of a rate decrease the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury has fallen below that of the 3 month treasury advertisement advertisement this atypical pattern hasn t happened for the 3 month 10 year spread since 2007 and often precedes recessions but it s not a sure bet just because we re seeing an inversion doesn t necessarily mean we re headed into a recession recessions do happen as a natural part of the business cycle but an inversion doesn t mean one is imminent and investors did get some respite thursday as the yield on the 10 year treasury rose a bit even though it didn t pop above the 3 month yield the rise in the 10 year yield and the optimism about the trade situation seemed to outweigh the worries about the yield curve inversion and the dismal gdp data to help bring down wall street s main fear gauge lower the cboe volatility index vix fell below 14 5 markedly lower than its high near 18 earlier in the week because it s the last day of the quarter there may be some extra volatility heading into the close as investors and traders may make larger than normal trades to adjust their portfolios before the quarter closes screen shot 2019 03 28 at 8 08 59 pm png taking the shine off palladium

palladium from a tight supply picture data source cme group chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results advertisement advertisement how the mighty have fallen in the world of commodities you ve probably heard of oil gold soybeans and wheat but consider palladium the main use for the silvery white metal is in catalytic converters in the automobile industry it s also used in jewelry and electronics palladium has been on a tear recently with spot prices hitting a record above 1 600 an ounce amid expectations of increased demand because of stricter emissions standards and a potential ban on exports from russia but this week is a different story as investors seem to have decided to book some profits spot palladium lost more than 7 thursday to just over 1 340 after having fallen more than 6 wednesday in what had been its biggest daily percentage loss in more than two years reuters reported noting selling pressure came as economic concerns and a weak technical picture prompted profit taking pressure on the metal also comes after the head of a major mining company said the recent price

biotech m a deals announced this year are getting an average of a 111 premium to what they were trading at a weak prior to the deal announcement that s well over the 35 premium all m a deals are averaging year to date biotech companies and their drugs have grown in popularity as patient demand for their life saving therapies continues to rise and pricing power remains intact due to limited competition cfra said these companies have become quite attractive takeover targets as free cash flow has improved over the years and valuations contracted a tale of two sectors the stabilization and slightly higher move in the 10 year treasury yield thursday meant different things for different sectors financial stocks got some relief forming the second best performing spx sector of the day behind materials banks tend to do better when longer term interest rates are higher as they can charge more for loans on the other end of the spectrum the utilities sector slid 1 25 as the sector is

greyerz massive 14 000 gold revaluation may be only way out for u s as the world edges closer to the next crisis today the man who has become legendary for his predictions on qe and historic moves in currencies told king world news that the fed may revalue gold to 14 000 as a major warning signal flashes red major warning signal is flashing red march 31 king world news egon von greyerz one of the fed s three main objectives is to maintain stable prices but they have never achieved that at least not since 1971 again last week the fed did a volte face turnaround because they have a total inability to read the economy the clueless fed overslept and realized a few years too late that the us economy was overheating when the economy was turning down the fed started to increase rates and implement qt quantitative tightening but now they are panicking and reversing policy again i discussed the incompetence of the fed last week on kwn below is the fed s incompetence chart some people would use a sophisticated description like an inverted yield curve when the rate goes negative but that doesn t tell the real story the chart shows the 10 year us treasury minus the fed funds rate this spread has just gone negative which means that 10 year rates are lower than short term rates this is interpreted as a high probability that a recession is imminent looking at the chart since the late 1980s it went negative in 1989 before the early 1990s recession and again in 1998 and 2000 before the economic downturn and the 80 crash of the nasdaq it also went negative in 2006 just before the great financial crisis so long rates being lower than short rates is clearly a good indication of an economic downturn and a stock market crash what an inverted yield curve really tells us is the inability of the fed to forecast market turns the fed sets short term rates but they are always behind the curve since their model can never predict anything accurately so instead of the fed anticipating a downturn in the economy the market will do it for them the 10 year rate is set by the market which clearly senses the impending recession and thus buys the bonds and forces the long term rate down below the short term rates so the market knows before the fed that trouble is coming listen to the greatest egon von greyerz audio interview ever by clicking here or on the image below sponsored this proves that the fed s and other central banks manipulation of rates creates a false market which seriously distorts economic cycles if short term rates were determined by the market the chance of an inverted yield curve would be extremely small as short term rates would fall faster than long term rates when demand for money declines the graph is clear proof that central banks manipulation creates false markets as well as extreme economic peaks and troughs if the natural laws of supply and demand ruled the world economy would fare a lot better the reason why central banks dislike gold is that it reveals their total failure to achieve the objective of price and currency stability since the fed was created in 1913 the dollar has lost 98 5 in real terms vs gold and in this century the dollar has lost 79 there is really no need for central banks since their policies are always detrimental to the domestic and global economies if we look at two other central banks we will find that they also have totally failed in achieving their objectives we ensure that money retains its value this statement appears on the website of the world s oldest central bank you wonder how the bank could have the audacity to make such a statement in this century alone the country s currency has lost 80 in value and since 1971 the currency lost 99 obviously the fall in the currency is measured against gold which is the only money that has survived intact in history i am talking about sweden s central bank the riksbank which was created 351 years ago in 1668 this central bank has clearly failed totally to achieve its objectives just like every single central bank in history in the early 1600s silver and gold were in short supply in sweden due to the high cost of prolonged wars sweden then introduced copper coins in 1624 as an alternative to gold and silver also sweden wanted to maintain the price of copper as it was their biggest export one mine the falun mine dates back to 1288 and became stora kopparberg mining company in 1347 this is regarded as the world s oldest industrial company during the 17th century the company produced 2 3rd of europe s copper consumption and also financed sweden s wars in 1644 stora started producing big coins to keep the price of copper high the biggest was 62 cm or 2 foot long and weighed 20kg not really a practical coin to keep in your pocket especially since the value would have been 1 100th of a similar size silver coin sweden s first bank stockholm banco was founded in 1656 the bank issued credit notes or banknotes to replace the cumbersome copper coins sweden thus became the first country in europe to issue bank notes eventually the bank issued too many notes without any tangible backing and went bankrupt a very similar story to what john law did in france in the early 1700s creating a banking and currency collapse as well as the collapse of the mississippi company in the us this happened as the same time as the south sea bubble the swedish riksbank was founded from the ruins of stockholm banco in 1668 from the beginning swedish law stated that the riksbank was to maintain the domestic coinage at its right and fair value and today 331 years later the riksbank states we ensure that money retains its value so after over 300 years of history with the same core objective the bank has totally failed since losing over 99 of its value and that could hardly be called that money retains its value with negative interest rates since early 2015 how can the swedish krona retain its value gold in swedish kroner reveals it all it is now at an all time high the riksbank s policy is not price stability but currency debasement in order to promote exports this has led to massive inflation in asset prices with a major bubble in property values and also in stocks norway has no gold if we go to norway s central bank norges bank their primary objective is price stability by means of monetary policy and to keep inflation low and stable well anyone who goes to norway will find the country very expensive and also the property market is a massive bubble norway has no understanding of a stable currency and how can they since they no longer have any gold reserves well they actually hold 7 gold bars they sold the last 37 tonnes back in 2004 no wonder gold in norwegian kroner is at a record high against gold the norwegian krone has lost 80 since 2000 and 98 since 1971 is that what is called price stability when a currency has lost 80 in the last 18 years the readers of my writings all know what it means it means that the norwegian krone together with most currencies will lose at least 99 from here in the next few years but virtually no one in norway buys gold they follow the lead of their central bank and have zero investment in gold imagine the wealth destruction that the norwegians will experience in coming years they can just check with argentina or venezuela to see what will happen but they won t gold in both swedish and norwegian kroner is above the 2011 peak this is a very clear indication that gold will break the maginot line at around 1 350 when so many other currencies are above the 2011 highs the maginot line is guaranteed to break in the near term future central banks around the world have created the biggest bubble in history when this bubble bursts in the next few years they will have no tools to save the world they will try the only thing they know which is unlimited money printing and lowering rates but they will be surprised to find that this time it will have no effect and why should it since you can t solve a debt problem with more worthless debt fed to revalue gold to 14 000 clearly the fed and other central banks are aware of this this is why we could see an attempt by the fed to substantially devalue the dollar by say 90 and back it or tie it to gold and maybe also oil that would give gold a value of around 14 000 they could do this combined with special drawing rights or a new cryptodollar they will thus try to make the market believe that the new currency is the solution to the us debt problem but the effect of such a soft reset would be short lived first china and russia wouldn t accept it and they would also require the us to prove that they actually hold 8 000 tonnes of physical gold since the us doesn t have more than a fraction of that gold in physical form there will be panic in financial markets the new cryptodollar would crash leading to hyperinflation gold and silver would surge creating panic in the precious metals markets as it would be impossible to get hold of physical at virtually any price eventually we will see the start of the greatest financial crisis in history as i have outlined many times a currency crash and debt collapse is absolutely guaranteed it is only a question of when for those who would like to read more of egon von greyerz s fantastic articles click here kwn has now released the powerful audio

there are expectations that juxtaposed with other factors the slight reduction in the monetary policy rate by the central bank of nigeria may stimulate lending to the real sector which will in turn boost local production and translate to job creation report kunle aderinokun and james emejo it came like a thunderbolt to the markets last tuesday s announcement by the central bank of nigeria s cbn monetary policy committee mpc of a reduction in the monetary policy rate mpr by 50 basis points from 14 per cent to 13 5 per cent after keeping the benchmark unchanged for 33 months since june 2016 in announcing the decision cbn governor mr godwin emefiele at the end of a two day mpc meeting in abuja said the rate cut had become inevitable in order to boost economic growth essentially the mpr acts as the baseline for interest rate in the economy and goes to determine the cost of borrowing from commercial banks nigerians have for long craved for a loosening of monetary policy stance as high cost of borrowing appeared to slash returns on businesses and sometimes making it difficult for them to break even as well as discouraging entrepreneurship amid inflationary pressures some of the attendant implications were distortions in the real sector particularly manufacturing which is already overburdened by infrastructure challenges including power nevertheless the cbn had retained the cash reserve requirement crr at 22 5 per cent and liquidity ratio at 30 per cent the interest rate reduction was a decision which proved bookmakers wrong and caught the markets unawares nigerians were particularly anxious to know whether the rate cut finally symbolised an end to the tightening regime questions were being asked as to whether the interest rate slash which many had given up on was a sort of parting gift from the cbn governor whose initial five year tenure expires in june though subject to renewal many also expressed doubts about the impact the marginal drop in mpr would eventually have on the economy given that nigerians believe whatever goes up in the country price wise never comes down the surprising announcement also raised genuine concerns as to whether the commercial banks would sincerely adjust to the rate cut and allow nigerians feel the impact after such a long hurl at monetary easing but according to emefiele the rate cut does not necessarily indicate an end to the monetary tightening cycle even though banks would be expected to adjust to the loosening in mpr so that its positive impact could be felt by customers he also said the reduction in mpr had a reasonable correlation to lending to the real sectors of the economy giving further reasons for the committee s landmark resolution the cbn boss said with the mpr at 14 per cent since july 2016 and with the relative stability we have seen in the macroeconomic variables over the last two and a half years we just think that this should be the next phase where keeping our eyes on all other parameters let s see whether we can signal a direction from the monetary policy in the direction of supporting and really accelerating growth in the country accelerating growth effectively means that we have to push harder to consolidate gdp we need to push harder to make sure we create jobs doing this will naturally mean that we are softening gradually but i repeat and i shouldn t be misunderstood that we will continue to do what we are doing what we have done in the past keeping inflation at moderated levels and exchange rate stable we will continue to do so i think we are moving in the right direction emefiele said the slight interest rate reduction was meant to signal and what that meant is that all factors held constant what we were doing that macroeconomic remains strong we need to signal that there is a need for us to slightly not change move course a little further because while you are talking about a low inflation rate regime you are looking at a stable exchange rate regime strong reserves management naturally you will also expect that growth should be stronger and to do so means that we need to begin to look at money supply liquidity interest rate and issues like that to see that we push effectively towards growth expectedly there have been mixed interpretations by market leaders to the cbn s rate adjustment a professor of finance and capital market at the nasarawa state university keffi prof uche uwaleke described the move as the right response to inflation which had been on a decline in recent months the reduction in mpr by 50 basis points signals the cbn s desire to relax monetary policy to support economic growth obviously it is a right response to the declining inflationary pressure and the relative stability in exchange rate which have prevailed for quite some time moreover on the external front crude oil price has stabilised around 65 dollars per barrel while the us interest rate normalisation has slowed down all these must have combined to influence the mpc decision which is expected to increase the flow of credit to the real sector he told thisday according to him the reduced mpr will also be positive for the capital market as some of the increased liquidity that will ensue will flow into the equities market also it will be cheaper for the government to issue bonds given that part of this year s budget deficit will be financed through domestic borrowing he added but the chief executive officer financial derivatives company limited mr bismarck rewane said the decision by the mpc was for signalling purpose so it depends on whether the economic agents would react to the signal but i think this should have been done almost a year ago as a stimulant but we are where we are and they say it is better late than never also analysts at cardinalstone research raised specific questions about the motivation behind the mpc decision in their response to thisday enquiries the analysts noted the decision to change the mpr for the first time since july 2016 begs the following questions why now does this signal a decline in yields going forward will the pro growth decision yield dividend we believe that the committee s consideration for reducing the monetary policy rate was predicated on among others the relative attractiveness of emerging and frontier markets thanks to a dovish us fed stance interest rate normalisation in the united states in 2018 together with economic crisis experienced in some emerging nations led to portfolio flow reversals from frontier markets including nigeria this alongside heightened political concerns necessitated the cbn to hold its tight monetary stance despite initial hint of a potential loosening to attract retain foreign investors however in a complete reversal the us fed has disclosed a change in policy guidance from two rate hikes to none in 2019 owing to fears of an economic slowdown they added nevertheless that this reversal bodes well for frontier markets like nigeria as it makes a carry trade borrowing money from a lower interest rate environment to invest in a higher yielding one more attractive on his part fxtm s research analyst lukman otunuga opined that the move by the mpc would support growth according to him the central bank reduced interest rates from 14 per cent to 13 5 per cent as inflationary pressure eased and macroeconomic conditions stabilised during the first quarter of 2019 today s move by the cbn may open the doors to further rate cuts in the future especially if macroeconomic conditions continue to improve and inflation cools further in addition analysts at afrinvest research said though the mpc decision beat its forecast as it expected all policy rates to be held at constant levels nevertheless the cbn policy stance remained intact in view of current global happenings in our earlier pre mpc report we noted that we expected the mpc to hold all policy rates at current levels in next week s meeting although the case for monetary easing has become compelling however our expectations were off as the committee favoured a rate reduction they stated since the july 2016 tweak in mpr and the subsequent use of short term market rates to anchor monetary policy we have continuously expressed our views on the redundancy of the benchmark rate we think the mpc is moving back to convention and aligning policy rate to market rates currently the average short term discount rate settled at 12 7 per cent implying an average yield of 13 6 per cent which aligns with the new mpr at 13 5 per cent we are not distracted to believe an easing cycle has begun rather we think policy stance remains intact considering global interest rate development and the desperation to sustain and retain flows the cbn can always resort to omo to achieve the objective of attracting and retaining capital flows in addition credit to private sector is not expected to improve on the back of rate reduction as structural bottlenecks and the elevated business risk environment remain drags to credit creation price pressures on the other hand should also not deteriorate as it has been consistently proven that nigeria s inflation is largely cost push nonetheless analysts at vetiva research described the decision of the cbn as hasty pointing out that it was touted as a key measure to stimulate the economy by reducing the cost of borrowing whilst the decision will have an immediate impact on borrowing rates already benchmarked to the mpr we are skeptical of a significant passthrough to the real sector as bank lending rates are notoriously sticky going down also the decision seemingly ignores the looming risks to inflation an expected increase in liquidity from the frontloading of a late 2019 budget an increasingly likely review of the multi year tariff order myto which has an impact on electricity prices and most importantly a looming 67 per cent increase in national minimum wage all of which are likely to push inflation north for the rest of the year they posited notably the cbn had previously been vocal about their concerns on the impact of the minimum wage increase on inflation this change in direction could possibly be a signal that the committee now projects a milder impact on inflation than initially feared that said our view is that this decision is a hasty reaction to a short term positivity in economic indicators one which could exert pressure on price levels in the near term on her part the managing director chief economist africa and middle east standard chartered bank razia khan said the mpc decision raises important questions about the government s broader reform intent first the mpr cut comes following senate approval of a sizeable minimum wage increase second what does it suggest about the likelihood of an imminent vat hike or fuel price deregulation both are pressing much needed reforms but the cbn s rate cut today appears to suggest that these reforms which may both exert upward pressure on the price level in the short term may not necessarily be imminent this would be disappointing especially for investors hoping for stronger reform impetus post election third with the crr a much more important determinant of the policy stance of the cbn still unchanged it is not clear that a modest policy rate cut on its own will do very much to boost bank lending

whether it be the manufacture of more stuff or the greener production of better stuff has to happen in the real economy and that money simply facilitates buying selling saving and investing as j laurence laughlin first chair of economics at the university of chicago wrote in 1895 money no matter how valuable is not wanted for itself it is only a means to an end like a bridge over a river no one laughlin continued could really believe that adding silver to the money in circulation would produce bushels of wheat and bushels of corn and barrels of mess pork only mine owners and their investors would gain by its being minted mmters and silverites in contrast emphasize the work left undone factories shut children and the elderly not cared for solar panels not made and installed etc because there is too little money in circulation mmt s proposed mechanism for adding money to the economy is hardly that of the free silver movement but the two fundamentally agree that money is a political phenomenon a creature of the state in the words of abba lerner s 1947 paper populists in the 1890s campaigned against the 1873 law that demonetized silver mmters today against the rhetoric of deficits and mandates for pay as you go budgeting that have been central to american politics since the reagan revolution mmt crucially claims that a monetary sovereign cannot go broke in its own money it can always issue more we should therefore think of public deficits not as bills to be paid but as indicators of how much we as a nation care about particular issues since money exists for wars and walls they say it can just as readily be found for high speed trains and clean power energy if the sovereign uses its money issuing power unwisely if more exists in the system than there is work to be done or goods to be bought then prices for everything could rise should there be high inflation the government should spend less and tax the excess money back into its coffers mmt in other words does recognize that deficit spending could become problematic but not for the reasons usually given a country like the united states a public entity that is sovereign does not age or plan to retire and is imagined as existing indefinitely into the future is not a household that needs to balance its budget using examples from personal finance to explain public spending may give a homey touch to political campaigns but they are fundamentally misleading in the way it links monetary policy fiscal policy and social policy the jobs guarantee and something like a green new deal are not things to be paid for via mmt but are part of it mmt rejoins the enlightenment tradition of political social economy adam smith remember was not an economist the word was barely used in the eighteenth century but professor of moral philosophy and an opponent of many of the developments growth of corporations laissez faire capitalism the exploitation of workers for which he is now imagined to stand as gareth stedman jones and others have shown the selective reading of smith as father of capitalism was an interpretation formed in reaction to the social radicalism of the french revolution so too did political context play a significant role when economics became a distinct and then increasingly model based social science some 120 years ago with the strikes and labor unrest of the 1880s and the populist movement of the 1890s economists who spoke in favor of unions or about the plight of workers under monopoly capitalism either found themselves out of a job or re appointed to social or political science departments there is a long institutional history then to mmters self positioning as underdogs and voices in the wilderness while mmt economists stephanie kelton pavlina tcherneva randall wray warren mosler and bill mitchell are five big names to know quarrel with their fellow post keynesians over models and implications historians need to reclaim money as something to be studied in specific social and political contexts historians know what all financial advisors profess to recognize past returns are no guarantee of future results in fact however the entire field of economics with its assumptions about trend lines models and transhistorical facts such as milton friedman s assertion that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon has largely failed to internalize this salient and important truth the historian andrew dickson white first president both of cornell university and of the american historical association made himself part of the 1890s debate with his fiat money inflation in france how it came what it brought and how it went 1896 an earlier version entitled paper money inflation in france had appeared in 1876 when the greenback party named for the paper money issued by the united states to fund and win the civil war was at its peak in both pamphlets white used the example of the french revolution s paper money the assignats to argue against increases to the money supply and for fighting a financial crisis in an honest and manly way by changing the first word in his title and adding material borrowed from macauley s history of england about seventeenth century coinage debasements white expanded his target to include all fiat currencies all money created by government order re issued in 1914 1933 and 1945 by various publishers and in 1980 by the cato institute white s pamphlet remains widely available today this is a record of impact and influence few historians can match but i do not suggest it is a model we should follow couched in a vocabulary of natural laws at one point white describes issuing paper money as equivalent to opening dikes in the netherlands elsewhere he compares it to corrosive poison and cheap alcohol fiat money inflation in france appealed to partisans of the gold standard because it seemed to show fiat money s inevitable outcomes but nothing in history is inevitable even if some things are far more likely than others and the eventual failure of the assignats owed as much to the specific politics of the revolution as to any timeless laws of economics mmt along with the euro crisis and awareness of austerity s social effects has done much to open monetary and fiscal debates to wider audiences simply recognizing that money is political and historical central as harvard law professor christine desan likes to say to how a polity constitutes itself is a difficult breakthrough for most people on the other hand seeing money in this way doesn t in a fractured polity characterized by demagoguery and high levels of inequality make policy any easier to write or implement

laurence laughlin first chair of economics at the university of chicago wrote in 1895 money no matter how valuable is not wanted for itself it is only a means to an end like a bridge over a river no one laughlin continued could really believe that adding silver to the money in circulation would produce bushels of wheat and bushels of corn and barrels of mess pork only mine owners and their investors would gain by its being minted mmters and silverites in contrast emphasize the work left undone factories shut children and the elderly not cared for solar panels not made and installed etc because there is too little money in circulation mmt s proposed mechanism for adding money to the economy is hardly that of the free silver movement but the two fundamentally agree that money is a political phenomenon a creature of the state in the words of abba lerner s 1947 paper populists in the 1890s campaigned against the 1873 law that demonetized silver mmters today against the rhetoric of deficits and mandates for pay as you go budgeting that have been central to american politics since the reagan revolution mmt crucially claims that a monetary sovereign cannot go broke in its own money it can always issue more we should therefore think of public deficits not as bills to be paid but as indicators of how much we as a nation care about particular issues since money exists for wars and walls they say it can just as readily be found for high speed trains and clean power energy if the sovereign uses its money issuing power unwisely if more exists in the system than there is work to be done or goods to be bought then prices for everything could rise should there be high inflation the government should spend less and tax the excess money back into its coffers mmt in other words does recognize that deficit spending could become problematic but not for the reasons usually given a country like the united states a public entity that is sovereign does not age or plan to retire and is imagined as existing indefinitely into the future is not a household that needs to balance its budget using examples from personal finance to explain public spending may give a homey touch to political campaigns but they are fundamentally misleading in the way it links monetary policy fiscal policy and social policy the jobs guarantee and something like a green new deal are not things to be paid for via mmt but are part of it mmt rejoins the enlightenment tradition of political social economy adam smith remember was not an economist the word was barely used in the eighteenth century but professor of moral philosophy and an opponent of many of the developments growth of corporations laissez faire capitalism the exploitation of workers for which he is now imagined to stand as gareth stedman jones and others have shown the selective reading of smith as father of capitalism was an interpretation formed in reaction to the social radicalism of the french revolution so too did political context play a significant role when economics became a distinct and then increasingly model based social science some 120 years ago with the strikes and labor unrest of the 1880s and the populist movement of the 1890s economists who spoke in favor of unions or about the plight of workers under monopoly capitalism either found themselves out of a job or re appointed to social or political science departments there is a long institutional history then to mmters self positioning as underdogs and voices in the wilderness while mmt economists stephanie kelton pavlina tcherneva randall wray warren mosler and bill mitchell are five big names to know quarrel with their fellow post keynesians over models and implications historians need to reclaim money as something to be studied in specific social and political contexts historians know what all financial advisors profess to recognize past returns are no guarantee of future results in fact however the entire field of economics with its assumptions about trend lines models and transhistorical facts such as milton friedman s assertion that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon has largely failed to internalize this salient and important truth the historian andrew dickson white first president both of cornell university and of the american historical association made himself part of the 1890s debate with his fiat money inflation in france how it came what it brought and how it went 1896 an earlier version entitled paper money inflation in france had appeared in 1876 when the greenback party named for the paper money issued by the united states to fund and win the civil war was at its peak in both pamphlets white used the example of the french revolution s paper money the assignats to argue against increases to the money supply and for fighting a financial crisis in an honest and manly way by changing the first word in his title and adding material borrowed from macauley s history of england about seventeenth century coinage debasements white expanded his target to include all fiat currencies all money created by government order re issued in 1914 1933 and 1945 by various publishers and in 1980 by the cato institute white s pamphlet remains widely available today this is a record of impact and influence few historians can match but i do not suggest it is a model we should follow couched in a vocabulary of natural laws at one point white describes issuing paper money as equivalent to opening dikes in the netherlands elsewhere he compares it to corrosive poison and cheap alcohol fiat money inflation in france appealed to partisans of the gold standard because it seemed to show fiat money s inevitable outcomes but nothing in history is inevitable even if some things are far more likely than others and the eventual failure of the assignats owed as much to the specific politics of the revolution as to any timeless laws of economics mmt along with the euro crisis and awareness of austerity s social effects has done much to open monetary and fiscal debates to wider audiences simply recognizing that money is political and historical central as harvard law professor christine desan likes to say to how a polity constitutes itself is a difficult breakthrough for most people on the other hand seeing money in this way doesn t in a fractured polity characterized by demagoguery and high levels of inequality make policy any easier to write or implement
last year the philippine government expected gross domestic product gdp growth to reach a level between 7 and 8 percent this year but since no one in the financial markets has bought into this forecast it does not hit the stock market nor the philippine peso when the dream doesn t materialize on the contrary my expectation is that international investors will very well consider it positive that the general expectation for the gdp growth this year is only reduced marginally from around 6 6 percent to 6 4 or 6 5 percent advertisement selldown in the course of 2018 both emerging markets equities and bonds were generally sold down suffering from the tighter american monetary policy and increasing nervousness about global economic growth when the tide in the financial markets turns the philippines is one of the countries i use for the litmus test i consider the philippines an a country which means that in the long term the country belongs to the most interesting investment destinations my assessment of emerging markets for more than 12 months has been that us interest rate increases and the us monetary tightening in general would hit quite hard during 2018 it remains my continued expectation that the culmination of uncertainty during this first quarter of 2019 because the very large emerging market economies could be hit by further uncertainty brazil faces major political and macroeconomic changes and the indian government is tightening its control of the central bank which is a very risky path to follow despite the recovery in the chinese stock market in january it s my opinion that the financial markets haven t priced in the possibility that the chinese gdp growth will drop to 6 percent faster than investors can imagine advertisement further i expected last year that the american central bank fed would keep the hawkish tone concerning rate hikes throughout 2019 but the head of the us central bank jerome powell softened his hawkish view after president trump aired the idea of sacking powell the whole financial market felt some relief and surely also in emerging markets countries however i still expect more jitters to come from brazil india and china therefore i maintain my primary scenario that several markets would have explored higher volatility during this quarter this of course has an importance in the judgment of the right timing to increase the exposure in emerging markets like the philippines which in my view is a first choice due to the a status changed outlook the changed interest rate outlook for the united states makes me argue for a two step increase of the allocation to emerging market equities and bonds a first fast allocation move followed by a second round within a couple of months when fundamentals confirm a brighter emerging markets outlook though i do not consider the philippine stock market a bargain or cheap but it s rarely the case in high growth economies in the decision process i pay a lot of attention to growth in the domestic demand and it must remain strong for the litmus test to give an indication of increasing investments in the philippine stock market again globally and in the philippines the inflation is on the way down though domestic actions like the introduction of the rice tariffication bill which will hopefully help lower inflation below 4 percent undoubtedly it will support the consumer confidence that plummeted in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the survey among consumers i noticed that the expectations for the future were at the lowest point for many years the country was hit by a number of natural disasters in the third quarter which has understandably played a role but very fundamental conditions such as concerns about future household income and a less positive labor market are the major causes for the low confidence according to the survey the higher reading in the last consumer confidence will support the investment case in the philippines though that the gdp growth remains at a very high level this year also plays a big role in the consideration however i remain with my opinion that more public investments in it infrastructure will optimize the return on public investments in the long term positive effect concerning the classical public investments in construction work then some are still in the project phase and probably start next year which postpones the positive effect for the labor market until the coming year this contributes to the expectation that the gdp growth will also remain high in 2020 a concern is that philippine export companies can feel some headwind in a global economy which cools down confirming the reason for my focus on domestic growth and demand how the domestic demand in the philippines develops is another big issue when making the final investment decisions when we work with our global conviction model in my firm we include megatrends as well the strongest megatrend in my view is that another 1 5 billion people in emerging market countries during the next decade will move out of poverty and up into the lower middle class or middle class measured on household income i pay attention to observing this pattern in the philippines as it might result in some frustration among current middle class household incomes that could explore a static income development the key is however that many other households are still moving up toward a middle class income and therefore all in all the overall economy is still progressing at a macroeconomic level as mentioned there are a number of reasons why the overall progress continues for the philippine economy our allocation work has been moved forward due to the changed guidance from fed your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up but based on the fundamental factors in the philippine economy i expect the litmus test to show that foreign investors should again increase their investments in the philippines contributed
great powers says the nobel laureate economist robert mundell have great currencies so where is china s in the years following the great financial crisis things seemed to be looking up for the renminbi by the middle of 2015 almost 30 percent of china s trade was being settled in renminbi hong kong banks were holding some rmb 1 trillion worth of yuan denominated deposits and there was life in the dim sum bond market with issuance running close to 10 billion per month 2015 was also the year the international monetary fund imf announced that the renminbi would become one of currencies that underpin its own reserve asset the special drawing rights or sdr almost by definition this step seemed to confer on the renminbi something like the status of a global reserve currency so the renminbi seemed to most observers to be firmly on a path towards real international relevance in the past three years though grounds for optimism about the renminbi s global role have proved to be decidedly fragile these days the share of china s trade that is settled in renminbi is less than half of what it was in 2015 the stock of yuan denominated deposits has fallen to just over rmb 600 billion and dim sum bond issuance late last year was down to 1 billion per month it turns out that all the enthusiasm back then about the renminbi s future was guilty of what philosophers call a category mistake what most people saw as evidence of the renminbi s internationalization was in fact simply evidence of something else an accumulation of speculative positions built on the expectation that renminbi was going to rise in value as the renminbi weakened after mid 2015 so too did the market s willingness to own it and use it that s hardly the mark of a global reserve currency international investors want to own dollars or euros for example not just because they expect these currencies to strengthen but because they offer legal security ease of use and critically unrestricted convertibility into any other currency and it is questions surrounding the renminbi s full convertibility that are likely to stunt its growth as a global currency for the foreseeable future it just happens to be a fact of life about the current international monetary system that the definition of a reserve currency implies a fully convertible one the problem is that recent years have seen the chinese government pivot away from the idea that the renminbi should be a fully convertible currency back in 2012 the political report delivered at the eighteenth party congress included a goal to gradually realize capital account convertibility by 2017 though officials had decided to drop any reference to capital account opening in the report to the nineteenth party congress this change of heart was captured neatly in 2015 by the then people s bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan who claimed that the capital account convertibility that china is seeking to achieve is not based on the traditional concept of being fully or freely convertible instead he said china would adopt a concept of managed convertibility what managed convertibility means above all is that the chinese authorities assert a right to use their discretion to make decisions about which kind of inflows and outflows are good and which are bad this assertion of the competence of policymakers seems to fit right in with what most people understand as a revival of the party state under president xi and the use of this discretion was on full display in late 2016 and early 2017 when chinese authorities imposed heavy restrictions on the outflow of capital from china if anything it seems that chinese policymakers seem more interested in the internationalization of the renminbi than they are in its liberalization but in the international monetary system we re saddled with it s the latter that counts and the effort that chinese regulators have recently made to open up china s securities markets won t do much to change things even if the inclusion of chinese bonds in the three main global indices belonging to bloomberg barclays jp morgan and ftse russell brings in a few hundred billion dollars worth of portfolio inflows over the next couple of years this doesn t have any real bearing on the renminbi s future as a global reserve currency after all foreigners own some 40 percent of the indonesian government s rupiah denominated debt and no one would claim that the rupiah is on course for any global significance the good news in the end is that there is no law of nature that requires a reserve currency to be a fully convertible one it simply depends on convention or the norms that happen to prevail at a particular time the bretton woods international monetary system that was set up at the end of the second world war for example had capital controls at its very center the u k had capital controls until 1979 and it wasn t until 1989 that france finally lifted the restrictions on its citizens ability to open bank accounts abroad incidentally it was a remnant of the bretton woods system that helped to build the case for the renminbi s inclusion into the imf s sdr basket a few years ago the imf s carefully phrased criterion for a currency to become part of the sdr basket was that it should be freely usable which is certainly not the same thing as fully convertible we know that s true because the imf first adopted the term freely usable back in 1978 when plenty of big countries still had bretton woods era controls in place what all this means is that it might be possible one day for china to have its cake and eat it in other words for the renminbi to be a truly global currency and yet for china to retain a discretionary approach to managing the capital account but it will probably take a bretton woods like renegotiation of the international monetary system to get there don t hold your breath in any case history strongly advises patience when it comes to the emergence of new super currencies the united states overtook great britain as the world s largest economy sometime around the mid 1850s and though the dollar did start to become a grown up global funding currency after the first world war it is worth remembering that even as late as 1947 sterling accounted for 87 of global foreign exchange reserves currency power in other words has a strong sense of inertia even when transferring from one english speaking liberal western country to another none of this is to say that international use of the renminbi won t rise in the future it almost certainly will and especially in asia where trade integration with china has already increased the co movement between the region s currencies and the renminbi the greater that co movement becomes the more likely it is that the renminbi becomes the natural vehicle for trade settlement but it also seems quite likely that china will remain attached to its preference for discretion in management of the capital account over the rule that pretty much allows everyone to do everything with a reserve currency as long as that is the case we will have to keep waiting for the emergence of china s great currency david lubin is a managing director and head of emerging markets economics at citi research he is an associate fellow at chatham house the royal institute of international

lambert here short capitalism but how by eric holthaus a meteorologist and columnist for grist covering climate science policy and solutions he has previously written for the wall street journal slate and a variety of other publications originally published at grist climate change was already worrying enough now a report from the u s central bank cautions that rising temperatures and extreme storms could eventually trigger a financial collapse a federal reserve researcher warned in a report on monday that climate based risk could threaten the stability of the financial system as a whole but possible fixes using the fed s buying power to green the economy are currently against the law glenn rudebusch the san francisco fed s executive vice president for research ranks climate change as one of the three key forces transforming the economy along with an aging population and rapid advances in technology climate change could soon hit the banking system by storms droughts wildfires and other extreme events making it harder for businesses to repay loans rudebusch warns that crops and inundated cities have already started to hurt the economy economists view these losses as the result of a fundamental market failure carbon fuel prices do not properly account for climate change costs he writes businesses and households that produce greenhouse gas emissions say by driving cars or generating electricity do not pay for the losses and damage caused by that pollution a hefty carbon tax alone wouldn t be enough to fix the problem what he calls an intergenerational and international market failure since congress has yet to take sufficient action rudebusch says that the fed could in theory take matters into its own hands by encouraging a shift away from fossil fuels the problem is the fed s only official job is to keep inflation tame and unemployment low and its tools are limited to buying and selling government debt to tweak interest rates that means it can t help companies make a shift to a low carbon economy by for instance lending them money in the bond market by contrast the european central bank has been buying green bonds since 2016 an ecb research note last july found that those purchases have helped boost the market for these kind of investments helping spur environmental improvements along with a report last week from the insurance industry saying that climate change could eventually make insurance unaffordable for most people rudebusch s report is part of a growing body of evidence that climate change poses an existential threat to the world economy as it currently exists last month fed chairman jerome powell told legislators that asking why the fed doesn t currently consider the risks of climate change was a fair question
getty the stock market held firm last week even though some of the economic data was weaker than expected the final reading for 2018 s q4 gdp came in as expected at 2 2 on thursday while the trump administration is looking for a 3 gdp in 2019 the growth is not currently that strong for example the atlanta federal reserve s gdpnow tool forecasts economic growth of only 1 7 for the first quarter the declining yields in the global bond market seemed to also warn of a weak economy however the bond market was ignored by the major averages which recorded solid gains for the week the dow jones transportation average was the strongest up 3 54 it was followed by a solid gain of 2 25 in the small cap russell 2000 both of these averages still ended lower for the month both averages have recorded solid gains for the quarter and have done better than the 13 1 q1 gain for the s p 500 for the month the spyder trust spy was up just 1 8 but that was the third higher monthly close in a row there is monthly chart resistance line a now at 298 04 the monthly s p 500 advance decline line made a significant new high in march during the entire bull market it has only been below its wma in early 2016 point b during the sharp decline last fall it was the positive action of the monthly a d line that kept me positive on the major trend the monthly a d line declined towards the rising wma in december but has been positive since march of 2016 the daily trend analysis was neutral a week ago but then turned bullish with tuesday s close which was a reason to do new buying this was the top q1 performance since 1998 when the spy closed up 12 so what happened next in 1998 on the weekly chart of the nyse composite i have noted the march 1998 close vertical line a the nyse continued to move higher until july as it gained another 5 before the russian ruble crisis hit the markets in late july the weekly nyse a d line dropped below its wma in the middle of may and only rallied back to its declining wma as the nyse was making its new high the significant negative divergence line c sent a strong warning that the market was topping out in my course on a d line analysis i point out that the daily nyse a d line dropped below its wma two days after the july high before the market s 30 decline was over hedge fund long term capital management needed a 3 6 billion bailout though there is no reason to expect history to be repeated now the 1998 experience does warn investors not to become complacent for the month the top three sectors were real estate technology and consumer staples in last monday s top sector spotlight i focused on the consumer staples sector xlp of course within any sector you can look at the individual industry groups in the sector such as the dow jones us food products djusfp as well as stocks the stock i liked was hormel food hrl which was up 2 8 last week the relatively weak economic data last week did not help the decline in yields as the 10 year t note hit a low yield of 2 356 last week which was below the weekly and daily starc bands there is next support from late 2017 in the 2 300 area the daily chart shows that yields bounced at the end of the week the 20 day ema is still declining sharply at 2 529 and shows no signs yet of a bottom the daily macd and macd his are both negative and declining with no signs yet of a weekly bottom this week we have the monthly jobs report on friday which is preceded by the ism manufacturing report on monday and the ism non manufacturing index on wednesday clearly the focus will be on the jobs report as after the very weak report last month many are expecting revisions in this week s report last friday s release of the core personal consumption expenditure price index showed an annual increase of 1 8 the is the federal reserve s favorite inflation gauge and the annual rate is a sign that inflation is still currently quite low and does not support new rate hikes it also certainly does not support the 0 5 rate cut urged by white house economic advisor larry kudlow however the inflation rate could increase in the coming months as may crude oil was up 4 4 in march the weekly chart shows that a doji buy signal was triggered the first week in january see arrow there is next resistance in the 62 63 area the weekly technical studies like the on balance volume turned positive in january and the obv is stronger than prices the obv is already close to the october 2018 highs line a when crude was above 75 the herrick payoff index hpi formed a short term bottom in december and then moved above its wma confirming a new uptrend in last week s post i pointed out the weekly and daily divergences in three of the key advance decline lines which in my view warranted a cautious strategy by traders these warning signs were reversed by last tuesday s close which means the next significant move is now going to be higher not lower still one needs to be selective as some sectors like the financials are performing much weaker than the s p 500 currently there are more stocks that are just coming out of their trading ranges and therefore offer better risk buying opportunities those who followed the four week dollar cost averaging plan i recommended before christmas are still 75 long at an average price of 2497 based on the s p 500 on february 25 25 of the position was sold when the s p 500 moved above 2805 as a stop on the position sell the remaining position if the s p 500 has a weekly close below 2597 which is quarter 1 s qpivot in my viper etf report and the viper hot stocks report i

turkey s 2019 local elections will take place on sunday 31st of march 2019 more than 2500 mayors and 20 500 municipal councillors will be elected throughout turkey s 81 provinces the elections have been overshadowed by the economy following last summer s turbulence of the turkish lira this had in some part been due to the brazen imposition of us tariffs and last minute subversive financial speculation and international interventions seeking according to the president of turkey to destabilise the economy ahead of the elections the both overt and clandestine attacks on the muslim ak party are nothing new either on the part of the middle eastern despots who openly supported the plotters or the western nations who hosted them what may be more sinister is whether the turkish economy is actually suffering to the extent alleged by the ak party s internal opponents scrambling for alliances with pocket sized secularist parties or indeed western media corporations whilst flustered journalists and politicians try to blight the turkish voter from the ak party s 19 year transformative and revolutionary contribution on top of the scrambles left by the kemalists of old below are the facts to set the record straight whilst in 2018 the turkish economy experienced sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate of its lira against the us dollar in the same year it achieved the largest economic growth in the world accounting to some 7 the plethora of headlines in 2018 2019 surrounding turkey s economy have focused on inflation economic devaluation and rising prices in the same year the turkish economy has managed to maintain rapid growth rising wages and a declining foreign trade deficit during 2018 inflation reached 25 24 an all but expected outcome to the us s doubling of tariffs on some of turkey s largest exports deliberately accelerating the fall of the currency of its nato ally by the end of the year turkey had salvaged its inflation to 20 3 reshaping itself to exhibit lesser dependence on the temperamental us administration prone to political outbursts by the end of the financial year it was down to 19 5 turkish finance minister berat al bayrak has indicated that he expects inflation to continue falling to as little as 10 in september in 2018 the prices of commodities increased by an average of 16 33 whilst the price of domestic production rose by 27 01 and whilst unemployment rose to 11 this was only up 0 1 from 2017 in its most turbulent and targeted year holding the unemployed at 3 537 000 but rather than sit on its hands the government swiftly rolled out points of sale run by metropolitan municipalities offering the most vital commodities such as fresh produce although scorned at by the ak party s opponents as creating a nation of queues a rich critique from the tiny iyi party whose creative economic rescue plan includes kicking out vulnerable syrian refugees the stalls challenged merchants and large businesses attempting to profiteer from the transient price hike and were acclaimed by the general public particularly the poorest of turkey in what may indicate increasing economic independence turkish foreign exports reached a record high of 168 1 billion in 2018 up 7 1 compared to 2017 according to turkish trade minister rohasar bekjan who also said that imports declined to 223 1 billion equivalent to 4 6 turkey entered the year 2019 by raising the minimum wage by 26 equivalent to 2020 liras around 381 per month after a similar increase in 2018 by 14 in the past two months turkey managed to cut financing and foreign trade deficits by 10 8 billion while central bank governor mourad chiten kaya said the bank s total reserves increased by 4 3 billion in the last week of march to 96 7 billion in addition to this the value of turkish foreign investment reached 6 5 billion last year according to its central bank the lira saga last week the turkish lira fell again against the dollar touching 5 8 turkish liras to the dollar on friday 22nd of march 2019 and rebounding last tuesday recovering most of its losses turkish experts are almost conclusive that what is dubbed the economic crisis in their nation is more due to political tensions and palpable external threats directly aimed at turkey rather than its economic performance the drop in the turkish lira coinciding with increasing tensions with washington over several issues was a testimony to this this is notwithstanding the declining turkish us relations over the former s russian s 400 missile deal technology its nato ally sees turkey not worthy of the detention and trial of american pastor andrew brunson and donald trump s recognition of israel s annexation of the syrian golan heights in the past year turkey s economy has faced challenges rarely seen in recent years the problems it suffered in the 1990s were due to the fragility of its very structure the recent challenges however cannot but be dwarfed by its remarkable growth of some 133 in the last 16 years or since the ak party came to power alongside an average annual growth rate of 5 7 so it is not a question of whether turkey has a viable alternative to the ak party as its opposition would like us to believe nor is it that it has done everything perfectly it is that this party has really transformed a nation marred by corruption military rule and pitiful

investors have worked themselves into a lather equities crashed in q4 last year amid on corporate earnings and concerns about growth the fed s tightening decision in december was made unanimously the above trend growth the preferred inflation measure was near target unemployment was the lowest in a generation and real rates were historically low there are myths in the market like the plunge protection committee or that the fed targets the core rate of inflation one such myth that some fed officials have helped to perpetuate is that the central bank is a murderer that it kills expansions it may have been true but it has reformed indeed it was the federal reserve under paul volcker a market favorite that last murdered an expansion the last three business cycle downturns were preceded by a financial crisis and were not caused by too tight of fed policy think about it the s l crisis the tech bubble and the great financial crisis which one did the fed tightening spur that is another myth the fed has helped to perpetuate it often refers to its dual mandate others do too full employment and price stability but the truth of the matter is the there is a third mandate and the fact that it is often left out is revealing affirmation through negation it is financial stability ii market fundamentalism is as dangerous as all fundamentalisms it is both an exaggeration and simplification it exaggerates the market s function as the greatest aggregator of information it oversimplifies ignoring other relevant factors and often assumes what it has to prove namely that the market is always right while nearly constant incremental movements are the norm it is prone to lurches overshoot and reversals what is the yield curve telling us what is the bond market telling us these are the question economists investors and policymakers are asking many market fundamentals know the answer the precipitous fall interest rates and inversion of the yield curve reflect investors anticipating a recession q e d yet the situation is considerably more complicated right alongside the fair value model we have in our heads or on the spreadsheet needs to be another model albeit perhaps less formal it would include the myriad of factors that are not about a macroeconomic assessment when it comes to us yield this means it is not just asset managers but also the us treasury debt managers who determine the precise issuance it would include the attractiveness of us yields regardless of one s view of the economy given that nearly a fifth of all bonds has a negative yield which is more than 10 trillion narratives focus almost exclusively on investors and much of the media coverage of the markets make it seem as if hedge funds and other risk takers are the market what about hedgers and passive investors who are forced into action by other developments the mortgage holder faces early pre payment risk due to the decline in interest rates may be forced to hedge it may be like an echo chamber where the echo produces its own echo previously the conventional wisdom was that central banks bond buying drove down yields and dampened volatility now on a net basis central bank buying has ceased and yields have plunged the unwinding of the fed s balance sheet some suggested would push up interest rates since the fed s balance sheet operations reached terminal velocity the 10 year yields have dropped around 85 bp no one would buy italian bonds once the ecb stopped we were told by top economists and op ed writers and yet the 10 year btp yield has fallen nearly as much as us yield over the past six months as the ecb tapered and then ceased buying altogether in the six months before while the ecb was buying the yield had risen by more than twice that iii market fundamentalism also leads to exaggerating the economic weakness the data is read through market prices and modernity appears to have exorcized any discussion of value as a philosophic demon and its fanciful language that coverup for personal desires passions and moralizing the gap between the 1 5 rate cuts the market is discounting this year for the federal reserve stands in stark contrast to not only fed s forecasts dot plot but also the fomc statement which is its primary communication tool that gap needs to be closed federal reserve speakers including the perceived doves like bullard and kashkari are already using their speaking opportunities to emphasize the underlying strength of the us economy and the neutral stance of the central bank market fundamentalists often make their claims almost an article of faith let s treat our ideas as hypotheses our hypothesis many participants are exaggerating the economic weakness and that next week s us economic data will help underpin the fed s message that a rate cut is not warranted specifically the january surge in us retail sales was not the capitulation of american shoppers consumption likely like grew further even if at a more moderate pace auto sales likely firmed after declining in january and february most important the 20k rise in february non farm payrolls was a fluke it will not be repeated it is more likely that the march jobs growth snaps back toward trend the six and 12 month averages are 200k 10k hourly earnings growth should remain near cyclical highs and the work week may have expanded which given the size of the workforce swamps the month to month net change in employment the atlanta fed s gdp tracker for q1 began march below 0 5 and finished the month at 1 7 the new york fed s model is at 1 3 after stating the month less than 0 9 the median forecast of the bloomberg survey is smack between the two at 1 5 iv we see preliminary signs that the chinese economy may have also found a base even if it is not evident in the pmi reports the household and corporate tax cuts that begin now and other stimulus measures suggest it will be forthcoming shortly we put emphasis on xi s political will and interest to avoid an economic weakness in this the 70thanniversary of the revolution which would give the us an advantage in negotiations speculation that china will get more serious about the trade negotiations now the mueller investigation is complete appears far from the mark the media has delivered a steady stream largely repetitive stories quoting senior us officials talking about the progress that is being made we have been led to believe that the main problem is in enforcement because the us rejects the currently preferred use of independent panels the trump administration sees what previously had propagated as the rule of law as a sinister erosion of us sovereignty it wants to reserve the right to unilaterally respond commensurately with the hard if no timely resolution of a conflict is found europe s economy may also be finding a base the current slowdown centered in the core and especially germany yes italy contracted in h2 18 even in the best of times it did has not grown quickly since 2011 the italian economy has experienced only three quarters in which growth exceeded 0 4 the more immediate problem is germany and the corner appears to have been turned last week the german ifo survey surprised on the upside and seemed to contradict the dismal flash pmi the february unemployment rate slipped to 4 9 the lowest since unification economists had cautioned that the jump in january retail sales stole from future sales and the median forecast in the bloomberg survey was for a 1 0 decline in february instead they rose 0 9 and the january gain was revised down from 3 3 to a still heady 2 8 the two month gain matches the strongest in five years which itself was the best since mid 2011 more evidence is that the european locomotive is getting back on track is likely in the coming days when germany reports february factory orders and industrial production figures both should recover from the steep slide in january 2 6 and 0 8 respectively modest gains are expected suggesting the recovery is gradual the recovery is not even and spring may come to france later

a decade ago so keep that in mind before you take to twitter to vent about stephen harper s austerity or justin trudeau s taxing of the rich still the good times rolled a little slower last year that s partly because the housing bubbles in toronto and vancouver started to deflate but it s also because a group of wealth creators on which the country has relied since the great recession had a tough time in 2018 statistics canada diced household wealth into five income segments it also divided the aggregate data into five regions there wasn t a lot of change in distribution nationally the richest 20 per cent of households controlled about 49 per cent of total wealth roughly the same as 2010 one shift stood out however inequality and fragile growth may be two sides of the same coin in the prairie provinces the richest quintile s share of total household net worth in alberta saskatchewan and manitoba dropped to about 56 per cent compared with about 57 per cent in 2017 and almost 64 per cent in 2015 the share of prairie wealth held by the four poorer groups increased by about two percentage points each compared with three years earlier so far it s the richest who have absorbed the

often but the central theme of its economic policy is narrowing income inequality just like jean chrétien s and paul martin s quest to eliminate the deficit and stephen harper s attack on excessively high corporate taxes there are good economic reasons to focus on inequality unfortunately the tendency of trudeau and his ministers to justify everything they do as necessary to help the middle class has made it difficult for thinking people to take them seriously team trudeau always looks like it s shopping for votes even when it might not be some wealth disparity is necessary to ensure dynamism even left wing economists accept that economies work better when entrepreneurs and other ambitious types are allowed to satisfy their greed but over the past decade the economics profession has concluded that big gaps between the richest and the rest could be a cause of all sorts of chronic problems high levels of income inequality correlate with corruption and regulatory capture as the wealthiest outspend others to ensure the playing field tilts in their favour societal and political unrest also flare in places where the majority feels left behind by an elite majority advertisement

executive officer leblanc asked the finance minister about eight things and not once did he mention the middle class the trudeau government and the business community keep talking past each other the

submitted by russell napier of the electronic research interchange it s all over now baby blue now the deflation then the repression you must leave now take what you need you think will last but whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast yonder stands your orphan with his gun crying like a fire in the sun look out the saints are comin through and it s all over now baby blue it s all over now baby blue bob dylan 1965 what a three weeks it has been particularly in bond markets where ten years after the launch of qe the prospect of deflation is priced as a clear and present danger the good news is that we know what is coming next the bad news is that we know what is coming next the current war on deflation a war lost if the shift in bond yields is to be believed is bringing forth from the authorities not a new tactic but a whole new strategy financial repression so is the financial repression now renamed modern monetary theory makeup strategy nominal gdp targeting imminent as bond yields in new zealand and australia reach all time lows and the ten year bond yields of both japan and germany return to zero human beings are not naturally proactive and in groups they become less so in groups trained to believe the same things say for instance at economics faculties in the world s finest universities proactivity does not often extend beyond trying to get to the front of the lunch queue we must expect the move to financial repression to be proactively discussed now widely by central bankers and politicians but to be implemented as a reaction in terms of how central banks will move to their newly floated plan b financial repression the remarks by jay powell in california on march 8th are very instructive my fomc colleagues and i believe that we have a responsibility to the american people to consider policies that might promote significantly better economic outcomes makeup strategies are probably the most prominent idea and deserve serious attention they are largely untried however and we have reason to question how they would perform in practice before they could be successfully implemented there would have to be widespread societal understanding and acceptance as i suggested a high bar for any fundamental change considering monetary policy mom broadly we are inviting thorough public scrutiny and are hoping to foster conversation regarding how the fed can best exercise the precious monetary policy independence we have been granted our goal is to enhance the public s trust in the federal reserve our most valuable asset monetary policy normalization and the road ahead chair jerome h powell march 2019 siepr economic summit stanford institute of economic policy research stanford califomia these direct quotes and other comments in powell s speech in california on march 8th make it clear that the fed s goal above all others is to protect its own independence like just about any other institution it believes in self preservation and can compromise on much to achieve it it is no coincidence that the new strategic target has been put forward just as key political voices have raised the prospect of a move to modem monetary theory a capture of the fed which is indeed red in tooth and claw this threat to the institution as much as the risk of an economic slowdown can force the fed proactively to change its strategic target while the solid ground expects a deflationary bust to provide the main prompt for a central banking revolution we cannot rule out that it is a political bust at least as seen through the eyes of an independent central banker that drives action many are to blame for the sudden outbreak in monetary theory madness but the fed must realize at least in private that their direct actions to boost asset prices have economically orphaned many us citizens and created a political backlash while their formal research may not recognise such a role the point is that the citizens do and thus it s all over now for a monetary policy seen to benefit the few and not the many given the need to shift strategy what the fed is grabbing fast is the policy that will abate the citizens but preserve as much of its independence as possible they thus are preparing to inflate away debts but are looking for widespread societal understanding and acceptance before doing so the speech refers to a series of town hall meetings that the fed will run across the country in search of such acceptance should a recession credit crunch come along before that exercise in democracy is completed such acceptance may just have to be inferred investors must be in no doubt that this is not more qe it is a strategic shift in monetary policy aimed at benefiting debtors at the expense of creditors and spenders at the expense of savers as discussed in that last newsletter a few weeks ago what investors need to grab fast now is gold even as the markets price in ever clearer risks of deflation in those past few weeks bond yields have shifted markedly lower and the gold price markedly higher that s a terrible combination that suggests that it is indeed all over now at least for those who believe that markets are ultimately better at allocating resources than governments if bond market moves do indeed augur another deflationary scare and a move to a new monetary strategy of financial repression then gold is just beginning what could be a thirty year bull market sometimes it s the cure and not the disease that ultimately kills you so it is to be for savers investors when it comes to the cure that has constantly cheered their chilled hearts since 2009 that cure in the form of larger central bank balance sheets was explicitly aimed at producing a positive wealth effect by boosting asset prices and encouraging consumption it succeeded at least it did for those who owned assets and the ft how to spend it supplement beam testimony to the link between the rise in asset prices and a type of rise in consumption of course that illustration of the gap between the have nots and the have yachts has created its own form of threat to savers and now a new monetary policy is mooted which will shift wealth from the owners of assets in particular credit assets to wage earners and the leveraged they that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind and the tactical victory for the owners of assets in the age of qe 2009 2019 will unleash a whirlwind in the form of financial repression which will deplete the purchasing power of savings mightily over the forthcoming years so much for the long term political failure of qe but what about its short term failure it s creation of a deflationary bust for many years the solid ground has argued that qe was producing debt faster than it was producing money and thus was setting the stage for our next deflationary bust the balance sheet deterioration that resulted from bringing forward growth via the accumulation of debt has troubled investors occasionally over the past decade it did so in the eurozone crisis particularly regarding the debt levels for the so called piigs portugal ireland italy greece and spain it did so for the so called taper tantrum for emerging markets it did so when glencore and other commodity producers were in trouble in early 2016 and it did so yet again when turkey seemed incapable of servicing its huge foreign currency debt obligations the monetary medicine called qe was liberally dosed out but despite this european equity prices emerging market equity prices and commodity prices are all lower than they were in 2014 debt however is much higher for most investors more monetary medicine still means more profits but increasingly this has relied upon an inflation of us equity prices now 58 of the morgan stanley all country world index so here we are again central bankers are preparing more medicine and investors await their bounty despite the fact that the last dose had limited impacts at least outside the us it is legitimate for investors to believe that a major deflationary shock will either not be permitted or at least reversed quickly by the action of the authorities indeed in anatomy of the bear lessons from wall street s four great bottoms harriman house limited 2016 your analyst argues that it is this social panic to defeat deflation that signals the end of a bear market however in those four great bottoms equity valuations were extremely low and none of them coincided with debt to gdp ratios at the current excessive levels society has thus not yet had to face the true consequences of too much debt and thus not had to adapt the extreme policies necessary to inflate those debts away indeed behaviour across the planet shows that the lessons they have learned from central bank actions is that they can only benefit from having even more debt for those who thought that qe was that extreme policy and it wasn t too bad then the rise of the global debt to gdp ratio and the recent dive in bond yields indicates that they have simply not been extreme enough or perhaps just extremely misconceived there is no doubt that the assembled authorities cannot contemplate the consequences now of even less money given the record high levels of debt to gdp the solid ground has long argued that their inability to accept the social consequences of the gravity of financial market value will indeed lead them not to try to use their balance sheets to influence pricing but ultimately to use their legal authority to suspend and set pricing financial repression when that comes all sorts of phoney prices can be created albeit at an extremely high price for savers and also the efficient allocation of capital as jay powell made it clear in his speech at stanford in march there would have to be widespread societal understanding and acceptance for such a move your analyst continues to believe that it will be dramatically lower prices for equities associated with a recession and probably deflation that will be taken as sufficient pain to imply such understanding and acceptance the recent dive in bond yields indicates that such pain is imminent in capital management in the age of financial repression 3q 2016 the solid ground shows using historical examples the alice in wonderland world that ensues for savers when acceptance grows that debts must be inflated away its a world where our political masters fearful of the consequences from their own policy mistakes subject us to a suspension of pricing for our own benefit be in no doubt that the continued dive in bond yields and the likely dive in equities should the bond investors view on the growth deterioration be confirmed paves the way for the new era of financial repression perhaps tongue in cheek to be known this time as capitalism with chinese characteristics so is there any good news for investors yes there is we can all retrain as investors who understand the nature and consequences of financial repression with some study of the history of financial repression algorithms however laboring with only post repression data will still be merrily investing funds to take advantage of the less government and more market and general disinflation that they have the past forty years of data to describe oops financial repression will be triggered by a deflationary episode and investors must now prepare for that episode however when we move to financial repression asset allocation becomes very easy by ignoring bonds buying gold and buying equities with high fixed costs usually companies that are asset heavy and not asset light these are not unconventional assets but the secret will be to hold them in unconventional amounts of course the most important thing to do in any repression is to move your savings to a country that will not need to repress them a country with a low debt to gdp ratio having taken such unconventional measures your job is largely done because it should outperlom with little or no further active management for a few decades note your 2019 asset weightings and be prepared to liquidate but only when the algorithms have reached the same weightings i d guess for these vagabonds that will be about 2039 active managers get to strike another match whenever they want well at least those free to move to unconventional asset sizing and leave the age of stepping stones behind leave your stepping stones behind there s something that calls for you forget the dead you ve left they will not follow you the vagabond who s rapping at your door is standing in the clothes that you once wore strike another match go start anew and it s all over now baby blue it is my sincere desire to provide readers of this site with the best unbiased

amman last february jordan and the international community agreed on a radically new approach to the syrian refugee crisis instead of viewing refugees as a burden that could only be alleviated by humanitarian aid the new agreement described them as a development opportunity that with sufficient levels of investment and structural reforms could benefit jordan s entire economy the jordan compact was welcomed as a potential blueprint for other host countries looking for ways to reduce their dependence on dwindling sources of aid and shift towards a development response that helps refugees become more self reliant according to the world bank which is helping to fund the compact s implementation it s a win win proposition for jordan but more than a year later jordan is struggling to translate its new approach into more economic opportunities for syrians or jordanians the small resource poor country of 9 5 million people three million of them foreigners according to the 2016 census has a long history of absorbing the region s displaced beginning in 1948 jordan welcomed waves of palestinians and then in the 1990s and 2000s it was iraqis each influx has added jobs cash and diversity to the economy but the arrival of close to one million syrian refugees over the past five years only 657 000 of whom are currently registered with unhcr has been tougher to absorb the issue is partly demographic many of jordan s syrians are from poor rural areas of southern syria in contrast to the well heeled iraqis who flocked here decades earlier meanwhile the war in syria and border closures with both syria and iraq have hit trade crippling jordan s export economy and compounding the strain of coping with so many needy newcomers jordan s economic slowdown has not been helped by the fact that syrians are largely prevented from working legally this is designed to protect jordanian jobs in a stagnating market with an unemployment rate of 15 8 percent around double that for youth but has kept hundreds of thousands of syrians dependent on aid and low paid informal work this has driven wages down edging out many jordanians and resulted in lower government revenues from taxes and employer social insurance payments the jordan compact agreed at a major donor conference in london in february 2016 secured 1 7 billion in grants low interest loans and pledges from the international community in return for jordan opening up its labour market to syrian refugees besides funding jordan was promised access to tariff free trade with the eu providing it issued at least 200 000 work permits to syrians until that target is hit businesses located in 18 special economic zones sezs throughout jordan can unlock preferential access to the eu market by employing syrians as 15 percent of their workforce in the first two years and 25 percent thereafter one year on jordan has secured 923 6 million in funding including 147 million in world bank loans and a december 2016 cash transfer from the united states of close to half a billion dollars but the hoped for results haven t yet materialised work permits were made widely available to syrians from april 2016 but by february 2017 just 38 516 permits had been issued according to jordan s ministry of labour trust deficit alisa reznick irin ahmad yassin hamood 28 successfully applied for a work permit through his employer at a nut roastery in amman last summer thirty year old daraa native ahmad alhmood recently acquired a work permit after years of working in a food shop without one before getting my permit i used to watch my back all the time i worried all the time that the authorities could come to my work alhmood told irin syrians caught working illegally can be arrested detained sent to azraq refugee camp and in some cases deported back to syria alhmood referred to his permit as his legal weapon against such outcomes now i am like any foreign worker in jordan i have my rights and i know that i am legally entitled to them he said those rights include being paid the minimum wage recently raised from 190 to 220 jordanian dinars 268 to 311 per month and social security but for many syrians the gains of formalised employment aren t worth the potential losses humanitarian agencies say some refugees fear losing access to aid or the chance of resettlement to a third country others prefer to remain under the radar rather than risk registering with a government they don t fully trust i believe no permit will protect me in jordan said a syrian father of one who works in an office in amman and asked not to be named it s always a matter of how you react with the authorities when they ask to see your papers and if this guy wants to make things hard for you then your permissions won t help bureaucratic hurdles this trust deficit doesn t help but neither does the fact that not every syrian who wants a permit can get one some professions engineering medicine and teaching for example are off limits completely to refugees and other occupations for which permits are supposed to be available are very difficult to get in practice basel a 24 year old refugee living in irbid in northern jordan is the sole breadwinner for seven members of his family he is desperate to make his job at a restaurant more secure by regularising his employment status but described the procedure for getting a permit as a little bit complicated that s putting it mildly the jordan ingo forum a network of 51 international ngos responding to the syrian crisis in jordan released a document in december called the work permit maze which maps the labyrinthine steps refugees must take to regularise their employment several business owners contacted for this article said the process of getting a work permit for their syrian employees was simply too complex and time consuming most continued to employ syrians without permits special zones special challenges sezs have the potential scale needed to quickly reach the 200 000 permit goal but progress towards hiring more syrians has been slow jordan s chamber of industry has argued that syrians could be a natural fit for industries that struggle to lure jordanian labour currently the garment manufacturing industry which accounts for around 20 percent of jordan s gdp hires large numbers of mainly asian foreign workers to work on sezs around the country sanal kumar chairman and managing director of classic fashion a global manufacturing company that is jordan s biggest garment maker scoffed at the idea that tariff free access to the eu was of interest to jordan based garment manufacturers classic fashion and others like it can make clothes far more cheaply in bangladesh which has duty fee access to the eu the reason they manufacture in jordan he explained is for tariff free access to the us market thanks to a jordan us free trade deal for classic fashion employing locals and refugees is still a goal but one motivated more by corporate social responsibility than any incentives on offer through the jordan compact classic fashion set out to hire 500 syrians last year but unfortunately the response was very very negative said kumar numerous job fairs resulted in just 30 syrians coming to work for the company many stayed only a few days and months later just four syrians remain on its payroll even they aren t working in the sezs where workers live on site but at satellite factories closer to urban areas alisa reznick irin fatma rajab sakr a 32 year old mother from damascus began working in classic apparel s factory inside the al hassan industrial complex in january she is now able to support her daughter with her income from the factory more needs to be done by ngos to help recruit refugees and convince them they won t lose benefits or refugee claimant status by working legally said kumar he also cited other intractable issues like the location of most sezs far from the cities camps and villages where most refugees live a problem compounded by jordan s crippling lack of public transportation as long as the ngos can find syrians who are ready to work classic is more than ready to take them he told irin win win john speakman who is leading the world bank s efforts to develop economic opportunities for jordanians and syrian refugees said his team was pretty pleased with the implementation of the jordan compact generally jordan s investment climate is not good it has even gone backwards over the past four or five years but we re seeing progress he told irin we re trying really hard to make this a win win proposition for jordan there s a chance this may be transformational but drastic reforms are needed for jordan to be a better place to do business and to ensure the jordan compact delivers benefits for refugees whether jordan will be able to make these reforms is the pressing question the bad business environment in jordan is a pre existing problem to think we can make this work for syrians a disempowered disenfranchised fragmented population when it hasn t worked for jordanians that s just nuts said sean yom an associate professor of political science at temple university who has tracked jordan s economic development for more than a decade in the case of the struggle to employ refugees on sezs yom sees a disconnect between the project s aims and the needs of the people it s supposed to help public transport is the lifeblood of the jordanian economy and jordanians say it s inadequate the idea that syrians are going to transport themselves to sezs an hour away if jordanians can t do it for syrians to do it is pure fantasy he said yom worries that the compact doesn t provide sufficient incentives for jordan to implement the reforms needed to get more people jordanian and syrian alike participating in a better functioning economy but with or without those reforms he noted the compact will deliver enough funding to help stabilise jordan s economy if or when the jordan compact fails jordan doesn t lose that much because the refugee population is transient he said for jordan this is win win top photo mohammad amr 25 is one of only a handful of

fast forward to now and wall street is over 12 per cent higher and though at stages has looked extremely vulnerable to turnarounds or at least pull backs to date no such thing has occurred and now after friday s trade the whispering speculation is whether the s p is headed for new all time highs 1 the start of something new a new day week month and quarter today and what a difference a little time can make 3 months ago at least for some global financial markets stood at the brink of ruin it was december 24 last year that the s p500 hit its low but it wasn t until the start of january that something resembling a turnaround in us stocks transpired the asx is set for a bright start to the month on the back of a strong performance by wall street on friday 2 wall street eyes all time highs given the balance of risks there s more than a negligible chance that will occur this isn t to say that s it s the likeliest of outcomes in us stocks presently but the conditions are certainly in place to foster it as has been covered off innumerable times the market s initial turnaround and subsequent follow through has in large part been central bank engineered led by the fed and dutifully followed by the ecb boj boc rba and rbnz interest rate expectations completely reversed course in the past quarter a world once preoccupied with calling the next round of rate hikes has been replaced with one speculating on when global central banks will cut next 3 a central bank made rally the subsequent loosening of financial conditions has ignited this multi month rally from its highs in october last year the 10 year us treasury note has fallen over 80 basis points the fed has gone from a long way from neutral to being on autopilot to straight up patient with their monetary policy say what you will about the fed there actions are a lesson in human fallibility and the inherent ambiguity in predicting the future not that the markets fundamentally care homeric lessons and questions of morality don t concern it much the foundations for risk taking were reinstated implying that whether right or wrong as a matter of principle or policy a gobbling up of risk assets is justified 4 fighting the cyclical slow down of course this dynamic has all played out at a stage of the business cycle that might be described as late stage geopolitics has done its part to undermine market sentiment and hobble economic activity in particular geographies but as time goes by more and more it appears that these issues are peripheral and are causing a marginal impact to a global economy that is already in the process of slowing down
investors have worked themselves into a lather equities crashed in q4 last year on corporate earnings and concerns about growth the fed s tightening decision in december was made unanimously the above trend growth the preferred inflation measure was near target unemployment was the lowest in a generation and real rates were historically low there are myths in the market like the plunge protection committee or that the fed targets the core rate of inflation one such myth that some fed officials have helped to perpetuate is that the central bank is a murderer that it kills expansions it may have been true but it has reformed indeed it was the federal reserve under paul volcker a market favorite that last murdered an expansion the last three business cycle downturns were preceded by a financial crisis and were not caused by a too tight fed policy think about it the s l crisis the tech bubble and the great financial crisis which one did the fed tightening spur that is another myth the fed has helped to perpetuate it often refers to its dual mandate others do too full employment and price stability but the truth of the matter is the there is a third mandate and the fact that it is often left out is revealing affirmation through negation it is financial stability ii market fundamentalism is as dangerous as all fundamentalisms it is both an exaggeration and simplification it exaggerates the market s function as the greatest aggregator of information it oversimplifies ignoring other relevant factors and often assumes what it has to prove namely that the market is always right while nearly constant incremental movements are the norm it is prone to lurches overshoot and reversals what is the yield curve telling us what is the bond market telling us these are the question economists investors and policymakers are asking many market fundamentals know the answer the precipitous fall interest rates and reflect investors anticipating a recession q e d yet the situation is considerably more complicated right alongside the fair value model we have in our heads or on the spreadsheet needs to be another model albeit perhaps less formal it would include the myriad of factors that are not about a macroeconomic assessment when it comes to u s yield this means it is not just asset managers but also the u s treasury debt managers who determine the precise issuance it would include the attractiveness of u s yields regardless of one s view of the economy given that nearly a fifth of all bonds has a negative yield which is more than 10 trillion narratives focus almost exclusively on investors and much of the media coverage of the markets make it seem as if hedge funds and other risk takers are the market what about hedgers and passive investors who are forced into action by other developments the mortgage holder faces early pre payment risk due to the decline in interest rates may be forced to hedge it may be like an echo chamber where the echo produces its own echo previously the conventional wisdom was that central banks bond buying drove down yields and dampened volatility now on a net basis central bank buying has ceased and yields have plunged the unwinding of the fed s balance sheet some suggested would push up interest rates since the fed s balance sheet operations reached terminal velocity the yields have dropped around 85 bp no one would buy italian bonds once the ecb stopped we were told by top economists and op ed writers and yet the btp yield has fallen nearly as much as the u s yield over the past six months as the ecb tapered and then ceased buying altogether in the six months before while the ecb was buying the yield had risen by more than twice that iii market fundamentalism also leads to exaggerating the economic weakness the data is read through market prices and modernity appears to have exorcized any discussion of value as a philosophic demon and its fanciful language that coverup for personal desires passions and moralizing the gap between the 1 5 rate cuts the market is discounting this year for the federal reserve stands in stark contrast to not only fed s forecasts dot plot but also the fomc statement which is its primary communication tool that gap needs to be closed federal reserve speakers including the perceived doves like bullard and kashkari are already using their speaking opportunities to emphasize the underlying strength of the u s economy and the neutral stance of the central bank market fundamentalists often make their claims almost an article of faith let s treat our ideas as hypotheses our hypothesis many participants are exaggerating the economic weakness and that next week s u s economic data will help underpin the fed s message that a rate cut is not warranted specifically the january surge in u s retail sales was not the capitulation of american shoppers consumption likely like grew further even if at a more moderate pace auto sales likely firmed after declining in january and february most important the 20k rise in february was a fluke it will not be repeated it is more likely that the march jobs growth snaps back toward trend the six and 12 month averages are 200k 10k should remain near cyclical highs and the work week may have expanded which given the size of the workforce swamps the month to month net change in employment the atlanta fed s gdp tracker for q1 began march below 0 5 and finished the month at 1 7 the new york fed s model is at 1 3 after stating the month less than 0 9 the median forecast of the bloomberg survey is smack between the two at 1 5 iv we see preliminary signs that the chinese economy may have also found a base even if it is not evident in the reports the household and corporate tax cuts that begin now and other stimulus measures suggest it will be forthcoming shortly we put emphasis on xi s political will and interest to avoid an economic weakness in this the 70th anniversary of the revolution which would give the u s an advantage in negotiations speculation that china will get more serious about the trade negotiations now the mueller investigation is complete appears far from the mark the media has delivered a steady stream of largely repetitive stories quoting senior u s officials talking about the progress that is being made we have been led to believe that the main problem is in enforcement because the u s rejects the currently preferred use of independent panels the trump administration sees what previously had propagated as the rule of law as a sinister erosion of u s sovereignty it wants to reserve the right to unilaterally respond commensurately hard if no timely resolution of a conflict is found europe s economy may also be finding a base the current slowdown centered in the core and especially germany yes italy contracted in h2 18 even in the best of times it did has not grown quickly since 2011 the italian economy has experienced only three quarters in which growth exceeded 0 4 the more immediate problem is germany and the corner appears to have been turned last week the german surprised on the upside and seemed to contradict the dismal flash the february slipped to 4 9 the lowest since unification economists had cautioned that the jump in january stole from future sales and the median forecast in the bloomberg survey was for a 1 0 decline in february instead they rose 0 9 and the january gain was revised down from 3 3 to a still heady 2 8 the two month gain matches the strongest in five years which itself was the best since mid 2011 more evidence that the european locomotive is getting back on track is likely in the coming days when germany reports february and figures both should recover from the steep slide in january 2 6 and 0 8 respectively modest gains are expected suggesting the recovery is gradual the recovery is not even and spring may come to france later
here s our summary of key events overnight that affect new zealand with news with a china turnaround story china s official factory pmi made a remarkable recovery jumping from a contracting 49 2 in february to an expanding 50 5 in march they say most of this is due to the data provided by large state owned enterprises smaller private ones are still contracting we will need to await the caixin pmi to be sure this sudden improvement is for real if it is confirmed it will be domestic demand rather than exports that is driving their improvement and that is significant in the us official data shows consumer spending barely rose in january and income increased only modestly in february suggesting their economy was still losing momentum after growth slowed in the fourth quarter of 2018 however there was better news on new home sales in the us which firmed nearly 5 in february from january to get back to the same level they were a year ago the other main survey of american consumer sentiment reported a better level in march but that is at odds with its rival survey in canada their january gdp result came in with better growth than was expected yes they do their gdp monitoring monthly back in beijing the united states and china said they made progress in trade talks that concluded over the weekend the americans called them candid and constructive meanwhile beijing is taking a different tack in their new round of stimulus using its big four state owned banks to pump out for debt finance the amounts involved are not small between the better pmi trade talks in the balance and more stimulus this goes some way to explain why the shanghai equities market is up 25 so far in 2019 in japan they also got some quite good data reported over the weekend vehicle sales were up again in february and that follows very strong 7 production rises in january and housing starts rose 4 2 as well in europe the main news is the continuing failure of the british to agree on anything related to brexit with the latest series of parliamentary votes all resulting in rejection a crash out is now inevitable it seems the eu isn t holding its breath and seems to have abandoned any hope of an organised divorce in australia their tax office data shows how crazy aussie landlords have become with their attachment to negative gearing it is being seen as positive progress that the proportion of australia s 2 2 mln landlords who are negatively geared fell to 60 in fiscal 2017 the lowest level since 2003 no wonder a correction in their housing markets have hit them so hard and debt growth for housing has now hit its lowest annualised level since records started there in 1977 the opposition australian labor party has said it will scrap negative gearing for new investors from the start of 2020 the ust 10yr yield is now at 2 41 their 2 10 curve is narrower at 14 bps and their negative 1 5 curve is wider at 19 bps the aussie govt 10yr is slightly firmer today at 1 79 but right where it was at the start of the week the china govt 10yr is lower on that basis however now at 3 08 while the nz govt 10 yr is at 1 83 up 5 bps since this time yesterday on friday local swap rates rose firmly off their lows gold has dipped us 2 over the weekend to us 1 292 and a 1 2 loss for the week us oil prices are firm now just on us 60 bbl while the brent benchmark is at us 67 50 bbl that is about where they were this time last week the kiwi dollar is holding this morning at 68 1 usc on the cross rates we are marginally lower up to 95 9 auc against the euro we are at 60 6 euro cents that puts the twi 5 at 72 8 yes the currency did fall sharply earlier in the week on the rbnz signal but it ended march right at its average for the month bitcoin is also a firmer at us 4 094 and a 2 5 weekly gain in fact at this price it has now topped nz 6 000 for the first time in over 4 months this rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here
pritzker s 3 4b income tax hike can fund less than 4 months of state pension costs without reform illinois pension problem will continue to force tax hikes while crowding out the core services residents need gov j b pritzker is making extraordinary claims about his 3 4 billion income tax hike among them that it will fill illinois deficit hole and bring financial stability to the state but the scale of illinois fiscal problems demands an entirely different solution one that doesn t force taxpayers and businesses to pour billions of dollars more into a broken system pritzker s estimated new revenue would be enough to fund the equivalent of 118 days of state pension costs less than four months if approved by the illinois general assembly and voters at the ballot box pritzker s tax plan would be implemented in 2021 at the earliest pritzker assumes his plan will generate 3 4 billion that year a gross overestimation when compared against the state s historic income growth and national economic trends but even assuming his plan raises that much it will be dwarfed by the scope of illinois pension problem in 2021 illinois is scheduled to contribute 9 55 billion to the five state run pension systems 250 million to the chicago teachers pension fund and 713 million in payments on the state s pension bond debt that means total pension costs will be 10 51 billion or more than 27 percent of the state s expected general revenues if pritzker succeeds in passing a graduated income tax illinois growing pension costs will ultimately force lawmakers to call for tax hikes on the state s middle class fixing the pension problem illinois pension crisis is often reduced to talking points about how the system was either underfunded or overpromised in reality one follows from the other according to wirepoints total pension liabilities or the present value of current and future promised benefits have grown 4 5 times faster than illinoisans personal income and six times faster than state revenues since 1987 underfunding is a result of the fact that required payments were unrealistic to begin with overpromised a back loaded funding ramp signed into law by former gov jim edgar significantly worsened the problem without reform pensions will continue to drive up local property tax bills as well from 1996 to 2016 increasing pension costs and debt payments accounted for more than half of the growth in residents property tax bills bringing illinois property tax burdens from around the national average to among the highest of any state instead of devoting enormous political resources to scrap the illinois constitution s flat income tax protection pritzker should set his sights on the state s single largest cost driver the constitutional pension clause preventing bipartisan reform to protect the solvency of the state s retirement funds house joint resolution constitutional amendment 21 and senate joint resolution constitutional amendment 9 would do just that the amendments would protect all pension benefits already earned meaning the state could keep its promises to current employees and retirees but it would allow for changes in the growth of future benefits including provisions such as automatic 3 percent raises in pension benefits for life moving to true cost of living adjustments by tying post retirement benefit increases to some measure of inflation was part of a reform effort that passed illinois general assembly in 2013 but was struck down by the state s supreme court in 2015 had the reforms survived they would have reduced the state s 2016 pension contribution by 1 2 billion and put the state on a path toward a sustainable and affordable pension system if state lawmakers fail to tackle the pension problem illinois taxpayers will continue to pay more and get less from their state and local governments
as the euro zone s downturn drags on the lack of coordinated response from the bloc s governments appears to be leaving an uneasy european central bank with little choice but to step into the breach again as growth has slowed in recent months the ecb has had to put off plans to return to more normal monetary policy and had to rethink the potential dangers of keeping rates negative for longer than planned but with interest rates already at record lows oecd chief economist laurence boone said that euro zone countries should not be looking to the ecb again to revive their economies if downside risks materialise further governments must act and coordinate fiscal policies and they must do structural reforms boone told a conference at the bank of france on thursday germany france and italy the euro zone s three biggest economies are easing fiscal policy this year which barclays said should provide some support to growth while germany is focussed on social payments and some investment italy aims to roll out a universal income scheme and france is easing the tax burden by more than 10 billion euros 8 61 billion pounds together their fiscal easing should add 0 2 percentage points to euro zone growth bringing it to around 1 2 percent this year barclays said in a research note this week but euro zone countries budget stimulus is being done largely independently of each other especially on public investment which economists say would have the biggest effect greater public investment across the euro area is needed but is unlikely to materialise even if economic activity weakens much further barclays concluded in a note this week growth shocks imf chief economist gita gopinath warned on friday that euro zone financial markets would be unable to absorb a future shock in the absence of a more unified banking sector and capital markets in the next crisis a lot of these issues are going to crop up why because it continues to be the case that there are fragmented markets gopinath said at the conference her boss imf chief christine lagarde said the solution would be to agree a shared bank deposit guarantee scheme but northern countries remain suspicious that the long proposed plan could leave them on the hook for repayments of deposits in southern countries burdened by bad bank loans in the absence of better levers to bolster the euro zone economy the focus falls on the ecb which is also contending with inflation slipping away from its 2 percent target despite its already record low interest rates although economists polled by reuters estimate that data due on monday will show euro zone inflation remained steady at 1 5 percent in march weak data from france and germany increase the chances of a softer reading in other data next week the first friday of the month will bring all important payroll data in the united states with economists on average forecasting the creation of 170 000 jobs after a paltry 20 000 the previous month along with retail sales and ism business surveys the data should paint a clearer picture of whether the united states is at risk of joining the euro zone in a more marked slowdown source reuters reporting by leigh thomas editing by kevin liffey
by russell napier of the electronic research interchange it s all over now baby blue now the deflation then the repression you must leave now take what you need you think will last but whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast yonder stands your orphan with his gun crying like a fire in the sun look out the saints are comin through and it s all over now baby blue it s all over now baby blue bob dylan 1965 what a three weeks it has been particularly in bond markets where ten years after the launch of qe the prospect of deflation is priced as a clear and present danger the good news is that we know what is coming next the bad news is that we know what is coming next the current war on deflation a war lost if the shift in bond yields is to be believed is bringing forth from the authorities not a new tactic but a whole new strategy financial repression so is the financial repression now renamed modern monetary theory makeup strategy nominal gdp targeting imminent as bond yields in new zealand and australia reach all time lows and the ten year bond yields of both japan and germany return to zero human beings are not naturally proactive and in groups they become less so in groups trained to believe the same things say for instance at economics faculties in the world s finest universities proactivity does not often extend beyond trying to get to the front of the lunch queue we must expect the move to financial repression to be proactively discussed now widely by central bankers and politicians but to be implemented as a reaction in terms of how central banks will move to their newly floated plan b financial repression the remarks by jay powell in california on march 8th are very instructive my fomc colleagues and i believe that we have a responsibility to the american people to consider policies that might promote significantly better economic outcomes makeup strategies are probably the most prominent idea and deserve serious attention they are largely untried however and we have reason to question how they would perform in practice before they could be successfully implemented there would have to be widespread societal understanding and acceptance as i suggested a high bar for any fundamental change considering monetary policy mom broadly we are inviting thorough public scrutiny and are hoping to foster conversation regarding how the fed can best exercise the precious monetary policy independence we have been granted our goal is to enhance the public s trust in the federal reserve our most valuable asset monetary policy normalization and the road ahead chair jerome h powell march 2019 siepr economic summit stanford institute of economic policy research stanford califomia these direct quotes and other comments in powell s speech in california on march 8th make it clear that the fed s goal above all others is to protect its own independence like just about any other institution it believes in self preservation and can compromise on much to achieve it it is no coincidence that the new strategic target has been put forward just as key political voices have raised the prospect of a move to modem monetary theory a capture of the fed which is indeed red in tooth and claw this threat to the institution as much as the risk of an economic slowdown can force the fed proactively to change its strategic target while the solid ground expects a deflationary bust to provide the main prompt for a central banking revolution we cannot rule out that it is a political bust at least as seen through the eyes of an independent central banker that drives action many are to blame for the sudden outbreak in monetary theory madness but the fed must realize at least in private that their direct actions to boost asset prices have economically orphaned many us citizens and created a political backlash while their formal research may not recognise such a role the point is that the citizens do and thus it s all over now for a monetary policy seen to benefit the few and not the many given the need to shift strategy what the fed is grabbing fast is the policy that will abate the citizens but preserve as much of its independence as possible they thus are preparing to inflate away debts but are looking for widespread societal understanding and acceptance before doing so the speech refers to a series of town hall meetings that the fed will run across the country in search of such acceptance should a recession credit crunch come along before that exercise in democracy is completed such acceptance may just have to be inferred investors must be in no doubt that this is not more qe it is a strategic shift in monetary policy aimed at benefiting debtors at the expense of creditors and spenders at the expense of savers as discussed in that last newsletter a few weeks ago what investors need to grab fast now is gold even as the markets price in ever clearer risks of deflation in those past few weeks bond yields have shifted markedly lower and the gold price markedly higher that s a terrible combination that suggests that it is indeed all over now at least for those who believe that markets are ultimately better at allocating resources than governments if bond market moves do indeed augur another deflationary scare and a move to a new monetary strategy of financial repression then gold is just beginning what could be a thirty year bull market we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us sometimes it s the cure and not the disease that ultimately kills you so it is to be for savers investors when it comes to the cure that has constantly cheered their chilled hearts since 2009 that cure in the form of larger central bank balance sheets was explicitly aimed at producing a positive wealth effect by boosting asset prices and encouraging consumption it succeeded at least it did for those who owned assets and the ft how to spend it supplement beam testimony to the link between the rise in asset prices and a type of rise in consumption of course that illustration of the gap between the have nots and the have yachts has created its own form of threat to savers and now a new monetary policy is mooted which will shift wealth from the owners of assets in particular credit assets to wage earners and the leveraged they that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind and the tactical victory for the owners of assets in the age of qe 2009 2019 will unleash a whirlwind in the form of financial repression which will deplete the purchasing power of savings mightily over the forthcoming years so much for the long term political failure of qe but what about its short term failure it s creation of a deflationary bust for many years the solid ground has argued that qe was producing debt faster than it was producing money and thus was setting the stage for our next deflationary bust the balance sheet deterioration that resulted from bringing forward growth via the accumulation of debt has troubled investors occasionally over the past decade it did so in the eurozone crisis particularly regarding the debt levels for the so called piigs portugal ireland italy greece and spain it did so for the so called taper tantrum for emerging markets it did so when glencore and other commodity producers were in trouble in early 2016 and it did so yet again when turkey seemed incapable of servicing its huge foreign currency debt obligations the monetary medicine called qe was liberally dosed out but despite this european equity prices emerging market equity prices and commodity prices are all lower than they were in 2014 debt however is much higher for most investors more monetary medicine still means more profits but increasingly this has relied upon an inflation of us equity prices now 58 of the morgan stanley all country world index so here we are again central bankers are preparing more medicine and investors await their bounty despite the fact that the last dose had limited impacts at least outside the us it is legitimate for investors to believe that a major deflationary shock will either not be permitted or at least reversed quickly by the action of the authorities indeed in anatomy of the bear lessons from wall street s four great bottoms harriman house limited 2016 your analyst argues that it is this social panic to defeat deflation that signals the end of a bear market however in those four great bottoms equity valuations were extremely low and none of them coincided with debt to gdp ratios at the current excessive levels society has thus not yet had to face the true consequences of too much debt and thus not had to adapt the extreme policies necessary to inflate those debts away indeed behaviour across the planet shows that the lessons they have learned from central bank actions is that they can only benefit from having even more debt for those who thought that qe was that extreme policy and it wasn t too bad then the rise of the global debt to gdp ratio and the recent dive in bond yields indicates that they have simply not been extreme enough or perhaps just extremely misconceived there is no doubt that the assembled authorities cannot contemplate the consequences now of even less money given the record high levels of debt to gdp the solid ground has long argued that their inability to accept the social consequences of the gravity of financial market value will indeed lead them not to try to use their balance sheets to influence pricing but ultimately to use their legal authority to suspend and set pricing financial repression when that comes all sorts of phoney prices can be created albeit at an extremely high price for savers and also the efficient allocation of capital as jay powell made it clear in his speech at stanford in march there would have to be widespread societal understanding and acceptance for such a move your analyst continues to believe that it will be dramatically lower prices for equities associated with a recession and probably deflation that will be taken as sufficient pain to imply such understanding and acceptance the recent dive in bond yields indicates that such pain is imminent in capital management in the age of financial repression 3q 2016 the solid ground shows using historical examples the alice in wonderland world that ensues for savers when acceptance grows that debts must be inflated away its a world where our political masters fearful of the consequences from their own policy mistakes subject us to a suspension of pricing for our own benefit be in no doubt that the continued dive in bond yields and the likely dive in equities should the bond investors view on the growth deterioration be confirmed paves the way for the new era of financial repression perhaps tongue in cheek to be known this time as capitalism with chinese characteristics so is there any good news for investors yes there is we can all retrain as investors who understand the nature and consequences of financial repression with some study of the history of financial repression algorithms however laboring with only post repression data will still be merrily investing funds to take advantage of the less government and more market and general disinflation that they have the past forty years of data to describe oops financial repression will be triggered by a deflationary episode and investors must now prepare for that episode however when we move to financial repression asset allocation becomes very easy by ignoring bonds buying gold and buying equities with high fixed costs usually companies that are asset heavy and not asset light these are not unconventional assets but the secret will be to hold them in unconventional amounts of course the most important thing to do in any repression is to move your savings to a country that will not need to repress them a country with a low debt to gdp ratio having taken such unconventional measures your job is largely done because it should outperlom with little or no further active management for a few decades note your 2019 asset weightings and be prepared to liquidate but only when the algorithms have reached the same weightings i d guess for these vagabonds that will be about 2039 active managers get to strike another match whenever they want well at least those free to move to unconventional asset sizing and leave the age of stepping stones behind leave your stepping stones behind there s something that calls for you forget the dead you ve left they will not follow you the vagabond who s rapping at your door is standing in the clothes that you once wore strike another match go start anew and it s all over now baby blue
fast forward to now and wall street is over 12 per cent higher and though at stages has looked extremely vulnerable to turnarounds or at least pull backs to date no such thing has occurred and now after friday s trade the whispering speculation is whether the s p is headed for new all time highs 1 the start of something new a new day week month and quarter today and what a difference a little time can make 3 months ago at least for some global financial markets stood at the brink of ruin it was december 24 last year that the s p500 hit its low but it wasn t until the start of january that something resembling a turnaround in us stocks transpired the asx is set for a bright start to the month on the back of a strong performance by wall street on friday 2 wall street eyes all time highs given the balance of risks there s more than a negligible chance that will occur this isn t to say that s it s the likeliest of outcomes in us stocks presently but the conditions are certainly in place to foster it as has been covered off innumerable times the market s initial turnaround and subsequent follow through has in large part been central bank engineered led by the fed and dutifully followed by the ecb boj boc rba and rbnz interest rate expectations completely reversed course in the past quarter a world once preoccupied with calling the next round of rate hikes has been replaced with one speculating on when global central banks will cut next 3 a central bank made rally the subsequent loosening of financial conditions has ignited this multi month rally from its highs in october last year the 10 year us treasury note has fallen over 80 basis points the fed has gone from a long way from neutral to being on autopilot to straight up patient with their monetary policy say what you will about the fed there actions are a lesson in human fallibility and the inherent ambiguity in predicting the future not that the markets fundamentally care homeric lessons and questions of morality don t concern it much the foundations for risk taking were reinstated implying that whether right or wrong as a matter of principle or policy a gobbling up of risk assets is justified 4 fighting the cyclical slow down of course this dynamic has all played out at a stage of the business cycle that might be described as late stage geopolitics has done its part to undermine market sentiment and hobble economic activity in particular geographies but as time goes by more and more it appears that these issues are peripheral and are causing a marginal impact to a global economy that is already in the process of slowing down

beijing factory activity in china unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in march an official survey showed on sunday suggesting government stimulus measures may be starting to take hold if sustained the improvement in business conditions could suggest the ailing manufacturing sector is on a path to recovery easing fears that china could slip into a sharper economic downturn but many analysts remained cautious on the growth outlook citing seasonal distortions caused by the long lunar new year break in february they argue that real investment and consumer demand remained soft and pushed up inventories at a sharper rate potentially adding pressure to the sector the official purchasing managers index pmi rose to 50 5 in march from february s three year low of 49 2 marking the first expansion in four months according to data released by the national bureau of statistics nbs on sunday the 50 mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis analysts surveyed by reuters had forecast the manufacturing gauge would pick up slightly to 49 5 as factories ramped up production after the lunar new year holidays and rebuilt inventories ahead of a seasonal pickup in activity in spring factory output grew at its fastest pace in six months in march reversing a brief contraction in the previous month it rose to 52 7 from february s 49 5 the highest level seen since september 2018 total new orders also grew at a quicker pace driving up factory gate prices to a five month high of 51 4 ending four months of contraction the jump will likely give a big boost to stock markets and could delay a cut in the reserve requirement ratio rrr said ting lu chief china economist at nomura china has announced five rrr cuts in the past year to free up more cash for banks to boost lending to private firms and further cuts are widely expected ting said there is limited room for manufacturing pmi to rise further and the chance for another dip is not small overall although the manufacturing pmi in march can somewhat alleviate the pessimistic expectations of the economy we believe that the actual situation may not be so optimistic as reflected in this indicator lianxun securities said in a note export orders shrank for the 10th straight month suggesting external demand remained sluggish and further policy cushion may be needed if trade tensions escalate china s trade oriented neighbors japan south korea and taiwan have seen more signs of slackening demand both in china and elsewhere construction work starting at the beginning of the year has led to strong domestic demand but external demand is still weak and the outlook on imports and exports is still not optimistic economists at huatai securities said tit for tat tariffs imposed by washington and beijing remain in place as talks continue to end a trade war that has disrupted the flow of billions of dollars of goods between the world s two largest economies it s unclear if a deal acceptable to both sides can be done u s president donald trump said on friday that talks with china were going very well but added he would not accept anything less than a great deal after top trade officials wrapped up two days of discussions in beijing china s vice premier liu he will head to washington on april 3 for more talks specter of layoffs chinese factories shed more staff in march with the employment sub index edging up to 47 6 from 47 5 in february amid rising labor costs and weaker sales a growing number of foreign companies from car makers to electronics manufacturers have decided to shut plants in china in recent months raising the specter of more layoffs the jobless rate in february rose to 5 3 percent nearing a two year high sony corp is closing its beijing smartphone plant and production will stop by the end of the month while samsung electronics ceased operations at one of its mobile phone manufacturing plants in china last year the pmi survey showed small and mid sized manufacturers still fared worse than large companies many state controlled although their activity improved from the previous month suggesting that policymakers efforts to channel affordable financing to the private sector are gradually working policymakers have acknowledged the economy is under pressure multi year campaigns to curb debt risks and pollution have deterred fresh investment while the u s china trade war is hurting china s export sector threatening even more jobs in response beijing plans more spending on roads railways and ports along with nearly 2 trillion yuan 297 27 billion in tax cuts to ease the pressure on corporate balance sheets the measures will take time to kick in say analysts who believe economic activity may not stabilize until the middle of the year data on wednesday showed industrial profits fell 14 percent the sharpest drop since at least late 2011 growth in china s services industry accounting for over half of the economy picked up in march as new orders rose more quickly the official non manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi rose to 54 8 from 54 3 construction activity swung back into high gear in march with the return of warm weather a sub reading for construction activity stood at 61 7 in march up from 59 2 in february
the big question facing financial markets is whether the united states and therefore the global economy is heading into recession key data which will help confirm or refute the signals that bond markets are currently sending is due out this week including us retail sales and manufacturing figures later today and non farm payrolls on friday as for those bond market signals three month us treasury bills have started trading at higher yields than those of 10 year treasury bonds that s a classic sign if sustained that recession is nigh the local impact has been to take the yield on 10 year swap rates to record lows they bottomed at 2 02 percent on thursday last week and ended the week at 2 1450 percent we ve got quite an important week of us data coming says mark lister head of wealth research at craigs investment partners we ve got all these signposts that are pointing to trouble ahead lister says the data so far this year has been quite ugly the key us index of manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level since late 2016 last month and a very weak report showed the us economy added just 20 000 jobs in february well below forecasts we ve been able to blame that on the government shut down but we can t do that anymore lister says in addition weaker results and outlook comments reported by international parcels business fedex have suggested a slowdown in global growth one of the reasons new zealand s interest rates have fallen is the reserve bank s bombshell announcement last wednesday that the next move in its official cash rate is likely to be down in february the local central bank had said the ocr probably wouldn t move until well into 2020 and that then it could move either up or down the reserve bank was following on from the surprise about face from the us federal reserve which went from expecting to continue raising interest rates to no more rate hikes this year there have been similarly dovish statements from other central banks including the european central bank a key concern of our reserve bank was that the increasingly gloomy tilt of other central banks had been pushing the new zealand dollar higher its statement pushed the local currency down about a us cent against that backdrop the reserve bank of australia s next cash rate decision due tuesday afternoon will be watched more closely than usual if all those concerns that the rbnz sees are valid you would think the rba would see them too lister says if the rba doesn t follow suit i think the australian dollar could spike up but the market has already decided they re going to be quite dovish too he says on the local front tuesday s quarterly survey of business opinion from the nz institute of economic research will probably confirm the results of anz bank s monthly survey which have shown businesses are getting ever gloomier we will probably see a decline potentially quite a sharp one in sentiment from the qsbo this week lister says among other things the february release of the final report of the tax working group is likely to be causing some anxiety amongst the business community during the survey period he says but it isn t all doom and gloom for one thing commodity prices are still travelling well particularly the key global dairy trade index it has risen in each of the last eight fortnightly auctions and dairy farmers will be hoping for another good result from the latest auction due early wednesday lister notes that the main gdt index is 21 1 percent higher than it began this year and at its highest levels since september 2017 on a less positive note a key reason for the strength in prices is lower milk production on the back of dry weather during recent months in particular in the north island he says you certainly wouldn t think a global recession was on the cards from looking at global equities markets although one of the reasons they keep rising is falling interest rates the benchmark s p 500 index gained 13 percent in the march quarter along with other key markets around the world even the brexit benighted british ftse index managed an 8 percent march quarter gain new zealand s s p nzx 50 index gained 12 percent and five of the top 10 gainers are all utilities offering significantly higher dividend yields than available in money markets shares in meridian energy were the third highest gainer for example up 25 percent followed by phone lines company chorus up 23 6 percent and genesis energy up 23 4 percent businessdesk comments from our readers no comments yet add your comment your name

washington ap president donald trump s latest pick to help lead the federal reserve has received a rocky reception with top economists raising several red flags about whether stephen moore is qualified to be a governor of the world s most influential central bank moore is a former trump campaign adviser who helped design the 2017 tax cuts and the co authored trumponomics the economists say moore poses the distinct risk of injecting politics into an institution that strives to remain free of political influence when setting short term interest rates that can determine the path of employment inflation and overall growth he s merely a propagandist as far as i can tell said menzie chinn an economist at the university of wisconsin he makes just egregious mistakes in fact and theory even a prominent republican economist criticized the choice of moore after trump s announcement last week steve is a perfectly amiable guy but he does not have the intellectual gravitas for this important job harvard university economist greg mankiw said in a blog post mankiw a former chairman of the white house council of economic advisers for president george w bush added it is time for senators sic to do their job mr moore should not be confirmed still other prominent conservative voices are rallying to moore the wall street journal for which moore was once an editorial writer has endorsed him in a new editorial asserting that he might be a useful counter to the group think among fed officials the endorsement asserted that the remarkable cascade of derision and condescension from academic economists on moore s nomination is itself evidence that he should be a fed governor moore who has been affiliated with multiple conservative groups including the heritage foundation has taken a series of controversial stances about the fed despite acknowledging that he still needs to learn about how the regulator works he previously said that the fed should be scrapped in favor of the gold standard he called on the fed to hike rates during the great recession a move that could have further crippled the united states and he recently said that fed chairman jerome powell should be fired for rate hikes last year that in his opinion undermined the gains from trump s tax cuts the controversy took on a new dimension on wednesday when it was reported that he had a lien of more than 75 000 filed against him in january 2018 for unpaid taxes moore did not respond to an interview request for this report but in an interview friday with fox news moore said he was in the middle of a dispute with the irs in which he believed the irs owed him money but that it was taking a long time to get a resolution of the matter with the agency they owe us money we don t owe them moore said moore argued that he would not be unduly influenced by trump if the senate confirms him for the fed board he said he was looking forward to discussing economic issues with powell someone he has not met i will just tell him if we get the monetary policy right on top of the tax cuts and the deregulation this economy is going to soar moore said i am going to say chairman powell you are going to be a hero if you get this right a u s official familiar with the matter said moore s background check a requirement of the nomination process was still underway his nomination has not been sent to the senate the official insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations but the president is likely to stick with moore after having been disappointed by his decision to make powell chairman said dan clifton a partner at the advisory firm strategas clifton noted that the fed has since backed off plans for rate hikes in 2019 suggesting that moore was correct in his criticism of powell in an opinion piece in the wall street journal regardless of public criticism trump supports steve and is willing to go to bat for him clifton said when has establishment criticism stopped trump before especially when it comes to someone trump personally respects moore fits a profile of trump nominees who have largely been radio and television pundits who defended the president only to then get elevated to roles as policymakers their new jobs involve nuances trade offs and tough analysis that seldom make for snappy soundbites larry kudlow for example segued from being a commentator on cnbc to director of the white house national economic council but decades of moore s public statements might now haunt him during the nomination process to be one of seven fed governors my concern with stephen is actually not so much what he knows but the fact that he claimed to know things that weren t so said george selgin director of the center for monetary and financial alternatives at the libertarian cato institute a washington think tank selgin noted that moore has suggested that the fed set rates based off changes in commodity prices mistakenly claiming that former fed chairman paul volcker was guided by this principle when fighting a wave of inflation during the early 1980s

from amechi ogbonna washington dc amidst growing concerns by the world bank and the international monetary fund imf that nigeria s debt profile is soaring to very unsustainable levels finance minister kemi adeosun yesterday gave reasons why the federal government would continue to borrow in the face of dwindling crude oil revenue to keep the wheel of the economy running the minister who spoke at a wrap up session of the just concluded annual meetings of the world bank and the imf in washington dc on sunday said suspending the government s borrowing programmes would only lead to loss of jobs stagnation in infrastructure investments and closure of many businesses adeosun said the muhammadu buhari administration inherited an economy where about 27 out of 36 states were not paying salaries due to the over 70 per cent drop in crude oil revenue and decided not to leave the situation to degenerate further she said it was in an effort to keep the economy running and halt the mass sack of workers in both the private and public sectors of the economy that government embarked on the borrowing spree recorded over the last two years recall that recent statistics from the debt management office had put the nation s total foreign and domestic debt at n19 16trillion from about n17 36trillion in 2015 which forced the imf to warn the nation s indebtedness could hit 24 1per cent of gdp by 2018 and 23 3 per of gdp by end of this year she said why are we borrowing if you think back to the problem we faced when the present government came on board you would notice that our principal source of revenue plummeted by up to 85 per cent so we had no choices you either cut public infrastructure massively which should have led to massive job losses or you borrow in the short term until you begin to generate revenue we felt that laying off thousands of persons was not the best way to stimulate growth also when we came into office about 27 states could not pay salary if we had allowed that situation to persist we would have been in depression by now so we took the view as a government that the best thing to do was to stimulate growth and spend our way out of trouble get the state governments to pay salaries make sure federal government pays and invests in capital infrastructure once growth is restored you begin to systematically reduce your dependence on borrowing now we are talking about tax and what we are saying is that people should be aware of their responsibilities to their nation

trump s rich man s tax cut passed in december 2017 and as sure as your car goes faster when you step on the gas pedal economic growth accelerated it reached 4 2 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and individual 1 crowed we re on track to reach the highest annualized growth in 13 years his son you know the one who was happy to accept dirt about hillary clinton from russian government officials took a shot at his predecessor remember when obama said you need a magic wand to make that happen well abracadabra obama we re doing it people who unlike don jr are actually employed as white house economic officials made similar promises of regular growth levels above 3 percent since then it s turned out to be less abracadabra and more avada kedavra as the graph to the right demonstrates growth has fallen each of the subsequent quarters since q2 2018 even with their absurd tax policy one whose negative budgetary consequences will be with us for years trump still couldn t beat the strongest quarters achieved under president obama and 2018 s calendar year growth only matched obama s best year 2015 furthermore it s the trend that matters most going forward and that s really where it looks like the trump slump is really going to hurt thursday s revisions to economic growth in 2018 s fourth quarter did more than just render trump s tweetfrom a few days earlier which claimed that growth was the best it had been in 14 years completely non factual the report made clear that economic growth is slowing because of key factors namely that consumer spending and business investment are weakening there was even a 0 4 percent decline in corporate profits the first since the first quarter of 2017 these are not good signs for 2019 even worse for americans these trends appear to be negatively affecting growth in the current year as well another report released this week showed consumer spending in january came in below expectations growing only 0 1 percent and the report revised december s consumer spending down from a 0 5 percent drop to an even worse 0 6 percent decline personal income dropped 0 1 percent in january and rebounded only 0 2 percent in february a fairly pathetic overall reading for the first two months of 2019 according to reuters the data overall suggest the economy was fast losing momentum after growth slowed in the fourth quarter the weak consumer spending report extended the run of soft data ranging from housing starts to manufacturing that have flagged a sharp slowdown in growth early in the first quarter the economy is losing steam as the stimulus from 1 5 trillion in tax cuts as well as increased government spending dissipates legitimate economic outfits like the federal reserve and the international monetary fund have significantly reduced their economic outlook for 2019 and beyond and here s moody s analytics economist mark zandi 2018 will be the high water mark for growth in the trump administration zandi predicted growth would slow to 1 1 percent next year and sees a recession in 2020 as more likely to occur than not of course trump s own political appointees are still apparently still unwilling to say anything that might contradict their boss i know you re as shocked by that as i am after you ve recovered take a look at the graph to the right although donald trump is to put it mildly not a normal president we do know that incumbent presidents usually win reelection when the economy is strong clinton reagan or at least improving after a crash that began under the other party s watch obama trump inherited a strong overall economy from obama one that featured low unemployment and quite manageable budget deficits around 3 percent of gdp if after priming the pump and doing so largely by sending billions of dollars up the economic ladder trump is running in 2020 with a slowing economy growth levels at or below where they were when he took office trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see and rising unemployment he s going to have a very hard time convincing voters he should be re elected on the basis of his economic record having had republican majorities in congress for his first two years and thus having been able to implement his fiscal and economic priorities as well as his dangerous de regulation policies which he claimed would unleash growth he won t be able to run away from a trump slump between the race baiting the media bashing and most recently his renewed support for taking away health coverage from 20 million americans by repealing obamacare through the courts trump has demonstrated no interest in expanding his coalition all these actions serve as trump doubling down on his right wing base the one thing that might perhaps help trump bring in voters who didn t go his way last time would be if he had a positive economic record in terms of growth not that that would change the fact that his policies have benefited only a narrow slice of american households while doing little for the rest even if growth remains strong the evidence that the economy will help him is dubious as his approval ratings are lockedin a narrower range than that of any president since regular polling began if the best he can do is 42 percent approval in the year that looks like it will be his strongest in economic terms that does not bode well for his re election prospects as democrats we want our country to succeed republicans may have no qualms about rooting for the economic policies of their opponents to fail even in a time of economic crisis worse than any since the great depression i still can t fathom that rush limbaugh said upon the inauguration of president obama in 2009 that he hoped for the new president to fail when a president s policies don t work people we care about suffer and the country we love is harmed but we democrats are not blind and we will not pretend that failed policies are not failing
investors are questioning whether markets can move higher from this point given the spectacular performance from global shares in the first quarter a short term pull back is possible according to amp capital s shane oliver but sharemarkets should eventually end the year at a higher level he said valuations are ok global growth is expected to improve into the second half of the year monetary and fiscal policy has become more supportive of markets and the trade war threat is receding all of which should support decent gains for sharemarkets through 2019 as a whole dr oliver said on the fiscal side the federal budget due on april 2 could provide markets with a helping hand if policies are announced that support australian economic growth hsbc s economics team for one is expecting measures to be announced that will support the economy we expect the government to announce a range of tax cuts and spending measures and to use the budget to set out its election campaign platform noted hsbc s australian economics team led by paul bloxham advertisement we expect tax cut and spending measures that could deliver around 8 billion to 12 billion support to the economy most prominently there are likely to be more generous tax cuts he added according to commonwealth bank s economics team the starting point for the budget is in a better position than it had expected when the mid year budget review was announced late last year higher than expected commodity prices are part of the government s revenue windfall cba noted while a solid labour market and weak inflation have restrained expenditure model results point to a net improvement in the budget bottom line of 28 billion over four years the commonwealth bank economics team said the nominal economy is in good shape and there is the potential for some upgrades to this side of the story iron ore and metallurgical coal prices are sitting well above the mid year economic and fiscal outlook forecasts so there are likely to be some upward revisions there this should lift the terms of trade and nominal gross domestic product forecasts advertisement the budget takes place on the same day as the reserve bank of australia will announce its latest interest rate decision the rba has left rates on hold at 1 5 per cent since its last move in august 2016 if the government unveils tax cuts it may allow the rba to be a little more confident about the income consumption outlook but that will be after it adjusts its current views to a much more realistic and lower growth trajectory noted westpac s chief economist bill evans with so much uncertainty about the impact of fiscal policy and the negative forces around housing rising savings rates low inflation and softening global growth building over the next months the rba is still likely to move in august particularly now that the move is fully priced in to markets meanwhile white house chief economic adviser larry kudlow has called on the federal reserve to immediately cut us interest rates by a half percentage point friday will see the release of us employment data economists are expecting payroll growth to rebound to 175 000 after a shock 20 000 gain in february
by brian maher via daily reckoning any simpleton can recognize an unfolding calamity the two trains about to collide the twister racing for the schoolhouse the betrayed lover with a finger on the trigger but you require a wider vision to perceive the chains of disaster coming together link by fateful link when a conductor gets his signals crossed when the winds take a fatal shift when someone takes the first bite of forbidden fruit today we attempt a wider view of future calamity presently taking shape but first to a future calamity in its own right the stock market global growth drags on stocks once again the global economy throws a darkened shadow over wall street we learn today that chinese industrial profits have fallen 14 year over year their largest fall since 2011 meantime european central bank ecb president mario draghi has drawn a dark sketch of the eurozone mr draghi cited weakness in world trade and a weakening growth picture the ecb recently downgraded its 2019 eurozone gdp forecast from 1 7 to 1 1 the dow jones gave back 32 points on the day the s p lost 13 the nasdaq 48 by way of explanation ed yardeni president and chief investment strategist at yardeni research there s lots of angst about global economic growth that s understandable because it has been slowing significantly since early 2018 furthermore we can all observe that ultra easy monetary and debt financed fiscal policies aren t as stimulative as policymakers have been hoping yes mr yardeni we can all observe that ultra easy monetary and debt financed fiscal policies aren t as stimulative as policymakers have been hoping except perhaps for the policymakers themselves failure is only indication that they need to double triple or quadruple existing ultra easy monetary and debt financed fiscal policies as said wittgenstein nothing is so difficult as not deceiving one s self but we lift our gaze from the roiling present and face the distant horizon a vision of coming recession what do we spot unsurprisingly a scene of coming recession the present expansion is the second longest in united states history if the economy can peg along until july it will be crowned the longest expansion in united states history but the signs of age are creeping in like rust on a chassis growth has been trending wrong two consecutive quarters and going on three even the eternally optimistic atlanta wing of the federal reserve projects first quarter gdp to expand at 1 5 jpmorgan chase seers project the same 1 5 but even that is subject to downside risk the reasons are close at hand housing prices are the softest in four years manufacturing plumbs 21 month lows retail stores are closing at alarming rates 5 279 year to date the american consumer languishes under record levels of debt and the yield curve has inverted a recession indicator of supreme accuracy looking out beyond these pristine shores we also find the global economy wobbling on its axis as suggested above china and europe all go on unsteady legs japan is similarly afflicted meantime the federal reserve has just executed perhaps its most dramatic retreat in its history we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us it has essentially guaranteed no rate hikes on the year as recently as december it had penciled in two would it throw up the sponge if it were confident in the future but the federal reserve has conceded defeat to a superior and determined foe the stock market jerome powell ran his white flag up the pole in late december after the market raged against his promises of additional tightening we are forced to conclude that the federal reserve cannot lift interest rates much above the present 2 50 or restore its balance sheet to levels approaching pre 2008 levels that is the economy cannot withstand interest rates that are still historically low and the stock market will roar in protest if rates rise only slightly the real interest rate but the real interest rate the nominal rate minus the inflation rate is even lower than face value suggests thus we find the real fed funds rate not 2 50 but as low as 0 25 by way of comparison the real fed funds rate scaled 2 75 when the federal reserve s last tightening cycle concluded in 2006 and 4 when the previous cycle ended in 2000 but sticking to the nominal rate history argues convincingly that rates between 4 and 5 are required to beat back recession only with that much dry powder can the federal reserve cut enough to lift the economy from its wallows but when recession does besiege us this year next year or the year following the federal reserve will scarcely be at half strength imagine a one armed gladiator battling in the arena or a flyweight taking on the heavyweight champion of the world and so the federal reserve is in an awful bind it must raise rates to build its steam against the next recession but it cannot raise rates above present levels without bringing the furies crashing down upon it a conundrum to ponder of a blue day but we now return our binoculars to the purple horizon recession in fall 2020 could sink trump the next presidential election falls in november 2020 1 5 years from today given the present drift the economy may well be sunk in recession by that time recessions are notoriously poor portents for incumbent presidents since the civil war the economy was in recession eight occasions during presidential election season these years were 1876 1884 1896 1920 1932 1960 1980 and 2008 in all eight instances all eight the opposition party was voted in if the economy plunges into recession by next fall could the sitting president defy the odds it would not be the first time but every man s luck has its limits eventually the gods plot against him and recall the federal reserve will likely enter the next recession with barely a half barrel of steam recession will roll over it like a thundering locomotive over a rat and the cries will go out capitalism has failed yet again this is all donald trump s fault it is time to reclaim the economy for the people at this point our vision of the future begins
people work in a coffee drying station in kayanza northern burundi photo desire nimunbona bumper coffee harvests were supposed to fuel burundi s recovery from three years of political upheaval tell that to jean ntungiyabandi one local farmer who s just called it quits the tiny east african nation which counts starbucks among its customers and gets at least 80 per cent of its foreign exchange from coffee wants to double output by 2023 but delays in local payments are squeezing its 60 000 small scale producers complicating plans to revive the economy as burundi tries to recover from an economic and political crisis that s claimed at least a thousand lives coffee as far as i m concerned is finished said ntungiyabandi a father of five who has a small plot in mwaro central burundi and previously grew as much as 300 kilograms 661 pounds a year i will exploit my land in another way still in more than a dozen interviews in seven of burundi s 18 provinces most coffee farmers said they re determined to stick it out even as factors including low prices and fertilizer shortages mean they make little or no profit and are unable to hike output coffee growing encouraged in burundi in the 1930s when it was a belgian colony is a vital cog in the agriculture led economy the smallest in east africa more than half the country s 11 million people depend on it for their livelihoods and it s key to plans by president pierre nkurunziza s government to revitalize economic productivity that s been in the doldrums since deadly unrest flared in 2015 as he secured a third term farmers are angry because they re earning little said joseph ntirabampa leader of the coffee farmers confederation which is lobbying authorities to raise the prices paid to producers he said the average coffee plant produces 800 grams 1 8 pounds per annual harvest on a typical 100 tree plot with the beans bought at 500 francs per kilogram that can mean income of just 40 000 francs 22 a year we want the government and partners to invest in coffee by supplying enough fertilizers which can increase output from each tree ntirabampa said authorities pledged in august to invest us 81 million in steps including fertilizer distribution the industry regulator has accused local buyers associations of not exporting some of their purchases as well as failing to repatriate about 23 million from foreign sales that were made both situations they say held up farmers pay economic growth this year in burundi which is about the size of the us state of maryland is estimated at 0 4 percent by the international monetary fund and a coffee renaissance may be some way off burundi produced 16 079 tons in 2017 18 some 20 per cent more than the previous season but still about 13 per cent less than in 2014 15 according to the central bank immaculate sindabimenya a 60 year old who s farming a small plot about 40 kilometers 25 miles from burundi s commercial capital bujumbura is among those finding times tough what i get from this coffee is not even half of what i spend on maintenance of the farm she said sometimes i feel i could quit this another farmer in muramvya province bernard ntamagiro said producers were taking on debt to maintain their fields and sometimes wait more than 10 months to be paid tell me who can accept this situation he said agriculture minister deo guide rurema has defended the amounts paid to farmers in an interview with local newspaper burundi eco in august last year he said the government s 2016 decision to set the minimum price at 500 francs per kilogram has protected producers from speculators and that fertilizers are available government officials didn t respond to calls seeking comment francois mbabare who has a small plot in the central province of gitega described the prices paid as derisory and said officials should take part in coffee farming to understand the hardships we work for nothing especially since we re not allowed to set prices for the coffee we produce ourselves he said for some farmers like hakizimana emmanuelline who was widowed during burundi s civil war in the 1990s coffee growing has become so integral to their family and community that they can t imagine abandoning it i can t do much with the income from coffee but nor can i live without it she said from her farm in kayanza province in the north of the country i am happy to see it even though i benefit almost nothing
the battle over federal budget irresponsibility continues as democratic presidential candidates try to outspend each other while president donald trump s 2020 budget blueprint is awash in red ink putting many iowans at risk democrats have been unveiling an array of expensive programs medicare for all guaranteed jobs tuition free education at public universities canceling student debt u s treasury bonds for newborns expanding social security 10 billion annually in slavery reparations for a decade 500 monthly for families and assorted costs associated with the green new deal meanwhile trump s record 4 7 trillion fiscal 2020 budget is a 15 percent increase that grows the deficit by 1 1 trillion despite 2 7 trillion in spending cuts the red ink is getting worse rapidly just three months into the current fiscal year the deficit was up 310 billion 40 percent more than last year the federal debt 19 8 trillion in november 2017 is on track to hit 22 8 trillion when the federal fiscal year ends sept 30 trump s budget is predicated on 3 percent economic growth which both the congressional budget office and the federal reserve believe is at least 1 percent too optimistic yet previous administration growth forecasts were closer to the mark than anticipated but its claim that the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent as well as individual rates would grow federal revenues hasn t panned out in fy2018 revenues were down 275 billion 7 6 percent from what the cbo estimated prior its passage federal reserve chairman jerome powell had a message in late february for free spending democrats and tax averse republicans the idea that deficits don t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency is just wrong while democrats would play robin hood and rob from the rich to give to the poor trump s budget would do the opposite by slashing aid to the needy as well as health environmental and farm programs while increasing the military budget and building his border wall trump may have professed his love for farmers but the agriculture budget was cut 15 percent 3 6 billion farm safety net programs would be reined in some programs would limit eligibility to farmers with adjusted gross incomes of at most 500 000 while subsidies for crop insurance premiums would be lowered from 62 percent to 48 percent among the cuts that would impact iowans for the 88 000 iowans benefiting from the supplemental nutrition assistance program food stamps the administration proposes sending them a prepackaged america s harvest box 100 percent american grown foods in boxes and cans although described as a budget savings packaging and delivery costs reportedly aren t factored in and it s a curiously socialistic requiring government menus no fresh fruit or vegetables and warehouses trump again wants to repeal and replace the affordable care act which would put insurance for 172 000 iowans at risk protections for pre existing conditions also would be jeopardized despite his assurances to the contrary medicaid which covers some funding for nursing home residents and children including those with disabilities would be reduced by 1 4 trillion over 10 years including 12 billion in iowa the low income home energy assistance program which serves 80 300 iowa households frequently those with elderly or disabled residents or small children would be abolished as would the home energy weatherization program to cut utility bills after school programs which affect 7 300 iowa students would be eliminated college students would see the end of the direct subsidized loan program 102 500 iowans and supplemental educational opportunity grant program 31 800 while the public service loan forgiveness program would be eliminated and federal work study reduced by 80 percent the budget is being promoted as promises kept taxpayers first but it belies trump s vows not to cut social security and medicare social security would be reduced by 26 billion including 10 billion from the social security disability insurance program which provides benefits to disabled workers the savings supposedly will be accomplished by reducing fraud medicare would be cut by 575 billion by supposedly reducing waste and cutting prescription drug prices yet critics claim trump s revision of the north american free trade agreement could provide drug companies with 10 years of protection from cheaper competition among biologics ultra expensive drugs elsewhere the environmental protection agency would be slashed by 31 percent the national institutes for health centers for disease control and prevention and the national science each would have double digit cuts subsidies for coal and fossil fuels would increase while the opposite would be true for renewables while many democratic proposals are aspirational at best fantasies at worst trump s budget is fiscal nonsense taking an ill advised meat ax to programs when a scalpel is preferable it wouldn t make america great again for thousands of iowans struggling to make ends meet

people who work hard and fail yet you never hear about them overall entrepreneurship is overrated 5 successes for every 100 failures and the successful ones will try to tell you that their success is attributable to some sort of special skills or rules hucksters like gary vaynerchuk who looks and sounds like a used car salesman when it s either luck having rich parents or some other variable outside of one s control gary inherited his family s wine business regarding bill gates in addition to having very high iq gates got a near perfect score on the old sat which is also luck as philip greenspun notes his upbringing could not have been more fortuitous writing books selling on amazon or doing podcasts is too much work has a high failure rate and pays poorly relative to things like investing unless you re sam harris or joe rogan people are all impressed that their book is 1 on amazon in some obscure category or their book sells a couple thousand copies or their podcast has 1 000 downloads but that requires a 1 1 000 rarity talent and or iq whereas anyone regardless of talent can invest in the s p 500 and make money much more easily or any low skilled job pays more the median success for the typical podcast amazon seller or self published author in terms of income after one factors in the number of hours involved and start up costs amounts to less than minimum wage the most successful people i know didn t do it with entrepreneurship but rather they got good paying jobs kept expenses low and invested whatever was left in the stock market or real estate taking advantage of compounding for every college dropout success story like jobs gates zuck etc or someone with a successful podcast there are countless failures who are stuck in fast food or retail all over reddit on popular subs such as r wallstreetbets r investing r financialindependence and r personalfinance there are tons of stories of people in their 20 40 s who have gotten rich in finance and other high paying jobs and by investing thanks in large part to post 2009 tech and stock boom which a decade later continues with no end in sight it s not like i have to dig deep for financial success stories but just within a few minutes of skimming one can find many young people striking it rich with investing and tech there s even an entire sub culture surrounding this the so called fire movement not too many fire disciples are writing books doing podcasts or selling on amazon or ebay a traditional job lacks the autonomy of entrepreneurship but cushy working conditions a six figure salary and generous stock options makes it worthwhile especially when one considers that the median hourly wage from entrepreneurship is less than minimum wage a single decade in tech can equal many decades of lower paying work regarding entrepreneurship versus investing if i had to choose between putting a large sum of money say 200 000 into a small business which has a 90 chance of failing within 5 years or the s p 500 the choice is obvious buy the dip has been a winning strategy since 2009 look the s p 500 since the start of the year strait up without a hiccup out of the ruins of the 2008 crisis came possibly the biggest and longest technology and stock market boom ever that so few could have anticipated and the media ignores instead focusing on all the things that are going wrong such as the mueller investigation and not what is going right the strong economy i don t want to turn this into a politics post but i think this lopsided reporting is motivated by biases that fall along predictable party lines if i had to predict how much higher the stock market is going rise my response is much higher due to a combination of robust consumer spending low interest rates geopolitical stability pe multiple expansion and strong earnings the s p 500 can conceivably post 15 annual returns including dividends for the next decade for a total of 300 which is similar to that of the 80 s and 90 s it may be a decade or longer before there is another recession pension funds and passive investors are pouring money into the market because bond yields are too low to meet obligations in our post 2008 winner take all capitalist system with huge winners few and far between and lots of losers riding on the coattails of the winners or as josh brown says own the damn robots is a way better strategy than trying to create the next facebook or the next google many have tried and all failed a common response is what if we re in a tech bubble and my answer is people have been predicting this for a long time and they have a terrible track record at it as the tweet below in regard to facebook s 2012 acquisition of instagram for 1 billion which the pundits said facebook overpaid but in retrospect it was a brilliant move what if the commentators actually had no idea what they were talking about all along pic twitter com n5s3x49gy2 austen allred austen march 31 2019 given that the tweet was favorited over 1 110 times many people agree these pundits are worse than a broken clock in that they are never right when facebook went ipo in 2012 and the stock failed to pop as most ipos tend to do but this was not the fault of facebook but rather the stock being underwritten at an appropriate value which worked to facebook s advantage the experts proclaimed it as the top of the web 2 0 and tech boom which in retrospect was wrong now facebook stock is up 300 since then and facebook s earnings have grown so much that the pe ratio of facebook is only 20 versus 100 when it debuted the experts underestimated the boom in mobile advertising and content which in 2012 was underdeveloped compared to today also it s impossible to know what inning we re in but it does not matter if you are making a solid six figure salary and you invest and save diligently then even if the tech boom was to end next year you would still come out ahead by virtue of having more money what these alarmists don t understand is you keep the money you earn it s not like you have to give everything up when the market turns and even in 2000 after the tech bubble burst it took less than three years for things to pick up again tech unlike housing and energy tends to be very resilient to macro economic forces and recovers quickly even the s p 500 made a new high within 6 years of the 2000 peak and 6 years after the 2007 peak so you didn t need to wait that long to recover all your money even with the worst possible timing some blame this on the fed for artificiality inflating economy and no doubt low interest rates help but companies are making tons of cash too multinationals such as disney walmart visa nike google microsoft and facebook are generating billions of dollars in free cash flow every quarter this is indicative of actual economic activity and demand not just artificial fed stimulus america has among the highest per capita income of all developed countries higher than that of germany and the uk and with 330 million americans that is a substantial amount of purchasing power flowing into the economy but what about living expenses for sure silicon valley and new york are expensive but if you are single and keep expenses low then even in a high cost of living area you can still save and invest a large percentage of your income yeah if you have many dependents the picture changes but i think much of this hype and alarmism over high bay area living expenses is overblown just running the numbers if you make 210k year after taxes you are still taking home 135k year in silicon valley the median rent for a one bedroom apartment is 2 300 a month so you are still left with 107k subtract 1 500 month for other misc expenses such as food health insurance assuming employer does not cover it internet access phone plan and car payment for a used car so you re left with 89k which is no small change this is not even counting stock compensation or sign on bonuses or other perks of course if you add children to the equation expenses rise dramatically but this can be offset to some degree by having a double income family how about student loan debt as the meme below shows again similar to high living expenses i think these fears are overblown and outcomes depend on variables such university ranking and choice of major as opposed to the generalizations by the media and pundits such as james alucher that college is too expensive and not worth it the typical student has 20 30k in debt which is the cost of a new car but unlike car a degree gains value in terms of higher inflation adjusted wages whereas a car losses value yet there is much less alarmism over car debt in spite of the anti college movement since 2009 the gap between grads and non grads in terms of wages and employment rate is the widest it has ever been so these pundits and gurus could not have chosen a worse time to tell people to not go to college yeah if this were the 80 s for sure college would not be necessary but this is 2019 which is a much more competitive automated and globalized economic environment where in spite of low unemployment the labor market for many jobs is flooded and salaries follow a bimodal distribution with a lot of low paying jobs in the service sector some high paying tech and legal and medical jobs but not enough job in the middle due to the decline of manufacturing the evidence suggests that in spite of the debt college grads especially in stem finance and econ do well but i have read stories of liberal arts majors such as philosophy doing well on reddit subs devoted to finance and investing it s almost without fail that those who have the most money have college degrees and are in tech not small business or entrepreneurship even with 50 100k in debt it s spread out over a long time so if your job pays 100k a year the student loan payments are only a small fraction of your income 10k year in student loan payments for a 70 100k year job seems like a good deal also there are tons of forgiveness and deferment programs so although the debt is very hard to discharge the terms and interest rates are much better than other types of debt such as credit card consumer home or auto debt the 2005 changes to the bankruptcy law made other types of debt much less forgiving relative to student loan debt a solution is limiting loans only to applicants who have the highest likelihood of finishing college such as requiring a minimum iq or sat score to qualify just merely having a ged is not good enough part of the problem is economics employers for many industries have a glut of workers and requiring a degree is a cheap and low risk in terms of legal risk way of screening candidates for competence in conclusion if you have the corrections funding always use other people s money never your own and a truly great idea then go for it but this does not apply to most people who have neither funding nor a good idea

1 easy money the past decade of ultra low interest rates has spawned the rise of zombie companies these debt laden firms don t make enough to even cover their interest payments that s never a good sign the number of zombie companies in advanced economies last year stood at 536 or 13 of the total according to bank of america merrill lynch that s a surprising figure given that the global economy was strong in 2018 in fact the number of zombie companies isn t far from the peak of 626 seen during the depths of the great recession bofa said last time it was easy to be a zombie because everyone s profits were collapsing michael hartnett bofa s chief investment strategist said in an interview so what s the excuse this time economists blame the era of extremely low interest rates easy money allows companies to borrow cheaply and low rates encourage investors to gamble on riskier companies the federal reserve held interest rates near zero for almost a decade and pumped its balance sheet up to 4 5 trillion central banks have pushed interest rates to zero therefore nobody can go bankrupt harnett said while the fed steadily raised rates beginning in 2015 it announced plans this month to halt rate hikes because of slowing economic growth central bankers in europe and japan meanwhile have yet to lift interest rates out of negative territory poor use of resources borrowing money especially at affordable rates is not a bad thing at all adding debt allows companies to invest in the future by building new factories buying equipment hiring workers and researching next generation products and easy money helped breathe life into global stock markets inspiring confidence along the way but zombie companies are wasteful you are keeping companies afloat that should not be in business hartnett said those businesses are using resources such as capital or labor that could be used more efficiently elsewhere to stay alive zombie companies require greater and greater amounts of capital they need to frequently tap the capital markets for more of it zombie firms are less productive and crowd out investment in and employment at more productive firms ryan nilandri banerjee and boris hofmann wrote in a september 2018 paper published by the bank for international settlements which is owned by 60 global central banks it s not just a post crisis problem the bis paper found that the presence of zombie firms has ratcheted up since the late 1980s a period of stubbornly low interest rates while only 2 of companies in advanced economies were zombies in the late 1980s the authors said that figure climbed to 12 in 2016 and rather than recovering or exiting the zombie state through bankruptcy companies today tend to stay that way for longer the phenomenon isn t healthy because of how it saps the rest of the economy of resources but it might not become a problem as long as interest rates remain low the catch would be if historically low unemployment in the united states and a shortage of skilled workers causes wages to rapidly rise that would force the fed to resume aggressive interest rate hikes if inflation starts surprising to the upside then suddenly these zombie companies have a much bigger problem bofa s hartnett said 2 jobs report the us jobs report for march comes out on friday and it will give greater insight into how much wages are rising the us economy added only 20 000 jobs in february a surprisingly low number that fell short of huge jobs gains in the months prior economists will watch to see if it was a one time fluke or part of a broader trend there s some concern that february s numbers were a sign that the economy is running out of available workers after 101 consecutive months of job growth 3 brexit debate uk lawmakers rejected prime minister theresa may s brexit deal for a third time on friday extending the country s political and economic uncertainty the rejection raises the chances of either a longer delay to brexit or the united kingdom crashing out of europe without a deal on april 12 parliament will hold a second vote on alternatives to may s deal monday 4 second quarter kickoff after a horrible end to 2018 stocks notched one of their best first quarters ever the s p 500 rose 13 its best quarter since 2009 that s boosting optimism heading into the second quarter even after the us bond market flashed recession a big start to the year historically has suggested the bulls could remain in charge the rest of the year said ryan detrick senior market strategist at lpl financial in a recent note in fact 9 of the past 10 times the s p 500 was up at least 10 during the first quarter the rest of the year was also in the green 5 coming this week monday us february retail sales us ism manufacturing tuesday walgreens earnings us february durable goods orders wednesday us ism services thursday constellation brands earnings reserve bank of india rate decision friday us march jobs report eu finance ministers meet
acting chief executive matthew cheung the hong kong special administrative region government is determined to develop hong kong into a leading hub for green finance in the region with focus on mainland china and economies along the belt road economic corridors by leveraging our strengths and advantages as an international financial centre we seek to create value through sophisticated professional services and our unparalleled expertise and reputation in the provision of financial services indeed hong kong s sound legal and regulatory system a deep and liquid capital market robust financial infrastructure and a wealth of financial intermediaries and talent help maximise hong kong s potential in developing into a regional green finance hub while recognising the importance of market forces in shaping and determining the demand and supply for green bonds and other green financial products the hksar government will facilitate and provide necessary infrastructure and catalysts for jump starting market developments we will at the same time build up our international profile on green finance with increased international visibility and proactive promotion targeting audiences overseas we launched in june 2018 the green bond grant scheme to subsidise eligible green bond issuers in obtaining certification under the green finance certification scheme and attract more corporate green bond issuance in hong kong from a broader perspective the enhanced transparency and accreditation standard of green financial products will help strengthen market confidence in green finance as announced in the chief executive s inaugural policy address in 2017 the current term hksar government would take the lead in arranging the issuance of a green bond to demonstrate the government s support for sustainable development and determination to combat climate change and to promote the development of green finance the financial secretary further announced in the 2018 19 budget the launch of the green bond programme with a borrowing ceiling of hk 100 billion to encourage more issuers to arrange financing for their green projects through our capital markets and help grow the local green investor base we are actively preparing for issuing the inaugural government green bond under the programme targeting global green investors as soon as practical in addition the three year pilot bond grant scheme was also launched to attract local mainland and overseas enterprises to issue bonds including green bonds in hong kong we have also introduced the enhanced qualifying debt instrument scheme to provide tax concession for bond investment in hong kong with the aim of promoting our bond market development including green bond the priority that we accord to green finance is in consonance with our country s national 13th five year plan to construct a green financial system develop green loans and green bonds and establish green development funds green finance is also a theme championed by g20 at the hangzhou summit in september 2016 where the importance of green finance was mentioned for the first time in its leaders communique recognising the need to scale up green finance in order to support environmentally friendly and sustainable growth globally indeed g20 s call for scaling up green finance is underpinned by a growing market appetite for green bonds as evidenced by the increasing diversification of issuers and investors in the global green market according to the climate bonds initiative global green bond issuance for 2018 reached us 167 3 billion up 3 over the preceding year in parallel the mainland s financial institutions are actively promoting relevant financing products such as green bonds to raise capital for environmental projects with a long payback period such as renewable energy technology waste treatment and sewage treatment last year alone their green bond issuance that aligned with international green bond definitions reached us 30 9 billion representing about 18 of the global market second to the united states locally a two fold increase to about us 11 billion worth of green bonds were arranged and issued in hong kong last year by notable issuers from private sectors of hong kong mainland china and abroad as well as multilateral agencies such as the world bank the asian development bank and the european investment bank this testifies to the strengths of our financial platform in supporting further development of hong kong as a major green finance hub in the region according to the climate bonds initiative s green bond trading venue league table the hong kong exchanges clearing limited was ranked fifth globally and first in asia last year we envisage that certification bodies that are well conversant with a spectrum of international regional and local standards and guidelines will play a more significant role in the green finance development internationally in view of the underlying trend of international harmonisation for a broader investor base to this end the hksar government will continue to support the green finance certification scheme and encourage local mainland and overseas enterprises to make use of the scheme and our capital markets for financing their green projects in fact the hong kong quality assurance agency developed the green finance certification scheme with reference to a number of international and national standards on green finance the scheme also upholds its independence by refraining from rendering advisory or consultancy service in tandem to avoid potential conflict of interest ladies and gentlemen to facilitate cross border investment in green bonds we also make use of every opportunity to promote our competitive capital markets and green finance platform at regional and international forums including the asian financial forum held in hong kong in january this year under the theme of creating a sustainable and inclusive future relevant authorities such as monetary authority hkex and securities futures commission are also working in tandem with the government s effort to develop hong kong as a leading centre for green finance and connect green finance flows with the mainland and the rest of the world hong kong is an internationally renowned financial centre and global rmb business hub we are well equipped to become a leading regional hub for green finance through issuing bonds initial public offerings and other channels such as fund distribution in hong kong however we need the support and active participation of relevant sectors to achieve this ambitious goal acting chief executive matthew cheung gave these remarks at the green finance certification scheme presentation ceremony cum forum 2019 on march 25
first a review of last week s events eur usd despite the decline in the gdp data the us dollar has felt pretty confident this week and it s not the us president not the fed but first of all the prime minister and the parliament of great britain who can t decide how to get out of the stalemate that they themselves have driven who are the reason naturally the ambiguity with brexit could not but put pressure on the european currency which has been falling all week and any attempts of the bulls to change the trend rested on the downward resistance line 1 1447 1 1230 and only on friday just before the next vote in the british parliament did the pair move to a sideways movement thus starting from march 20 it lost about 235 points fixing the low at the level of 1 1209 very close to a very important support resistance level of 1 1200 gbp usd it is not for nothing that the ancient greeks called britain foggy albion the british managed to let the brexit procedure go in so much fog that it s impossible to see the road from the eu even at arm s length as of the end of friday march 29 we can state the following parliament voted three times against the deal with the eu in the theresa may version but it voted against withdrawing without any deal at all as well the country s leadership should formulate further plans until april 12 or withdraw without a deal but parliament is against such an exit mrs may is likely to propose an extension of the brexit procedure based on article 50 of the european union treaty but then the uk will have to participate in the european election which is again opposed by the parliamentarians europe does not really understand how to act in a situation of such uncertainty either which is why an emergency eu summit is being convened and the british pound has so far rolled down to the lower border of the five week side corridor 1 2960 1 3350 but did not leave it having fought off later by 55 points up and having completed the five day period at the level of 1 3030 usd jpy the dollar strengthening and not reducing risk appetites of investors could not but touch the yen recall that 15 of the oscillators on h4 and d1 at the end of last week already gave signals this pair had been oversold which is a fairly accurate precursor of the trend reversal and graphical analysis indicated a rise in the pair above 110 75 everything happened according to this scenario the pair made a throw to the north rising from the level of 109 70 to 110 90 the final chord sounded at 110 85 cryptocurrencies our forecast last week said that amid the absence of serious news the btc usd pair would not fall below 3 900 but would try to overcome resistance in the 4 200 zone that s exactly what happened having fixed the low at 3 938 on monday march 25 the pair turned around and was moving upward for all the remaining days reaching 4 190 by friday and thus completing the two week cycle almost at the same place where it began following bitcoin ethereum eth usd and litecoin ltc usd demonstrated similar dynamics having gained almost 100 of their recent losses and it was only ripple xrp usd that could not return to the march 16 high 0 328 and stopped a little below its 10 week pivot point 0 318 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd if the pair overcomes the support level of 1 1200 it will be able to continue moving down 75 of analysts 100 of trend indicators and 90 of oscillators on h4 and d1 agree with this the closest goal is the low of 2018 19 recorded on march 7 1 1175 the following support is located 50 points below but despite this seemingly clear advantage of the bulls not everything is so straightforward already now 10 of oscillators signal the pair is oversold graphic analysis on d1 also indicates that it will not be able to overcome such a strong support as 1 1175 and will return to the horizon 1 1340 in the medium term 60 of experts agree with the return to the area of 1 1300 1 1500 as for economic events one should pay attention to the publication of statistics on the consumer market in the eurozone and the united states on monday april 1 as well as data on the us labor market including nfp which will be released on friday april 5 analysts expect the number of new jobs created outside the agricultural sector to rise sharply in march compared with february from 20k to 175k even though the growth of the average wage will remain at the same level such data should strengthen the dollar but it must be borne in mind that the market very often takes these forecasts into account in advance in its quotes gbp usd at the time of writing the forecast for this pair is almost one to one similar to the forecast for eur usd this also applies to the bearish attitude of 75 of the experts and the red color of the indicators in addition to the fog with brexit the uk has a very serious trade deficit the interest rate is low and the pound is subject to great risks which is why investors avoid investing in the british economy the pound finished the week close to the strong support resistance level of 1 3000 but unlike the euro it is still far away from the lows of 2018 2019 so a breakthrough below 1 3000 opens the way for the pound to supports 1 2830 and 1 2770 the similarity with the euro this week concerns both the bearish and the bullish scenarios here oversold signals are signaled by 10 of oscillators and graphical analysis shows that after having fallen to 1 2960 the pair will turn up and head towards the center of the five week side corridor 1 2960 1 3350 in the 1 3150 zone usd jpy the upcoming movement of this pair can be limited to the channel 109 70 112 15 the pair is practically in its center at the moment and the only question is where it will move now down or up most trend indicators and oscillators look to the north at h4 while at d1 they take a neutral position at the same time 15 of oscillators on h4 indicate that the pair is overbought as for analysts 65 of them supported by graphical analysis on h4 have sided with the bears and 35 along with graphical analysis on d1 give victory to the bulls cryptocurrencies since december 15 last year the total capitalization of the crypto market has grown by almost 40 reaching a high of 143 366 billion on wednesday march 27 this is undoubtedly a good sign and gives hope that the bitcoin will manage to overcome the resistance of 4 200 and gain a foothold in the range of 4 200 4 280 almost 65 of experts agree with this forecast the next target for the bulls is the zone 4 365 4 385 where the highs of november december 2018 are located however we recall that in the transition to the medium term forecast the balance of power changes and here as before 70 of analysts side with the bears voting for the reduction of the pair to the 3 000 mark

critics of immigration argue that there is a huge cost to the american taxpayer that immigrants come to take advantage of government handouts and compete with american workers for jobs the facts do not support those arguments quite the opposite the center for american progress cap found that immigrants added about 2 trillion to the u s gross domestic product gdp in 2016 with more than 40 percent of fortune 500 companies founded by immigrants and their children immigrants they argue complement rather than compete with american workers and will be crucial to filling job openings as baby boomers retire the center for american progress is admittedly liberal and yes george soros is among its many funders along with walmart wells fargo citigroup eli lilly co the united arab emirates and other decidedly non liberal financiers but although the language is a bit different the conservative committee for economic development of the conference board ced applying a cost benefit analysis agrees each immigrant of working age who arrives in the us represents an immediate infusion of human capital into the economy as with any form of investment human capital once formed delivers a stream of future income adding to gdp new immigrants carry with them human capital formed from education training and child rearing they received in their home country once they arrive in the us they add to the productive capacity of the economy the value of which can be assessed by the present value of their future earnings as a result the return on the investment in immigration is quite high as the us economy benefits from the early investment in immigrants human capital made in their home country as the population of new immigrants shifts toward a more educated one these human capital endowments become larger ced estimates the human capital contribution of new immigrants at about 314 billion a year with immigrants more likely to be better educated over time in fact in 2015 nearly half of immigrant arrivals had bachelor s degrees or better with the number of lower skilled and often undocumented workers declining a benefit ced includes in its calculations is that the cost of child rearing and education have already been met in their home countries and will not be borne by u s taxpayers cap researchers found that the poverty rate for immigrants in 2015 was 17 3 percent for u s born 14 3 percent even so immigrant working class households received 9 3 percent of their overall income from public programs such as food stamps social security or welfare while u s born headed households received 15 percent of their income from such programs they also found that more than half of the foreign born are homeowners and that immigrants are becoming homeowners at a faster rate than the u s born population contributing some 3 7 trillion to housing markets unauthorized immigrants the current politically correct term are increasingly entering the u s legally and overstaying their visas the u s department of homeland security dhs found the largest sources of visa violators are from canada mexico and brazil mexicans make up half of the unauthorized immigrant population but mexican legal residents grew faster than their illegal counterparts the majority of unauthorized immigrants are long term u s residents with about two thirds living in the u s for over ten years as of 2014 21 percent of the unauthorized population lived in california 15 percent in texas 8 percent in florida 7 percent in new york 5 percent in new jersey and 4 percent in illinois current immigration law prevents many from applying for legal status some 3 million could qualify for a green card because they have a close relative who is a u s citizen but they would have to leave the country and face up to ten years waiting because of re entry bars put in place in 1996 when democrat bill clinton was president and congress had a republican majority there are many misleading statistics floating around for instance the british daily mail in a march 14 2019 story about the largest groups of naturalized immigrants in each state had a sub head indian settlers came top in nine states and later somalians were the largest group of settlers in three states both statements are factual but and it s a big but the immigrants from india totaled less than 8 000 in those nine states and somalians added up to under 2400 in the three states cited when you compare that with over 40 000 mexicans in california over 20 000 mexicans in texas over 20 000 dominicans in new york and almost 6 000 mexicans in arizona well montana with its largest group of naturalized immigrants being mexicans all 33 of them might not perceive why there is any controversy note that in new york there are some one million puerto ricans that dwarf the dominican migration they are not included in the statistics because the island is a u s territory colony and its people u s citizens albeit often treated as second class when it comes to hurricane relief etc island residents cannot vote for u s president but those that move to the mainland can islanders pay social security and medicare taxes but not federal income tax they have no representation in congress the non partisan economic policy institute epi which is supported in large part by labor unions who might be expected to minimize any positive impacts by immigrants on the labor force found in 2014 that there is broad agreement among academic economists that in the long run immigration has a small but positive impact on the labor market outcomes of native born workers on average there is some debate about whether within the overall small positive effect certain subgroups are harmed in particular native born workers with low levels of education the evidence shows that in the long run immigrants do not reduce native employment rates but some evidence suggests that in the short run immigration may slightly reduce native employment because the economy takes time to adjust to new immigration government policy may have more impact on american jobs than unauthorized workers congress has set a yearly limit on the number of new permanent and temporary immigrants who may enter the country legally in order to work and these limits do not fluctuate based on the state of the labor market for example in 2010 the unemployment rate in construction was over 20 percent but the department of labor nevertheless certified thousands of temporary foreign worker visas for the construction industry there is little evidence that immigrant labor depresses the wages of u s workers but new immigrants do put pressure on earlier immigrants the bigger problems are programs like the guest worker which tie an immigrant employee to one employer with limited rights and no bargaining power if treated badly their only recourse is to leave the country probably in debt from the costs of getting here prevailing wage rules allow those employers to pay less than the market rate and that does depress wages unauthorized workers who complain about conditions or pay face threats of arrest and deportation and so it is greedy employers who force wages downward and not the immigrant workers and according to the social security administration three quarters of those unauthorized immigrant workers are on formal payrolls using someone else s or a made up social security number with fica and medicare taxes to the tune of 7 13 billion a year withheld that they will never collect on similarly income taxes withheld from paychecks are often never claimed for fear of deportation if they file cap estimates that unauthorized immigrants contribute about 7 billion in sales and excise taxes annually plus 3 6 billion in property taxes and over 1 billion in personal income taxes legal status would raise that another 2 2 billion mass deportations on the other hand would cost the federal government billions of dollars over 10 000 per person and states with large unauthorized immigrant populations would take a significant hit to their economies 103 billion in california 60 billion in texas 40 billion in new york and 26 billion in new jersey the bottom line as conservative john daniel davidson wrote in the march 14 2019 issue of the federalist is that low skilled workers are coming to america in large numbers because american employers want to hire them emphasis in the original that was true in the 19thcentury when large numbers of chinese immigrants were employed as railroad laborers and it s true today as even larger numbers of illegal immigrants from mexico and central america find employment in farming construction and manufacturing in other words market forces are at play u s employers have a demand for cheap labor and plenty of foreign born laborers are willing to meet it part 3 will examine the roots of the present migrations especially from central america and mexico part 4 will consider the war on drugs and the role of immigrants
a deceleration in industrial activity and the fear of a global economic slowdown are expected to prompt the reserve bank of india to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points in the monetary policy review scheduled on april 4 retail inflation staying below the rbi s 4 per cent target is a comfort factor for the central bank to put through a second rate cut on the trot market players say a rate cut to support growth will be opportune industrial growth represented by the index of industrial production dipped to 1 7 per cent in january from 2 6 per cent in december 2018 though the retail inflation as measured by the consumer price index rose to a four month high of 2 57 per cent in february against 1 97 per cent in january the reading is still lower than the rbi s inflation target of 4 per cent in its sixth monetary policy review in february the central bank had cut the repo rate from 6 50 per cent to 6 25 per cent the repo rate is the rate at which the rbi provides funds to banks to overcome short term liquidity mismatches union bank of india md ceo rajkiran rai g said rate cut seems to be very much visible now the last monetary policy committee mpc meeting talked about output gap opening up modestly i think the rbi was very clear last time when they spoke that they are trying to push growth there are indications of global growth weakening so a rate cut will give a fillip to growth stage ripe for larger cut soumya kanti ghosh group chief economic advisor state bank of india said rural demand continues to look increasingly weak and fragile urban demand is also worrying a deceleration in global trade growth is also impacting export outlook through the trade channel investment scenario as can be inferred from order inflows has declined in q3fy19 by 20 per cent credit growth is not broad based and is in selective areas we expect at least a 25 basis points rate cut in the april policy cumulative 50 75 bps over next 2 3 policies though we believe the stage is ripe for a larger rate cut if the rate cut is of 25 basis points only then the rbi could indicate more cuts through a possible shift in stance policy statement

iceland is a tiny little country with just 338 000 people about the population of santa ana ca but that doesn t mean it can t teach us lessons about public policy i wrote about the nation s approach to fisheries in 2016 and explained that the property rights based system is the best way of protecting fish stocks from over harvesting and in 2013 i wrote about how modest spending restraint was helping to solve fiscal problems created by the financial crisis today i want to further explore iceland s fiscal policy largely because of this remarkable chart that accompanied a bloomberg report on the country s budget strategy as you can see debt skyrocketed during the financial crisis and has since plummeted at a very rapid rate this shows debt reduction is possible indeed there can be huge reductions in a very short period of time so there may be hope for nations that are in the midst of fiscal crisis such as greece nations that are about to suffer fiscal crisis italy is a prime candidate and nations that will suffer a crisis if there isn t reform most developed nations including the united states but what are the specific policy lessons here are some excerpts from the accompanying article which basically tells us that the government is focused on spending restraint iceland will continue to reduce public debt and sustain a budget surplus even as it lowers taxes in the next five years finance minister bjarni benediktsson said the plan is part of a financial road map the balancing act between austerity and the proposed fiscal concessions means less room for the government to step up other spending we will need to impose certain measures of restriction benediktsson said the government may have to seek cost savings of as much as 5 billion kronur 42 million he said the financial plan projects a decrease in taxes as well as the treasury s debt levels and interest burden it also expects the bank tax to be lowered in four steps but the article didn t tell us why iceland s debt fell so quickly so i dug into the imf s world economic outlook database and crunched some numbers i specifically wanted to find out why debt fell both before and after the 2008 crisis and i focused on three sets of numbers annual inflation rate annual growth of government spending burden annual increase in nominal gross domestic product here are those numbers both for the years leading up to the 2008 crisis as well as what happened starting in 2009 for both the 2001 07 period and 2009 19 period iceland followed my golden rule government spending the orange bars grew slower than the economy the grey bars so it shouldn t be a surprise that debt fell during both eras but debt fell much faster starting in 2009 for the simple reason that the gap between spending growth and gdp growth was very significant over the past 10 years this is the reason for the big reduction in debt voters in iceland had an opportunity to vote on bank bailouts and 93 percent said no and this spending restraint also generated some data that s even more important the burden of government spending has dropped from more than 48 percent of economic output in 2009 to less than 41 percent of gdp this year during the 2001 2007 period by contrast iceland only barely satisfied the golden rule indeed one could argue that spending was growing much too fast since the economy was in an unsustainable boom ireland was similarly profligate during the same period p s i recently shared an excellent imf study showing three examples of big debt reductions in the pre world war i era p p s unsurprisingly the oecd has been pushing for higher taxes in iceland p p p s if you want to read about all of iceland s pro market economic prof hannes gissurarson has a must read article in econ journal watch p p p p s voters in iceland had an opportunity to vote on bank bailouts and 93 percent said no this article is reprinted with permission from international liberty

sean speer and robert asselin are senior fellows at the university of toronto s munk school of global affairs public policy they are co authors of the new public policy forum paper entitled a new north star canadian competitiveness in an intangible economy which will be released on thursday nearly 250 years after adam smith s the wealth of nations we may be undergoing one of the biggest shifts ever in what drives economic competitiveness it s critical that we take notice and begin to understand what it means for public policy and canada s economy the debate in canada prefers to dwell on the familiar territory of corporate tax rates here versus those of the united states government deficits and fleeting metrics such as average weekly earnings or the monthly unemployment rate this isn t wrong these old classics still matter but it isn t right either to fixate on short term indicators that matter less and less in this age of technological change technology is creating a whole new set of determinants of national wealth these economic developments require urgent attention consider a new and different economic metric about canada s near and long term prospects roughly 70 per cent of the value of the toronto stock exchange today consists of intangible assets such as brands intellectual property and data the same share for the s p 500 in the united states is 91 per cent for europe it s 77 per cent this tells us three things markets are placing far greater value on patents over physical plants and intellectual property over real estate canada is falling behind our competitors on this measure of where growth increasingly comes from and even here in a land replete in natural resources the trend toward a new data driven and knowledge based economy is significant and accelerating we need to better factor in how we think of the wealth of our particular country the rise of the intangible economy requires us to re evaluate refine and reorient how we think about economic policy and aim to position canada to compete in a new market dynamic the stakes are high we need to make the right choices today if we want to thrive in an era of intangibles and some of these decisions challenge decades of conventional wisdom what do we mean when we talk about the intangible economy the intangible economy is one that s no longer just fuelled by capital assets such as equipment machinery and assembly plants and instead is driven by intangible assets such as brands domain names service contracts computer software data and patented technologies the intangible economy is principally about accumulating assets that produce continuous streams of rents with low or no capital requirements after initial investments and therefore have practically zero marginal costs think of data for instance a single piece of data can fuel multiple algorithms analytics and applications and so the data owner operates with minimal costs and with greater chance of dominating a market monopoly there s a growing view among entrepreneurs and policy observers that the intangible economy represents a new economic paradigm it s something fundamentally different conventional economic and policy thinking fails to account for its peculiarities as jonathan haskel and stian westlake have written in a path breaking book entitled capitalism without capital the rise of the intangible economy there is something fundamentally different about intangible investment and that understanding the steady move to intangible investment helps us understand some of the key issues facing us today innovation and growth inequality the role of management and financial and policy reform these debates and discussions about the intangible economy s scalability and winner take all dynamics are increasingly present in technology hubs such as waterloo ont but are only starting to spill into the world of politics and policy it s critical that policy makers start to get their collective heads around these issues and their implications for canada s economic policy framework what does it mean for public policy and how will it affect canadian competitiveness there are certainly some who argue audaciously and somewhat persuasively that the intangible economy requires a whole new model of economic thinking and then there are others who contend that the differences are overstated and that conventional economic thinking and attendant policies remain by and large sufficient we fall somewhere in the middle of these two poles the rise of the intangible economy doesn t mean that we should discard the insights of economists and scholars who have studied the drivers of economic growth since smith s seminal work time proven ideas such as the role of incentives the laws of competition and the limits of state planning will continue to apply but there s certainly a need to refine conventional pro competitiveness policies and adopt new ones in light of emerging issues flowing from the intangibles paradigm policy makers must apply this new lens to traditional policies such as education taxation regulation foreign direct investment and intellectual property as well as the development of policies in emergent issues such as data governance and ownership this process will involve trial and error intergovernmental co operation and a disciplined focus on the long term we won t solve these issues overnight but we also cannot afford to be merely reactive the next government will invariably make policy choices that have long term implications for canadian competitiveness in the intangible economy as we grapple with these tensions policy makers will need to balance the opportunities and challenges associated with the intangible economy without neglecting or harming those sectors such as natural resources that sustain investment and employment across the country the good news is that it s not a binary choice there s considerable overlap between old and new traditional and modern tangible and intangible canada s natural resource sector for instance is increasingly drawing on cutting edge technologies and processes to drive efficiencies and reduce its carbon emissions data nanotechnology and other innovations are reshaping traditional sectors as much as they re creating new ones it s the modern manifestations of these traditional sectors in fact where canada may be best poised to become a global innovation leader it s no accident for instance that finance minister bill morneau s advisory council on economic growth identified agriculture and agri food as well as energy and renewables as two of the four domestic sectors with the highest potential for canada to compete and win this economic dualism requires policy makers enact an agenda that recognizes the continuing importance of traditional sectors and their technology driven transformations and the emergence of the new intangible economy and its unique characteristics and policy peculiarities the role of human capital is the one major commonality between the two smart dynamic people have been a key input into innovation and growth in the past and will continue to be in the future attracting training and retaining human capital will thus remain a key bridge between these two economic paradigms there are various policy ideas and recommendations that policy makers will need to consider in order to better invest in human capital in particular and support canadian competitiveness in general such policy reforms will necessarily cover the traditional drivers of competitiveness as well as the new drivers for the intangible economy but as important as these prescriptions may be the main takeaway is for policy makers and the canadian public to start to better understand the rise of the intangible economy and what it may mean for our old assumptions and the need for new thinking we should neither chase new ideas merely because of their novelty nor stick to old ones because of nostalgia competitiveness is a dynamic matter policy making in the intangible era will require continuing evaluation adjustment and most importantly a multipartisan set of long term competitiveness objectives what we have come to describe as canada s economic north star canada has been generally well served by a north star that was broadly shared across the political spectrum beginning first with the policies and institutions domestic and international of the postwar era and then from the mid 1980s to the present we believe it s time to reflect upon a new north

new york cnn business 1 easy money the past decade of ultra low interest rates has spawned the rise of zombie companies these debt laden firms don t make enough to even cover their interest payments that s never a good sign the number of zombie companies in advanced economies last year stood at 536 or 13 of the total according to bank of america merrill lynch that s a surprising figure given that the global economy was strong in 2018 in fact the number of zombie companies isn t far from the peak of 626 seen during the depths of the great recession bofa said last time it was easy to be a zombie because everyone s profits were collapsing michael hartnett bofa s chief investment strategist said in an interview so what s the excuse this time economists blame the era of extremely low interest rates easy money allows companies to borrow cheaply and low rates encourage investors to gamble on riskier companies the federal reserve held interest rates near zero for almost a decade and pumped its balance sheet up to 4 5 trillion central banks have pushed interest rates to zero therefore nobody can go bankrupt harnett said while the fed steadily raised rates beginning in 2015 it announced plans this month to halt rate hikes because of slowing economic growth central bankers in europe and japan meanwhile have yet to lift interest rates out of negative territory poor use of resources borrowing money especially at affordable rates is not a bad thing at all adding debt allows companies to invest in the future by building new factories buying equipment hiring workers and researching next generation products and easy money helped breathe life into global stock markets inspiring confidence along the way but zombie companies are wasteful you are keeping companies afloat that should not be in business hartnett said those businesses are using resources such as capital or labor that could be used more efficiently elsewhere to stay alive zombie companies require greater and greater amounts of capital they need to frequently tap the capital markets for more of it zombie firms are less productive and crowd out investment in and employment at more productive firms ryan nilandri banerjee and boris hofmann wrote in a september 2018 paper published by the bank for international settlements which is owned by 60 global central banks it s not just a post crisis problem the bis paper found that the presence of zombie firms has ratcheted up since the late 1980s a period of stubbornly low interest rates while only 2 of companies in advanced economies were zombies in the late 1980s the authors said that figure climbed to 12 in 2016 and rather than recovering or exiting the zombie state through bankruptcy companies today tend to stay that way for longer the phenomenon isn t healthy because of how it saps the rest of the economy of resources but it might not become a problem as long as interest rates remain low the catch would be if historically low unemployment in the united states and a shortage of skilled workers causes wages to rapidly rise that would force the fed to resume aggressive interest rate hikes if inflation starts surprising to the upside then suddenly these zombie companies have a much bigger problem bofa s hartnett said 2 jobs report the us jobs report for march comes out on friday and it will give greater insight into how much wages are rising the us economy added only 20 000 jobs in february a surprisingly low number that fell short of huge jobs gains in the months prior economists will watch to see if it was a one time fluke or part of a broader trend there s some concern that february s numbers were a sign that the economy is running out of available workers after 101 consecutive months of job growth 3 brexit debate uk lawmakers rejected prime minister theresa may s brexit deal for a third time on friday extending the country s political and economic uncertainty the rejection raises the chances of either a longer delay to brexit or the united kingdom crashing out of europe without a deal on april 12 parliament will hold a second vote on alternatives to may s deal monday 4 second quarter kickoff after a horrible end to 2018 stocks notched one of their best first quarters ever the s p 500 rose 13 its best quarter since 2009 that s boosting optimism heading into the second quarter even after the us bond market flashed recession a big start to the year historically has suggested the bulls could remain in charge the rest of the year said ryan detrick senior market strategist at lpl financial in a recent note in fact 9 of the past 10 times the s p 500 was up at least 10 during the first quarter the rest of the year was also in the green 5 coming this week monday us february retail sales us ism manufacturing tuesday walgreens wba earnings us february durable goods orders wednesday us ism services thursday constellation brands stz earnings reserve bank of india rate decision friday us march jobs report eu finance ministers meet
john smith former oil rig worker bus driver telecommunications engineer longtime activist in the anti war and latin american solidarity movements and author of imperialism in the twenty first century globalization super exploitation and capitalism s final crisis monthly review press january 2016 discusses the question of imperialism in the following interview taken by farooque chowdhury during july 2018 february 2019 the interview in slightly abridged form originally appeared on mr online on march 19 22 and 23 2019 the analyses interpretations and observations made the narratives presented the terms used and the way persons politics ideologies and trends characterized in the interview are completely of john smith and those don t always correspond to the interviewer s opinion interpretation etc following is the 2nd part of the four part interview q7 is there any difference between the way imperialism behaved during the cold war and the way it is behaving now and what is are the reason s if there s any difference js an almost impenetrable thicket of myths and falsehoods surrounds the so called cold war which was anything but cold for the billions of people who live in africa asia and latin america the dominant narrative is that the war was between the west led by the united states which was trying to spread capitalism and democracy and the east led by the soviet union which was trying to spread socialism and communism it is absurd to claim that the installation by the usa and its allies of countless bloodthirsty dictators from the shah to saddam to somoza had anything to do with spreading democracy but the first part of the dominant narrative is correct the usa and its imperialist allies were indeed fighting a war to spread capitalism and crush any resistance to it what is false is that the soviet union was trying to spread socialism and communism on the contrary time and again the fake revolutionaries who ruled the ussr provided crucial assistance to the imperialists the stalinist stages theory of history held that anti capitalist revolutions were impossible in nations oppressed by imperialism because the working class was too small and weak and because the task of the day was to abolish feudal and other pre capitalist obstacles to the spread of capitalism and its proponents argued that a protracted period of capitalist development was necessary before class contradictions in these nations could come to approximate those in the imperialist nations and only then could the struggle for socialism could be put on the agenda so instead of leading struggles to bring revolutionary governments of workers and farmers to power moscow instructed the communist parties under its control to become junior partners in alliances with the supposedly progressive wing of the national bourgeoisie leading to countless catastrophic defeats iran in 1953 and indonesia in 1965 being two major examples as che guevara said the indigenous bourgeoisies have lost all capacity to oppose imperialism if they ever had any there are no other alternatives either a socialist revolution or a caricature of a revolution it is notable that the only revolutionary victories during the so called cold war occurred under the leadership of communist parties that had broken at least partially from subservience to moscow yugoslavia china korea vietnam or of revolutionary movements and parties that had never been in moscow s orbit in the first place e g cuba nicaragua algeria perhaps the most instructive example is that of vietnam at the potsdam conference in july 1945 the victors truman churchill assisted by labour party leader clement attlee whose election as prime minister of britain was confirmed mid conference and stalin met to share out the spoils of victory hoping to continue the ussr s wartime alliance with the supposed to be the antifascist progressive wing of imperialism stalin agreed that france s indochinese colonies should be returned to their rightful owner namely france in defiance of this on september 2 1945 before half a million people gathered in hanoi ho chi minh proclaimed an independent democratic republic of vietnam but nothing was done to prepare an appropriate welcome for imperialist troops including 20 000 soldiers of the 20th indian division part of the indian army under britain s colonial command sent to enforce the nefarious decision taken at potsdam instead acting under moscow s orders the icp leadership greeted the first contingents of british troops to arrive on 12 13 september with welcome banners and attempted to shake hands with their commander general gracey but were contemptuously brushed aside gracey seized government buildings declared martial law freed japanese prisoners of war armed them and used them as a temporary police force until french military forces arrived to reinstate their colonial rule following this utterly avoidable disaster the vietnamese liberation forces resumed their struggle and pledged to never again subordinate their interests to the foreign policy of another power vietnam in 1945 was far from the only time that stalin acted as an accomplice to imperialism s crimes vietnam s history has similarities with korea s which stalin churchill and roosevelt agreed should be also divided and placed under military occupation at their notorious february 1945 meeting in yalta leading to the korean war in which the us dropped more bombs than had been used by both sides in the pacific theatre of world war ii by 1953 two and half million koreans lay dead but even this did not crush their resistance to imperialist occupation aided by some 300 000 soldiers from china whose social revolution triumphed in 1949 korea s working people led by kim il sung and the korean workers party inflicted the first ever military defeat upon the united states for which they have never been forgiven and for which they continue to be cruelly punished moscow s official policy throughout the cold war was peaceful coexistence code for class collaboration and can be understood as the continuation of its post war betrayal of the korean and vietnamese outlined above there are many other nations and peoples on this list not least the jews of europe and the people of palestine both of whom were betrayed by moscow s anti semitism and by its connivance with the establishment of israel in 1948 these facts are not widely known not even among left wing and progressive forces because neither liberal nor conservative opinion formers have any interest in reminding us of these facts and neither do those left wing movements who have their origins in the stalin led communist movement the dominant mainstream narrative on the cold war has yet to be seriously challenged on the contrary the truth is buried under more and more layers of rubbish yet only a moment s thought is needed to see its absurdity and its deeply reactionary nature the east in the east west confrontation was moscow yet moscow is geographically speaking part of the west the eastern edge of white europe the real east is invisible in this risible incredibly eurocentric narrative and the same fate of invisibility befalls the entire south the north south conflict i e the struggle between imperialism and its colonies and neo colonies is entirely collapsed into the so called east west conflict liberation struggles and revolutionary movements from asia to africa to latin america are regarded as mere pawns of moscow without grievances of their own without any agency of their own this is not only absurd it is also transparently racist only by exposing the lies that are contained in the term cold war can i answer the question about whether there has been any change in imperialist behavior since it ended with the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 just as the very notion of the cold war is premised on falsehood it is also false that the west won the cold war the collapse of the soviet union and the partial eclipse of the political forces that looked to moscow for leadership has severely weakened an important prop of the imperialist world order far from inaugurating a unipolar world in which the usa and its imperialist allies could exercise untrammeled power the post cold war world has seen accelerating chaos and disorder the imperialists convinced themselves that they had won a great victory and celebrated by launching a series of wars in the middle east and central asia beginning with george bush senior s war on iraq in 1991 in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the berlin wall but their hubris led to overconfidence and each and every military adventure they have undertaken since the end of the cold war has led them into a quagmire of death division and recrimination with nothing resembling a victory in sight unfortunately if the imperialists cannot be said to have won the cold war neither can it be said that victory belongs to their adversaries the working class and oppressed peoples of the world victory never falls into our lap it must be fought for what s lacking are revolutionary leaders of the caliber of lenin che fidel grenada s maurice bishop thomas sankara of burkina faso and others and political movements inspired by them able to take advantage of the imperialists growing weakness and disarray financialization and imperialism q8 have monopoly finance capital and financialization impacted imperialism and how if there s any impact js we need some clarity about what these two terms mean to take the first of them as lenin explained in imperialism the highest stage of capitalism monopoly finance capital is the result of two parallel processes that mark the transition to the imperialist stage of development the process of concentration and centralization of capital and the separation of ownership from management the question therefore needs to be reformulated because it suggests that monopoly finance capital is something external to imperialism and exerts an impact on it from the outside all of this underlines an essential point when we talk about imperialism we are not talking about imperialism in general as it has existed throughout the ages we are talking specifically about capitalist imperialism the imperialist stage of capitalist development monopoly finance capital didn t exist when sargon the great built the akkadian empire in mesopotamia 4 300 years ago or 500 years ago when the mughal kings unified the indian subcontinent financialization can be defined in different ways but at its most basic it refers in the words of john bellamy foster to the shift in gravity of economic activity from production and even from much of the growing service sector to finance see where you will also see an excellent discussion of the origin of this term so financialization pertains to the sphere of circulation where titles of ownership are exchanged but where nothing is produced yet the shift in the gravity of economic activity that john bellamy foster talks about is manifested in the fact that banking insurance and other financial activities make up an ever growing portion of the gdp of imperialist countries which just goes to show that what bourgeois economists call gross domestic product has less and less connection with what is actually produced within a domestic economy with the notable exception of the monthly review school recent studies of this phenomenon by avowedly marxist and left keynesian economists attempt to theorize financialization in isolation from the transformations that have taken place in the sphere of production especially the globalization of production processes and their large scale relocation to low wage countries this is a serious flaw but not so surprising since these same schools of thought deny the centrality or even existence of imperialism nevertheless many of these studies do shed light on the complex processes that make up this important phenomenon especially the financiers ingenuity in converting hypothetical future income streams into present day wealth thereby generating vast quantities of what karl marx called fictitious capital that is financial assets whose value is disconnected from the actual productive activity if any they give title to debt is the principal tool used to accomplish this as martin wolf said shortly after the beginning of the financial crisis financial times april 1 2008 between its low in the first quarter of 1982 and its high in the second quarter of 2007 the share of the financial sector s profits in us gross domestic product rose more than six fold behind this boom was an economy wide rise in leverage leverage was the philosopher s stone that turned economic lead into financial gold attempts to reduce it now risk turning the gold back into lead again yet the attempts to reduce debt that wolf speaks of have been feeble to say the least according to the international institute of finance aggregate debt that is sovereign corporate and domestic debt now stands at 320 of global gdp compared to 270 on the eve of the global financial crisis in 2007 what s more some especially risky categories of debt are growing much faster in particular debt owed by private non financial corporations in so called emerging economies who have been tempted by historically low interest rates we can be certain that the next financial crisis and there surely is one waiting for us around the corner will wreak its havoc far beyond europe and north america where its effects were concentrated post 2007 so to answer your question once again it s not a matter of financialization impacting upon imperialism but of imperialism revealing its own essential character its increasing parasitism i e the ever greater importance of monopoly rents of all kinds and of rent seeking behavior versus unmediated profit making from productive activities q 9 is it possible to differentiate monopoly finance capital and imperialist capital or is there any need requirement to make the differentiation for studying imperialism js i think it follows from my answers to earlier questions that monopoly finance capital and imperialist capital are synonymous more important than the labels themselves are the meanings we attach to them this depends on the context in which they are used on what else we say technical terms and the names of theoretical concepts can all too easily be used to mystify rather than to clarify to impress rather than to express
after weathering stock market gyrations a government shutdown and the looming threat of a trade war economists are starting to worry that the resilience of the american consumer has finally been exhausted consumer spending ticked up just 0 1 percent in january and december s drop of 0 5 percent was revised down to a 0 6 percent decrease february spending data has been delayed by a month due to the effects of the government shutdown personal income grew by 0 2 percent in february this was a recovery from the 0 1 percent drop it sustained in january but was below expectations of an 0 3 percent increase the spending numbers continue to be disappointing in tune with the broader economic concerns that materialized in december and january said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com the surge in consumption last year on the back of the tax cuts has now been followed by a sharp correction pantheon macroeconomics chief economist ian shepherdson said in a note to clients without the impact of a big tax cut to goose spending the economy appears to be settling back to the more moderate growth that characterized much of the economic recovery commerce department figures released thursday found that the economy grew just 2 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 a downward revision from the initial estimate of 2 6 percent full year growth was a modest 2 9 percent below the 3 plus percent the white house had projected the bigger picture here is that the trend in real consumption is reverting to its pre tax cut pace about 2 5 percent annualized shepherdson said although the federal reserve s recent decision to hold off on rate raising buoyed market sentiment there are growing indications that the optimism of average americans is starting to fray the university of michigan s surveys of consumers found that consumer sentiment had rebounded from february but overall sentiment as well as current conditions and future expectations were all down from a year earlier earlier this week the consumer confidence index showed a drop of 7 3 points with assessments of both current and future economic conditions falling confidence has been somewhat volatile over the past few months as consumers have had to weather volatility in the financial markets a partial government shutdown and a very weak february jobs report lynn franco senior director of economic indicators at the conference board said in a statement my sense is that consumer sentiment reflects what people see and what they hear on the news said harry holzer professor of public policy at georgetown university the michigan survey is tied mostly to the stock market it s very sensitive to swings in stock prices while the conference board survey is more tied to the job market said mark zandi chief economist for moody s analytics the diminished optimism expressed by the survey respondents could be an early indicator that the job market is weakening february s anemic job growth might not have been a fluke but rather an indication of how much and how fast economic growth will slow we have a bit of a puzzle holzer said the labor market is extremely tight but there is evidence of slowing in the economy for 2019 my guess is the employment data we re going to get going forward is going to be meaningfully softer the labor market s still good but it deteriorated very measurably last month zandi said now that we ve seen the stabilization of the employment rate then people start to think about saving more said ian harnett chief investment strategist at absolute strategy in london as people adjust their behavior as a hedge against the rising threat of job loss as a percentage of disposable income the personal savings rate was 7 5 percent in january according to the commerce department this was slightly below december s 7 7 percent savings rate which marked a roughly three year high i think consumers have turned more cautious in their spending and will remain so i think they ll keep spending but with less gusto zandi said this could hurt job growth across a variety of sectors from manufacturing to construction to tourism the conference board found that the percentage of americans who expect more jobs in the months ahead fell in the immediate term a growing percentage of americans say jobs are hard to get while fewer consider the number of available jobs plentiful the economy is still we believe slowing and it s actually slowing quite sharply harnett said at the moment we re finding it difficult to find positive charts that can paint a positive story on the outlook for the u s economy and the global economy
i recently attended the solar energy industry association s seia finance and tax seminar in new york the subject matter in this event delved into issues related to tax equity finance each panel session was moderated by a tax attorney or an accountant and most of the content of the sessions consisted of technical tax law to place the discipline into context one speaker noted that the tax equity renewables investing deal volume in 2018 was 2 3b for solar and 9b for wind and the number of tax equity participants is roughly only 25 35 large corporations so unless there are changes to the tax code that would widen the range of entities that could benefit from tax equity investing the pool of investors is not likely to broaden parabolically total investments in the us for renewables in 2018 was estimated by bloomberg new energy finance at 43b and globally totaled 300b total for all clean energy investments including equity raising by companies in smart grid digital energy energy storage and electric vehicle estimates from numerous ngo s contend that the rate of investment needed to transition rapidly enough to bend the ghg temperature curves is more like 1 2tr per year so the scale of tax equity investment although substantial and growing is estimated to be less than 20 of the build rate needed to deliver 80 renewable electricity per various transition targets proposed by various states the green new deal others the keynote session was moderated by a principal from novogradac an accounting firm with a large renewables practice who prefaced with a very brief overview of the mechanics of the 3 primary partnership structures commonly used in the industry the partnership flip structure sale leasebacks inverted leases a second session titled solar finance 101 led by an attorney from norton rose fulbright was provided specifically to elaborate on the structures in a partnership flip the general partner sponsor developer starts by holding 1 of equity and the tax equity investor tei is the limited partner holding 99 a flip in the ratio to gp 95 lp 5 is triggered either by reaching a target yield usually 5 7 yrs or a date certain 6 8 years the target roi for the tei in a yield based version is in the range of 6 5 earned from investment tax credits against prior losses development costs and some portion of operating cash flow the fixed term version requires different terms for the investors to achieve the desired yield and usually extends 6 8 years the fixed flip leaves as much cash as possible for the sponsor and pays the tei s cash as a 2 preferred distribution in the 101 session the main challenge was identified as how to get a step up in tax basis so that benefits are calculated on fair market value rather than on cost or dcf discounted cash flow she cited 3 court cases that will be adjudicating a the allowable standard for this valuation b whether developer fees should be limited to 12 18 and c whether use of dcf with a low discount rate that artificially raises value should be disallowed as a disguised sale the test imposed by the irs would disallow the itc claim if the dcf is the same after the end of the ppa term dcf should be different in the merchant period usually expected to be 7 5 to compensate for the variability risks of merchant pricing absorption was the other key element discussed throughout the conference and is one of the more complex aspects of partnership taxation the capital account for each partner documents what each has contributed and is allowed to take out in tax benefits and cannot drop below zero tax efficiency characterizes whether the tax benefits can be fully taken by either party or remain partially unclaimed if the tei capital account is at risk for drawing down too much such that the tax benefits would re allocate back to the sponsor who also could not use them then the remedy is often a deficit restoration obligation dro in which the sponsor indemnifies the tei a 2nd form used for tax equity financing is a sale leaseback which involves an outright sale of 100 of the equity in the project by the sponsor to the tei who then leases it back to the sponsor lease payments are a revenue stream from the sponsor leasee back to the tei leasor 100 ownership avoids complicated partnership accounting while preserving the tei s rights to the tax benefits but still carries a risk of irs disallowance if the tei is treated as a lender rather than an owner a 3rd form is an inverted lease which is used frequently in aggregations of residential rooftop pv systems the sponsor bundles the customer contracts assigns them to the tei and leases the equipment assets to the tei who collects the customer revenue pays most of it back to the sponsor as rent itc s are claimed by the tei but depreciation stays with the sponsor who then takes back the depreciated assets at the end of the lease term distribution of operating cashflow can be convoluted in all these structures with competing claims from tax equity investors v lenders but several panelists seemed to reflect a consensus that this structure tends to leave comparably more of the cashflow for the developer or cash equity investors it is more complex conceptually because there are two partnerships an operating entity an ownership entity and both parties tei and sponsor participate in both entities in the ownership entity the sponsor holds a majority position and becomes the leasor and the operating entity owned by the tei becomes the master tenant leasee and transfers rents back to the leasor risks of irs challenge to the basis used to calculate tax credits can be managed by documentation that transactions have occurred at arms length and costs have been clearly segregated that capital accounts remain positive and that an appraisal solidly establishes the value this basis risk is usually borne by the developer but is often capped at the difference between project completed value minus costs as encapsulated by midsized funder captona tax equity financing has an asymmetric contingent liability a 5 upside but a 50 downside recapture basis risk of irs challenge that can result in disallowance of the tax credits or decertification of partnership status each structure has pros cons but they all seek to optimize and protect the tax benefits for the tei and the cashflow for the sponsor and each varies in dealing with indemnifications cash sweeps and buybacks clearly there is a fine art in selecting the optimum structure to suit the needs of the participants and then negotiating each variable element but surprisingly when asked if these agreements were prone to litigation to resolve disputes the answer was no bespoke agreements can be designed with bolt on boilerplate options for contingent indemnifications cash sweeps buyback terms and other assurances disincentives to avoid the need for dispute resolution which would be adjudicated on the contract terms anyhow for deeper dives into resources that illustrate technical renewable finance modeling one can go to powerpoints produced by akin gump a conference sponsor and finance energy institute ed

gaf bundled roofing and solar systems for both c i offtakers and residential aggregations in portfolios sized 50 100mw and then financed them with tax equity partnerships usually structured as yield based flips all of which he said had been over subscribed in some cases they took long duration credit positions on their own he explained that their terms provided tax equity investors with max of 34 of eligible basis referencing an economic substance test that allows for 3 irr if the capital stack is limited to 34 in tax equity tei will usually then be able to utilize 99 of the depreciation and remainder of return comes from 7 of ebitda as unlevered cash distributed at the same time as distributions to the gp builder he commented that leverage helps utilize the tax basis goldman sachs gs who

some markets remain attractive ny il va pjm and pending rps legislation in other states is driving interest but the development horizons are being stretched beyond 3yrs which means these projects must be held much longer on balance sheets or in relatively expensive development facilities he recommends developers pull back from taking a buckshot approach carrying the risks of holding partially developed inventory and instead focus on the fundamentals of locational marginal pricing congestion policy there are 150gw of solar projects waiting for utility interconnection approvals many projects

pjm and pending rps legislation in other states is driving interest but the development horizons are being stretched beyond 3yrs which means these projects must be held much longer on balance sheets or in relatively expensive development facilities the hurdles to accelerating decarbonization of electricity are not availability of capital or lack of enterprising initiative but a bottleneck at interconnection the solutions to that problem must be resolved by reconfiguring structural impediments imposed by utilities and utility commissions technological advances are driving lcoe to fall faster than grid adaptations and even with declining yields capital markets demand for renewable assets are outpacing wacc for development but for the drag of a centralized grid the components are in place to accelerate implementation of a gnd level vision for renewable electricity
the 2019 model bernie sanders has aged well looking as spry as he did four years ago his speeches are the same too but where they were once dismissed as too radical they are now mainstream clearly focusing on the ills of an america that has grown more inequitable since he last ran for president those were my impressions when i joined about 12 000 others last week and heard him speak at grand park a big grassy space across from los angeles city hall the ability of his organization to build such a crowd in a city accused wrongly of political apathy was impressive almost a year shy of the california presidential primary sanders team had assembled an email network and social media connections recruited and deployed dozens of volunteers relentlessly contacted lists of potential supporters and moved them into long lines patiently waiting to enter the park not only are we going to win california we are going to win the democratic nomination sanders shouted but one rally does not make a campaign beyond the park as well as beyond the city limits are the millions of victims of an economy and society growing progressively more unequal draw a circle around grand park on a map of metropolitan los angeles and it will encompass all the ills of an inequitable america to the east is skid row with streets crowded with homeless people farther east and south and west are crowded neighborhoods where immigrants and native born share poverty and send their children to public schools unable to equip them to earn a living wage in a cutthroat competitive technically oriented world bad health inadequate diets a shortage of physicians and nurses and the need to work two or three jobs to survive add up to insurmountable barriers extend the imaginary circle to the entire country and it will include urban centers and the unemployed and underemployed residents of rural counties in the grips of the epidemic of drug deaths and suicide the coming election is about these people some are trump voters some are not among them are the many victims of the huge gap between the rich elite on top and the growing number of poor people i ve always thought that health care is the issue that encompasses every aspect of this inequality a belief that has been strengthened each time i visited a county hospital or a clinic without the certainty of care millions are a step away from financial ruin and death for the third straight year life expectancy in america is in decline sanders said at the rally we are going to change that during the event i talked to people about health care i approached two women sandy reding and rebecca prediletto who were wearing the red shirts of the california nurses association their union was a major force behind sanders four years ago embracing a concept then ridiculed by cautious democratic mainstreamers medicare for all earlier in the week sanders had spoken at a nurses union rally at ucla where the nurses had staged a one day walkout in support of members in other parts of the state this particular saturday was the day before the revelation of the report giving president trump so called exoneration in the russian investigation but as the democratic victories in last year s house elections showed health care means more to voters than the president s relations with the russians the following week trump scorning the election results moved to kill obamacare we ve been on the ground canvassing for medicare for all reding said their reception both nurses said was much different than it was four years ago it s the difference between night and day she said these are people who come out after they have done their research medicare for all is the fire starter the catalyst it is a catalyst because guaranteed medical care as represented by medicare for all would bring about a great improvement in american life on many levels obamacare or the affordable care act has already made life better i saw that when community health care clinics for the poor began to expand immediately after president obama signed the law that will always be identified with him just a few weeks before these clinics had feared closure or sharp reductions the center on budget policy and priorities estimates that 20 million americans have gained coverage by receiving affordable care act subsidies since obamacare became law that s in addition to young people who have been added to the rolls the new eligibility of those with pre existing conditions and recipients of medicaid obama made major compromises to win approval for his proposal this left defects in the program his efforts to remedy them failed because of republican opposition and democratic inability to agree on a fix improvements have been proposed by congressional democrats a simple cure would be to increase the subsidy leaving in place obamacare s complex system of private insurance public marketplaces and a variety of plans with different costs and benefits even simpler would be to eliminate private insurance including employer plans and provide health insurance through a single government plan that s medicare for all it would be a federal government administered program providing coverage to all u s residents medicare for all would result in a major shift in the way in which health care is financed in the u s away from households employers and states to the federal government and taxpayers the kaiser family foundation says this would be a revolution now impossible to accomplish with republicans in control of the presidency and the senate in addition those with employer provided insurance might be reluctant to give it up rep pramila jayapal of washington presidential candidate sen elizabeth warren and other democrats favor a two track approach making fixes in obamacare while fighting for medicare for all sanders wants to go all the way as soon as possible trump s alternative is brutal it s hard to imagine the harm it would do the country if he succeeds in killing obamacare more than eight years after enactment aca changes to the nation s health system have become embedded and affect nearly everyone in some way according to the kaiser family foundation the numbers of people who could lose coverage if trump succeeds are staggering it would return control of health insurance to the insurance business famous in pre obamacare days for whom it would not cover the kaiser family foundation says 17 million poor americans could lose medicaid coverage and 15 million others could lose aca subsidies that now help pay for policies the foundation says 52 million people have pre existing conditions that are now covered by obamacare but would not be included if it is repealed higher rates for women could return preventative services mandated by the aca could be lost including screening for breast colon and cervical cancer and pregnancy related services such as contraception the requirement for insurance companies to pay for essential services could be lost among these are mental health and substance abuse treatment such illnesses experts say are largely responsible for americans decreasing life expectancy think of all these numbers as human beings it s easy to forget about them with the news media transfixed on finding out whether trump and his shady team tried to cover up electoral and business wrongdoings but these potential victims of obamacare repeal were heard during last year s election when they helped the democrats win the house four years ago even two years ago these concerns were not a major part of the political debate growing income equality changed that the poor as well as members of the working class and middle class white collar sectors find themselves in the same boat too many of them in the gig economy working part time one illness or injury away from disaster the ideas we talked about were considered by mainstream politicians as much too radical sanders said at the grand park rally well brothers and sisters a funny thing happened in the last two years now it is our job to complete the revolution i don t know whether sanders can win with so many democratic candidates floating around it s too early to talk about that but in a los angeles park filled with supporters sanders no longer looked too radical and his victory didn t seem so improbable

president donald trump s trade policies and tariffs reduced u s income at a rate of 1 4 billion per month by the end of last november according to new research from the federal reserve bank of new york princeton university and columbia university the collaborative study found that businesses and consumers saw substantial increases in the price of goods throughout last year including a complete passthrough of u s imposed tariffs onto imported items the economists the new york fed s mary amiti princeton professor stephen redding and columbia professor david weinstein also said americans suffered by a lack of import variety and disruptions to supply chains economists have long argued that there are real income losses from import protection using the evidence to date from the 2018 trade war we find empirical support for these arguments the researchers wrote losses mounted steadily over the year as each wave of tariffs affected additional countries and products and increased substantially after the imposition of the wave 6 tariffs on 200 billion dollars of chinese exports amiti redding and weinstein found that while losses were accumulating at a rate of 1 4 billion per month by last november total losses from january 2018 through november 2018 ballooned to a conservative estimate of 6 9 billion that number may be too low the economists said because their model assumes that the u s government uses tariff tax revenues to offset the welfare burden if the u s government did not offset the cost of the tariffs to the american consumer with the new tax revenues the full value of the tariff payments would be 12 3 billion the white house imposed a variety tariffs on goods imported from economic partners of the u s in 2018 the tit for tat between the u s and china has come as trump and the u s trade representative try to protect american intellectual property and curb a steep trade deficit trump has had varying success with the tariff tactic winning both a revised version of the north american free trade agreement as well as alienating key allies including canada and the european union the white house announced a round of tariffs on 200 billion of products imported from china at a 10 percent rate last year the white house also announced last year the introduction of a 20 percent tariff on the first 1 2 million imported residential washing machines from south korea and a 50 percent tariff on machines above that number lg electronics told retailers less than one week after that decision that it would hike prices the research team also found that american consumers are also harmed during a trade war in terms of the variety of goods they can purchase consumers benefit from open trade and the ability to purchase more unique goods like french wine and colombian coffee for example that might be foregone if trade barriers are high in the three years prior to the imposition of tariffs all categories of goods experienced increases in the number of varieties offered in the u s the researchers said however the imposition of the tariffs is associated with sharp drops in the number of imported varieties entering the u s in all sectors except the wave 1 products washing machines and solar panels they wrote these results suggest that some of the tariffs were prohibitive reducing imports to zero this can create a measurement problem that can arise if we try to assess the price impacts of tariffs on goods that are no longer imported the trade war also caused dramatic turmoil in supply chains as about 165 billion of trade 136 billion of imports and 29 billion of exports is lost or redirected through company and customer efforts to circumvent tariffs we find that the u s tariffs were almost completely passed through into u s domestic prices so that the entire incidence of the tariffs fell on domestic consumers and importers up to now with no impact so far on the prices received by foreign exporters the fed princeton and columbia economists wrote we also find that u s producers responded to reduced import competition by raising their prices

president donald trump ratcheted up his pressure on the federal reserve saying that if the central bank had not mistakenly raised interest rates the u s gross domestic product would be higher and markets would be in a better place the president s comment in a twitter post on friday afternoon was yet another shot across the bow of fed chairman jerome powell who trump has repeatedly rebuked since the fed raised borrowing costs four times last year trump even discussed firing powell bloomberg news reported on dec 21 had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the 3 0 gdp stock market would have both been much higher world markets would be in a better place the president said in the tweet earlier friday white house chief economic adviser larry kudlow called on the fed to immediately cut interest rates by a half percentage point escalating the trump administration s fight with the central bank and challenging its independence kudlow would love to see such a move according to a report by axios which cited an interview friday with the director of the national economic council later on cnbc kudlow said a rate cut would protect the strength of the american economy from weakness abroad though he said such a move isn t needed immediately and the underlying economy isn t slowing the comments follow a report saying stephen moore whom trump plans to nominate to the fed s board also advocated a half point cut fed policy makers last week projected they would keep interest rates on hold for the year compared with their december forecast for two rate hikes as slowing global growth weighs on the u s economy the fed s target benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent fed spokesman david skidmore declined to comment on kudlow s remarks which came days after moore told the new york times that the central bank should ease skidmore also declined to comment on trump s tweet moore is a conservative pundit and supporter of the president who co authored the book trumponomics inside the america first plan to get our economy back on track kudlow said the president has had his views on chair powell they had dinner together i couldn t make the dinner he s our chairman we re not going to displace him policy expectations trump dined with powell at the white house on feb 4 the central bank announced at the time in a statement that said its chief did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy trump s criticism in interviews and on twitter disregarded long standing white house practice of avoiding public comment on monetary policy out of respect for the fed s independence which is an article of faith among investors who purchase u s treasuries kudlow s direct demand for a rate cut took things up a notch it s more than poor form it crosses a line said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton in chicago swonk said she s confident the fed under powell will continue to ignore white house pressure when making monetary policy decisions but kudlow s remarks help chip away at the central bank s independence if it s ok for one white house to do it maybe it s ok for another white house to do it and over time that may have a cumulative effect she said we know that countries that allow their central bank to be run by the political whims of those governing do extremely poorly over time source bloomberg

associated press as a wall street journal article penned by santiago perez put it last week venezuela is run by an anti american socialist government despite the previous truth venezuela is dollarized perez cites estimates that a quarter of its people use the dollar for ordinary transactions from buying ice cream to paying for car repairs that venezuela is essentially a dollar economy is one of those statements of the obvious that is useful when it comes to exposing as wildly false much of what s thought to be true about money venezuela disproves much of what the monetary mystics believe about what they plainly don t understand to see why this is true it s useful to stress yet again that no one exchanges money while we americans use dollars to buy things and while venezuelans similarly utilize the greenback to fulfill their consumptive needs all transactions are about products for products behind every purchase is production of another good or service that enables the purchase applied to venezuela its dollarized existence exposes gresham s law as anything but the latter presumes that bad money pushes out good whereby the more valuable monetary form will gradually disappear as the one lacking credibility is used to liquefy transactions the previous falsehood is accepted wisdom in the economics profession but it s also utter nonsense implicit in what s blindingly obtuse is that someone in possession of tangible goods and services would accept discredited paper money for those goods and services what a laugh economists don t even pretend to be serious anymore blinded by simplistic theory that has no real world applications they don t understand that all production is an expression of demand since it is no producer is going to offer up something of market value in return for paper of questionable value and that is losing value all the time and that would be exchangeable for little to nothing all of the above explains why the dollar increasingly liquefies what s left of venezuela s economy precisely because the dollar is accepted around the world it s the currency of choice in venezuela over the collapsed bolivar the dollar is far from perfect as this column regularly points out but it s an acceptable medium of exchange gresham s law is backwards in the actual world of commerce good money always and everywhere drives out the bad all of what s previously been said will hopefully vivify the laughable notion of central banks and so called money supply monetary mystics who claim a free market orientation they call themselves monetarists or market monetarists believe that the federal reserve and other central banks should control the supply of money in circulation the view is that in controlling it central banks can shrink so called supply when the economy s booming and increase it when the economy is weak as a way of tamping down inflation and deflation readers familiar with the phillips curve thinking that animates keynesian thought probably recognize the monetarist view of the world it s the keynesian view merely turned inside out it s one that similarly embraces the impoverishing notion of economic growth defined by speed limits beyond which inflation breaks out the difference being that free market monetarists think excess or easy money supply is what powers the alleged economic excess keynesians would stop inflation through tax hikes while monetarists would stop it through reduced money supply you can t make this up back to reality the conceit that says central bankers can plan money supply is as boneheaded as the one that says politicians can plan production stating what should be obvious money in circulation is an effect of production where production is abundant so is money abundant to facilitate exchange of products for products reducing what s basic to what is basic it s not by coincidence that manhattan is filled to the brim with dollars while neighboring newark is relatively bereft of same central banks didn t plan this nor did governments money is everywhere in manhattan simply because there s so much production to exchange and it s relatively scarce in newark precisely because there s comparatively little production that rates exchange looking at this through the prism of venezuela there are dollars there because bolivars aren t trusted as a medium of exchange for those who have goods and services to sell that greenbacks increasingly liquefy venezuelan commerce is to some degree an effect of production outside of venezuela whereby those who escaped the socialist paradise send dollars earned to those who stayed the crucial point here is that it s still products for products the consumption taking place inside venezuela a consequence of production outside of it the fed didn t plan this money supply in venezuela but the country s partially working markets did because there are goods to exchange in venezuela there are dollars there if commerce ever grounds to a halt there in total dollar supply will shrink money supply flows to where trade is as opposed to it being an instigator of same all of which leads us to the false notion of money shortages supposedly the fed can engineer shortages of dollars stateside but all one need do to cure oneself of such delusions is to imagine the fed dropping billions into a locale to reverse the alleged shortage imagine it doing so in crushingly impoverished marianna ar the billions would depart almost as quickly as they arrived either citizens would use the money to exit the town themselves or they d spend it only for the money to be banked the latter would ensure a departure of the funds simply because lending and investment opportunities within ola are slim in venezuela there s seemingly a dollar shortage now but it s a consequence of a lack of productivity or better yet a lack of goods and services to facilitate exchange of assuming more economic freedom readers can bet that the supply of dollars circulating in venezuela will surge to reflect this central banks cannot create monetary abundance as much as production makes it an inevitability that s why readers should scoff at commentary about sparse dollar supply there s no such thing there s only sparse production that is made apparent through a reduced amount of dollars what about easy money there s yet again no such thing implicit in the notion of easy money is we trade anything other than products services and labor but we don t easy money connotes money that s hurtling toward debasement which means it s gradually going to disappear from any economy to reflect a lack of trust in its exchangeability dollars can command goods and services in caracas but destroyed bolivars increasingly cannot easy money is nowhere the positive news is that it s expected that venezuelan emigrants will send 4b home in 2019 versus 1 9 billion in 2018 this is a happy sign that dollars are flowing into the wrecked country is evidence that the profit motivated are figuring out ways to work around the maduro regime s policy errors such that 4t will find a consumptive purpose in a country long defined by scarcity good production both inside and outside venezuela has plainly proven a magnet for the money that enables exchange venezuela s dollarization signals better times ahead
twenty five percent of new investment money goes to companies that investors deem to be socially responsible an investing approach that has increased by trillions of dollars in recent years the concept of esg environmental social governance investing is particularly attractive to younger investors many from the millennial generation based on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions labor practices and corporate governance it is unclear whether either lyft or uber should ever pass esg screens while lyft lyft was preparing to go public this week in an ipo valuing the rideshare company above 20 billion facebook was preparing for something else a lawsuit from the federal government over discriminatory housing ads that probably wasn t in the minds of investors back in 2012 when the social network was the silicon valley start up going public that would change the world for the better and improve lives advertisement advertisement it certainly wasn t the message being broadcast by founder and ceo mark zuckerberg who wrote in a letter with the facebook s 1 ipo filing that the company was not just one more company but was built to accomplish a social mission to make the world more open and connected and improve the quality and efficiency of their lives a lot has changed in the way the world views facebook but not in the way these companies message their public market debut lyft s ipo filing included the now typical founders letter talking about the company s larger than business mission and it stated it pretty simply improve people s lives with the world s best transportation sound familiar the lyft ipo should be a reminder that silicon valley s change the world moments come with unpredictable consequences but the investor dollars keep flowing the lyft ipo price was raised higher than expected and some market enthusiasts think the deal will lead to a new surge of stock market interest lyft shares traded as high as 87 on friday after an ipo price of 72 but closed up with a more modest for an ipo gain of 8 7 percent at 78 29 and market valuation above 22 billion advertisement advertisement a lightning start and a lightning rod this is a lightning start for lyft s stock as investors are salivating owning a piece of the 1 trillion ride sharing market wedbush managing director dan ives said in a statement to cnbc there s one investor class though that should be sitting this deal out investors who buy into the idea that social issues matter in their decision making and to the bottom line story continues data show that more than 1 in 4 new investing dollars go to companies that investors deem to be socially responsible in 2018 alone 12 trillion of professionally managed assets were in socially responsible accounts a 38 percent increase since 2016 representing 26 percent of the 46 6 trillion in total u s assets under professional management according to the us sustainable investment forum the concept of esg environmental social governance investing is particularly attractive to younger investors many from the millennial generation on all these counts lyft deserves if not a failing grade at best an incomplete today its ipo filing stated that at lyft we work every day to address these challenges by improving transportation with the goal of improving people s lives socially economically and environmentally according to esg experts the company has a lot of work to do starting with climate and business goals of carbon neutrality and electrified transit advertisement advertisement in the case of lyft and uber and didi they need to translate those aspirations and early stage commitments into systemic work to make sure they are part of solutions rather than worsening problems said sue reid vice president of climate and energy at ceres which works with 161 institutional investor with 25 trillion on all on climate risk and sustainability it could go in either direction lyft says it was founded on the belief that technology will enable us to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the transportation system in april 2018 the company began making all lyft rides carbon neutral but not by changes made to its core business model it is one of the world s largest voluntary purchasers of carbon offsets this week new york city moved closer to instituting a congestion pricing plan in manhattan in part blaming uber and lyft for the increased traffic they are convenient scapegoats and not immune from criticism advertisement advertisement they definitely have made things worse said harry campbell founder of the rideshare guy blog and author of the rideshare guide they have to be putting more miles on the road by the simple math of going to get a passenger we re starting to see that too much of a good thing can be bad but they are not the sole cause of congestion lyft s electrification lyft has made some notable changes it offers electric scooters and bikeshares and in february it announced a green mode that will allow riders to choose hybrid or electric vehicles its rental program for drivers also added electric vehicles as an option reid said the efforts are too early to earn approval as being significant it would not be responsible to say they are a sustainability company today she said nicole moore one of the driver organizers behind a strike in los angeles this week said that both uber and lyft need to do more to incentivize drivers to use electric vehicles they are onboarding more and more drivers which causes more and more congestion which causes more and more carbon what is most needed is more financial support to buy emissions free cars right now their model is built on us buying and maintaining cars moore said advertisement advertisement more from impact investing why bill gates jeff bezos are big clean energy backers warren buffett on investing in an era of climate change a primer for the socially responsible investor campbell said electric vehicles are smart for markets like california where electricity is cheaper than gas and he recommends the chevy bolt as one of the best options for rideshare drivers but uber and lyft do need to work more on driver economics they don t do much to educate drivers on expenses campbell said they will take you but not tell you that you won t make money drivers are 100 percent responsible for expenses and campbell said if these gigantic technology companies can t figure it out i don t think drivers can do it any better we need to see more options going forward he said campbell thinks there is reason to believe that it will be worth lyft and uber s time to focus more on this last week s strike in los angeles was precipitated by uber cutting driver rates by 25 percent they are lowering rates and paying drivers less and less so the next obvious opportunity is to help reduce driver expenses so they can cut rates even more advertisement advertisement one of the missions that lyft says is part of its core business model is tackling inequality lyft states the average cost of a new vehicle in the united states has increased to over 33 000 which most american households cannot afford moreover a society built around personal car ownership has resulted in inadequate or unaffordable transportation solutions for the aging disabled unhealthy and underprivileged but there s no mention of homeless drivers who live in their cars or the vicious cycle of driver rate cuts lyft said on friday that it does not need to compete with uber on rate cuts but don t be surprised if the price war continues the reason according to ucla labor center senior research analyst lucero herrera is that the current business model for both lyft and uber only has two choices either they increase rates and can offer drivers more of a share and that in turn decreases demand or they decrease the rate they pay drivers to offer cheaper rides and increase demand the latter is the only choice that has proven successful in terms of growing and even that has not been profitable herrera said advertisement advertisement that s one of the worst parts campbell said you don t have much control any control on key asks like pricing when they cut rates by 20 cents a mile and you are no longer making enough to cover rent there s nothing you can do campbell said his belief in prior years had been that the companies would ultimately lose so many drivers they would need to stop with the rate cuts but now he is less sure uber said two thirds of all drivers are quitting after six months and pay is the no 1 issue at a certain point i thought you would have to run out of drivers but a lot of time has come and gone and frankly lots of people are in need of work campbell said adding that new drivers don t know what older drivers used to be paid either a significant labor issue for the us advertisement advertisement this is an issue with significant repercussions for society according to herrera who was one of the authors of a ucla study on the gig economy and drivers in la it s concerning when companies spend very little time thinking about drivers and drivers ability to earn a living the ucla researcher said we are finding these people are fully committed to the work and working longer hours and more days out of the week and getting trapped into work getting into debt to be able to drive for uber and lyft the 2018 ucla study found that 44 percent of drivers were having difficulty paying for gas or insurance and so to make ends meet were working longer hours taking out loans and using credit cards driving is a top source of adult male employment in the u s from trucks to taxis and rideshares ceres sustainability expert reid said just like the transitioning we ve seen with coal plants and coal mining you can t automatically plunk these workers into different spheres advertisement advertisement it is a major public policy and corporate governance challenge striking driver organizer moore who has a day job as a municipal employee said she has recently worked longer driving hours for less take home pay we can t be expected to come home with 5 an hour and be happy we have a job she said this recent cut was uber and it causes real harm in families i saw a grown man break down in tears telling me what the 25 percent cut meant to him moore added drivers are making far less than minimum wage after expenses moore said that two years ago a good night for her meant 150 to 200 in between 8 and 10 hours last friday she made 90 while the company is providing a novel mobility service there remain a number of important questions that need to be answered before an esg label can be applied to the company including whether drivers are being treated fairly said danielle fugere president of shareholder advocacy group as you sow she said investors need to understand a new business model is not the same as an enlightened one and other concerns include whether drivers are adequately screened whether the service is increasing traffic congestion and air pollution and whether it is cutting into or deliberately undercutting transit ridership governance issues if the solution to these environmental and social issues is going to come from lyft management the voting structure of the public shares is not likely to help prod them like many tech ipos lyft s founders retain a huge hold over voting even though they own a minority of shares forty nine percent of the company s voting power while holding just under 5 percent of the overall shares we are particularly concerned that the company is offering shares under a dual class voting structure which means that public shareholders will have limited voting rights and less ability to successfully raise concerns with management and boards fugere said shareholders have historically been highly effective in flagging important public policy issues that negatively affect company bottom lines decrease company value increase costs and litigation or cause reputational risk there are plenty of compelling reasons to invest in lyft a business that is growing and targeting a huge market ripe for disruption investors have good reason to overlook the billions in losses if they believe the lyft business model is on the way to long term profits but they should not be fooled by the narrative about making lives better in recent years as uber battled a public relations nightmare lyft positioned itself as the ethical choice in rideshare it noted in its ipo filing as a part of our ongoing commitment to social impact and improving the communities we serve we expect to invest the greater of 1 percent of our profits or 50 million annually toward our social impact efforts it is up to investors to ensure that companies claiming this moniker are truly implementing such practices and not just greenwashing their services fugere said driver organizer moore had a message for investors who believe their dollars include a conscience people who worry about ethical investments and have stock portfolios and don t want to invest in guns or tobacco why would you want to invest in a poverty pimp she said uber and lyft are exxon mobil meets walmart and she does not distinguish between the two there is no better one campbell who remains a part time driver does not have nearly as negative a view of these companies he said lyft has to its credit historically had the more driver friendly image for a reason it was the first to offer tips had power driver bonuses before uber and offered other tangible products and services that were more driver friendly and all of which forced more competition on improving the experience for drivers but he also said the overall number of drivers striking this past week impressed him i was skeptical and surprised how organized it was the bonus that lyft offered drivers to coincide with the ipo was nice and something many drivers asked him about because it was the only way their contributions to the business success could be recognized in the ipo event but it was the minority of drivers who were eligible pay for drivers has gone down over the past five years while the companies are bringing in more money and doing more rides than ever and valuations are higher than ever campbell said the bonus it s something i ve done a thousand rides for lyft someone who has done 10 000 rides is a lot more important they didn t have to do it but for the most part it won t have a big boost to their image he said over time if you ask me if lyft or uber are really distinguishing themselves from a driver point of view it seems like they are becoming more similar than ever from a cold hearted business perspective it won t improve bottom line driver retention people are choosing lyft co founder and president john zimmer said told cnbc on friday lyft is focused on consumer transportation focused on north america and focused on taking care of our drivers and passengers and that s paying off lyft s mission driven language worked on some consumers who chose lyft over uber in recent years and felt that made them part of a virtuous club of riders but for investors who are willing to believe there is a similar ethical or goodness premium about the market s newest publicly traded stock know this you might be taken for a ride more from cnbc
white house economic advisor larry kudlow made some news yesterday when he said he would like to see the fed cut interest rates by half a point 50 director kudlow then appeared on cnbc for a discussion of the economy and the united states ongoing trade discussions with china and mexico the larger story is actually about the current state of the u s economy as trump s policies influence direct investment and re establish a middle class durable goods manufacturing sector watch keep in mind this was written in december 2016 before president trump took office our current location is now over two years into the shift from favoring a wall street engine to favoring a main street engine i hope you find this helpful in essence we are in that economic space where trump has de emphasized the wall street economy multinational corps investments and financials and re emphasized the main street economy manufacturing blue collar jobs the new trade deals represent an unusual economic paradox for wall st national corporations thrive however multinational corporations and their investment instruments can simultaneously suffer we can tell we are in the space between both of these economies because actions by the fed are having no impact on inflation consumer prices are returning back to their natural dynamic i m reposting an article below from december 2016 right after the 2016 election because this odd economic landscape while new was entirely predictable i called it the third dimension in american economics traditional economic principles have revolved around the macro and micro with interventionist influences driven by gdp gross domestic product or total economic output interest rates inflation rates and federally controlled monetary policy designed to steer the broad economic outcomes additionally in large measure the various data points which underline macro principles are two dimensional as the x axis goes thus the y axis responds accordingly and so it goes and so it has historically gone traditional monetary policy has centered upon a belief of cause and effect ex 1 if inflation grows it can be reduced by rising interest rates or ex 2 as gdp shrinks it too can be affected by decreases in interest rates to stimulate investment production etc however against the backdrop of economic globalism vs economic americanism cth is noting the two dimensional economic approach is no longer a relevant model there is another economic dimension a third dimension an undiscovered depth or distance between the x and the y i believe it is critical to understand this new dimension in order to understand trump economic principles and the subsequent america first economy he s building as the distance between the x and y increases over time the affect detaches slowly and almost invisibly i believe understanding this hidden distance perspective will reconcile many of the current economic contractions i also predict this third dimension will soon be discovered and will be extremely consequential in the coming decade to understand the basic theory allow me to introduce a visual image to assist comprehension think about the two economies wall street paper or false economy and main street real or traditional economy as two parallel roads or tracks think of wall street as one train engine and main street as another the metaphor several decades ago 1980 ish our two economic engines started out in south florida with the wall street economy on i 95 the east coast and the main street economy on i 75 the west coast the distance between them less than 100 miles as each economy heads north over time the distance between them grows as they cross the florida state line wall street s engine i 95 is now 200 miles from main street s engine traveling i 75 as we have discussed the legislative outcomes along with the monetary policy therein follows the economic engine carrying the greatest political influence our historic result is monetary policy followed the wall street engine there had to be a point where the value of the second economy wall street surpassed the value of the first economy main street investments and the bets therein needed to expand outside of the usa hence globalist investing however a second more consequential aspect happened simultaneously the politicians became more valuable to the wall street team than the main street team and wall street had deeper pockets because their economy was now larger as a consequence wall street started funding political candidates and asking for legislation that benefited their interests when main street was purchasing the legislative influence the outcomes were beneficial to main street and by direct attachment those outcomes also benefited the average american inside the real economy when wall street began purchasing the legislative influence the outcomes therein became beneficial to wall street those benefits are detached from improving the livelihoods of main street americans because the benefits are global needs global financial interests investment interests are now the primary filter through which the dc legislative outcomes are considered there is a natural disconnect more here is an example of the resulting impact as felt by consumers two economies time continues to pass as each economy heads north economic globalism expands wall street s false paper economy becomes the far greater economy federal fiscal policy follows and fuels the larger economy in turn the wall street benefactors pay back the politicians economic nationalism shrinks main street s real traditional economy shrinks domestic manufacturing drops jobs are off shored main street companies try to offset the shrinking economy with increased productivity the fuel wages stagnate now it s 1990 the wall street economic engine traveling i 95 reaches northern north carolina however it s now 500 miles away from main street s engine traveling i 75 the appalachian range is the geographic wedge creating the natural divide a metaphor for trickle down by the time the decade of 2000 arrives wall street s well fueled engine and the accompanying dc legislative attention influence and monetary policy has reached philadelphia however main street s engine is in ohio they re now 700 miles apart and almost out of fuel there simply is no more productivity to squeeze from that moment in time and from that geographic location all forward travel is now only going to push the two economies further apart i 95 now heads north east and i 75 heads due north through michigan the distance between these engines is going to grow much more significantly now with each passing mile month however and this is a key reference point if you are judging their advancing progress from a globalist vessel filled with traditional academic economists in the mid atlantic both economies both engines would seem to be essentially in the same place based on their latitude from a two dimensional linear perspective you cannot tell the distance between them it is within this distance between the two economies which grew over time where a new economic dimension has been created and is not getting attention it is critical to understand the detachment within this three dimensional detachment you understand why near zero interest rates no longer drive an expansion of the gdp the main street economic engine is just too far away to gain any substantive benefit despite their domestic origin in ny dc traditional fiscal policies over time have focused exclusively on the wall street globalist economy the wall street economic engine was simply seen as the only economy that would survive the main street engine was viewed by dc and those who assemble the legislative priorities therein as a dying engine lacking fuel and destined to be service driven only within the new 3rd economic dimension the distance between wall street and main street economic engines you will find the data to reconcile years of odd economic detachment here s where it gets really interesting understanding the distance between the real main street economic engine and the false wall street economic engine will help all of us to understand the scope of an upcoming economic lag which rather remarkably i would add is a very interesting dynamic think about these engines doing a turn about and beginning a rapid reverse gdp can and in my opinion will expand quickly however any interest rate hikes fiscal policy intended to cool down that expansion fearful of inflation will take a long time to traverse the divide additionally inflation on durable goods will be insignificant even as international trade agreements are renegotiated why simply because the originating nations of those products are going to go through the same type of economic detachment described above those global manufacturing economies will first respond to any increases in export costs tariffs etc by driving their own productivity higher as an initial offset in the same manner american workers went through in the past two decades the manufacturing enterprise and the financial sector remain focused on the pricing inflation on imported durable goods sold in america while necessary will ultimately be minimal during this initial period and expand more significantly as time progresses and off shored manufacturing finds less and less ways to be productive over time durable good prices will increase but it will come much later inflation on domestic consumable goods may indeed rise at a faster pace however it can be expected that u s wage rates will respond faster naturally faster than any fiscal policy because inflation on fast turn consumable goods become re coupled to the ability of wage rates to afford them the fiscal policy impact lag caused by the distance between federal fiscal action and the domestic main street economy will now work in our favor that is in favor of the middle class within the aforementioned distance between x and y a result of three decades traveled by two divergent economic engines is our new economic dimension
president donald trump ratcheted up his pressure on the federal reserve saying that if the central bank had not mistakenly raised interest rates the u s gross domestic product would be higher and markets would be in a better place the president s comment in a twitter post on friday afternoon was yet another shot across the bow of fed chairman jerome powell who trump has repeatedly rebuked since the fed raised borrowing costs four times last year trump even discussed firing powell bloomberg news reported on dec 21 had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the 3 0 gdp stock market would have both been much higher world markets would be in a better place the president said in the tweet earlier friday white house chief economic adviser larry kudlow called on the fed to immediately cut interest rates by a half percentage point escalating the trump administration s fight with the central bank and challenging its independence kudlow would love to see such a move according to a report by axios which cited an interview friday with the director of the national economic council later on cnbc kudlow said a rate cut would protect the strength of the american economy from weakness abroad though he said such a move isn t needed immediately and the underlying economy isn t slowing the comments follow a report saying stephen moore whom trump plans to nominate to the fed s board also advocated a half point cut fed policy makers last week projected they would keep interest rates on hold for the year compared with their december forecast for two rate hikes as slowing global growth weighs on the u s economy the fed s target benchmark rate stands in a range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent fed spokesman david skidmore declined to comment on kudlow s remarks which came days after moore told the new york times that the central bank should ease skidmore also declined to comment on trump s tweet moore is a conservative pundit and supporter of the president who co authored the book trumponomics inside the america first plan to get our economy back on track kudlow said the president has had his views on chair powell they had dinner together i couldn t make the dinner he s our chairman we re not going to displace him policy expectations trump dined with powell at the white house on feb 4 the central bank announced at the time in a statement that said its chief did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy trump s criticism in interviews and on twitter disregarded long standing white house practice of avoiding public comment on monetary policy out of respect for the fed s independence which is an article of faith among investors who purchase u s treasuries kudlow s direct demand for a rate cut took things up a notch it s more than poor form it crosses a line said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton in chicago swonk said she s confident the fed under powell will continue to ignore white house pressure when making monetary policy decisions but kudlow s remarks help chip away at the central bank s independence if it s ok for one white house to do it maybe it s ok for another white house to do it and over time that may have a cumulative effect she said we know that countries that allow their central bank to be run by the political whims of those governing do extremely poorly over time

by yawen chen and ryan woo beijing reuters factory activity in china unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in march an official survey showed on sunday suggesting government stimulus measures may be starting to take hold if sustained the improvement in business conditions could suggest the ailing manufacturing sector is on a path to recovery easing fears that china could slip into a sharper economic downturn but many analysts remained cautious on the growth outlook citing seasonal distortions caused by the long lunar new year break in february they argue that real investment and consumer demand remained soft and pushed up inventories at a sharper rate potentially adding pressure to the sector the official purchasing managers index pmi rose to 50 5 in march from february s three year low of 49 2 marking the first expansion in four months according to data released by the national bureau of statistics nbs on sunday the 50 mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis analysts surveyed by reuters had forecast the manufacturing gauge would pick up slightly to 49 5 as factories ramped up production after the lunar new year holidays and rebuilt inventories ahead of a seasonal pickup in activity in spring factory output grew at its fastest pace in six months in march reversing a brief contraction in the previous month it rose to 52 7 from february s 49 5 the highest level seen since september 2018 total new orders also grew at a quicker pace driving up factory gate prices to a five month high of 51 4 ending four months of contraction the jump will likely give a big boost to stock markets and could delay a cut in the reserve requirement ratio rrr said ting lu chief china economist at nomura china has announced five rrr cuts in the past year to free up more cash for banks to boost lending to private firms and further cuts are widely expected ting said there is limited room for manufacturing pmi to rise further and the chance for another dip is not small overall although the manufacturing pmi in march can somewhat alleviate the pessimistic expectations of the economy we believe that the actual situation may not be so optimistic as reflected in this indicator lianxun securities said in a note export orders shrank for the 10th straight month suggesting external demand remained sluggish and further policy cushion may be needed if trade tensions escalate china s trade oriented neighbors japan south korea and taiwan have seen more signs of slackening demand both in china and elsewhere construction work starting at the beginning of the year has led to strong domestic demand but external demand is still weak and the outlook on imports and exports is still not optimistic economists at huatai securities said tit for tat tariffs imposed by washington and beijing remain in place as talks continue to end a trade war that has disrupted the flow of billions of dollars of goods between the world s two largest economies it s unclear if a deal acceptable to both sides can be done u s president donald trump said on friday that talks with china were going very well but added he would not accept anything less than a great deal after top trade officials wrapped up two days of discussions in beijing china s vice premier liu he will head to washington on april 3 for more talks specter of layoffs chinese factories shed more staff in march with the employment sub index edging up to 47 6 from 47 5 in february amid rising labor costs and weaker sales a growing number of foreign companies from car makers to electronics manufacturers have decided to shut plants in china in recent months raising the specter of more layoffs the jobless rate in february rose to 5 3 percent nearing a two year high sony corp t is closing its beijing smartphone plant and production will stop by the end of the month while samsung electronics ks ceased operations at one of its mobile phone manufacturing plants in china last year the pmi survey showed small and mid sized manufacturers still fared worse than large companies many state controlled although their activity improved from the previous month suggesting that policymakers efforts to channel affordable financing to the private sector are gradually working policymakers have acknowledged the economy is under pressure multi year campaigns to curb debt risks and pollution have deterred fresh investment while the u s china trade war is hurting china s export sector threatening even more jobs in response beijing plans more spending on roads railways and ports along with nearly 2 trillion yuan 297 27 billion in tax cuts to ease the pressure on corporate balance sheets the measures will take time to kick in say analysts who believe economic activity may not stabilize until the middle of the year data on wednesday showed industrial profits fell 14 percent the sharpest drop since at least late 2011 growth in china s services industry accounting for over half of the economy picked up in march as new orders rose more quickly the official non manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi rose to 54 8 from 54 3 construction activity swung back into

when it comes to advocating for their children s schools oregon families are a force of nature they organize bake sales car washes and auctions for a fundraising cycle that never ends they give up national holidays to rally at the state capitol for more education dollars and from local school board meetings to legislative hearings they testify about overcrowded classrooms understaffed libraries and bottom tier graduation rates that show just how poorly oregon is serving its students their effort and energy may finally pay off lawmakers and business interests are studying corporate tax proposals to raise as much as 2 billion more per budget cycle to buy oregon students a longer school year more mental health counselors special education instructors and other investments with tax friendly democratic supermajorities in the legislature education advocates are hopeful that such an infusion of cash could finally help oregon s schools turn the corner on mediocrity but if they want such investments to stick parents should consider focusing their advocacy work on the spending side of the equation particularly the need for reforms to the public employees retirement system with a 27 billion unfunded liability in the pers fund public employers face steep increases in how much they will have to contribute for the next several budget cycles and even 2 billion in new money on top of record revenue in oregon s red hot economy won t be enough to save school districts from the massive public pension debt crushing them and other public employers in fact in the 2019 2021 budget cycle schools required pension contributions will claim a quarter of the new revenue that the legislature is looking to dedicate the oregonian oregonlive s mike rogoway reported by 2023 that goes up to 40 percent and will continue to rise through the decade if the state fails to adopt significant steps to reform the system and curb employers contributions that doesn t even factor in the pers costs for higher education institutions state agencies or other public employers which will be taking a heavy toll on those budgets as well and while gov kate brown is searching for a way to protect those new dollars from being sucked up by the pension debt she s yet to unveil any viable plan that achieves that so much for the grand vision of what oregon schools can be broaching pension reform is no easy task when the most promising solutions require cutting future benefits for teachers and other public employees and certainly the governor and legislative leaders who are expected to lead in crises of this magnitude have shown little appetite to seek those changes from public employee unions who rank among their largest and most loyal donors but that s why education advocates ptas and families whose primary concern is students not donors must take up the mantle sort fact from fiction and push for change they should resist the simplistic falsehood that being pro pers reform is the same as being anti teacher they should recognize that the promise of additional revenue means little when only pennies on the dollar will make it into the classroom and they should recognize that the only way out of oregon s pension mess is for everyone businesses taxpayers and public employees to share in the pain so that students low income oregonians and the state s most vulnerable can be protected as much as possible it s worth clarifying a few common misconceptions many have about pers fact while oregon must honor promises made to employees and retirees for work they ve already completed they can change benefit levels for work going forward as both the oregon supreme court and legislative lawyers have made clear that leaves a lot of possibilities for legislators to make changes including a slate of reforms offered by advocates fact while newer employees receive a more modest retirement package than earlier employees they still receive a generous retirement package that includes both a guaranteed monthly pension as well as a 401 k type plan that s a combination that only 13 percent of employees in the private sector get according to the bureau of labor statistics rather private sector workers typically get only a 401 k fact oregon teachers and other public employees do not contribute their own money to the pension fund unlike public employees in other states while many employees pay 6 percent of their salary to their 401 k type account that does not go to the pension fund that s a key distinction one proposal pushed by pers reform advocates would redirect that 6 percent into the pension fund easing the contribution that employers have to make and leaving more dollars for the services and programs that oregonians and oregon students deserve fact as required pers contributions increase taking an additional 10 billion of tax money over current levels from public employers budgets over the next eight years school districts will have little choice but to cut school days lay off teachers and other staff or a combination of both while newer employees can rightfully say they aren t the cause of the unfunded liability no one will escape the fallout of decades worth of poor policymaking even if teachers successfully resist any retirement changes they will be paying for it in the form of layoffs larger class sizes or less support staff portland public schools families are already seeing what runaway pers and other costs mean for schools despite expecting 35 million more than it received this year the district announced it is facing a shortfall for the coming year the plan dip into reserves cut school days reallocate teachers and increase class sizes as the oregonian oregonlive s eder campuzano reported predictably the news shifted parents fundraising efforts into hyperdrive as school communities or at least those who can afford to attempt to drum up the cash to ward off staffing changes but this fractured approach to funding education is neither sustainable nor fair to communities that lack the resources of higher income neighborhoods those are the schools that most need lawmakers to come through with both new revenue and a pers fix that keeps those investments secure families should do what they do best and work together for that common goal the oregonian oregonlive editorial board editorial agenda 2019 transform education for students benefit keep oregon solvent work toward more evenhanded justice in oregon put portland on the right track ________________________ read more about the

of commerce which hoped to showcase the economic potential of another capital city with college town roots austin s size dwarfed tallahassee but to many on the trip it was cool quirky and impressive

gov andrew cuomo and state lawmakers have reached a 175 5 billion budget deal the final deal announced early on sunday morning includes congestion pricing a permanent cap on local property tax increases bail reform and a plan for publicly financed political campaigns which had been the final hurdle an approximately 1 billion increase in education funding reforms to the mta and a codification of parts of the affordable care act also made it into the budget though the legalization of recreational marijuana did not while democrats entered the year controlling both houses of the legislature and the governor s mansion for the first time in years an on time budget was hardly a given the collapse of the amazon hq2 deal differing revenue projections and policy disputes threatened to derail budget negotiations at times but lawmakers and cuomo were able to bridge their differences in time to meet the april 1 budget deadline which will allow state lawmakers to keep their salary increase showing that democrats can keep their campaign commitments and capitalize on their biggest legislative majorities in a century lawmakers voted to approve the various budget bills on sunday in what cuomo called the toughest budget season he has had in his three terms in office the hard ones are the good ones by definition cuomo told reporters in a sunday evening press conference this is probably the broadest most sweeping state plan that we have done there are a number of national firsts and it really grapples with the tough issues that have been facing this state for a long time while cuomo ended up backtracking on some proposals such as cuts to medicaid and reduced aid to localities the governor achieved significant victories on the red lines he drew in the budget process the 2 percent property tax cap congestion pricing in manhattan criminal justice reforms and campaign finance reform from the beginning i said we will not do a budget that fails to address three major issues that have evaded this state for decades the permanent property tax cap criminal justice reform and an mta overhaul including central business district tolling cuomo said in a statement sent after midnight that announced the budget deal i also said this budget must be done right meaning it must be fiscally responsible and protect new york from the federal government s ongoing economic assault on our state i am proud to announce that together we got it done this agreement accomplishes our goals and enacts the transformative policies of our 100 day justice agenda while keeping spending at 2 percent for the ninth consecutive year cuomo added state senate majority leader andrea stewart cousins a suburban lawmaker whose conference won a commanding majority at the polls last fall described the spending package as responsible effective and on time the 2019 2020 state budget will provide an over 1 billion increase in state education aid with a focus on struggling school districts she said in a statement issued in the governor s press release the budget will also provide essential aim funds for local governments a permanent property tax cap and tax relief for middle class new yorkers additionally we have taken historic steps to implement a public financing system reform our criminal justice system and ban single use plastic bags meanwhile assembly speaker carl heastie touted funding for the mta and criminal justice reforms but his statement did not mention public financing of elections which his conference had balked at the budget includes the creation of a public financing commission which will have the binding power to develop a program of up to 100 million annually for legislative and statewide offices with eligibility thresholds public financing limits and contribution limits to be decided in a report due by december 1 2019 the recommendations would become law within 20 days unless amended by lawmakers importantly we were able to secure landmark criminal justice reforms that will make a difference in the lives of new yorkers he said in a statement in the governor s press release since i became speaker in 2015 it has been my personal mission to correct the tilted scales of justice for new yorkers and this year s budget agreement makes a giant leap toward realizing these goals reforming our bail system ensuring the right to a speedy trial and making critical changes to new york s discovery process here is a rundown of the most notable measures included in the budget congestion pricing the metropolitan transportation authority will implement a first in the nation tolling program although some details remain vague the program will institute electronic tolling devices on the perimeter of a zone encompassing all of manhattan south of 60th street a six member review board will advise on tolls exemptions and credits which will be variable and passenger vehicles will only be charged once per day the tolls would not go into effect until 2021 at the earliest people with disabilities would be exempt from the tolling and a traffic mobility review board could recommend additional credits discounts and exemptions for other bridge and tunnel tolls according to budget legislation the mta will also have to come up with an reorganization plan by june board members terms will also be realigned with the terms of the officials who appointed them and a congestion pricing plan will be enacted additional funding for the transit agency will be raised through an internet sales tax and a 4 15 percent tax on the sale of properties valued at 25 million or above criminal justice among the most contentious issues in the budget was bail reform the budget deal will result in the elimination of cash bail for about 90 percent of cases according to the governor s press release deals were also reached on reforming the discovery process and ensuring that criminal trials happen faster a key impediment to a deal had centered on whether judges could consider dangerousness as a reason to detain a criminal suspect pre trial a proposal that was taken out of the budget by friday cuomo told reporters on sunday night that additional changes to the bail system could be made in the coming months education funding a total of 27 9 billion will go to education in the coming fiscal year cuomo also secured new provisions that will require school districts to report more information to the state on how they allocate per pupil spending at the school level in the end education funding increased by about 3 7 percent this year a small difference from the governor s original budget proposal while lawmakers secured about 620 million in additional foundation aid that amount did not affect the overall total of education spending much largely due to a shifting of different funding sources activists had asked for a 1 2 billion increase in foundation aid this year s budget is one of dashed hopes and deferred dreams said jasmine gripper legislative director at the alliance for quality education this time we cannot blame the republicans state sen shelley mayer chair of the senate education committee told city state the the final budget would not include a proposal to consolidate different categories of expense base aid lawmakers had been skeptical about this proposal from the governor and how it could have limited how school districts are reimbursed for expenses such as school buses and text books public authorities control board cuomo exacted a bit of revenge against state senate democrats by increasing the governor s control of the public authorities control board this obscure government entity was poised to have a potentially pivotal say in the amazon hq2 deal by recommending that a leading opponent of the deal state sen michael gianaris represent the state senate on the board stewart cousins added one more hurdle that apparently proved too much for amazon which subsequently gave up on plans to open a large satellite office in long island city queens cuomo had argued that the appointment was political new language in a budget bill will ensure that a governor has full discretion to immediately remove a member of the board he or she finds to be acting or threatening to act beyond the scope of such member s legal authority property tax cap a permanent 2 percent on local property tax increases was a top priority of cuomo and one that he said he would not sign the bill without there had been some doubts however that the assembly would go along with making the cap permanent as the senate voted to do earlier this session in past years an extension of the cap had been contingent on passing similar multi year extensions of rent regulations some assembly members had hoped that a similar deal could be struck this year as well but cuomo got what he wanted in the end public campaign finance the very last sticking point in the budget was concluded with mixed results for advocates of establishing a system of publicly financed election campaigns statewide the budget did authorize up to 100 million for such a system but leaves it to a newly established commission to figure out how it would work in practice similar to a controversial commission that determined legislative pay raises the findings of the public finance commission will have the full force of law unless legislators vote otherwise they would have 20 days to do that once the commission releases its report by dec 1 2019 reporters asked cuomo on sunday night why a commission rather than lawmakers will determine the details of the upcoming publicly financed system because it is too complicated cuomo said it s not a simple system to put in place it s especially not simply statewide what offices are eligible how many candidates how many parties what s the match is the match the same in buffalo as it is in new york city the commission will answer those questions the most important thing on public financing was passing it cuomo said voting reforms voters statewide will now have three hours of paid time off to vote on election day online voter registration expanded upstate voting hours and 10 million to fund early voting were also in the budget as well as funding for the electronic poll books that are needed to make early voting feasible health care numerous parts of the affordable care act were codified in state law including protections for people with pre existing conditions essential health benefits new york state of health and a prohibition on limiting annual and lifetime coverage we have codified many of the protections of obamacare so regardless of what president trump does we know that we have a health care program in new york that will protect new yorkers cuomo said on sunday pre existing conditions the 10 essential health benefits no cost sharing codifying new york health insurance marketplace etc insurance companies also must provide coverage for in vitro fertilization and egg freezing the environment a ban on single use plastic bags was included cities and counties can also choose to enact a five cent fee on paper bags with 40 percent of that revenue going to provide low and fixed income people with reusable bags the rest will support programs in the state environmental protection fund which received a total of 300 million in the budget the same as last year a total of 2 5 billion will support clear water infrastructure a 500 million increase other measures cuomo s crackdown on limousine operators in response to a horrific crash in schoharie last fall that killed 20 people made the cut despite earlier worries that it had fallen out of the budget this includes new safety standards increased insurance requirements and a provision that makes it a class e felony if a driver causes the death of another person while knowingly operating an unsafe limo the new budget also contains 27 million to implement the dream act which had already been passed by both houses as well as tweaks that cuomo had said were necessary to keep the legislation from being overly broad only 20 million was allocated for census outreach to undercounted populations just half of what immigration advocates had requested the final budget also contains provisions to ensure the right for workers to organize and collectively bargain suny and cuny students who families make up to 125 000 a year are now eligible for the excelsior scholarship free tuition program
michael hicks a recent survey of economists posed two questions about the recently popular modern monetary theory mmt the results were clear three out of four economists strongly disagreed with its central premises and one out of four merely disagreed precisely zero survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the fundamental predictions of the theory this was wholly unsurprising as mmt is nonsense but it caused me to think about the way economists discuss ideas that are politically popular yet have been proven false the most obvious example of that other than mmt is modern supply side economics indulge me in some musing on how these two ideas continue to have legs after being rejected by careful research using abundant data mmt concludes that government debt does not matter and as long as government can print money it need not collect taxes this would be a political panacea of course we could finance the building of the interstate highway system world war ii and the modern welfare state simply by printing money it is absurd modern supply side economics argues that large tax cuts like the recent tax cuts and jobs act would actually generate more tax revenues because they would lead to higher economic growth this would be a political panacea as well we could finance the building of the interstate highway system world ii and the modern welfare state simply by cutting taxes it is just as absurd more from michael hicks a frank look at education subsidies and pay i ll scare many a reader by noting that both mmt and modern supply side economics have people in congress who believe them some even from indiana but before i recount the wrongness of both ideas it is good to expose the hint of truth that allows folks to tout ideas that are demonstrably false it is true that sovereign nations controlling their own currency can sustain large debts for decades this is especially true if the debt is in their own currency the u s cannot go bankrupt while we have a printing press with which to pay off our debts all of these truths are used to justify mmt but a partial truth is not sufficient for a theory to hold after all the earth looks flat and that brings us to supply side tax cuts tax cuts spur economic activity by allowing households and firms to buy more goods and invest in more new business when marginal tax rates are very high say over 60 or 80 percent a tax cut may cause more new economic growth than the revenues lost by the rate reduction that is the laffer curve the problem is that there are no taxes at that rate anywhere in the world much less the u s the recent tax cut and jobs act reduced corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent that is much too low to be as revenue neutral as far too many in congress claimed it turns out that wild claims like the mmt and supply side tax cuts have like conspiracy theories and cults just a tad bit of truth to them unlike conspiracy theories and cults there is an enormous treasure trove of data from which to calculate their actual effects data on national and sub national tax rates and economic performance exist for most of the world for 50 years some nations like great britain have some of this data back a millennium this allows us to test the effect of mmt and tax cuts on literally tens of thousands of observations mmt is harder to wholly reject as a theory since only a few hundred national or sub national governments have been willing to wreck themselves with debt but the capacity of a nation to self finance a debt without taxation a hallmark of mmt has yet to occur the supply side argument of a revenue neutral tax cut has yet to occur in tax rates beneath the high double digits we ve seen high taxes and big tax cuts but a revenue neutral tax cut is as common as a unicorn this prompts me to ask why these ideas remain popular and hold currency in the political debate i cannot be certain but nearly 35 years of public policy leads me to believe that most political leaders stop asking questions as soon as they hear the answer they like this absence of curiosity is deadly to good government but it is the rule rather than the exception it is also the sign of deeply unserious men and women it is also difficult to rule out pure duplicity like politicians voters ask too few questions and the promise of costless public policies is seductive as economists are fond of noting there is no free lunch we cannot get something for nothing let me conclude with something that is both true and unpopular with the unicorn watchers from both the left and the right the politicians who proclaim mmt is a magic bullet that will allow for the funding of a green new deal are misleading you in exactly the same way the politicians who told you the tax cuts and job acts would pay for itself through new tax revenue are untruthful i don t have windows into the souls of these politicians i don t know if they are simply uncurious and are able to wish away unhappy facts like a child or if they think voters are uncurious and childlike but that d be a great question to ask for the next election michael hicks is the george and frances ball distinguished

beijing reuters factory activity in china unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in march an official survey showed on sunday suggesting government stimulus measures may be starting to take hold in the world s second largest economy if sustained the improvement in business conditions could indicate that manufacturing is on a path to recovery easing fears that china could slip into a sharper economic downturn but analysts remained cautious citing seasonal distortions due to the long lunar new year break in february they said real investment and consumer demand remained soft and pushed up inventories potentially adding pressure to the sector the official purchasing managers index pmi rose to 50 5 in march from february s three year low of 49 2 marking the first expansion in four months according to data released by the national bureau of statistics nbs on sunday the 50 mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis analysts surveyed by reuters had forecast the manufacturing gauge would pick up slightly to 49 5 as factories ramped up production after the lunar new year holidays and rebuilt inventories ahead of a seasonal pickup in activity in spring factory output grew at its fastest pace in six months in march reversing a brief contraction in the previous month it rose to 52 7 from february s 49 5 the highest level seen since september 2018 total new orders also grew at a quicker pace driving up factory gate prices to a five month high of 51 4 ending four months of contraction the jump will likely give a big boost to stock markets and could delay a cut in the reserve requirement ratio rrr said ting lu chief china economist at nomura china has announced five rrr cuts in the past year to free up more cash for banks to boost lending to private firms and further cuts are widely expected ting said there is limited room for manufacturing pmi to rise further and the chance for another dip is not small overall although the manufacturing pmi in march can somewhat alleviate the pessimistic expectations of the economy we believe that the actual situation may not be so optimistic as reflected in this indicator lianxun securities said in a note export orders shrank for the 10th straight month suggesting external demand remained sluggish and further policy cushion may be needed if trade tensions escalate china s trade oriented neighbors japan south korea and taiwan have seen more signs of slackening demand both in china and elsewhere construction work starting at the beginning of the year has led to strong domestic demand but external demand is still weak and the outlook on imports and exports is still not optimistic economists at huatai securities said tit for tat tariffs imposed by washington and beijing remain in place as talks continue to end a trade war that has disrupted the flow of billions of dollars of goods between the world s two largest economies u s president donald trump said on friday that talks with china were going very well but added he would not accept anything less than a great deal after top trade officials wrapped up two days of discussions in beijing specter of layoffs factories shed more staff in
