work of our people and agencies we look forward to continued success in the year ahead in closing we are pleased with our performance for q4 and the full year 2019 and i m confident that we are very well positioned as we enter 2020 i will now turn the call over to phil for a closer look at the results philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john and good morning john just described the fourth quarter results represented a very solid end of the year for us reflecting the quality of our employees and the services they deliver to help our clients achieve their goals and for the full year our results were in line with the upper end of the range of our expectations as always our agencies remain focused on responding to our clients ever changing requirements and delivering effective solutions to meet their needs and at the same time managing their agency cost structures in an efficient manner we also continue to see the positive effects of our ongoing companywide efforts to identify opportunities for improvement and efficiencies starting on slide 7 regarding our revenue for the fourth quarter we had organic growth of 3 5 as our agencies overall did a good job capturing year end client project spend for the full year organic growth was 2 8 which was at the upper end of the range of our expectation of 2 to 3 growth as we had positive performance across most regions and major markets fx was once again negative reducing our revenue by 0 9 in the fourth quarter and while a reduction in revenue from dispositions made during the last 12 months exceeded revenue from acquisitions in the quarter the net reduction of 1 2 this quarter is lower than it was in the previous four quarters as we cycle through the largest tranche of our 2018 dispositions during the third quarter as a result our reported revenue in the fourth quarter increased 1 3 to 4 14 billion when compared to q4 of last year i will discuss the components of the changes in revenue in more detail later in my comments turning back to slide 1 our operating profit for the quarter was 646 4 million up 3 1 when compared to q4 of 18 while our operating margin of 15 6 represented a 30 basis point increase over last year s fourth quarter ebitda for the quarter increased 2 5 and q4s ebitda margin of 16 1 was up 20 basis points when compared to last year improvement in margins when compared to q4 of last year primarily resulted from the change in business mix we ve experienced from the strategic disposition of several non core or underperforming agencies and our ongoing efforts to be more efficient throughout the organization particularly in the areas of real estate back office operations it and procurement net interest expense for the quarter was 38 6 million down 14 5 million versus q4 of last year largely driven by the refinancing activity that took place in the third quarter of 2019 and down 10 7 million compared to the third quarter of this year as a reminder i ll recap the refinancing activity in early july we issued eur1 billion senior notes in two parts we issued eur500 million of eight year senior notes due in 2027 at an effective rate of 0 92 and an additional eur500 million 12 year senior notes due in 2031 at an effective rate of 1 53 together the euro note issuance after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses resulted in net proceeds of 1 1 billion at an average rate of 1 23 proceeds were used to retire the 500 million of 6 25 2019 senior notes which came due in mid july and to retire on august 1st 400 million of the 4 45 2020 senior notes through a partial redemption as a result of the refinancing activities our expected ongoing long term debt portfolio will be comprised of 4 billion in dollar denominated debt and eur1 billion in euro denominated debt in addition with the drop in long term interest rates we settled our fixed to floating rate interest swaps for a small gain as a result our debt portfolio is now 100 fixed rate debt at very attractive rates an effective rate of approximately 3 3 and total third party interest expense for the fourth quarter decreased by 15 2 million when compared to q4 of 2018 in addition interest income decreased 1 8 million period over period as the reduction in interest rates on our cash deposits over the past year more than offset the increase in our cash balances when compared to the third quarter of 2019 interest expense decreased 10 8 million driven by the refinancing activity in the third quarter while interest income was flat note gross interest expense in q4 was approximately 7 6 million lower than in q3 because q3 included incremental net interest expense recorded as a result of the early redemption of 400 million of the 2020 senior notes for the full year 2020 we expect net interest expense savings of approximately 20 million primarily from the refinancing activity when compared to 2019 s reported results however total interest expense for 2020 and going forward will be subject to changes due to the translation of interest expense into u s dollars related to the euro notes that we issued in 2019 our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26 1 bringing the 2019 full year effective tax rate to 26 as previously discussed the annual rate for 2019 includes a benefit of approximately 11 million resulting from the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in q2 of 2019 heading into 2020 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 26 5 to 27 before considering the impact of the tax effect from our share based compensation including the impact of any future stock option exercises both of which are subject to changes in the value of omnicom stock price earnings from our affiliates were less than 1 million for the quarter down versus q4 of last year primarily due to lower earnings at our affiliates as well as a negative impact of fx and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries was up 4 3 million to 34 8 million during the quarter due to the strong performance from several of our less than fully owned agencies as a result net income for the fourth quarter was 415 million up 4 or 15 8 million when compared to q4 of 2018 now turning to slide 2 our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 2 8 versus q4 of last year to 219 3 million shares as a result our diluted eps for the 4th quarter was 1 89 which is an increase of 0 12 or 6 8 when compared to our q4 eps for last year next i ll provide a quick recap of the summary p l eps and other information for the full year results as a reminder in the third quarter of 2018 we closed on the disposition of sellbytel as well as other dispositions that resulted in a net pre tax gain of 178 million at the time we also recorded charges of 149 million repositioning actions primarily resulting from severance and lease terminations and lastly we recorded additional tax expense of approximately 29 million resulting from adjustments of the provisional amounts originally recorded in connection with the 2017 tax act as we reported last year the net impact of these items on our full year 2018 results increased our reported operating profit by 29 million net income by 18 2 million and diluted earnings per share by 0 08 therefore on slides 5 and 6 we presented the fiscal 19 results in comparison to 2018 both with and without the impact of the net gain from dispositions the repositioning charges and the tax adjustments in connection with the tax act the non gaap adjusted amounts for these items show how our underlying business performed year on year on a comparable basis which we believe is a meaningful presentation for investors and is consistent with how management measured our 2019 operating performance since the full year results for 2019 were in line with our quarterly performance i ll just give you a few headlines organic revenue growth for the full year was 2 8 which was in line with the upper range of our expectations for the year of between 2 and 3 fx translation decreased revenue by 2 1 and the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions reduced revenue by 2 9 so for 2019 our reported revenue totaled 14 95 billion a decrease of 2 2 compared to 2018 our reported operating profit for 2019 was 2 12 billion down slightly when compared to our reported results last year while operating margin improved 20 basis points year over year to 14 2 on a reported basis and 40 basis points after adjusting 2018 s operating income with the net gain from the dispositions and repositioning actions we undertook during q3 of 2018 in our full year reported diluted eps for 2019 was 6 06 a share up 0 23 or 3 9 compared to the reported amount of 5 83 a share in 2018 adjusting for the impact of 2018 s net gain from the dispositions repositioning actions and tax reform activity 2019 s diluted eps represents a 0 31 improvement or 5 4 over the 2018 non gaap adjusted amount of 5 75 a share turning to the details of our revenue performance in the fourth quarter starting on slide 7 fx once again was negative in the quarter but not as negative as the impact we saw in the first nine months of the year fx reduced revenue by 9 10 of a percent in the fourth quarter were 37 million this impact remains fairly widespread on a reported basis consistent with the year over year impact dollar strengthened against practically every one of our major foreign currencies in the quarter only the japanese yen and russian ruble strengthened against the dollar the fx movements creating the largest reductions in the quarter continue to be from changes in the dollar compared to the euro chinese yuan brazilian real and the australian dollar as for our projection of the fx impact for the upcoming year any assumption as to how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months let alone the balance of 2020 at this point is speculative but if currencies stay where they currently are based on our estimates fx could reduce our reported revenues by approximately 50 basis points in the first quarter and be slightly negative over the balance of 2020 the impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 51 million in the quarter or 1 2 this is lower than earlier quarters as we cycled through much of our recent disposition activity during the third quarter of 2019 based on transactions completed to date we estimate the impact of our acquisition activity net of dispositions will be a net reduction of about 75 basis points in the first quarter of 2020 and close to flat over the remaining three quarters of the year resulting in a projected negative impact of 25 basis points for the year and finally our organic growth for the quarter was 3 5 growth this quarter was fairly well distributed and reflective of the positive effects of year end client project spending geographically our domestic asia pacific and european regions all had good performances within our service disciplines our advertising media and crm consumer experience agencies all experienced positive organic growth this quarter while our crm execution support and pr agency group once again lagged slide 8 shows our mix of business by discipline for the fourth quarter the split was 58 for advertising and 42 for marketing services as for their organic growth by discipline our advertising discipline was up 5 1 we saw solid performances from our global advertising agency networks and several of our regional brands as well as solid performance that our media businesses crm consumer experience was up 3 3 organically driven by continued strong growth from our precision marketing agencies as well as from our events businesses outside the u s crm execution support was down 6 this quarter across most of the service offerings and discipline pr was down 2 5 the reduction is consistent with the performance of our pr discipline throughout earlier quarters in 2019 lastly healthcare was up double digits organically at 12 9 and the growth continues to be well distributed both domestically and internationally on slide 9 which details the regional mix of business you can see during the quarter the split was 52 in the u s 3 for the rest of north america 9 in the u k 19 for the rest of europe 11 for asia pacific 3 for latin america and 3 for the middle east and african markets turning to the details of our performance by region on slide 10 organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter in the us was 2 8 led by our crm consumer experience healthcare and advertising media disciplines with our crm execution support and pr agency group lagging outside the u s our other north american agencies were down 2 3 due to the sluggish performances at our advertising and media businesses our u k agencies were once again positive up 3 3 driven by the strong performance of our advertising pr healthcare and field marketing agencies the rest of europe was up 4 7 organically in the quarter in the eurozone we saw a solid performance across most markets the strongest being germany belgium portugal and spain the netherlands was slightly positive in the quarter while france was once again negative driven by continued weak performance in a few of our crm execution support businesses in that market organic growth outside the eurozone also continues to be positive across most markets organic growth in asia pacific for the quarter was 4 5 our greater china agencies performed well this quarter after coming off a poor performance in q3 primarily driven by growth from our media and events agencies on the mainland however we do not expect this to continue in the first half of 2020 given the uncertainty in china elsewhere in the region we saw somewhat mixed performance by market solid performance by our agencies in australia south korea and thailand was partially offset by reductions in japan and singapore latin america was down 1 3 organically in the quarter brazil once again returned to a negative organic performance as did chile and colombia offsetting some growth in mexico in the quarter and lastly the middle east and africa which is our smallest region was positive for the quarter with qatar and the uae turning in strong performances turning to slide 11 we present our mix of revenue by our client s industry sector as we saw throughout the year when comparing the full year revenue for 2019 to 2018 there was a small shift in our mix as a result of the sellbytel disposition the mix of revenue from technology clients has been reduced turning to our cash flow performance on slide 12 you can see that for the year we generated 1 73 billion of free cash flow diluting changes in working capital as for our primary uses of cash on slide 13 dividends paid to our common shareholders were 564 million up about 16 million year over year as you recall we increased our quarterly dividend by 0 05 a share effective with april s payment the increase in the cash payment was partially offset by a reduction in common shares over the past 12 months dividends paid to our non controlling interest shareholders totaled 97 million down versus the prior year due to a combination of dispositions and the repurchase of shares from our minority shareholders capital expenditures were 102 million year to date down compared to 2018 primarily due to reduction in leasehold improvements from our real estate activities year over year acquisitions including earn out payments totaled 124 million as we ve mentioned previously this is a decrease when compared to last year when we opportunistically executed on several acquisitions and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans were 604 million all in we generated 239 million in net free cash flow over the past year on page 14 we present our capital structure as of year end which reflects the changes we discussed earlier regarding the refinancing actions we took in the third quarter regarding our capital structure at the end of the year our total debt was 5 14 billion and our net debt position as of december 31st was 835 million down almost 400 million from this time last year year on year the improvement in net debt is primarily due to our positive free cash flow of 239 million and changes in operating capital of 125 million which includes the year over year improvement of 45 million on our working capital management as for our debt ratios they remain solid our total debt to ebitda ratio was 2 2 times and our net debt to ebitda ratio was 0 4 times and our interest coverage is 10 4 times which has improved over the past year due to the reduction in our interest expense and finally on slide 15 you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions for the last 12 months our return on invested capital ratio was 29 5 while our return on equity was 49 6 and that concludes our prepared remarks please note that we ve included several other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point we re going to ask the operator to open the call for questions thank you questions and answers operator our first question will come from the line of alexia quadrani from jp morgan please go ahead alexia quadrani jp morgan analyst thank you very much my first question is really more detail on the outlook for 2020 if you can give us a sense of how we should be thinking about organic growth and then the margin efficiencies that you have highlighted that benefited q4 and actually full year 2019 can they continue in 2020 how we should think about profitability as well thank you philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll start and then john can add his comments i think i think for 2020 in terms of where we are with our planning cycle for the year right now our expectations are similar to what they were at this point in 2019 so we see an organic growth range of 2 to 3 again for 2020 and with respect to margins we re going to continue to focus on growing ebit dollars that has been our focus all long that s how we approach planning and executing on our business and it has been successful we re always looking for opportunities for improvement and efficiencies throughout the organization more particularly focused or have been the last three or four years in the areas of real estate and back office and it we re going to continue to do that and at the same time we re going to continue to invest for growth especially in the areas of of data and analytics training and some other initiatives as we always strive to find the right balance between those investments and finding sustainable growth so for 2020 at this point in our planning cycle we expect margins to approximate what they were in 2019 so flat for now and we ll see how it goes as the year evolves alexia quadrani jp morgan analyst and john can i ask a follow up question is you touched on or maybe phil touched on china or asia region in your opening remarks i m curious i know it s not a huge market for you but how are the multinationals sort of dealing with added spending in china right now and then just a last question for phil or john the crm execution business which continues to be a tough area for you do you see more divestitures or opportunity to sort of i guess what s the how do we fix that business do we get out of some of the businesses or is it a question of sort of just cyclical and it will come back john d wren chairman and chief executive officer first alexia with respect to china we like most other people are playing in day to day at this point our primary focus is the safety of our employees january which we know the results were fine it wasn t until after that that it just became a full blown crisis it depends on how long it goes on people have been working primarily from home and work goes on for most clients some are really spending more because of the products that are selling to the marketplace the one area for the quarter anyway that i think will be affected will be our events business in china because any planned events have been canceled at this point and we don t know if they will be done later in the year or whatever but as you said in your comments china is an important market but it s not a terribly large market for us and our numbers and your second question alexia quadrani jp morgan analyst on the crm execution just a question if did more divestitures there or what s your outlook really philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure yeah i think we re going to continue to look at the entire portfolio as we go through our planning process and all throughout the year so identify businesses that strategically make make sense for disposition we ve been through we believe we ve been through the bulk of that process as far as acquisitions of size but we re always open to reconsiderations and there s a lot of change that s happened in our industry we expect that change to continue we don t have any particular meaningful businesses targeted for disposition at this point and we think a bunch of the execution support businesses that we have are going to get back to being positive growth maybe not high growth businesses with good returns with some exceptions there are some that are still cycling through some of the issues that they faced in 2019 but the part of the portfolio it represents is a smaller part of our portfolio now than it was over the last few years and some of those businesses are really good businesses and have always been they ve been overshadowed by some of the underperformers within that group or grouping so i think you can expect we re going to continue to work with the management teams to look for opportunities for growth and improvement and to the extent that we feel strategically we re not going to continue to invest in them and they re not and they are opportunities for good returns for disposition we may continue to to consider going down that route too alexia quadrani jp morgan analyst thank you very much operator our next question then will come from the line of craig huber from huber research partners please go ahead craig huber huber research partners analyst good morning thank you i got a few questions can you just size for us if you would the china revenues for last year what percent of revenues it was and what was your organic revenue there we get that question a lot philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer the size of china for us is it s probably a little bit less than 1 5 of our revenues and and i think given that size we typically don t disclose every country by country organic revenue growth percentage but if you give me a minute i ll just double check it so for the year china s organic growth was negative so you know i think in the mid single digits in 2019 craig huber huber research partners analyst thank you for that my next question john i guess your various conversations you ve had with your larger customers particularly here in the u s just curious what are the tone of businesses with them and as you sort of think about the u s economy what s your sort of a sense of that is it holding you back is it helping you and the same questions for continental europe as well what s your sense of the economy in both places please john d wren chairman and chief executive officer sure most of the conversations we ve had i ve had with clients in the u s the us economy continues to be strong and clients are trying to take advantage of the growth that they see in the marketplace obviously with the election coming up there is some cautiousness that goes along with that but for the most part i d say its a net positive once you get into europe the market it changes market by market the real behind the scene conversations about brexit is uncertainty not so much for 2020 but post 2020 as businesses decide where they have to be positioned and what it needs to get done france is so the market is ok we ve suffered an individual loss in some of our execution businesses which affect our numbers but the market is ok and germany germany is a question mark at this point not a negative but a question mark especially since i think it was last night the expected successor to angela merkel decided she would not be running for that position so we don t have any better information at the moment russia continues to be a strong performing market for us and i don t know if that covers most of the things you wanted me to cover craig huber huber research partners analyst i appreciate that every year in the fourth quarter you tend to have some variability on your project related work obviously here in the fourth quarter can you maybe size that for us in terms of dollars maybe how you want to do it the fourth quarter this year versus last year please philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we typically see as we head into the fourth quarter somewhere around 200 million or 250 million of project work that is typically available for our agencies to achieve and our agencies do typically achieve something in that range some years it s a little bit lower some years they actually do a little bit better and there s a whole variety of factors and it s not just when we speak about that in the fourth quarter it s not just our project based businesses alone that are actively pursuing year end project opportunities with their clients so i think this year it was probably similar to maybe a little bit better than last year s fourth quarter and i think if you go back to 18 it probably wasn t as good a performance where there wasn t as much of it that we were able to convert in that fourth quarter but that s a typical range that we see it s hard to actually put your finger on every dollar and whether where what exactly the client situation was that led to us being able to capture those dollars but that s traditionally what we found that it has been pretty consistent over the years craig huber huber research partners analyst that s it thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator our next question will come from line of dan salmon from bmo capital markets please go ahead daniel salmon bmo capital markets analyst thanks for taking the questions and good morning everyone john i was hoping you could comment on the recent news about accenture reportedly closing their media auditing division you commented i think on that specific issue on prior calls and love to hear an update on that specifically but really more importantly i d love to hear just your broader thoughts particularly as you enter 2020 about the competitive environment and particularly with that group and then just you mentioned all the sort of success at the healthcare division and the numbers are clearly robust there i hate to ask about what are the markets that are seeing challenges but i d just love to hear an update on the pr division in particular just we know that that s a business where it might have lagged in adopting technology within marketing traditionally but where it does appear to be really picking up and i m wondering how you see the role of technology and helping bring that division back to growth going forward this year thanks john d wren chairman and chief executive officer well first on accenture i did comment i forget when it was back a while ago that some of their ambitions and the fact that they re still in the media auditing business was inconsistent and i m just happy to see that they got out of the business and we ll continue to compete with them where we see them although we haven t run into them very often on major pitches your second question was about healthcare and could you just reframe it for me for a second daniel salmon bmo capital markets analyst rather you emphasized the strength in healthcare what i was hoping to just hear a little bit more about was the pr division and how you aim to get it back to growth and in particular the role of technology and whether you re seeing that become more significant within those businesses john d wren chairman and chief executive officer sure well i think the utilization of omni and especially q which i mentioned in my remarks will benefit pr business in some of their assignments the other activity that s going on now let me frame it even though we ve had some difficulty with a couple of percentage points loss here and there the profitability of the pr division has been and remains very strong so the opportunity is a marketplace opportunity it s not anything structurally to do with the business at this point and we re continuing to go through and evaluate recently john doolittle took over for karen van bergen as the head of that practice area and we re sitting down and taking into the hard look at where we get our revenue what we can expect in the future and what changes we want to make to the business so it s an opportunity from my perspective it s not really a problem it s just constantly running 1 or 2 below the prior year and technology will help that as well q especially which has just been it s been in development for over 5 years but it s just been added to the omni offering i believe will particularly help the pr business in some of the things that they re doing daniel salmon bmo capital markets analyst great thank you john d wren chairman and chief executive officer sure operator our next question then will come from the line of julien roch from barclays please go ahead julien roch barclays analyst yes hi there thank you very much for taking the questions coming back on china quickly you said it was less than 1 5 of revenue and that so far the only impacts were you events business because no event was taking place in china how much is events either out of the chinese revenue or out of the 1 5 that s my first question the second one is could you give us some color on the organic growth of your media practice in full year 2019 you said it was solid it s one of your largest practice and it s been the growth engine of agency in the last few years so organic would be great and if you don t want to give a precise number maybe a range i don t know 2 5 to 5 or 5 to 7 5 and then last question is on the number of shares it was flat in q4 well it usually goes down by about 1 plus million a quarter so what happened in terms of number of shares in q4 thank you john d wren chairman and chief executive officer i ll let phil answer some of these are you applying for a job because some of the detailed questions are probably questions a few employees that actually look at it we are not in the business of segregating our businesses in a particular market we haven t done in the past but our events business our main business is media advertising and public relations in that market events add something to it but i m not going to get into the dissection of that for disclosure so i apologize for that but what was the second the go ahead julien roch barclays analyst and then no i mean if you knew that i just wanted to have an idea of the growth of media in 2019 philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i think overall it wasn t disproportionately higher or lower than our overall growth rate i think if you go through the numbers we ve been through on the call you can see media advertising and healthcare grew better than the overall portfolio and some of the overall portfolio namely pr crm execution support in particular either didn t grow so by that you can include the 3 that did grow or the primary drivers of our growth grew at a little bit higher rate than our overall average rate for the quarter and the year and i think each of those businesses had a good year and did well and drove our growth overall but as far as the specific percentages i think we provide quite a bit of information to give you a good sense of that but i don t think there re any dramatic anything dramatically different about that part of our portfolio and some of our media business is actually in like markets such as brazil and some others are integrated into the advertising businesses they aren t stand alone media businesses so it s hard to pull out exactly how much of the growth in those markets came from stand alone media versus advertising because they are integrated and as far as shares go in the fourth quarter i m not quite sure i follow in detail your observation but we can go through that after the call i think certainly we bought back through share repurchases as little bit more in the fourth quarter this year than we did in the prior year and maybe what you re seeing has something to do with just the way the year end averages get complied and we haven t seen the effects just yet julien roch barclays analyst oh is that just the timing because 219 3 diluted number of shares in q4 and you had 219 4 in q4 so it s just the timing of the average then philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yeah you kind of you will see i think more of that or an acceleration of that effect when you get into 2021as the averages start over julien roch barclays analyst okay very clear thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i think given when the markets open we probably have time for one more call one more question operator thank you our final question then will come from adrien de saint hilaire from boa please go ahead one moment please go ahead adrien de saint hilaire bank of america merrill lynch analyst i ll try and be quick thank you very much so first of all on the chinese points you said it was down mid single digits i m just curious if you have any explanation why it is indeed down mid single digits in an economy which is still growing 5 to 6 second question is on your expectations around the phasing out of cookies at google do you think that s bad news in the short term good news in the long run or maybe the other way around or is that good news in all cases and then lastly about your performance in the middle east should we expect some carry over into the first half of 2020 as well thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll take the china question i think our growth this year in china was largely due to some performance challenges i think we lost a couple of clients and frankly as a portfolio our agencies with some exceptions but our agencies didn t perform as well as they did the year before frankly i think the current situation presents a very different set of challenges so until we get some more clarity and so the situation resolves itself i think our expectations are similar to everybody else is there is just little bit too much uncertainty to have a clear picture as to how it s going to roll out in china and in the middle east i think we ve got some good businesses that we expect to continue to grow but as an overall percentage of omnicom s portfolio and omnicom s growth we don t expect that to be significant or meaningful but it s been a nice part of our portfolio and we ve got some nice businesses over there that have been doing well and we certainly expect them to continue to do well john d wren chairman and chief executive officer with respect to your first question regarding cookies honestly we ve been expecting this for some time now it s not new news to us it will make targeting a little bit more challenging than it was in the past then it certainly will make google stronger but in anticipation of it that s why we work so diligently on the creation of omni and the enhancements that we made to it in the future it s not just going to be the data it also has a lot to do with the execution which you actually do with that data and how you process it clients other people have other sources which we can get access to from first party data which can be used to accomplish many of the objectives that were made a little bit easier with cookies adrien de saint hilaire bank of america merrill lynch analyst so you don t expect any impact on your media activities just to be clear from that news john d wren chairman and chief executive officer very minor but i expect because we ve been adjusting and we ve been anticipating this for some period of time there will be changes to everything what happens today will be different to what happens tomorrow but we re not threatened by it and it makes us more valuable philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the more complexity there is in the marketplace the more clients need our expertise and need us to help them solve some of the challenges that this creates for them not just for us adrien de saint hilaire bank of america merrill lynch analyst many thanks john d wren chairman and chief executive officer good philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer okay thank you everybody for taking the call and for joining us and have a good rest of the day john d wren chairman and

rosario argentina business wire bioceres crop solutions corp bioceres nyse american biox a fully integrated provider of crop productivity solutions announced today its unaudited consolidated financial results for fiscal second quarter 2020 and the six month period ended december 31 2019 financial results are expressed in u s dollars and are presented in accordance with international financial reporting standards 2q20 financial and business highlights comparable revenues up 6 yoy with volume growth across key product lines despite macroeconomic and weather headwinds in argentina continued expansion of adjuvants seed treatment packs and inoculants into brazil and uruguay alongside a successful salesforce restructuring in paraguay supported sales performance for the quarter micro beaded fertilizers ramp up continued to deliver sales growth as well adjusted ebitda up 4 yoy achieving 21 1 million for the quarter with a margin expansion of 103 basis points to 33 5 395 hectares 976 acres of ecowheat were harvested during the quarter yield benefits across different environments ranged from 8 0 in highest yielding fields to 22 1 compared to commercial controls weather conditions were particularly conducive to highlighting hb4 technology s full potential seed inventory in place for planting of projected 12 000 hectares 29 760 acres in 4q20 2 905 hectares 7 178 acres of ecosoy were planted in argentina to ramp up seed inventories seed produced expected to enable planting of up to approximately 90 000 hectares during next summer s crop season in the southern hemisphere moving the company closer to broad commercialization execution of strategic agreements with okaratech ltd enabled beta launch of digital platform to track and support activities in ecofields subsequent to quarter end bioceres entered into a commercialization agreement for rizobacter branded biologicals with brett young a distributor with a solid footprint in western canada and the us northern plains this is expected to accelerate the company s penetration in the northern hemisphere commenting on the company s results mr federico trucco chief executive officer of bioceres said from a big picture perspective the most important milestone for the quarter was the validation of ecowheat performance at hundreds of hectares for the first time hb4 benefits were consistent with those estimated in our product development trials testifying to the robustness of our r d process off season multiplication of ecosoy inventories allowed us to approximate the 3 000 hectares planted during the quarter keeping us on track with inventory ramp up projections for both crops also an important achievement for the period was the beta launch of our digital platform providing a very valuable field to cloud data interface from an operating viewpoint we were able to partially recover sales in argentina from the prior quarter while actively managing costs though this was not sufficient to accomplish the full growth we expected for the period in sum we continue to execute on our strategic priorities of leading with innovation operating with excellence and driving increased productivity our goal is to build on the foundation for growth we have in place to take all our businesses to the next level mr enrique lopez lecube cfo of bioceres said it was an important accomplishment to confirm an overall growth trend in revenues as well as ebitda during the quarter considering the adverse scenario under which the planting season unfolded in argentina where macroeconomic and drought conditions generated uncertainty amongst farmers the commercial teams did a good job at dealing with headwinds and partially recovering packs sales that had not happened in q1 our business proved to be resilient with multiple sources for growth and profitability brazil paraguay and uruguay continued to be an offsetting factor to argentina while the micro beaded fertilizers and adjuvants also performed well in terms of financing we will continue to identify opportunities that extend the maturity of our debt and maximize cash generation as well as securing future capital requirements from our core initiative around hb4 mr lopez lecube concluded review of operating performance installed capacity utilization of the micro beaded fertilizer plant for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 reached 27 2 this was a 22 5 yoy increase bringing total production to 13 600 tons for the trailing twelve month period driven by sales in argentina brazil uruguay paraguay and bolivia adjuvants aggregated volume in fiscal 2q20 increased 10 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 this was led by brazil which delivered 37 growth yoy as the company continues to execute its growth strategy in that country other international subsidiaries ex argentina increased 18 yoy argentina volume was up 6 maintaining the leading position in the high end adjuvants market for the six month period ended december 31 2019 adjuvants aggregated volume increased 3 compared to the same period in 2018 which factors in a shift from high volume lower margin products into higher margin adjuvants in argentina inoculants and seed treatment doses aggregated volume in fiscal 2q20 increased 5 yoy reflecting partial recovery of purchases delayed for summer crops seed treatment packs in argentina and higher packs sales in other countries for the six month period ended december 31 2019 inoculant doses decreased 3 compared to the same period in 2018 partially reflecting delayed purchases in the prior quarter review of

2q19 negatively impacted by ias29 adjustment comparable revenues during the quarter increased 6 yoy driven by growth in adjuvants seed treatment packs and inoculants in brazil uruguay and paraguay as well as sustained micro beaded fertilizers sales growth this was partially offset by weaker than anticipated seed treatment packs sales in argentina where macroeconomic and weather uncertainty faced by farmers at planting did not permit a full recovery of delayed fiscal 1q20 pack sales crop protection comparable revenues for the quarter increased 8 yoy or 2 1 million to 29 8 million driven by adjuvants sales in argentina and brazil as well as higher sales of seed treatment therapics insecticides and fungicides this growth was partially offset by lower baits sales in argentina which are

segment crop protection comparable revenues for the six months delivered a 10 yoy growth or 4 3 million reaching 49 3 million mainly explained by adjuvants growth in brazil and argentina during the first half of the fiscal year seed and integrated products comparable revenues for the six month period decreased 2 yoy or 0 5 million to 18 5 million this was due to an overall decline in seed treatment packs sales in argentina as macroeconomic and weather uncertainty faced by farmers at planting affected decisions throughout the period this was partially offset by higher seed revenues generated by growth in seed royalty payments during the fiscal first quarter and higher seed treatment packs sales in brazil and paraguay crop nutrition comparable revenues for the six month period

ago period comparable gross margin for the period was 49 vis a vis 53 in the prior year period reflecting fx and inflation dynamics in argentina that affected production costs the sharp depreciation of the currency that occurred in calendar 2018 fiscal 1h19 had positively impacted results for the prior year s period but was not reflected in fiscal 1h20 gross profit and margins were driven by the

fiscal 2q20 was 10 5 million down from 10 7 million in the same period of the prior year reflecting cost efficiencies sg a for the six month period was 19 2 million excluding a one time expense of 1 1 million stock based compensation and transaction expenses accrued in 1q20 sg a for fiscal 1h20 would have been 18 1 million compared to 16 8 million in the corresponding year ago period the increase for fiscal 1h20 is mainly explained by fx and inflation dynamics in argentina as most of the business support functions are headquartered in the country and the corresponding costs denominated in local currency the sharp depreciation of the argentine peso that occurred in calendar 2018 had a positive impact in fiscal 1h19 results while fiscal 1h20 did not get a similar benefit in terms of sg a furthermore higher commercial expenses related to business growth partially offset by lower professional fees and outsourced services also explain the increase for the six month period research

therefore management has set a leverage ratio target that is measured by net debt divided by adjusted ebitda application of ias 29 argentina has been classified as a hyperinflationary economy under the terms of ias 29 beginning july 1 2018 ias 29 requires adjusting all non monetary items in the statement of financial position by applying a general price index from the day they were booked to the end of the reporting period at the same time it also requires that all items in the statement of income are expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period consequently on a monthly basis results of operations for each reporting period are measured in argentine pesos and adjusted for inflation by the applicable monthly inflation rate each month all amounts need to be restated by applying the change in the general price index from the dates when the items of income and expenses were initially recorded in the financial statements as a result each

financial position accordingly monthly results of operations in argentine pesos after adjustment for inflation pursuant to ias 29 as described above must then be converted into u s dollars at the closing exchange rate for such monthly reported period this conversion changes every prior reported monthly statement of income in u s dollars as each monthly amount is readjusted under ias 29 for

speech by isabel schnabel member of the executive board of the ecb at the juristische studiengesellschaft in recent years germany has experienced one of the longest economic upswings since the second world war since 2010 the german economy has grown at an average annual rate of 2 unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since german reunification the monetary policy of the ecb has contributed significantly to that expansion by lowering interest rates and making use of new monetary policy instruments the ecb has created financing conditions that support investment growth and job creation across the euro area and it was the ecb s decisive action in 2012 that prevented a break up of the euro area despite these considerable successes the public debate about monetary policy has become more heated in parts of the euro area and especially in germany the conversation is dominated by various narratives such as the expropriation of german savers through punishment rates the flood of money that will inevitably lead to massive inflation and the creation of zombie firms as a result of expansionary monetary policy in my remarks today i would like to take a closer look at some of these narratives and discuss them in the light of the facts i will demonstrate that the ecb s current monetary policy stance is necessary in order to achieve sustained price stability in the euro area and that the use of unconventional monetary policy tools such as negative interest rates and asset purchases is largely a consequence of structural changes in the economy that lie beyond the ecb s control i will also discuss the potential side effects of these monetary policy measures and show that many of the fears that are frequently being expressed are based on half truths and false narratives the excessive criticism of the ecb is dangerous because it not only jeopardises trust in our single monetary policy but also undermines european cohesion economic developments and ecb policy facts and perceptions the mandate states that the primary objective of the european system of central banks is to maintain price stability assigning the ecb a price stability objective was seen as particularly important in germany owing to fears of inflationary developments the ecb s governing council has defined price stability in the euro area as an annual increase in consumer prices of below but close to 2 over the medium term since the euro was introduced inflation in the euro area has tended to be too low rather than too high slide 3 the annual inflation rate for the euro area as a whole has averaged 1 7 since 1999 and the rate for germany has been 1 4 significantly lower than during the period before the introduction of the euro stable prices have been accompanied by significant economic growth slide 4 over the past decade in no other large industrialised nation has real per capita income growth been stronger than in germany in 2015 prices each german has on average about 6 000 more in their pocket now than they did ten years ago in italy by contrast average per capita income has remained broadly flat over the same period at the same time german unemployment fell to its lowest level since reunification these developments are all the more remarkable given the huge global disturbances we have seen in recent years such as the financial crisis the euro area crisis trade tensions between the united states and china and the united kingdom s departure from the eu economic success in germany is reflected in high and rising approval rates for the euro slide 5 support for the euro in germany is higher than it has ever been eight out of ten persons in germany support the euro which is above the european average and although trust in the ecb has typically been lower than in the euro itself it remains above the european average in germany given these positive figures it is surprising that the ecb has for years faced such fierce public criticism in germany the media and politicians never tire of pointing out the supposed perils and deficiencies of today s monetary policy wide ranging public debate and well founded criticism are crucial for an independent institution like the ecb however the central criterion by which the ecb must be judged is whether it is fulfilling its mandate in germany however criticism is all too often combined with claims and accusations that have no basis in fact in addition and this is something that worries me discussions are taking place in an atmosphere of rising aggression and a coarsening of the language german media have for example made references to count draghila who sucks dry german savings accounts or the biggest expropriation project since the soviet dismantling of industry and east german forced collectivisation slide 6 such images are hardly conducive to objective debate and this kind of aggressive language is not limited to the media politicians of various parties have referred to mario draghi as the gravedigger of german savers or the speculators accomplice who has continuously expropriated savers slide 7 this public reaction far exceeds the usual degree of criticism about economic policy decisions and it seems that negative interest rates are the chief cause of these deep feelings of discontent indeed negative interest rates are a relatively recent addition to the central banking toolbox slide 8 the ecb first took the deposit rate for banks into negative territory in june 2014 and subsequently lowered it to 0 5 in several steps structural factors are the main driver of interest rates against this background the question arises as to why the ecb needs to make use of negative rates and why interest rates were much higher in the past if inflation needs to be pushed up central banks need to bring the real interest rate that is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation below what is called the real equilibrium interest rate the rate at which all factors of production are at full capacity and inflation is stable the level of the real equilibrium rate is determined by a number of structural factors such as a country s demographic situation or capacity to innovate the real equilibrium interest rate cannot be directly observed and instead has to be estimated and almost all estimation methods show that the real equilibrium interest rate in the euro area has fallen markedly over the past 20 years slide 10 indeed many estimates have even been showing negative values in recent years this suggests that the supply of capital is matched with relatively low demand in other words that the desire to save is meeting with a comparatively low propensity to invest germany offers a prime example of this savings surplus the vast and enduring current account surplus means that in germany much more is being saved than invested the central bank however steers the nominal rate of interest that is the sum of the real interest rate and expected future inflation if the real equilibrium interest rate and inflation are both strongly positive the central bank has considerable scope to stimulate the economy by cutting rates but if the real equilibrium rate is close to zero or even negative that scope is greatly reduced because monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound and so you can see that low equilibrium interest rates create problems for the central bank if its price stability mandate is threatened by too low inflation or even the risk of deflation the ecb is however not the only central bank faced with this problem slide 11 the equilibrium interest rate has been falling across large parts of the industrialised world since the early 1970s what is behind this negative global trend one important driver is the fall in long term trend growth this is determined by the amount of resources labour and capital used and by how efficiently those resources are used as reflected by productivity and indeed all of these sources of growth have followed a declining trend in many advanced economies while annual productivity growth in the euro area in the 1980s was on average still around 2 today it is somewhat less than half of that slide 12 left hand side and the working age population in the euro area has for some time even been in decline demographic developments mean that this decline is highly likely to continue in the coming decades slide 12 right hand side in addition in recent decades the leading industrial nations have undergone massive structural change owing not least to digitalisation and have been moving away from capital intensive manufacturing industries towards less capital intensive service industries low interest rate environment requires unconventional monetary policy measures a key conclusion that can be drawn on the basis of this analysis is that it is not primarily the central bank that is responsible for low interest rates it is not within the power of the central bank to change the structural conditions that would turn around the negative interest rate trend the call for higher interest rates should instead be directed at governments and legislators combined with the urgent demand for measures to strengthen the growth potential of our economies a second conclusion is that these developments have an impact on the toolbox of central banks in order to maintain price stability central banks around the world had to resort to a number of unconventional instruments in order to bring inflation back to a level that is consistent with their medium term inflation aim the ecb for its part turned to unconventional measures when very low and later negative inflation rates took hold in the euro area and inflation expectations noticeably weakened slide 13 left hand side but unconventional measures were not restricted to negative interest rates in addition these included guidance on the future stance of monetary policy known in technical jargon as forward guidance targeted longer term refinancing operations that offer banks highly attractive conditions provided they extend credit to firms and an extensive purchase programme for bonds issued by public and private issuers this resulted in a massive expansion of the ecb s balance sheet slide 13 right hand side overall these measures have ensured that the borrowing costs of businesses and households in the euro area have fallen considerably over recent years and more strongly than would have been expected solely on the basis of the reduction in key interest rates slide 14 left hand side favourable financing conditions have in turn stimulated demand for loans and thus supported investment and job creation slide 14 right hand side together these monetary policy measures have given the euro area economy a decisive boost as shown by eurosystem economists estimates overall the estimates indicate that in the period from 2015 to 2019 inflation in the euro area would have been around one third to one half a percentage point per year lower without the measures taken by the ecb since the middle of 2014 slide 15 left hand side real gdp in the euro area in 2019 would have been between 2 5 and 3 0 lower and employment by more than two million lower slide 15 middle and right hand side thus these measures were not only necessary to fulfil the mandate of price stability they also had considerable positive effects on growth and employment in the current situation a fundamental departure from this policy does not seem appropriate not least in view of the weak economic developments in germany as well as in other parts of the euro area supposed and actual side effects of monetary policy all of this does not mean however that unconventional policy measures do not have their problems when conducting monetary policy the ecb and other central banks monitor possible side effects of their policy and take these into consideration in their monetary policy decisions insofar as this does not conflict with their mandate the question is however whether the side effects of the current monetary policy are as severe as german media coverage suggests in my remaining time today i would like to examine three of the side effects that have attracted the most discussion the first concerns the effects of monetary policy on income and wealth distribution and the supposed expropriation of german savers the second question concerns the effects on the corporate landscape and the purported emergence of zombie firms and the last concerns financial stability and above all the effects on asset prices are german savers being expropriated let me begin with the narrative on the expropriation of german savers first it should be pointed out that there is no entitlement to high interest rates on savings which is what the term expropriation implies and it is not part of the ecb s mandate to ensure high interest rates for savers yet it is important to consider the facts and figures so far only a relatively small proportion of the deposits of private households in germany have in fact been directly affected by negative interest rates slide 17 left hand side in the euro area it is even fewer slide 17 right hand side more so from a historical perspective the current return on savings deposits is not at all as untypical as many observers suggest slide 18 the reason is that what ultimately really matters for savers are real interest rates that is interest income less inflation a high nominal interest rate is of little benefit to savers if at the same time the purchasing power of money has fallen by a similar or greater amount that was the situation in the 1970s many observers may be surprised to learn that the average real interest rate for savings and demand deposits in germany since the introduction of the euro is around the average of the previous 24 years moreover germany consists not only of savers but also of borrowers taxpayers property owners and of course workers for the population as a whole there is for the period from 2007 to 2017 for a representative german household even a small plus on the bottom line of the interest account i e not taking into account wealth effects slide 19 left hand side an average net saver may indeed have received around 500 per year less in interest income however an average net borrower has saved almost 2 000 each year in interest payments in addition there are more than 400 billion in interest rate savings for the german general government since 2017 if the figures are broken down by income group you can see that the middle income group which is the group with the most borrowers were the winners of the low interest rate policy slide 19 right hand side in addition among the distributional effects of monetary policy its positive effects on the labour market must not be ignored slide 20 left hand side the results of an empirical study by ecb economists show that above all poorer income groups have profited from the monetary policy measures because they benefit in particular from the fall in unemployment finally monetary policy may also have effects on the wealth distribution through its impact on asset prices whereby those individuals with the largest wealth in the form of shares and real estate would stand to benefit the most one implication is that whether or not changes in asset prices ultimately cause an increase in wealth inequality depends among other factors on the rate of home ownership and although home ownership has traditionally been comparatively low in germany the latest available figures do not point to a material increase in wealth inequality between 2014 and 2017 slide 20 right hand side taken together the above analysis indicates that the distributional consequences of monetary policy are much more nuanced than what the public debate would suggest indeed in view of the diverse and partly opposing effects it is not at all clear whether monetary policy is associated with a redistribution of income and wealth from the bottom to the top and the overall effect is clearly positive does monetary policy create zombie firms a second narrative deployed by some critics relates to the effects of the low interest rate policy on the corporate landscape the theory is that low interest rates give sustenance to zombie firms i e firms whose profitability is so low that they would not be viable if interest rates were higher i should start by pointing out that profitability is often a false measure of expected future economic success some of the most promising companies in the world such as tesla or previously facebook and amazon did not make a profit for a long time but even if you take profitability as a yardstick a systematic increase in unprofitable businesses in the years of expansionary monetary policy cannot be seen here we are looking at the latest calculations of ecb economists based on a micro dataset of several million firms the proportion of companies with very negative profitability the red time series has not increased in germany in recent years slide 22 left hand side the proportion of highly profitable companies the green time series has even risen since the crisis one explanation for this is that more favourable financing conditions benefit all firms but most of all profitable healthy firms to whom banks are more willing to provide favourable loans than they are to unprofitable and highly indebted ones in addition profits and investment are subject to cyclical fluctuations it is reasonable to assume that monetary policy has led to a decline in firms with negative profitability by stimulating the economy this positive effect of monetary policy is of course desirable and contrary to what the zombie theory would predict and it is especially noticeable in the countries that were particularly hard hit by the european sovereign debt crisis such as spain slide 22 right hand side after increasing abruptly when the crisis broke out the share of less profitable firms in that country gradually fell back to pre crisis levels when economic growth picked up but such cyclical effects should not belie the existing structural deficiencies compared with other large economies first and foremost the united states europe still has structural weaknesses which are curbing the potential growth of the euro area the structural reforms of recent years have helped to remedy some of these weaknesses in many former crisis hit countries all in all however the labour and goods markets in the euro area remain comparatively rigid meaning that the broader conditions for growth and innovation need to be improved further with a view to counteracting the weakness in productivity growth part of the problem here is the european banking and capital market the european banking sector has not yet recovered from the serious crisis that emerged around ten years ago and it is still dealing with pre crisis structural problems such as inefficient cost structures the establishment of the banking union was a fundamental step towards enhancing the resilience of the european banking sector among the priorities of the new ecb banking supervision is the swift reduction of non performing loans significant progress has been made in this regard in recent years slide 23 left hand side the ratio of non performing loans in italy for example fell by half over the past four years and initial successes can now be seen in greece too these advances are likely to be far more important for the de zombification of the european corporate landscape than monetary policy for example an ecb analysis shows that weak banks are more likely to extend risky loans to weak firms slide 23 right hand side so the drive to press on with banking sector reforms plays a significant part in enhancing the forces of economic growth this includes allowing weak banks to exit the market which would at the same time alleviate the problem of weak profitability in the remaining banks in addition we need a developed european capital market which also provides capital to young ambitious and risk taking firms in europe and continues to finance them throughout their growth phase a functioning capital market is necessary for mastering the enormous challenges facing us today climate change digitalisation and demographic trends the european capital markets union can play a significant role here monetary policy and asset price bubbles the last narrative i would like to discuss this evening is the claim that loose monetary policy leads to price bubbles in the financial and real estate markets fears that monetary policy entails risks for financial stability should indeed be taken very seriously in fact one objective of the current expansionary monetary policy is to revive risk appetite among investors and thus promote growth and investment activity it is normal for asset prices to rise during phases of low interest rates equity prices for example reflect firms discounted earnings expectations if the interest rate falls equity prices will go up because future earnings will have a greater bearing on current valuations however earnings expectations themselves also tend to increase when interest rates are lowered because investors anticipate stronger economic growth and indeed the current price earnings ratio in the euro area is a long way off from the excesses of the dotcom bubble of 2000 and it is closer to its historical median than in other economies slide 25 left hand side nonetheless central banks need to keep a close eye on such valuations as purely liquidity driven price gains can result in risks for financial stability in the long term asset price bubbles pose a particular risk when they are largely credit driven this is typically more likely to apply to real estate than to equities that is why developments in real estate prices are rightly coming under particular scrutiny residential real estate prices in germany have risen appreciably in recent years especially in the larger cities and the deutsche bundesbank has repeatedly pointed to possible price excesses two factors are significant here first prices always reflect the interplay of supply and demand the pronounced price increase in german towns and cities reflects a noticeably stronger demand for housing that was unmatched by any corresponding expansion of supply there was a stronger influx of people to the towns and cities and a simultaneous increase in the demand for housing space per person the low interest rates are likely to have further fuelled the demand for residential real estate putting extra pressure on prices second despite the latest surge cpi adjusted real estate prices in germany are still at a comparatively low level by international standards today they are at around the same level than in 1990 slide 25 right hand side in the united kingdom by contrast they doubled over the same period while in sweden they even rose by some 160 to assess the risks for financial stability we must also look at the development of indebtedness despite the real estate boom and low interest rates private indebtedness in germany and in the euro area as a whole relative to gdp has barely risen in recent years slide 26 left hand side the development in private indebtedness thus differs markedly from the development prior to the global financial crisis macroprudential supervision has the task of closely monitoring developments in lending and borrowing and of taking measures to rein in credit growth where appropriate many eu member states have built up additional capital buffers in their banking sector albeit generally rather late and only to a limited extent in the case of public debtors however the level of indebtedness in the euro area has risen considerably slide 26 right hand side in the entire euro area public debt relative to gdp is 22 percentage points higher than in 2007 although there is very significant heterogeneity across the member states in germany government debt is two percentage points lower than in 2007 while in italy it is 31 percentage points higher highly indebted member states did not make enough use of the period of low interest rates to consolidate their government budgets but it is up to politicians to tackle the problem of high public debt not the ecb conclusions let me conclude i have shown that many of the narratives about monetary policy cannot withstand careful analysis the level of interest rates has fallen sharply over the past years for structural reasons in order to fulfil its mandate the ecb therefore had to use new unconventional instruments such as negative interest rates and bond purchases in the absence of these monetary policy measures the euro area s development would have been much weaker growth and inflation would have been lower and the rate of unemployment higher at the same time all monetary policy measures have side effects they result in distributional effects have an impact on the survival of unprofitable firms and harbour risks for financial stability but it is primarily up to other policymakers to counter such side effects distributional issues lie in the remit of fiscal and social welfare policy and containing risks in the financial system is a task for financial market regulators and supervisors of course the central bank also needs to take the side effects into account when designing monetary policy measures especially when they have repercussions for price stability careful consideration of the costs and benefits must be an integral part of monetary policy decisions the question as to how exactly this should be done will be part of the ecb s review of its monetary policy strategy this year it is important that the public should accompany this process critically and constructively but this should be based on facts rather than on narratives with no solid grounds thank you very much

first reports that shed light on the economic fallout from the coronavirus the headline of an almost 69 4 jump in exports though is a bit of a statistical quirk it is flattered by the number of

that sterling largely rangebound between 1 2870 and 1 2960 though lower highs are being recorded for the fourth consecutive session america president trump presented his budget proposals for the fiscal year that begins in april 2021 the president s budget proposals carry little weight and not only because it is an election year but because the power of the purse is invested in the legislature not the executive knowing this trump s budget is particularly aggressive because it violated the two year spending agreement struck last year between treasury secretary mnuchin and house speaker pelosi keeping in mind that congress is unlikely to finish the budget until after the november election means to accept that the spending proposals are a political statement to his party and base it is aspirational and this is evident too in the growth forecasts that are assumed the white house projects growth will be 3 1 in q4 20 year over year and then 3 for the next few years the non partisan congressional budget office forecasts 2 2 this year and the fed s median projection is 2 the private sector is more downbeat and according to a recent bloomberg survey the median private sector

the coronavirus yesterday both daly non voter and harker voter still were emphasizing the good place that the us economy was in suggesting no change in their stance however powell may be a bit more balanced and highlight the international risks which were the basis of the argument for easing last year second powell may discuss the fed s operations aimed at ensuring a smooth transmission of its policy which has resulted in repo operations and 60 bln a month of t bill purchases powell may help explain why this is not qe and the actions have kept financial market conditions broadly stable and supportive third there may be some follow up to comments by vice chair quarles that suggested the fed may be open to some changes in how minimum reserves are calculated such a shift toward average holdings rather than the end of period year positions the dollar has made higher highs against the canadian dollar for four sessions through yesterday but it still has not convincingly taken out the

lexical choices that are not neutral the terms used to designate the different categories of countries convey the theoretical and political divergences in terms of analysis and strategy generally these divergences are related to the social contents of the economic concepts the economic categories are often presented as reflecting natural laws in which social relations and power struggles have a limited place thus the conception of underdevelopment as being a simple time lag sometimes ascribed to natural causes largely dominates them let us have a look at some of these terms in 1951 in a brazilian journal i mentioned three worlds yet without using the term third world i coined and used the term for the first time in writing in the french weekly l observateur on 14 august 1952 this is how the article ended because at last this ignored exploited third world looked down on as the third state also wants to be acknowledged i was referring to the well known words of sieyes on the third estate during the french revolution alfred sauvy demographer and economist poor countries a term that focuses on the economic poverty of the majority of the populations in the countries concerned and obscures the blatant inequalities that exist there moreover a number of countries considered poor are actually very rich in natural resources not to mention their cultural wealth these countries should be called exploited or impoverished countries a term that focuses on the economic poverty of the majority of the populations in the countries concerned and obscures the blatant inequalities that exist there moreover a number of countries considered poor are actually very rich in natural resources not to mention their cultural wealth these countries should be called exploited or impoverished countries countries of the south a convenient term to stigmatise the break with the countries in the northern hemisphere often developed and dominant but having the double defect of ignoring the numerous exceptions to this geographic classification and letting people believe in a natural fatalism this is why in latin america they speak about the global south and the global north in order to distinguish them from geographical references we also speak about the souths in the plural to highlight the het erogeneity among countries of the south a convenient term to stigmatise the

an undeniable development process that which distinguishes them from the body of the formerly more homogenous third world china india and brazil being the principal examples this term is often enough replaced by emerging markets and this substitution clearly reflects the neo liberal vision of a development that can only be achieved through insertion in the international division of labour imposed by capitalist globalization it should be noted that five countries labelled emerging countries have developed some sort of mutual collaboration in a context called brics brics the term brics an acronym for brazil russia india china and south africa was first used in 2001 by jim o neill then an economist at goldman sachs the strong economic growth of these countries combined with their important geopolitical position these 5 countries bring together almost half the world s population on 4 continents and almost a quarter of the world s gdp make the brics major players in international economic and financial activities after their respective initials brazil russia india china and south africa a term designating the economies that have initiated an undeniable

russia india china and south africa countries in transition towards a market economy a euphemism for countries of eastern europe which after the collapse of the ussr and the explosion of the soviet bloc followed a process of capitalist revival for the cadtm the distinction north south developed developing countries also covers the domination by international financial institutions ifi such as the world bank the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries and other creditors that enforce imperialist and neocolonial policies monitored by the major powers in the north in spite of the various shortcomings of these terms the following terms are used as synonyms countries of the south south s periphery impoverished countries developing countries third world they are usually contrasted with countries of the north north centre also used as synonyms this group is dominated by the main industrialized countries or imperialist countries in spite of our reluctance and because of statistical data we have had to use categories established by the world bank indeed we cannot rely on sufficient resources to set up our own database on a global scale taking into account more relevant standards than those the world bank uses to establish various categories of countries in 2020 according to the world bank developing countries consists of three categories according to their incomes namely 31 low income economies countries where the gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another per capita is lower than or equal to 1 025 par year per capita is lower than or equal to 1 025 par year 47 lower middle income economies countries where the gdp per capita stands between 1 026 and 3 995 per year 60 upper middle income economies countries where the gdp per capita stands between 3 996 and 12 375 per year this classification includes among developing countries economies as different from each other as thailand and haiti brazil and niger russia and bangladesh the world bank includes china among the 60 higher middle income economies we have decided to treat china on its own considering the country s economic significance and the size of its population according to our approach there are 137 countries of the south in 2020 vs 138 for the world bank schematically speaking the south includes latin america the caribbean the middle east north africa sub saharan africa south asia south east asia and the pacific central asia turkey central and eastern european countries outside the eu as well as bulgaria and romania that are members of the eu when we use the term north we mean the group of 80 countries identified by the world bank as high income economies namely countries where the gdp per capita is over 12 375 per year the north thus includes west european countries central and eastern european countries that are members of the eu except bulgaria and romania the united states of america canada japan south korea australia new zealand and some forty countries at various latitudes not all of these countries are industrialized in the sense of their economies consisting of a significant manufacturing sector indeed some of those countries are hardly industrialized at all but they are regarded by international bodies as having achieved a high level of income either because they managed to attract foreign capital notably through their status as tax havens such as panama the seychelles bahamas the caiman islands or because they can rely on income from oil extraction such as the arab states of the persian gulf or brunei in south east asia world distribution of population wealth and co2 emissions countries of the south account for about 66 china for about 18 and countries of the north for about 16 of a world population estimated at about 7 8 billion in 2020 distribution of the world population in 2020 blue southern countries orange china grey northern countries source united nations gross domestic product gdp is traditionally the index used by many economists to assess the production of wealth in the world however it only provides an imperfect biased and disputable perception for at least five reasons unpaid labour mainly that of women which is vital for social reproduction is not taken into account environmental damage is not recorded as negative see box below the account unit used is the price of a good or service not the amount of work required to produce it inequalities within countries are not taken into account the way debt impacts on the progression of economic political social and cultural indices is excluded in spite of these shortcomings the gdp reveals deep economic imbalances between the north and the south the gdp as well as other economic indices used in this study are in us dollars except when otherwise specified since nowadays about 60 of foreign exchange reserves 88 of international trade and the majority of loans are denominated in this currency the accumulation of wealth is largely concentrated in the north in almost inverse proportion to the distribution of population while the share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings of the north in the accumulation of world wealth has decreased over the past years it is to be noted that the reason for this is not a larger part share accumulated by countries of the south but china s strong economic growth regions distribution of world gdp in 2010

greenhouse gases are countries of the north and china brazil and india frequently many political leaders and ceos in countries of the north reiterate that china now emits most ghg and should thus make the greatest effort to reduce those emissions and fight climate change such discourse is actually a way of avoiding any acknowledgment of the countries of the north s historical responsibility in ghg emissions since the industrial revolution in the 19th century ghgs remain present for decades in the atmosphere and their consequences on climate change can occur 40 years after their emission it also ignores the part played by china in the international division of labour a lot of ghg emission in china results from its manufacture of goods that are sold worldwide and notably in the north where the domestic purchasing power is higher by multinational corporations based in countries of the north a more detailed analysis of co2e emissions taking into account those imported emissions 9 similarly the global footprint network has developed an indicator which combines the human development index hdi and countries ecological footprints as it takes those two variants into account the analysis of development is quite different in 2015 no single country in the world combined a high hdi and a sustainable ecological footprint on the other hand countries that were close to this combination were mainly located in south america with cuba in the lead 10 so countries of the north have been able to develop their economies and achieve relatively high living standards thanks to significant ghg emissions in the necessary struggle against climate change countries of the north have to reduce a much higher proportion of their emissions than do countries of the south for the allowed emissions within the requirements of a drastic reduction at a global level to be used not only to achieve a transition towards an energy system using 100 of renewable resources but also to improve living standards in countries of the south it is also essential to recall the responsibility of large capitalist corporations over the past two centuries indeed very large corporations that appeared during the 19th century or at the beginning of the 20th century have a huge responsibility in ghg emissions these include coca cola founded in 1886 pepsi cola 1898 unilever 1930 monsanto 1901 cargill 1865 in the agri food sector bp 1909 shell 1907 exxonmobil 1870 chevron 1879 total 1924 in the oil industry thyssenkrupp 1811 arcelormittal resulting from various groups that developed in the first half of the 20th century in the steel and metal industry volkswagen 1937 general motors 1908 ford 1903 renault nissan mitsubishi a group of three companies that had been created between 1870 and 1932 in the car industry rio tinto 1873 bhp billiton 1895 in the extraction of minerals if we were to calculate the amount of ghg that they have produced since they were founded we would realize that it covers a very high proportion of the ghg that have accumulated in the atmosphere a time bomb that eventually exploded more recently we have to add to that a number of private or public companies in emergent capitalist countries which also have a most damaging effect on the environment such as gasprom and rosneft in russia sinopec and petrochina in china petrobras and vale do rio doce in brazil coal india and tata in india basically whether in the north or in the south the capitalist mode of production is responsible for the destruction of the earth rather than blaming humankind at large for the ecological crisis when we use the word anthropocene we should speak of capitalocene for the capitalist mode of production is the cause of climate change beyond the north south divide class exploitation in all countries yet such a survey of the global economic situation is incomplete since it bypasses the huge inequalities in income and wealth accumulation within nations capitalism has spread on a global scale in this system the capitalist class which accounts for a tiny minority of the population gets richer and richer thanks to the wealth produced by the labour of the majority of the population but also thanks to the exploitation of nature without any concern for its physical limits without any leverage leverage this is the ratio between funds borrowed for investment and the personal funds or equity that backs them up a company may have borrowed much more than its capitalized value in which case it is said to be highly leveraged the more highly a company is leveraged the higher the risk associated with lending to the company but higher also are the possible profits that it may realise as compared with its own value on the means of production most men and women are forced to sell their labour force to capitalists who own the means of production who try to pay the workforce as little as possible thus preventing a majority of the population from escaping the social conditions in which they find themselves conversely wealth accumulated by capitalists makes it possible for them to invest in various sectors so as to diversify their sources of profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders as they exploit both humans and nature in order to keep profits at their highest level and to make sure that this mode of production endures the capitalist class tries not only to pay as low wages as possible but also to prevent redistribution of wealth by paying as little tax as possible and by under valuing social policies such as public services whether housing transport health care or education capitalists also try to prevent workers from organizing notably when they stand up against labour rights the right to form trade unions right to go on strike right to collective bargaining etc conversely workers must organize if they want to acquire social rights and fight those inequalities so there is a class struggle at an international level the intensity of which depends on the level of collective organization of workers in a given place and at a given time in the face of blatant injustices in 2019 2 153 billionaires owned more wealth than 4 6 billion people i e 60 pf the world s population economic inequalities between various groups can be measured through the wealth people can claim and through people s income income from labour wages pensions various social benefits and income from capital such as corporate profits dividends received by shareholders etc the poorest among the world population own literally less than nothing they are indebted and owe money to their creditors generally banks namely to the richest portion of the population in the united states about 12 of the population over 38 million inhabitants are indebted beyond what they can ever hope to repay their

and south as though they were homogeneous entities but rather create a geographical momentum most decisions are made by a tiny minority in the north and in the south the 1 and have heavy negative consequences on the overwhelming majority of the population in the south as in the north the 99 the system of domination and exploitation is being reproduced within each country and each region in india for instance a tiny minority is becoming phenomenally rich thanks to labour performed by hundreds of thousands of poor indians in january 2020 and in another region of the world the international consortium of investigative journalists icij exposed the mechanisms of predation and spoliation used by isabel dos santos to become the richest woman in africa at the expense of the people in her country angola in the united states the first economy in the world over 14 million households were unable to repay their mortgages and were evicted during the sub prime crisis in 2006 but massive foreclosures occurred before and still occur today beyond the distinction between geographical blocks what is at stake is the exploitation of the overwhelming majority of the population in the south as in the north by the tiny minority of the capitalist class also called the 1 this ruling class is motivated by a quest for maximum short term profit we have to understand and fight this division otherwise we run the risk of not perceiving relevant alternatives in our struggle for the emancipation of the majority who are victims of exploitation and oppression patriarchal dominance according to oxfam every day women and girls perform the equivalent of 12 5 billion working hours in unpaid care women perform over three quarters of unpaid work in the world similarly we have to take into account the oppression and exploitation of women everywhere in the world the oppression of women goes back a long way and existed before capitalism the oppression of women as women by men is called patriarchy in the context of capitalism patriarchy means that women and gender minorities are assigned most tasks related to social reproduction which produce and regenerate the living conditions of the labour force such as education care food and thus perpetuate capitalism those tasks are usually performed within the family and are unpaid and made invisible that oppression is reproduced in several ways and beyond the strictly economic aspect through language filiation stereotypes religions culture etc the oppression of women and the patriarchal system are part and parcel of capitalist exploitation whether in the south or in the north the consequences of illegitimate public and private debts reinforce the oppression of women centre periphery relations in the north and in the south brazil s large private corporations exert imperialist relationships of dominance on neighbouring countries in latin america china s big corporations similarly dominate other countries in africa and in south and south east asia those relationships are sometimes called sub imperialism peripheral imperialism or regional imperialism within the eu whose member states are almost all part of the north except for romania and bulgaria peripheral countries are dominated by countries with stronger economies and their large private corporations this applies to countries in the so called south periphery such as greece cyprus spain portugal and to countries in the so called east periphery in central and east europe within the united states people in puerto rico are subjected to a neo colonial relationship we must therefore add the concept of economic centres and peripheries at a regional and continental level to enable a better understanding of international relationships that centre periphery model makes it possible to account for the system of oppression by a centre consisting of dominant economies that enforce their conditions on the peripheral economies that are subjected to this system based on unequal relationships and dependency mechanisms all in the service of capital accumulation contributors to this article included maud bailly nathan legrand milan

on february 4 2020 the us department of commerce doc published a final rule establishing a process by which doc may treat a foreign country s currency undervaluation as a countervailable subsidy for purposes of us countervailing duty cvd proceedings thus potentially subjecting imports from that country to remedial duties the final rule retains the key elements of doc s proposed rule issued in may 2019 but makes several important changes some of which may broaden the rule s applicability the new rule will apply to all segments of countervailing duty proceedings initiated on or after april 6 2020 and will likely prompt domestic petitioners to include new subsidy allegations of currency undervaluation in future cvd petitions or administrative reviews although china has historically been a target of us currency cvd proposals the yuan has lately been considered fairly valued and the new doc rule could result in increased duties on imports from several countries regardless of the target country however any such measures would likely face legal challenges both in us courts and at the world trade organization an overview of the final rule is provided below background and overview of the final rule under both us law and the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures scm agreement a subsidy is defined as 1 a financial contribution e g a grant or loan 2 by a government or public body or by a private body entrusted or directed by the government 3 that confers a benefit on the recipient a subsidy is countervailable where it is specific i e where it is limited to an enterprise or industry group of enterprises industries or a region or where it is a prohibited export subsidy or import substitution subsidy an affirmative doc final determination on countervailable subsidies will result in cvds on subject imports where those goods are also found by the us international trade commission itc to have caused or threatened to cause material injury to the domestic industry producing the same product doc s final rule acknowledges that neither us law nor doc s existing regulations specify how to determine the existence of a benefit or specificity when doc is examining a potential subsidy resulting from the exchange of currency doc therefore has determined to address this issue by modifying two of its regulations pertaining to the determination of benefit and specificity in us cvd proceedings however the final rule does not specify the types of actions that doc would find to constitute the requisite financial contribution and doc has declined to elaborate on this issue in its response to public comments on the proposed rule we discuss these issues in greater detail below financial contribution the final rule does not specify the circumstances in which doc would find that currency undervaluation constitutes a financial contribution nor does it explain how doc will determine whether such a financial contribution has been provided by an authority i e a government or public body or by a private entity entrusted or directed by the government however doc s responses to various comments on the final rule do provide some guidance first doc s statements indicate that the agency s financial contribution determination will be based on an investigated exporter s receipt of domestic currency in exchange for us dollars earned on export transactions in particular doc reiterated the view it expressed in the preamble to the proposed rule that he receipt of domestic currency from an authority or an entity entrusted or directed by an authority in exchange for u s dollars could constitute the financial contribution under section 771 5 d of the act doc further indicated that it would treat such an exchange as a direct transfer of funds under section 771 5 d i second doc also explained that it would only determine in subsequent proceedings whether an entity that is not a government e g a private bank has provided a currency related financial contribution in this regard commenters had requested official interpretations of the statutory terms authority public body and entrusts or directs but doc expressly declined to elaborate and instead stated that that these issues are more appropriately raised in the context of an actual cvd proceeding doc did emphasize however that it will examine entrustment or direction on a case by case basis and enforce this provision vigorously and that the statutory language could encompass a broad range of meanings this suggests that doc could find a financial contribution even where the currency exchanges under investigation are carried out by two private parties in a market economy country benefit doc in the final rule elaborated on the methodology it will normally use to determine whether a currency undervaluation confers a benefit on the exporter under investigation as well as the amount of any such benefit the proposed rule stated only that in determining whether a benefit is conferred when a firm exchanges us dollars for the domestic currency of a country under a unified exchange rate system doc 1 normally will consider a benefit to be conferred when the domestic currency of the country is undervalued in relation to the united states dollar and 2 will request that the treasury department evaluate whether the currency of a country is undervalued the final rule expands on doc s new methodology and adopts a two step approach for determining benefit first the final rule specifies that in determining whether a country s currency is undervalued doc normally will take into account the gap between the country s real effective exchange rate reer and the real effective exchange rate that achieves an external balance over the medium term that reflects appropriate policies equilibrium reer emphasis added in addition the rule now states that doc 1 normally will find the existence of a benefit only if there has been government action on the exchange rate that contributes to an undervaluation of the currency and 2 will not normally include monetary and related credit policy of an independent central bank or monetary authority in assessing whether there has been such government action emphasis added second the rule now specifies that where doc has found a country s currency to be undervalued it normally will determine the existence of a benefit after examining the difference between 1 the nominal bilateral united states dollar rate consistent with the equilibrium reer and 2 the actual nominal bilateral united states dollar rate during the relevant time period taking into account any information regarding the impact of government action on the exchange rate emphasis added where such a difference exists the amount of the benefit from a currency exchange normally will be based on the difference between the amount of currency the firm received in exchange for united states dollars and the amount of currency that firm would have received absent the difference emphasis added doc s responses to public comments on the proposed rule provide limited insight into its likely approach to determining a currency undervaluation benefit for example in expressly rejecting claims that under its methodology x percent undervaluation will necessarily lead to x percent duty doc made clear that the calculation of benefit to a particular firm will be firm specific and based on exporters questionnaire responses thus final cvd rates may be less than the rate of a currency s overall undervaluation and could vary substantially among exporters depending on their reported currency exchange transactions during the period of investigation doc also established that it will not consider whether and to what extent an undervalued exchange rate increases a respondent exporter s costs e g for imported raw materials and equipment thereby reducing the total benefit that the exporter allegedly received on its export transactions according to doc such an offset is not contemplated by the cvd statute and thus was not included in the rule finally doc elaborated on the process by which the us treasury will provide its input in any future cvd proceeding on currency undervaluation as required under the new rule 19 c f r 351 528 c in particular doc will 1 request and expect to receive treasury s evaluation and conclusion as to undervaluation government action and the bilateral u s dollar rate gap and 2 place treasury s evaluation and conclusion on the record and allow the submission of factual information to rebut clarify or correct treasury s evaluation and conclusion as required by 19 c f r 351 301 c 4 these comments provide some additional clarity on doc s likely approach to identifying currency undervaluation and calculating any resulting benefit to exporters but significant ambiguities remain for example as shown above and noted by doc in response to public comments because the final rule provides only that doc normally will follow the stated methodologies doc has retained discretion to use alternative methodologies and evidence that might be less advantageous towards exporters or contradict the views of the imf or other widely accepted currency assessments while doc states that it normally will find a benefit only where government action on the exchange rate has occurred the agency has provided no further guidance on this term stating instead that the scope of government action under this final rule will necessarily become more clear as commerce considers a range of government actions over time and the institutional settings in which they are undertaken relatedly doc has not clarified whether the type of devaluation matters the agency recognizes that treasury is charged with examining whether a country manipulates its exchange rate for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or granting unfair competitive advantage in international trade implying a requirement of intentionality doc on the other hand expressly states that a determination that the foreign subsidizing government is intending to provide a competitive advantage or to otherwise manipulate the playing field is not a required element of a cvd determination under us law thus there would seem to be an unresolved tension between the agencies respective currency mandates and when government intent should be considered this issue is far from abstract for example would doc s final rule treat a country that devalues its currency in response to an economic crisis the same as one that engages in intentional competitive devaluation the rule does not specify whether doc s calculations will take into account an exporter s us based exchange transactions only or alternatively all of the exporter s exchange transactions which could increase the amount of any benefit found to exist doc in response to public comments also held out the possibility that it will expand its approach to calculating benefit in the future by taking into account conversions of all currencies not just the u s dollar into the domestic currency doc states that it does not plan to take this approach at this time given the agency s lack of experience with determining the benefit from exchanges of currency but also notes that nce commerce gains more experience in investigating and analyzing this type of subsidy there may come a time to adopt such an approach although doc stated that it will defer to treasury s expertise with respect to currency undervaluation doc will not delegate to treasury the ultimate determination of whether currency undervaluation involves a countervailable subsidy in a given case as such the agency will normally follow treasury s evaluation and conclusion regarding undervaluation but can depart from treasury s evaluation and conclusion based on substantial evidence on the administrative record doc expressly refused to describe in detail when such a departure will occur doc s decision on each of these issues could have a substantial effect on the agency s benefit determinations and the magnitude of final duty rates based thereon specificity the final rule amends doc s regulations regarding the specificity of domestic subsides 19 c f r 351 502 to provide that n determining whether a subsidy is being provided to a group of enterprises or industries within the meaning of section 771 5a d of the the secretary normally will consider enterprises that buy or sell goods internationally to comprise such a group in defending its approach doc indicated that its determination of whether a currency subsidy is specific would occur pursuant to section 771 5a d iii of the act which addresses de facto specificity in response to public comments doc explained that under this regulation if a subsidy is limited to enterprises that buy or sell goods internationally or if enterprises that buy or sell goods internationally are the predominant users or receive disproportionately large amounts of a subsidy then that subsidy may be specific this change arguably represents an expansion of the number of sectors and subsidy recipients that would permit doc to find de facto specificity i e that it may consider to constitute a group under the specificity provisions of us cvd law section 771 5a d for example some commenters cited to previous cvd investigations of aluminum extrusions and coated paper to illustrate that treating all exporters as a group for purposes of specificity for domestic subsidies as opposed to export subsidies which are per se specific is contrary to doc s past practice a group that includes all exporters and importers would arguably be even broader while doc appears to acknowledge this shift in practice by noting that it is a fundamental principle of administrative law that an agency is allowed to change its practice provided the change is reasonable and explained the agency maintains that 1 its new approach is consistent with us law and 2 because u s law is consistent with our international obligations the new approach is also consistent with wto rules notably the final rule adopts an even broader interpretation of the term group than that which doc included in its proposed rule doc initially proposed that it would consider enterprises that primarily buy or sell goods internationally to comprise a group emphasis added but has omitted the term primarily from the final rule in response to public comments thus under the final rule doc potentially could find a subsidy resulting from currency undervaluation to be specific to the traded goods sector of an economy even where it is available to enterprises that engage in international trade to a lesser degree outlook doc s final rule will apply to all segments of cvd cases initiated on or after april 6 2020 and it is likely that us petitioners will begin to utilize the rule shortly thereafter in both new cvd investigations and administrative reviews of cvd orders now in force given the significant ambiguities in doc s final rule particularly with respect to the agency s determination of financial contribution and benefit these initial proceedings will be critical in terms of clarifying doc s practice with respect to treating currency undervaluation as a countervailable subsidy these early cases will also likely indicate the range of countries potentially subject to future currency cvd allegations under one approach for example doc could limit its inquiries to non market economy countries or those with a substantial state owned banking sector on the other hand doc s reach could be much broader for example the imf s most recent annual assessment found multiple countries to have negative reer gaps in 2018 which according to the imf implies an undervalued exchange rate as shown in the table below the treasury department has relied on these imf assessments of currency undervaluation in its recent annual reports to congress on the macroeconomic and foreign exchange policies of major trading partners of the united states country imf staff assessed reer gap 2018 argentina 12 5 china 1 5 euro area 3 0 germany 13 0 indonesia 4 0 japan 1 5 korea 4 0 malaysia 5 0 mexico 6 0 netherlands 8 6 poland 2 5 russia 6 0 singapore 8 2 sweden 10 0 switzerland 2 8 thailand 8 5 turkey 15 0 source imf external sector report july 2019 table 1 7 doc s treatment of ambiguous provisions for example on entrustment or direction or government action will likely determine whether exporters in these countries have received countervailable subsidies under the final rule finally it is highly likely that one or more of doc s initial currency undervaluation determinations as well as the final rule itself will face legal challenge before the us court of international trade or the wto s dispute settlement body for example doc s final rule expands upon or changes outright past agency practice on the treatment of currency policy under us cvd law and congress repeatedly considered and rejected legislation to amend the law so that doc could act plaintiffs might therefore argue as some public comments did that doc lacked the statutory authority to alter its approach without congressional action furthermore the final rule could permit interpretations of financial contribution benefit and de facto specificity that many legal experts have long argued are inconsistent with the scm agreement however whether and to what extent such legal challenges as well as diplomatic complaints from us trading partners emerge may depend on the countries targeted by future currency undervaluation allegations and any cvds resulting therefrom the final rule is available here see 2019 external sector report international monetary fund july 2019 at p 1 available at the external sector report provides two separate assessments of a country s reer gap one based on imf staff assessments and another based on the imf s external balance approach eba we present here the figures resulting from the imf staff assessments which are the figures cited by the us treasury department in its most recent annual report to congress on the foreign exchange practices of us trading partners see macroeconomic and foreign exchange policies of major trading partners of the united states us department of the treasury office of international affairs january 2020 at p 17 available at the figures shown above represent the midpoint of the imf s staff assessed reer gaps which are presented in ranges the treasury department similarly used the midpoint figures in its biannual report to congress

by while u s advocates and local politicians struggle to get their first public banks chartered mexico s new president has begun construction on 2 700 branches of a government owned bank to be completed in 2021 when it will be the largest bank in the country at a press conference on jan 6 he said the neoliberal model had failed private banks were not serving the poor and people outside the cities so the government had to step in andrés manuel lópez obrador known as amlo has been compared to the united kingdom s left wing opposition leader jeremy corbyn with one notable difference amlo is now in power he and his left wing coalition won by a landslide in mexico s 2018 general election overturning the institutional revolutionary party pri that had ruled the country for much of the past century called mexico s first full fledged left wing experiment amlo s election marks a dramatic change in the political direction of the country amlo wrote in his 2018 book a new hope for mexico in mexico the governing class constitutes a gang of plunderers mexico will not grow strong if our public institutions remain at the service of the wealthy elites the new president has held to his campaign promises in 2019 his first year in office he did what donald trump pledged to do drain the swamp purging the government of technocrats and institutions he considered corrupt profligate or impeding the transformation of mexico after 36 years of failed market focused neoliberal policies other accomplishments have included substantially increasing the minimum wage while cutting top government salaries and oversize pensions making small loans and grants directly to farmers guaranteeing crop prices for key agricultural crops launching programs to benefit youth the disabled and the elderly and initiating a 44 billion infrastructure plan lópez obrador s goal he says is to construct a new paradigm in economic policy that improves human welfare not just increases gross domestic product the end of the neoliberal era to deliver on that promise in july 2019 amlo converted the publicly owned federal savings bank bansefi into a bank of the poor banco del bienestar or welfare bank he said on jan 6 that the neoliberal era had eliminated all the state owned banks but one which he had gotten approval to expand with 2 700 new branches added to the existing 538 branches of the former bansefi that will bring the total in two years to 3 238 branches far outstripping any other bank in the country banco azteca currently the largest by number of branches has 1 860 digital banking will also be developed speaking to a local group in december amlo said his goal was for the bank of the poor to reach 13 000 branches more than all the private banks in the country combined at a news conference on jan 8 he explained why this new bank was needed there are more than 1 000 municipalities that don t have a bank branch we re dispersing resources but we don t have a way to do it people have to go to branches that are two three hours away if we don t bring these services close to the people we re not going to bring development to the people they re already building i ll invite you within two months three at the most to the inauguration of the first branches because they re already working they re getting the land because we have to do it quickly the president said the 10 billion pesos 530 4 million needed to build the new branches would come from government savings and that 5 million had already been transferred to the banco del bienestar which would pass the funds to the secretariat of defense whose engineers were responsible for construction the military will also be used to transport physical funds to the branches for welfare payments amlo added they are helping me they are propping me up the military has behaved very well and they don t back down at all they always tell me yes you can yes we do go to concerns that the government owned bank would draw deposits away from commercial banks and might compete in other ways such as making interest free loans to small businesses amlo countered there s no reason to be complaining about us building these branches f private banks want to build branches they have every right to go to the towns and build their branches but as they won t because they believe that it s not business we have to do it it s our social responsibility the state can t shirk its social responsibility issues with the central bank while the legislature has approved the new bank mexico s central bank can still block it if bank regulations are breached ricardo delfín who works at the international accounting firm kpmg told the newspaper la razón that if the money to fund the bank comes from a loan from the federal government rather than from capital it will adversely affect the bank s capitalization ratio but amlo contends that the bank will be self sufficient funding for construction will come from federal savings from other programs and the bank s operating expenses will be covered by small commissions paid on each transaction by customers most of whom are welfare recipients branches will be built on land owned by the government or donated and software companies have offered to advise for free about the central bank he said we re going to speak with those from the bank of méxico respecting the autonomy of the bank of méxico we have to educate them because for them this is an anachronism even sacrilege because they have other ideas but we ve arrived here after telling the people that the neoliberal economic policy was going to change there shouldn t be obstacles how is the bank of méxico going to stop us from having a branch that disperses resources in favor of the people what damage does that do whom does it harm amlo has repeatedly promised not to interfere in the business of the central bank which has been autonomous for the past quarter of a century but he has also said that he would like its mandate expanded from just preserving the value of the peso by fighting inflation to include fostering growth the concern according to the financial times is that he might use the central bank to fund government programs following in the footsteps of argentina s former president cristina fernández de kirchner whose heterodox policies led to high inflation and many economists believe the country s current crisis mark weisbrot counters in the new york times that argentina s problems were caused not by printing money to fund domestic development but by a massive foreign debt hyperinflation actually happened under fernández de kirchner s successor president mauricio macri who replaced her in 2015 the public debt grew from 53 to more than 86 of gdp inflation soared from 18 to 54 short term interest rates shot up to 75 and poverty increased from 27 to 40 in an upset election in august 2019 the outraged argentinian public re elected fernández de kirchner as vice president and her former head of the cabinet of ministers as president restoring the 12 year kirchner legacy begun by her husband nestor kirchner in 2003 and considered by weisbrot to be among the most successful presidencies in the western hemisphere more appropriate than argentina as a model for what can be achieved by a government working in partnership with its central bank is that of japan where prime minister shinzo abe has funded his stimulus programs by selling government bonds directly to the bank of japan the boj now holds nearly 50 of the government s debt yet consumer price inflation remains low so low that the boj cannot get the figure up even to its 2 target other funding options amlo is unlikely to go that route because he has vowed not to interfere with the central bank but analysts say he needs to introduce some sort of economic stimulus because mexico s gdp has slipped in the last year the mexican president has criticized gdp as the ultimate standard advocating instead for a model of development that incorporates wealth distribution and access to education health housing and culture into its measurements but as kurt hackbarth warned in jacobin in december to fully unfurl program without simply ransacking other line items to pay for it will require doing something amlo has up to now categorically ruled out raising taxes on the rich and large corporations which not surprisingly make out like utter bandits in mexico s rigged financial system amlo has continually vowed however not to raise taxes on the rich instead he has enlisted mexico s business magnates as investors in public private partnerships allowing him to avoid the tequila trap that brought down argentina and mexico itself in earlier years getting locked into debt to foreign investors and the international monetary fund mexico s business leaders seem happy to invest in the country despite some slippage in gdp as noted by carlos slim mexico s wealthiest man debt didn t go up there is no fiscal deficit and inflation came down in november 2019 the economy secretariat reported that foreign direct investment showed a 7 8 increase in the first nine months of that year compared with the same period in 2018 reaching its second highest level ever and at the end of 2019 the peso was up around 4 stocks also rose 4 5 and inflation dropped from 4 8 to 3 partnering with local businessleaders is politically expedient but public private partnerships can be expensive and as u k professor richard werner points out tapping up private investors merely recirculates existing money in the economy better would be to borrow directly from banks which create new bank money when they lend as the bank of england has confirmed this new money then circulates in the economy stimulating productivity today the best model for that approach is china which funds infrastructure by borrowing from its own state owned banks like all banks they create loans as bank credit on their books which is then repaid with the proceeds of the projects created with the loans there is no need to tap up the central bank or rich investors or the tax base government banks can create money on their books just as central banks and private banks do for mexico however using its public banks as china does would be something for the future if at all meanwhile amlo has been a trailblazer in showing how a national public banking system can be initiated quickly and efficiently the key it seems is just to have the political will along with massive support from the public the legislature local business leaders and the military this article was first posted on truthdig com

global equities are higher across the board as investor optimism grows that beijing is confident enough to allow its largest businesses to resume industrial production and on hopes that fed chair powell s testimony to congress will signal that the coronavirus impact to the global economy could warrant further stimulus from the fed it seems that beijing is losing patience with allowing the economy to fall to stall speed the worst levels in almost three decades president xi is pushing back and signaling leaders to avoid more restrictive measures the chinese death toll is now over a 1 000 and the number of confirmed cases has climbed to 42 638 but the trend in net daily changes seems to be declining the net daily change in globally confirmed cases almost reached 4 000 on february 4th and has since declined to the 2 548 as of yesterday the global stock market rally is being powered by central banks and with a lot of the january and february data being tossed out the window risk appetite may run wild for a few more weeks the pboc will remain active in delivering more easing and with the fed possibly on standby risky assets could remain attractive in the short term oil the bottom seems to be in place for oil prices it is way too early to be confident that peak of the virus will happen this month but optimism is growing that we could see beijing resume some normalcy in travel and trade outside of the hubei province it seems president xi can t stomach any further weakness to the growth outlook and we will see much of china return back to normal rather soon with no help from the opec alliance oil prices have managed to stabilize and move a way from the dangerous threshold that could have opened the door to extreme selling oil could see further upside today if powell delivers a dovish testimony that weakens the dollar the risks to the outlook are obvious and the fed could shift to ready to act mode gold with us stocks back in record setting mode and green everywhere else it is no surprise that gold prices are slightly softer today with investors focused on powell s testimony later today we could see gold s bullish momentum reassert itself as the fed chair might sound more dovish as he explains how the coronavirus in china presented a new risk to the outlook gold s longer term bullish backdrop will remain primarily supported on physical demand from central banks and rising risks to the global growth that will trigger another wave of worldwide stimulus em emerging markets have been feeling the pressure of coronavirus impact on the global

favorite trades heading into the new year was buying emerging market etfs and that streak of 16 consecutive weekly gains was snapped after almost topping 19 billion some investors may choose to hang onto the emerging market trade only if we see continued optimism that the coronavirus will peak by the end of the month with much of the emerging market central banks likely to signal more easing is on the way the dollar may remain stable this quarter if powell doesn t become dovish turkey the lira is getting hammered after the situation on the syrian border intensified following the turkish

cb governor says new programme with imf may be developed under policy framework of new govt but declines to comment whether sl is abandoning existing eff with imf imf has so far disbursed us 1 3bn out of approved us 1 5bn eff in six tranches sl has been recipient of 16 imf loans and hasn t completed six of them by nishel fernando amid concerns over fiscal slippages and uptick in fiscal deficit the central bank cb is mulling entering into a fresh programme with the international monetary fund imf under the policy framework of the new government i had long chats with the last imf team arrived in sri lanka and we will have talks with them later on and develop a programme within the kind of policy framework we agree as long as that is permitted the imf team told me that it is permitted and the country concerned has to develop the programme on that basis i think there would be a discussion for a new programme whether it will finalise or not is yet to be decided on the basis of development cb governor prof w d lakshman revealed he was speaking yesterday at the annual economic outlook forum 2020 organised by the ceylon chamber of commerce in colombo sri lanka negotiated an extended arrangement with the imf in 2016 as the country faced twin deficits amid piling up of external debt repayments the imf has so far disbursed us 1 3 billion out of the approved us 1 5 billion extend fund facility eff in six tranches the last eff programme review is to be conducted before june 2 this year sri lanka has missed the primary surplus target under the programme by a sizable margin in 2019 with a recorded deficit of 0 3 due to the weak revenue performance and expenditure overruns according to the imf the imf warned following its recent staff visit to the country that the primary deficit could widen further to 1 9 percent of gdp and the overall fiscal deficit to 7 9 percent in 2020 under the current policies in addition the current account deficit is also projected to increase to 2 9 percent of gdp this year from the estimated 2 5 percent last year given the risks to debt sustainability and large refinancing needs over the medium term renewed efforts to advance fiscal consolidation will be essential for macroeconomic stability the imf stated further sri lanka s net international reserves also fell short of the end december target under the eff supported programme in 2019 by about us 100 million amid market pressures after the presidential election and announced tax cuts however prof lakshman declined to comment whether sri lanka is abandoning the current imf programme to enter into a new programme sri lanka has been the recipient of 16 imf loans and the country hasn t completed six of these programmes as expected in this juncture with a significant policy shift away from the outgoing eff programme the press release cautiously refers to positive elements in the current policy framework while pointing out to relevant risks he said commenting on the recent press release issued by the imf upon completing their staff visit the new government has delayed sri lanka s financing plan for debt repayment until the end of parliamentary elections anticipated in april while postponing the us 500 million samurai bond issuance planned by the previous regime however the largest foreign debt repayment for the year is scheduled in october speaking at the occasion fitch rating sri lanka country head maninda wickramasinghe expressed concerns over the potential fiscal slippages while emphasising on the need to meet these revenue gaps fitch s view now is while external risks exist it has moderated but the fiscal slippages are likely to be higher which is worrying he said prof lakshman commended the neutral position taken by the imf on the new government s policy framework while stressing that the imf is not treated as an enemy in sri lanka the cautiously neutral position taken by the imf team about the new policy regime in the country wouldn t probably cause undue disturbances in the country s financial markets he added although the imf forecasted 3 7 percent economic growth upgrading the earlier 3 5 percent growth for the year prof lakshman was confident that sri lanka s economic growth would reach 4 percent this year however he acknowledged that sri lanka has serious problems impacting the economy from the fiscal and external sectors this is a country run on deficit budgets these are problems that we haven t addressed with clear cut policies it might take years to achieve results but we need to start addressing them at least now he said the imf has called the government to move ahead with growth enhancing structural reforms to fully harness sri lanka s economic potential and foster greater social inclusion there are difficult decisions that ought to be made by political authorities prof lakshman said he opined that as the imf distanced itself from the washington consensus framework the imf might support the present government to move away from the framework in that case attempt from the present government to move away from that framework might even receive active imf support that s perhaps wishful thinking he added commenting on sri lanka s current account deficit prof lakshman was optimistic that the current account deficit would continue to narrow during the year backed up by a continuous contraction in imports he expects that foreign capital flows portfolio and direct investment would during the year improve business confidence ccc urges need to balance growth with stability the ceylon chamber of commerce ccc yesterday warned that the anticipated acceleration in economic growth could come at the cost of stability while calling for implementation of key structural reforms to sustain the growth momentum as far as sri lanka is concerned it s a clear balance between growth and stability will we go back to resolving monetary and fiscal stimulus which is not backed up by reforms and adjustments in interest rates and currency ccc chief economist shiran fernando said sharing the highlights of the ccc s 2020 annual economic outlook publication the new government has granted sweeping tax cuts and has announced plans to recruit around 150 000 to the state sector within the year fernando noted that sri lanka tends to run into twin deficits leading to adjustments in interest rates and currency during election cycles as seen in 2010 and 2015 hence he emphasised the need to balance growth with stability to avoid such issues in the future despite a 25 percent yoy contraction in trade deficit during the first 11 months of 2019 fernando warned that imports could expand during this year backed by the anticipated uptick in public expenditure which could put pressure on the rupee imports are likely to very much pick up due to the consumption boost that we ve seen through measures provided by the government and that will impact trade deficit if the trade deficit expands there will be more pressure on rupee he said further he noted that growth in exports was halted while contraction in imports was also slowed down during the last couple of months of 2019 however the ccc projects better performance across key sectors in 2020 in the domestic economy the ccc expects that lower interest rates and fiscal stimulus would boost the consumer durable sector while a pick up in consumption is also expected in non essential categories of the fmcg sector however fernando said that the growth of the apparel sector would largely depend on market access and negating trade risks while the outcome on wage discussion would be crucial for outlook of the tea sector moving forward the ccc urged the government to focus on key structural reforms as well as low hanging fruits some are structural reforms and some are more low hanging fruits for an example digital id could potentially tie up loose ends such as welfare spending tax collection and healthcare similarly east container terminal could boost logistic sector fernando said

global equities are higher across the board as investor optimism grows that beijing is confident enough to allow its largest businesses to resume industrial production and on hopes that fed chair powell s testimony to congress will signal that the coronavirus impact to the global economy could warrant further stimulus from the fed it seems that beijing is losing patience with allowing the economy to fall to stall speed the worst levels in almost three decades president xi is pushing back and signaling leaders to avoid more restrictive measures the chinese death toll is now over a 1 000 and the number of confirmed cases has climbed to 42 638 but the trend in net daily changes seems to be declining the net daily change in globally confirmed cases almost reached 4 000 on february 4th and has since declined to the 2 548 as of yesterday the global stock market rally is being powered by central banks and with a lot of the january and february data being tossed out the window risk appetite may run wild for a few more weeks the pboc will remain active in delivering more easing and with the fed possibly on standby risky assets could remain attractive in the short term oil the bottom seems to be in place for oil prices it is way too early to be confident that peak of the virus will happen this month but optimism is growing that we could see beijing resume some normalcy in travel and trade outside of the hubei province it seems president xi can t stomach any further weakness to the growth outlook and we will see much of china return back to normal rather soon with no help from the opec alliance oil prices have managed to stabilize and move a way from the dangerous threshold that could have opened the door to extreme selling oil could see further upside today if powell delivers a dovish testimony that weakens the dollar the risks to the outlook are obvious and the fed could shift to ready to act mode gold with us stocks back in record setting mode and green everywhere else it is no surprise that gold prices are slightly softer today with investors focused on powell s testimony later today we could see gold s bullish momentum reassert itself as the fed chair might sound more dovish as he explains how the coronavirus in china presented a new risk to the outlook gold s longer term bullish backdrop will remain primarily supported on physical demand from central banks and rising risks to the global growth that will trigger another wave of worldwide stimulus em emerging markets have been feeling the pressure of coronavirus impact on the global outlook risk assets abroad remain vulnerable as developing world focuses on whether the coronavirus could infiltrate their homeland or provide a greater shock to a key trading partner one of the favorite trades heading into the new year was buying emerging market etfs and that streak of 16 consecutive weekly gains was snapped after almost topping 19 billion some investors may choose to hang onto the emerging market trade only if we see continued optimism that the coronavirus will peak by the end of the month with much of the emerging market central banks likely to signal more easing is on the way the dollar may remain stable this quarter if powell doesn t become dovish turkey the lira is getting hammered after the situation on the syrian border intensified following the turkish military retaliation against the russian backed syrian forces turkish and russian relations are falling to a new low and it could get worse for lira until erdogan and putin meet mexico the unwinding

bloomberg opinion under the misrule of nicolas maduro venezuela has ginned up a fake currency the petro fantasy price controls and a bootleg president of the legislative assembly now comes fake capitalism with the economy crumbling and millions fleeing the country the heir and keeper of what hugo chavez branded 21st century socialism has allowed once taboo dollars to flood the market private companies yesterday s enemies of the revolution are peddling luxuries from designer rum to imported cars the caracas club scene is on fire maduro is even flirting with privatizing the state oil company pdvsa the bolivarian crown jewel so is this a deathbed conversion to the free market or a cagey survivor s pivot to authoritarian capitalism to save socialism neither the more likely motive for venezuela s careening toward free market practices is anomie in league with expediency with a wink at felony the first part is no mystery there s no written policy shift behind these maneuvers said venezuelan economist juan nagel who teaches at the universidad de los andes in santiago chile a better explanation he said is that the government has become so hollowed out it has scant tools to keep a grip on the command economy you need a functioning paid bureaucracy to enforce price controls collect taxes and police contracts and many of these guys have already left the country said nagel the government simply isn t looking anymore advertisement so much the better for venezuela s well heeled disarray has put some businesses especially retailers back in the money whether wired home by expatriates or flown in from russia dollars are rolling in oxford economics lead economist carlos de sousa reckons that half the country s transactions are now carried out in cash from euros and dollars to brazilian reais and colombian pesos banks charge native high rollers a 1 to 2 monthly fee to store the hard currency loot in their vaults the upper middle class no longer hostage to the ennui of scarcity is living high again story continues while venezuela s less fortunate have little to celebrate the recent lapse in enforcement of price controls has eased the chronic shortages that emptied stores shelves and turned grocery runs into scavenger hunts annual inflation has slowed considerably from 2 688 844 in the year to january 2019 to 7 374 by december reports oxford economics gross domestic product is still contracting but at a much slower pace no one expects the estimated 4 6 million venezuelans who have fled the country to rush back although a few have returned on the tide of dollars however the estimated 4 billion a year the diaspora sends back home to friends and family help alleviate deprivation more importantly for maduro every expatriate greenback is one dollar less his regime must spend on venezuelan welfare not to mention a welcome source of cash through remittance taxes and fees for a regime ring fenced by u s sanctions in the bolivarian republic however not all discontents are equal keeping those with the deepest pockets in baubles and pleasure boats is a hedge against mutiny at the top most venezuelans with lots of money are regime people de sousa told me they had investments abroad before u s sanctions and now can t move their money anymore all of them are obliged to put their money in venezuela to be profitable they need to get rid of price controls maduro also has gone out of his way to indulge another powerful cohort the favored bureaucrats political operators military officials and assortment of felons whom he has regaled with patronage jobs a cut of public concessions and even authority over basic bureaucratic functions as moises naim and francisco toro recently wrote forget 21st century socialism this is a good old barony of bandits the trick of this arrangement is to relax the rules and look the other way at violators to encourage enterprise in the shadows but never transcribe those practices into policy or law we know that a lot of venezuelans have suffered and are starving but there are also a lot of people who have profited from maduro s maneuvers said monica de bolle senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics these are not reforms they re tidbits for cronies it s all a balancing act to keep his footing maduro strives to preserve the optics of revolutionary socialism even as it spins out of his control for that matter so do some of the government s most strident international foes who are invested in the conceit that venezuela is the last socialist bastion in south america hence the strange consensus uniting devoted bolivarians who admire maduro as an insurgent and leftist bulwark against imperialism with archrival donald trump to whom maduro is a socialist dictator whose grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken as he said in his state of the union speech wednesday venezuelan opposition leader and shadow president juan guaido knows better but was caught in the middle as he brought his case for democratic diplomacy to the poisonous politics of washington trump in his speech feted guaido as a rebel for democratic freedom only to abruptly cancel a scheduled oval office joint presser the next day after republican senator mitt romney voted for impeachment venezuela s opposition is also uneasy over maduro s sudden affinity for capitalism s animal spirits guaido and his backers have long called for freer markets and relaxing rules for foreign investment especially in oil exploration what they want to avoid is for maduro to make the call on reform much less capture the benefits not all of venezuela s renascent profiteers are comfortable with his off books workaround the collapse of pdvsa has already forced the government to ignore constitutional strictures on foreign capital and surrender operations to international partners such as russia s state owned oil major rosneft now those same partners want to convert the de facto rule into a written

one thing many people forget about the 2016 election is that as a candidate donald trump promised to be a different kind of republican unlike the mainstream of his party he declared he would raise taxes on the rich and wouldn t cut programs like social security medicare and medicaid that ordinary americans rely on at the same time he would invest large sums in rebuilding america s infrastructure he was lying trump s only major legislative achievement the 2017 tax cut and jobs act was absolutely standard modern republicanism huge tax cuts for corporations plus tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy the only unconventional aspect of the legislation was the variety of new tax scams it made possible like the benefits for investors in opportunity zones which were supposed to help poor communities but have actually enriched billionaire real estate developers trump also came very close to passing a health care reform that would have imposed savage cuts on medicaid eliminated protections for those with preexisting conditions and taken away health insurance from more than 30 million americans and there has of course been no infrastructure bill in fact the trump administration s repeated proclamations of infrastructure week have become a running joke policy wonks are still poring over the latest trump budget released on monday but there was no hiding the same reverse robin hoodism as in previous budgets taking from the poor and middle class while giving to the rich in other words trump in practice as opposed to trump in pretense has turned out to be every bit as committed to trickle down economics as republicans in congress have been for decades people often say that trump has captured the gop which is true as far as things like rule of law and support for democracy are concerned but it s equally true that the gop has captured trump when it comes to domestic policy the only difference between trumpism and the proposals of paul ryan in his heyday is that the trump administration having blown up the budget deficit from less than 600 billion to more than 1 trillion has pretty much given up even claiming to care about government debt back in the day ryan called debt an existential threat a few days ago vice president mike pence told cnbc that rising deficits aren t a concern as long as they help boost the economy and as i wrote last week the economic good news of recent years not as good as trump claims but the economy has indeed been strong largely reflects the reality that after hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity under barack obama republicans have embraced runaway deficit spending under trump but while trump is willing to run trillion dollar deficits to give giant tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy he s as determined as the rest of his party to make life harder for the less fortunate the grand plan to repeal obamacare fell just short but the administration is supporting a court challenge that could declare the affordable care act unconstitutional it is also supporting things like work requirements for food stamps and block grants that would de facto lead to major cuts in medicaid compared with current law but why has trump turned out to be such a conventional republican my sense is that he doesn t really care about policy aside from protectionism which i ll get to in a minute and he certainly doesn t feel any empathy for less fortunate americans or actually anyone so he was happy to make what amounts to an implicit deal with the republican establishment you get to implement your usual policy agenda and i get a free pass on my corruption and abuse of power the one place where trump has deviated from conservative orthodoxy is his trade war but why is he a self proclaimed tariff man the supposed reason was that he wanted to bring back u s manufacturing if that were really his motivation he failed amid a generally strong economy we re experiencing a manufacturing recession and estimates from the federal reserve suggest that trump s tariffs which have raised business costs have actually reduced manufacturing employment my guess however is that trump s trade policy has been motivated less by any substantive goals than by the desire to look like a tough guy and while establishment republicans headed off any important changes in nafta which would have been really bad for business trump basically took the existing agreement and stuck his name on it they have been willing to indulge his posturing on other less critical fronts the question now is whether trump will pay any price for betraying all his promises democrats took the house in 2018 largely because of the popular backlash against his attempt to destroy obamacare but there s a real danger that democrats will blow the election by making it a referendum on ambitious ideas like so called medicare for all that are unlikely to become reality rather than on trump s ongoing efforts to destroy programs americans love paul krugman paul krugman ph d winner of the nobel memorial prize in economics is an op ed columnist for the new york times
international asia s emerging market currencies are sliding as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to slow the region s economy and drives outflows into the dollar investors may consider the region s copious foreign exchange reserves to be a buffer against severe economic dislocation capital flight and currency fluctuations that would be a mistake asia s reserves have expanded vastly since the 1997 98 financial crisis to reach more than 5 trillion 40 of the global total often cited as a strength they may prove of limited value in any future crisis first reserves aren t profits in addition to net export payments they include foreign investment the asset reserve investments is offset by a liability the amount owed to foreign investors china is the world s biggest holder of reserves with 3 1 trillion as of the end of january while that looks substantial in dollar terms it considers only one side of the coin since 2009 growth in china s foreign exchange assets has tracked accumulated investment liabilities based on international monetary fund criteria used to calculate the minimum required level of reserves china needs around 3 trillion roughly what it has now the imf calculations factor in short term foreign denominated debt portfolio liabilities broad money supply and the cover necessary for trade payments similar vulnerabilities exist in indonesia india and south africa because foreign currency especially short term borrowing is high some analysts have suggested that china could use its reserves to recapitalize the banking system which is sure to be hit by the economic shutdown that authorities have imposed in an effort to slow the spread of the virus assuming a level of bad debts comparable to that of the late 1990s the losses and recapitalization requirements would absorb around half or more of china s total reserves that would leave the country s foreign exchange chest below the imf minimum in addition reserves can be volatile intervention to support a currency can reduce holdings rapidly as the recent experience of turkey and argentina shows it is difficult to estimate unexpected outflows from disinvestment unwinding of carry trades exchange traded fund redemptions or contingent payments such as collateral calls or derivative settlements for example potential claims on chinese reserves from its belt and road initiative and other international obligations are poorly understood reserve investments are also difficult to realize most are in government bonds and other high quality securities denominated in so called g3 currencies the u s dollar euro and japanese yen the size of the holdings means that governments couldn t sell them without a collapse in the price of assets such as u s treasuries and the dollar that would inflict large losses on asian investors granted many central banks have expanded the type of assets they buy china has redirected its reserves into real investments in advanced economies and strategic projects such as belt and road however these aren t liquid and are risky china faces challenges in obtaining repayment of loans to developing countries such investments are also exposed to potential interference by the host country especially during geopolitical or trade conflicts a further drawback of using reserves is that managing their currency and domestic liquidity effects is cumbersome repatriating realized reserves will force the domestic currency to appreciate decreasing the nation s international competitiveness it will also reduce the value of foreign investments when measured in a country s home currency large scale accumulation and spending of reserves affects money supply while central banks can manage this through sterilization operations conflicts between reserve management and monetary policy objectives will create economic and financial instability finally the economic model underlying the reserves creates a complex financial interdependence between asian central banks and advanced economies termed the fatal embrace by the late paul volcker former chairman of the federal reserve foreign exchange reserves represent advances allowing the importing country to buy the exporter s goods and services on credit withdrawing support would risk destroying the value of existing investments and damaging the borrowers real economy and export demand the interdependence runs deeper since 2009 the growth of developing country reserves is highly correlated to the growth of the balance sheets of advanced economy central banks which has been driven by quantitative easing attracted by higher returns than available at home investors moved capital into emerging markets which in turn supported demand and economic activity in developed economies this is evident in the increased reliance of many north american european and japanese businesses on emerging economies for growth and earnings unfortunately this cheap capital encouraged rapid rises in debt and increased the risk of future financial instability in many emerging countries the solution lies in international co operation to create a new international monetary system and for surplus countries to boost domestic demand in a world of rising political tensions trade wars and adherence to debt and export driven economic models the prospects for that may appear bleak still this is unfinished business the world will have to return to once it has got past the economic shock of the coronavirus epidemic

calgary feb 11 2020 cnw mainstreet s q1 2020 results mark the 7th consecutive quarter of year over year double digit growth in all of its key metrics extending a steady improvement in its operational performance that has continued to deliver non dilutive value to shareholders continued growth in rental revenue net operating income noi and funds from operations ffo comes despite the fact that q1 is typically a low rental season bob dhillon founder and chief executive officer of mainstreet said our achievements over the past few years are a testament to mainstreet s countercyclical growth strategy which has continued to deliver real value to our shareholders ever since we listed in tsx in 2000 he added as we enter the remainder of the fiscal year we believe that a fundamental and positive shift in the macroeconomic climate underpinned by healthy population growth in our core markets will lay the foundation for years of future wealth creation we believe that these achievements are a direct result of mainstreet s countercyclical growth strategy which our management team introduced five years ago in anticipation of an economic downturn they are also partly connected to an ongoing population surge across canada including in alberta which has driven down vacancy rates and bolstered our value added growth model over the last four years alberta has added 226 825 new residents 70 595 of which came in 2019 alone statistic canada during that same four year period rental supply in the province remained flat adding only 13 736 new units including townhomes according to cmhc data in the edmonton calgary corridor where 76 of the residents of alberta reside roughly 3 32 million people and where the majority of mainstreet s properties located the total purpose built rental universe including townhouses is just 123 134 cmhc by 2046 the portion of albertans living within that corridor is expected to rise to 80 government of alberta while we recognize that a sizeable number of these new residents are either would be homebuyers or children many others are foreign students immigrants and young people who will continue to enter and therefore expand the broader rental space we believe these supply demand figures point to a fundamental robustness in the rental market that mainstreet believes will extend well into the future supporting mainstreet s 100 organic non dilutive growth model as we enter fiscal year 2020 we plan to leverage improving market fundamentals by accelerating our countercyclical growth strategy our management team will also continue to fine tune key processes across our operations this includes anything from identifying underperforming assets for acquisition creating efficiencies in our supply chain strengthening internal training and adopting new technologies shortening cycle times for stabilization and unlocking future growth by refinancing long term cmhc insured debts at low cost as of q1 2020 12 of our portfolio was unstabilized and our liquidity position stood at 147 million looking to the coming fiscal year we believe this provides mainstreet a firm foundation to continue our record of top tier performance and delivering non dilutive value to shareholders financial highlights operations 13 growth in rental revenue 12 growth in noi and 18 growth in ffo on a same asset basic both noi and rental revenue increased 5 we achieved these results despite a high number of acquisitions that would typically drive down operating results refinancing 26 million in additional funds raised through the financing of six clear title properties at an interest rate of 2 47 in additional funds raised through the financing of six clear title properties at an interest rate of 2 47 occupancy vacancy rate reduced to 5 9 compared with 6 7 in q1 2019 acquisitions 11 3 million 134 units in new acquisitions in q1 2020 with 36 2 million 236 units in calgary and edmonton subsequent to end of quarter year to date acquisitions amounted to 47 5 million 370 units 134 units in new acquisitions in q1 2020 with 236 units in and subsequent to end of quarter year to date acquisitions amounted to 370 units mortgage 95 of mortgage portfolio locked in as cmhc insured mortgages at an average interest rate of 2 98 with an average maturity period of 6 years substantially lowering exposure to interest rate risks liquidity 147 million liquidity position to fund future growth challenges despite our achievements mainstreet faces challenges on several fronts higher municipal property taxes and other policies have continued to raise operating costs the federal carbon tax which targets property owners through higher heating costs came into force in alberta in 2020 new federal regulations under the clean fuel standard are anticipated to come into force around 2023 layering new costs onto natural gas consumption our efforts to reduce stabilization cycle times have also increased expenses for human resources materials and other operational necessities market volatility also remains a challenge prices for west texas intermediate an american crude oil benchmark hovered around us 55 per barrel in 2019 well below prices five years ago industry investment has likewise fallen as producers delay major decisions denting the economic output of oil dependent provinces like alberta and saskatchewan low oil prices have underscored deeper shortfalls in canada s regulatory and legal regime which have caused delays in major projects two multi billion dollar developments in b c the trans mountain pipeline and lng canada natural gas facility have now entered the early construction phase which we view as positive however we believe that the broader uncertainty around project approvals in canada could yet cause a further cooling in investor appetites as major investment funds look to other markets particularly the u s the federal government s pending approval of the frontier oilsands mine in northern alberta expected by the end of february will likely feed into investor sentiments management also believes negative macro economic forces could have caused short positions in respect of the trading of mainstreet common stock we believe this is partly responsible for our share price continuing to trade well below what we believe to be its true net asset value we also see risks in the recent outbreak of the coronavirus causing global travel restrictions border closures factories and businesses closures in china which could ripple out into the canadian economy in 2020 outlook even in the face of some challenges mainstreet has benefited over the last four years from a vast improvement in almost every possible macroeconomic measure we believe that employment levels population growth and gdp across canada appear to be on the upswing this trend supports our plan to accelerate our acquisition strategy in 2020 funded by low interest long term cmhc insured financing we will also continue efforts over the past two years to re stabilize units at a record pace boosting noi and cash flows we believe that it appears that positive macroeconomic trends appear poised to continue according to statistics canada canada s population could reach 48 million by 2050 under a medium growth scenario under a high growth scenario that could reach as high as 56 million the province of alberta which makes up 54 of mainstreet s portfolio could reach 6 6 million by 2046 or an increase of 2 3 million according to estimates by the provincial government we believe that positive international and inter provincial migration numbers coupled with a steady rise in foreign student enrolments could continue to bolster this trend more than 720 000 foreign students enrolled in canadian institutions in 2018 immigration refugees and citizenship canada 2019 higher than many developed nations international in migration into canada reached 437 000 statistic canada in 2019 nearly on par with the 595 000 people census bureau who entered the u s we expect that improved population and in migration levels could translate into economic growth over the long term at a projected growth rate of 1 6 in 2020 canada s economy is comparable to that of the u s 1 9 but still below the bank of canada s target inflation rate of 2 job growth remains robust unemployment levels across canada were 5 6 in december 2019 among the lowest in years in alberta unemployment in december was 7 0 roughly in line with its five year average british columbia which makes up 21 of our portfolio has continued to outperform the national average with an unemployment rate of 4 8 in december 2019 statistics canada and bank of canada mainstreet believes these positive indicators will continue to return the rental market to balance rental markets have been oversupplied following a rapid build out of condominiums during years of high economic growth which then spilled over into the broader rental space but we believe that recent data suggests absorption of that oversupply is already underway vacancy rates for purpose built rental units in metropolitan edmonton fell to 4 9 in 2019 down from 5 3 a year earlier according to cmhc data vacancies in calgary have fallen as low as 3 9 directly in line with a year earlier vancouver remained among the lowest vacancy rates in canada 1 1 while vacancies fell sharply in saskatoon down to 5 7 from 8 3 and remained unchanged in regina 7 7 we also believe that expected increases in housing prices will continue to push more young people into the rental market in our opinion mainstreet s mid market rental rate with a price point average between 900 and 1 000 are perfectly positioned to attract would be renters in today s market we believe that renters which often include millennials foreign students and new migrants tend to favour mid market prices as they defer major investments like new homes we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture renters who fall within this bracket this trend among first time buyers who usually come out of the overall rental pool are underscored by tighter borrowing requirements under the office of the superintendent of financial institutions announced in 2017 which we believe will make it more difficult for first time homebuyers to secure financing we see this trend as generally supportive of the rental market the bank of canada estimates the new rules could disqualify as much as 10 of new buyers every year runway on existing portfolio pursuing our 100 organic non dilutive growth model using our strong potential liquidity position of approximately 147 million we believe there is significant opportunity to continue acquiring new assets at low cost closing the noi gap in q1 2020 12 of the mainstreet portfolio was going through the stabilization process once stabilized we believe same asset revenue vacancy rate noi and ffo will be meaningfully improved leveraging our loss to lease we believe our vancouver lower mainland market which makes up 21 of our portfolio 2 799 units offers a significant opportunity for future same store noi growth this is partly due to a continued increase in market rates combined with rules under the provincial tenancy act that has kept some annual rent rate increases substantially below the rest of the market resulting in loss to lease of approximately 258 per unit per month currently over 91 of our tenants in the region are below the market average with an average annual turnover rate of about 25 we expect our noi will continue to improve while we reduce our loss to lease over time lowering interest costs approximately 130 million of mainstreet mortgage loans with an average interest rate of 4 1 are maturing in 2020 and 2021 the current 10 year cmhc insured mortgage rate is about 2 5 we expect interest rates to remain low and our refinancing of these maturing debts will result in a substantial reduction in future mortgages expenses buying back shares at a discount we believe meq shares continue to trade below their true nav we will therefore continue to buy back our own common shares on an opportunistic basis

a band of democrats from the senate banking committee where powell heads on wednesday has already sent him a list of questions about last autumn s upheaval in the repurchase agreement market where banks go to secure funding to meet their reserve requirements the episode when a cash squeeze drove overnight repo interest rates to 10 forced the fed back into the active bond buying business for the first time in some five years and it scooped up more than 300 billion of t bills since the fed has also become the lender of first resort in the repo market pumping tens of billions of dollars each day into money markets to ensure liquidity and avoid another squeeze policy makers believe the repo riot was triggered by having allowed bank reserve levels to fall too low in the roughly two years it had been letting the stash of bonds on its balance sheet dwindle reserves are on the upswing again but just where the sweet spot in reserve levels lies is the big unknown and powell will be pressed

one thing many people forget about the 2016 election is that as a candidate donald trump promised to be a different kind of republican unlike the mainstream of his party he declared he would raise taxes on the rich and wouldn t cut programs like social security medicare and medicaid that ordinary americans rely on at the same time he would invest large sums in rebuilding america s infrastructure he was lying trump s only major legislative achievement the 2017 tax cut and jobs act was absolutely standard modern republicanism huge tax cuts for corporations plus tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy the only unconventional aspect of the legislation was the variety of new tax scams it made possible like the benefits for investors in opportunity zones which were supposed to help poor communities but have actually enriched billionaire real estate developers trump also came very close to passing a health care reform that would have imposed savage cuts on medicaid eliminated protections for those with preexisting conditions and taken away health insurance from more than 30 million americans and there has of course been no infrastructure bill in fact the trump administration s repeated proclamations of infrastructure week have become a running joke policy wonks are still poring over the latest trump budget released on monday but there was no hiding the same reverse robin hoodism as in previous budgets taking from the poor and middle class while giving to the rich in other words trump in practice as opposed to trump in pretense has turned out to be every bit as committed to trickle down economics as republicans in congress have been for decades people often say that trump has captured the gop which is true as far as things like rule of law and support for democracy are concerned but it s equally true that the gop has captured trump when it comes to domestic policy the only difference between trumpism and the proposals of paul ryan in his heyday is that the trump administration having blown up the budget deficit from less than 600 billion to more than 1 trillion has pretty much given up even claiming to care about government debt back in the day ryan called debt an existential threat a few days ago vice president mike pence told cnbc that rising deficits aren t a concern as long as they help boost the economy and as i wrote last week the economic good news of recent years not as good as trump claims but the economy has indeed been strong largely reflects the reality that after hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity under barack obama republicans have embraced runaway deficit spending under trump but while trump is willing to run trillion dollar deficits to give giant tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy he s as determined as the rest of his party to make life harder for the less fortunate the grand plan to repeal obamacare fell just short but the administration is supporting a court challenge that could declare the affordable care act unconstitutional it is also supporting things like work requirements for food stamps and block grants that would de facto lead to major cuts in medicaid compared with current law but why has trump turned out to be such a conventional republican my sense is that he doesn t really care about policy aside from protectionism which i ll get to in a minute and he certainly doesn t feel any empathy for less fortunate americans or actually anyone so he was happy to make what amounts to an implicit deal with the republican establishment you get to implement your usual policy agenda and i get a free pass on my corruption and abuse of power the one place where trump has deviated from conservative orthodoxy is his trade war but why is he a self proclaimed tariff man the supposed reason was that he wanted to bring back u s manufacturing if that were really his motivation he failed amid a generally strong economy we re experiencing a manufacturing recession and estimates from the federal reserve suggest that trump s tariffs which have raised business costs have actually reduced manufacturing employment my guess however is that trump s trade policy has been motivated less by any substantive goals than by the desire to look like a tough guy and while establishment republicans headed off any important changes in nafta which would have been really bad for business trump basically took the existing agreement and stuck his name on it they have been willing to indulge his posturing on other less critical fronts the question now is whether trump will pay any price for betraying all his promises democrats took the house in 2018 largely because of the popular backlash against his attempt to destroy obamacare but there s a

expand kristopher radder the brattleboro reformer via ap democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg holds a town hall meeting at keene state college in keene new hampshire february 8 2020 coming off what some might argue was a win in iowa former south bend mayor pete buttigieg now finds himself the leader of the centrist democratic cohort heading into tuesday s primary in new hampshire accordingly over the weekend buttigieg hit the town hall circuit with a new economic vision that aligns with his big centrist energy asked by an attendee at a keene new hampshire town hall to give his thoughts on the deficit buttigieg articulated a willingness to embrace fiscal hawkery that s been notably absent from the democratic primary i think the time has come for my party to get a lot more comfortable talking about the deficit buttigieg answered because right now we got a president who comes from a party that used to talk a lot about fiscal responsibility with a trillion dollar deficit and no plan in sight for what to do about it this should concern progressives who are not in the habit of talking or worrying too much about the debt he then went on to claim that a ballooning deficit would in fact prevent investment in safety net and health and infrastructure and education programs intimating that deficit reduction would need to supersede the progressive policy agenda that should alarm democrats all over the political spectrum buttigieg s sudden pivot to deficit hawk politics is deeply misguided and evinces a profound misunderstanding of recent political and economic history virtually all of the party s disparate factions understand that there simply isn t a deficit problem worth obsessing over at this time and making such noises only serves to restrict progressive ambitions that buttigieg is taking his cues from the worst minds in politics when it comes to the federal budget only heightens his wrongheadedness the deficit has indeed risen dramatically under president donald trump as it did under george w bush and ronald reagan all of whom enacted tax cuts and boosted defense spending guided by dick cheney s famous proclamation that deficits don t matter but cutting the deficit has not been a focus of the 2020 democratic field which has been committed to expanding social services including education retirement and health care more from alexander sammon indeed the legitimacy of austerity politics seemed to have been driven out of the political arena with paul ryan after he quickly capitulated and championed the deficit exploding trump tax bill in fact it s hard to think of a school of political thought with less credibility and less popularity than deficit hawkery which was openly forsaken by even its most fervid apostles in the republican party once it came up against an opportunity to deposit an extra buck of would be tax revenue into the pockets of wealthy gop donors what s become clear is that fiscal responsibility is a tool only used when democrats occupy the white house to prevent popular programs from coming into being buttigieg may be new to national politics but he should know this well and though he has spent the last several months walking back his commitment to expanding social services not long ago he was a proponent of medicare for all his embrace of deficit reduction was not an entirely out of the blue provocation just to rile up flinty eyed new englanders in numerous fundraisers buttigieg has teased this same wink nod suggestion saying that his understanding of the importance of balanced budgets which are unpopular shows his daring political ambitions to defend those austerity politics that even the trump era gop has largely shied away from the buttigieg camp has elevated studies put forth by the progressive policy institute ppi a think tank of choice for new democrat and democratic leadership council types and the committee for a responsible federal budget crfb part of the peter g peterson foundation s anti deficit hydra peterson who died in 2018 spent hundreds of millions of dollars to further his mission to roll back the earned benefits of millions of americans through cutting social security and medicare ppi and crfb s policy prescriptions reflect this wish ppi has lambasted bernie sanders for his medicare for all proposal claiming it leaves a 25 trillion shortfall and praised buttigieg for being the only candidate with more deficit reducing offsets than new spending proposals for what it s worth buttigieg s health care vision would be more costly than sanders s in terms of overall national health expenditures proving further that this is an ideological mission above all crfb meanwhile has pivoted between praising trump s proposed cuts to social security and lamenting that they aren t bigger both groups have advanced a deficit scaremongering approach that has consistently failed the burden of proof we re running a real time experiment about the dangers of runaway deficits but despite the best apocalypse predicting efforts interest rates haven t soared and inflation hasn t spiraled crfb and ppi are part of the crowd who have predicted dire outcomes from deficits for a decade and they have spent a decade being incorrect there was no natural rate of unemployment no government crowding out private spending and no inflationary spiral they were completely utterly mistaken somehow these are buttigieg s go to fiscal policy shops we re running a real time experiment about the dangers of runaway deficits but despite the best apocalypse predicting efforts interest rates haven t soared and inflation hasn t spiraled perhaps the reason that deficit hawkery is unpopular is not because of a lack of political derring do as buttigieg says but because it s flat out wrong and if it s bad economics it s even worse political messaging especially in the run up to the general election against a trump administration that has already spent twice as much public money on farm bailouts as obama spent to save the auto industry obama s too soon pivot to deficit reduction stunted the recovery and may have contributed to trump s rise that any democrat would want to rerun that playbook beggars belief it marks a staggering heel turn from a candidate who just coincidentally happens to be raising a boatload of money from wall street and the billionaire class which just coincidentally happens to find deficit hawkery a perfectly persuasive line of political thinking that s to say nothing of its open intergenerational unfairness which calls for the already pauperized millennial generation to now pay for the benefits of the boomers despite being saddled with historic levels of debt and not owning any real wealth or assets it bespeaks a profound generational divide and helps explain why buttigieg has done so poorly with his own demographic no self respecting millennial would parrot this patently unfair line of argument indeed the peterson funded youth tailored deficit hawk group the can kicks back was one of the all time political failures of the 2010s could a pro austerity agenda outflank republicans in 2020 it certainly wouldn t offend mitch mcconnell who recently reiterated his long standing ardor for cutting social security medicare and medicaid even suggesting he would set aside his undying opposition to bipartisanship to do it but buttigieg isn t the only one mounting an incipient campaign to bring back hawkery on monday the trump administration released a budget proposal with massive cuts to the social safety net after blowing a multitrillion dollar hole in the deficit for his tax cuts and jobs act trump s budget includes a 920 billion medicaid cut a 756 billion medicare cut 24 billion in social security cuts alongside a 26 percent cut to the epa the elimination of hud s affordable housing program and a 181 billion cut to food stamps this they say is the tough but necessary price to pay for eliminating the deficit in 15 years so buttigieg in his advocacy for balanced budgets and all they entail is not alone after all in a general election that should attack trump for his heartlessness toward the neediest buttigieg would be in the awkward position of agreeing with the president on the need to tighten our belts indeed his newfound embrace of that very same largely discredited right wing rhetoric trump is now elevating has sounded alarm bells from progressive groups who see him as a risk of advancing the next stage of the republican agenda one built on equal parts bad faith and bad math senator mitch mcconnell says he wants to work with the next democratic president on cutting social security medicare and medicaid so that the republican party isn t blamed for the cuts mcconnell uses the deficit as a pretext for demanding cuts to earned benefits even though social security unlike the 2 trillion republican tax scam doesn t add a single penny to the deficit said linda benesch communications director of social security works a progressive political action group we need to make sure the democratic nominee is someone who would never take mcconnell s bait
washington times dc commentary president trump has nominated distinguished economist judy shelton to be a member of the federal reserve s fed seven person board of governors mrs shelton is under attack for her alleged unorthodox views elizabeth warren who advocates adding trillions of dollars in new federal spending huge tax increases and massive new regulations had the gall to call mrs shelton radical mrs shelton has committed the sin of being right when many in the washington establishment have been dead wrong in 1989 mrs shelton wrote a book the coming soviet crash gorbachev s desperate pursuit of credit in western financial markets which shook many in the foreign policy establishment at the time it was well understood that soviets were in retreat but no one before mrs shelton had examined the soviet budget numbers in a such detailed way as a result of her hard work expertise and rational intelligence she was able to predict both the path and the timing of the soviet collapse and she turned out to be spot on some of those foreign policy types who were comfortable co existing with the soviet union argued there would be a never ending stalemate or eventually even a western defeat and were in denial about the soviet decline and very critical of mrs shelton s work but she had less than a year to wait before being proved correct subsequently i had the pleasure to work with her on the u s committee to aid russian reform she was the only woman on the team and usually proved to be the most insightful many of the great economists of the last century like milton friedman and f a hayek both nobel laureates believed that government fiat currencies that is currency without the backing of a hard asset like gold would ultimately fail the failure would occur because politicians like to spend more money than the tax system produces leading to higher and higher levels of debt until the private sector refuses to buy any more of it spending other people s money is politically popular and taxing is often unpopular and even when the politicians increase taxes it does not get them out of the box because tax rate increases slow economic growth until the point where the economy is producing less tax revenue rather than more look at the record the united states and all the major nations were on the gold standard before the fed was created in 1914 the fed is mandated to provide price stability in the 120 years before the creation of the fed the united states experienced no persistent inflation according to the consumer price index the dollar is worth less than 1 25 of what it was worth in 1914 or it now takes more than 25 to buy what 1 would buy in 1913 the price of gold was 18 93 18 99 per ounce from 1833 until 1913 the price of gold on feb 7 2020 was 1 571 per ounce so much for price stability under the fed the fed has an impossible mandate as at least one former fed chairman said its job is to lean against the winds and take away the punch bowl when the economy is overheating they attempt to do this by trying to control the size of the money supply and interest rates hayek friedman and their intellectual allies and disciples including judy shelton and yours truly believe this is a fool s errand many smart people have served on the fed board but they are no smarter than many others and have no more ability to see the future which is unknowable than other learned people politicians often hate gold or other hard monetary anchors because it limits their ability to spend without restraint in 1936 john maynard keynes wrote his general theory of employment interest and money which gave what appeared to be a scientific rationale for larger levels of deficit spending and so it immediately became a hit with the political class keynesian economics was all the rage for the first four decades after keynes book but then the great inflation of the 1970s came upon us showing that hayek and friedman had been right not keynes the irony is that many in the economic political establishment still support bigger government with more taxing and spending even though that model has been a clear failure worldwide people like economist paul krugman the new york times are in this camp if nominated for a fed position mr krugman would probably have no trouble being confirmed because he is a well known establishment economist despite a long record of failed predictions including saying that the u s stock market would collapse with a trump victory and that the world would go into recession in contrast mrs shelton is accused of being unorthodox and out of the mainstream because she is closer to hayek and friedman in her views about the desirability of a monetary anchor like gold if the united states is going to have a fed it is important that the governors be diverse in their views as a way of minimizing mistakes in terms of experience education a track record of predicting policy outcomes and understanding economic reality i can think of no better person to serve on the fed board than judy shelton richard w rahn is chairman of the institute for global economic growth and improbable success productions
keynote speech by philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb at the financial markets workshop of the economic council finanzmarktklausur des wirtschaftsrats der cdu in the period between the end of the bretton woods system in the early 1970s and the global financial crisis in 2008 the main challenge for central banks was to tackle excessively high inflation and guard against its resurgence by counteracting pro inflationary shocks more recently anti inflationary shocks have dominated and addressing excessively low inflation poses new challenges in my remarks today i therefore plan to focus on the conduct of monetary policy when inflation is below target and explain why the ecb is maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance i will also discuss why it is necessary to adopt unconventional monetary policy measures when the conventional monetary policy instrument the central bank s policy rate is constrained macroeconomic risks of excessively low inflation from a macroeconomic perspective excessively low inflation poses several dangers one danger is that low inflation that persists over the longer term provides only a small buffer against deflation if inflation is low it only takes a relatively small shock to tip the economy into deflation the macroeconomic implications of deflation are well known first the expectation of falling prices delays purchases and investment second the combination of falling output prices and downwardly rigid nominal wages damages the profitability of businesses and reduces the demand for labour third deflation means that the real burden of nominal debt increases over time making debt repayments more difficult for households firms and governments however even in the absence of pronounced risks of deflation there are substantial macroeconomic costs to persistently undershooting the inflation objective first excessively low inflation can hamper beneficial macroeconomic adjustments the stickiness of wages that hampers their adjustment to the downside is deep rooted and pervasive as a result an insufficiently positive inflation rate means that a negative area wide shock is more likely to result in higher unemployment than a smooth adjustment in real wages similarly in the event of asymmetric shocks that have differential effects across member states low inflation also makes it more difficult to facilitate competitiveness adjustments in a monetary union finally a sufficiently positive inflation rate smooths the impact of newly introduced products since the relative price of a product tends to decline over its life span second since the nominal interest rate is the sum of the real rate plus inflation the combination of low real interest rates and persistent undershooting of the inflation objective reduces the policy space for conventional interest rate policy to react to future negative shocks the steady state level of the real interest rate primarily reflects the non monetary structural forces such as demographics productivity and risk preferences driving desired savings and desired investment let me give the intuition with a stylised example the nominal policy interest rate is the sum of inflation and the real interest rate for simplicity let us assume that the real interest rate is zero if inflation is stable at 2 percent then the nominal policy interest rate also stands at 2 percent this means that the policy space for the central bank to cut the nominal policy interest rate to zero is 200 basis points by the same logic if inflation is stable at 1 percent then the policy space for cuts of the nominal interest rate to zero is halved to only 100 basis points in practice the ecb has demonstrated that the effective lower bound for the policy interest rate is in fact not zero it is in negative territory even so the central bank cannot lower policy rates without limit at some point firms and households may start switching to paper currency which provides zero return a related but distinct argument is that there may also be a reversal rate of interest below which decreases in the policy rate fail to be expansionary accordingly the principle that an effective lower bound on interest rates exists is valid even if its exact value is subject to considerable uncertainty and likely varies over time this lower bound in turn makes the conduct of monetary policy more challenging when inflation is below target furthermore the decline in the steady state real interest rate presents a significant challenge for monetary policy lower real rates reduce the available policy space to counter low inflation this increases the time it takes for inflation to return to our aim this is compounded if a prolonged period of low inflation also erodes inflation expectations since a persistent fall in inflation expectations itself further reduces the available policy space through the associated downward pressure on the yield curve in this scenario the macroeconomic impact of negative shocks is more severe and long lasting it follows there is a clear risk of a self reinforcing dynamic in the inflation process prolonged low inflation risks dragging down inflation expectations which in turn further impairs the capacity of central banks to quickly restore inflation to the target it is therefore important for the central bank to be agile energetic and persistent in responding to prolonged inflation undershoots otherwise complacency and inaction bias would damage the capacity of the central bank to address future negative macroeconomic shocks putting medium term price stability at risk this vicious circle has been recognised by economists at least since keynes and others studied the interactions between deflation mass unemployment and a paralysed monetary policy in the 1930s the lessons from this period and the more recent experience of prolonged deflation in japan have encouraged the adoption of monetary policy strategies worldwide that seek to deliver sufficiently positive medium term inflation rates given the macroeconomic risks associated with excessively low inflation and deflation the contribution of non standard measures to monetary policy capacity the use of non standard measures to augment monetary policy capacity has been widespread across central banks in recent years the ecb s current configuration is based on a broad set of non standard tools that reinforce each other i the negative policy rate ii forward guidance iii the asset purchase programme app by which the eurosystem buys both sovereign and private debt securities and iv targeted long term refinancing operations tltros for banks bringing the policy interest rate to negative levels extends the scope to influence short term funding conditions and also longer maturity elements in the yield curve in fact since 2014 we have seen that rate reductions in negative territory propagate in qualitatively different ways than rate reductions implemented at positive levels a cut below zero demonstrates that the central bank is not mechanically constrained by a zero lower bound accordingly if used in combination with appropriate forward guidance a negative rate policy can provide a more effective way of controlling interest rates at maturities that are particularly influential in determining financial conditions in the euro area if a central bank cuts its policy rate to zero but excludes moving into negative territory the distribution of expectations of future interest rates becomes skewed market participants view interest rates as much more likely to increase than to decline further as a result interest rates at longer maturities tend to decline by less than the adjustment to the policy rate if future cuts are possible in the context of a negative rate policy the overall probability distribution of expected future rates broadens to the downside which puts downward pressure on longer maturity interest rates in the euro area banks tend to use risk free interest rates with maturities of one to two years as their reference for fixing loan rates accordingly the greater impact on interest rates at those maturities that the negative rate policy has gives the central bank a powerful instrument to enhance transmission to the loan market forward guidance reinforces this effect on the short to medium portion of the yield curve asset purchases withdraw long dated securities that otherwise would have to be held by private investors thus providing a stimulus by exerting downward pressure on the medium to long portion of the yield curve since the central bank pays for these securities with cash it encourages investors to rebalance their portfolios away from cash and towards other forms of longer duration investments including capital formation that boosts both demand and long term productive capacity while negative interest rates forward guidance and asset purchases operate predominantly on the term structure of interest rates in the money market and sovereign bond market tltros act specifically on bank credit conditions these operations provide a very attractive source of long term funding for banks which reduces the costs that banks incur when granting a loan to a company or to households i detailed the empirical effectiveness of these complementary measures in a recent speech overall when used in combination these instruments tend to improve the financing conditions for households and firms via lower borrowing rates which then stimulate economic activity and inflation taking the app negative rates and rate forward guidance together ten year sovereign bond yields would have been almost 1 4 percentage points higher in 2018 without those measures the ecb s experience is part of an emerging global consensus that central banks need to embrace new tools and frameworks the unconventional measures put in place since the crisis particularly if combined in a policy mix help compensate for the reduced scope for conventional rate cuts at least in part for example in his recent presidential address to the american economic association ben bernanke recently argued that the combination of asset purchases and forward guidance can add about 3 percentage points of policy space for the united states assuming a neutral nominal rate in the range of 2 to 3 percent the monetary policy stance and the banking system the evidence shows that the accommodative monetary stance has been effective in encouraging banks to provide more credit and firms to boost investment in terms of the effectiveness of the monetary stance a countervailing factor is that the negative policy rate can mechanically weigh on the net interest income of the banking system since banks typically do not pass on negative rates to most retail depositors in principle the adverse mechanical effect on profitability that is implied by a narrowing of the gap between the lending rate and the deposit rates applied to retail customers could contribute to a re assessment of lending policies with banks opting to contract rather than expand lending as i mentioned earlier the level at which the interest rate is so low that it would be counterproductive for bank credit creation has become known as the reversal rate we are clearly not at that point in the euro area as is evident in the ongoing pass through of easing measures to lower lending rates and continued credit growth it is also important to recognise the overall impact of the monetary policy stance on bank profitability in relation to funding costs the banking system has benefited from the decline in wholesale rates lower yields in the issuance of bank bonds and tltro funding in addition the support provided by our monetary stance boosts the level of economic activity generating higher lending volumes and lower default rates both of which support bank profitability moreover banks have been able to register capital gains on their asset holdings nonetheless the governing council closely monitors the risk that the impact of negative rates on bank profitability may impair the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy in order to reinforce the bank based transmission of monetary policy the governing council decided in september last year to exempt part of the bank holdings of excess liquidity with the eurosystem from the negative deposit rate the interest rate on such holdings is now tiered excess liquidity holdings up to six times the minimum reserve holding are not charged the negative deposit facility rate of 0 5 percent the annual gross savings for banks from the two tier system are estimated to amount to up to 4 billion in 2020 compared with the counterfactual projection if the system had not been introduced these savings more than offset the additional gross excess liquidity charge of around 1 billion that resulted from the september cut of the deposit facility rate by 10 basis points concluding remarks let me conclude confronted by marked adverse developments in inflation dynamics the ecb s governing council embarked on a fundamental pivot in its policy in 2014 by adopting the package of unconventional monetary policy measures that i have discussed the first stage of the ecb s pivot towards unconventional monetary policy measures was successful in restoring enough inflationary pressures to bring inflation back into sustainably positive territory currently we are in in a second stage in which the accommodative monetary stance is still required in order to support the robust convergence of inflation to our aim over the medium term underlying our monetary policy stance is the determination to avoid the macroeconomic risks of inflation stagnating at the current level in recognition of the associated fundamental threat to medium term price stability

was 8 higher than last year in constant currency terms and includes approximately 20 million or 3 of synergy benefits related to the bemis acquisition the remaining 5 organic growth reflects strong

from delivery of synergies and overall operating cost performance in north america volumes grew in the high value protein liquids and healthcare segments and operating cost performance was strong delivery of synergy benefits gained momentum throughout the first half and long term commitments have been secured with a number of large customers during the period reflecting the strength of amcor s enhanced value proposition in latin america volumes were lower reflecting challenging economic conditions across the region and the impact of volumes lost within the legacy bemis business prior to the

greenfield plant earnings were favorably impacted by the delivery of synergy benefits and strong operating cost performance net sales generated from specialty folding carton products were lower than the prior period due to weaker volumes in europe and in particular in eastern europe where there was an increase in the prevalence of illicit trade as well as customer destocking this was partly

adjusted ebit of 130 million was lower against a particularly strong comparative period which was highlighted in our first quarter results we anticipate a return to profit growth for the rigid packaging segment in the second half of fiscal 2020 in north america earnings were lower in the current period as overall mix was unfavorable in both beverage and specialty containers which also led to higher costs this compares to the prior period which benefited from exceptionally strong mix beverage volumes were 0 2 lower than last year with hot fill container volumes up 4 despite a strong comparative period driven by market growth and share gains as a range of customers launch new products in the pet format in latin america volumes were 2 higher compared with the first half of last

washington times dc commentary five decades of economics have taught me trouble comes when you least expect it and the federal reserve treasury and their brethren abroad are often clueless about what to do government officials business leaders and academics privileged to attend davos or the fed s annual conclave at jackson hole are convinced that president trump s trade wars and boris johnson s brexit campaign created great uncertainty hammered down investment and were root causes of slow growth now the phase one deal with china and mr johnson s masterful ascent along with corporate tax cuts and deregulation have the administration expecting good times for the president s reelection campaign the international monetary fund imf has raised its global growth forecasts to 3 3 percent for 2020 from 2 9 percent last year all this optimism ignores increasingly tough structural challenges and creeping decadence in the thinking of policymakers and the economics profession even before the coronavirus china s growth was slowing under the weight of too much debt from wasteful state directed investment and real estate development now the epidemic has made plain the economic costs of diverting government funds to the military and efforts to pirate western technology from badly needed public investments like hospitals the eu s largest economies are in a permanent funk manufacturing is one quarter of germany s prosperity and terribly dependent on gas powered automobiles italy is in perpetual political dysfunction and both have chronically troubled banks no one can govern france boeing s 737 max production shutdown will knock half a point off first quarter u s growth experience with sars and china s enlarged role in global supply chains indicates a 3 percentage point reduction in its gdp from the coronavirus could reduce u s growth by 0 3 points the u s economy could expand as little as 1 percent in the first quarter given that some sectors like health care grow no matter what that implies others could dip into recession read autos and restaurants an aging global population is saving a larger share of gdp and money looking for yield is moving into real estate in global cities like new york london and vancouver creating the danger for another bubble then bust those additional savings are a significant drag on demand for goods and services in all the major economies and that requires much bigger government deficits to make up the difference than are in the cards the bottom line is we are one more big shock away from a global recession phase two discussions on china s predatory industrial policies won t yield much and that will confront mr trump with a choice between reelection popularity and new tough measures after the election all bets on restraint go off until december trade across the english channel continues as before brexit but the eu is demanding that the u k follow brussels standards on environmental and social regulations subsidies and taxes for a permanent free trade deal that defeats london s purposes in leaving and prospects for a hard break will increasingly come into focus as the year progresses beijing could decide protecting its population from diseases is more important than a bigger navy and industrial espionage and spend a lot more on hospitals schools and other urgently needed social investments but don t bet on it the european central bank remains delusional after six years of negative interest rates with few good results christine lagarde a lawyer promises more of the same the fed is searching for new tools perhaps one debate is about whether to set ceilings for longer term treasury rates instead of a target for how many of bonds it purchases as the fed must buy bonds to hit its target that is operationally the same as the impeachment process demonstrated lawyers are good at circular reasoning and these days a lawyer also runs the fed former fed chairman ben bernanke and economists who advise current chairman jerome powell believe a publicly stated commitment to keep interest rates below a ceiling until the economy hits specific goals could deliver the equivalent of a 3 percent interest rate cut in a recession the fed must find a stimulus tool that powerful because it does not want to cut the federal funds rate now about 1 6 percent below zero folly heaped on folly does anyone really believe the fed would raise rates in a crisis either major governments including the stubborn germans spend a lot more or the western economies are stuck between lethargic growth and recession for the indefinite future peter morici is an economist and business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist
testimony douglas holtz eakin united states house of representatives committee on ways and means chairman neal ranking member brady and members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to discuss the corporation income tax and in particular the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja on the taxation of u s businesses i would like to make three points the jumping off point for the tcja was a bipartisan agreement that the u s corporation income tax needed fundamental reforms the tcja while imperfect addressed many of the most important elements that harmed the tax competitiveness of u s headquartered multinationals and it improved the growth incentives overall and while there are limited data available this soon after the passage of the tcja there has been a u turn on the loss of corporate headquarters a dramatic shift in repatriated funds and promising shifts in top line economic growth business investment and wage growth let me discuss these in turn the corporation income tax and reform international competitiveness and headquarter decisions prior to the enactment of the tcja the u s corporate tax code remained largely unchanged for decades with the last major rate reduction passed by congress in 1986 during the interim competitor nations made significant changes to their business tax systems by reducing tax rates and moving away from the taxation of worldwide income relative to other major economies the united states went from being roughly on par with major trading partners to imposing the highest statutory tax rate on corporation income while less stark than the united states high statutory rate the united states also imposed large effective rates according to a study by pricewaterhousecoopers companies headquartered in the united states faced an average effective tax rate of 27 7 percent compared to a rate of 19 5 percent for their foreign headquartered counterparts by country u s headquartered companies faced a higher worldwide effective tax rate than their counterparts headquartered in 53 of the 58 foreign countries the united states failed another competitiveness test in the design of its international tax system the u s corporation income tax applied to the worldwide earnings of u s headquartered firms u s companies paid u s income taxes on income earned both domestically and abroad although the united states allowed a foreign tax credit up to the u s tax liability for taxes paid to foreign governments active income earned in foreign countries was generally only subject to u s income tax once it was repatriated giving an incentive for companies to reinvest earnings anywhere but in the united states this system distorted the international behavior of u s firms and essentially trapped offshore foreign earnings that might otherwise be repatriated back to the united states while the united states maintained an international tax system that disadvantaged u s firms competing abroad many u s trading partners shifted toward territorial systems that exempt either entirely or to a large degree foreign source income of the 34 economies in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd for example 29 have adopted systems with some form of exemption or deduction for dividend income one manifestation of the competitive disadvantage faced by u s corporations was decisions on the location of headquarters the issue of so called inversions remained at the forefront of tax policy and politics originally tax inversions involved a single company flipping the roles of u s headquarters and foreign subsidiary i e inverting tax changes in the early 2000s largely ended this practice next whenever a u s firm sought to acquire or merge with a foreign firm the tax advantages of being subjected to a lower rate and a territorial base made it inevitable that the combined firm would be headquartered outside the united states in these cases inversions took place in the context of these otherwise strategic and valued business opportunities most recently foreign firms have recognized that freeing u s companies of their tax disadvantage allows foreign acquirers to use the same capital technologies and workers more effectively inversions were occurring because foreign firms were acquiring u s firms a macroeconomic analysis of former house ways and means chairman dave camp s tax reform proposal is instructive on the incentives inherent in the old tax code for capital flight john diamond and george zodrow examined how reform similar to that proposed by former chairman camp would affect capital flows compared to pre tcja law in the long run the authors estimated that a reform that lowered corporate rates and moved to an internationally competitive divided exemption system would increase u s holdings of firm specific capital by 23 5 percent while the net change in domestic ordinary capital would be a 5 percent increase it is important to note that these are relative measurements they were relative to current law at the time if the spate of announcements of inversions in the years leading up to the enactment of the tcja is any indication the old tax code was inducing capital flight accordingly the 23 5 percent and 5 percent increases in firm specific and ordinary stock respectively may be interpreted in part as the effect of precluding future tax inversions placing a value on this potential equity flight is uncertain but based on these estimates roughly 15 percent or 876 billion of u s based capital was estimated to be at risk of moving overseas under the old code finally it is an important reminder that everyone bears the burden of the corporate tax corporations are not walled off from the broader economy and neither are the taxes imposed on corporate income taxes on corporations fall on stockholders employees and consumers alike the incidence of the corporate tax continues to be debated but it is clear that the burden on labor must be acknowledged a survey compiled by the president s council of economic advisers aptly summarizes the economics literature and finds that while differing greatly empirical estimates have been trending upwards over time reflecting the dynamism of global capital flows that characterize the modern economy one study by economists at the american enterprise institute for example concluded that for every 1 percent increase in corporate tax rates wages decrease by 1 percent taxation of pass thru entities in 2016 over 150 million individual tax returns were filed covering over 10 2 trillion in income these returns also include millions of businesses that do not file as c corporations as of 2012 there were 31 1 million non farm businesses filing tax returns 23 6 million sole proprietors 4 2 million s corporations and 3 4 million partnerships including limited liability companies these entities represent more than one half of business income for this reason any reform of business taxation cannot be focused on the corporation income tax alone the need for reform was widely recognized the house ways and means committee had undertaken comprehensive reform efforts spanning several years the obama administration proposed corporate reforms and the senate finance committee had bipartisan working groups intended to address these problems important economic elements of the tcja the tcja addressed some of the most glaring flaws in the business tax code it lowered the corporation income tax rate to a more globally competitive level enhanced incentives to investment in equipment addressed some of the disparate tax treatment between debt and equity and refashioned the nation s international tax regime primarily for these reasons the tcja will enhance incentives for business investment in the united states at 21 percent the federal corporate tax rate makes investments in the united states more competitive for both u s and foreign headquartered companies operating in a global economy as noted above prior to the tcja the u s statutory and effective tax rates were among the highest in the developed world in contrast in 2020 the combined u s federal and state statutory corporate tax rate is just under 3 percentage points higher than the average of the other 35 oecd countries it is important however to recall that after the 1986 reforms the united states had the lowest tax rate only to be overtaken by other countries already we have seen foreign countries lower their corporate tax rates to re establish a competitive advantage since congress passed the tcja expensing the immediate deduction of 100 percent of the cost of investment in qualifying equipment is an important provision that should be made permanent and extended more broadly expensing lowers the cost of capital and provides strong incentives for business investment it is also the route to a more neutral tax code if all physical investment were to be expensed the tax code would treat equally investments in human capital training intellectual capital and physical capital there is no good reason to have the tax code tilt the playing field when choosing how best to raise productivity in a firm finally the tcja moved the united states toward a territorial system of taxation and refashioned the international tax rules the combination of a territorial system and competitive tax rate has ended the lock out effect of the previous tax code and eliminated the impetus for loss of headquarters the foreign derived intangible income fdii provision levels the playing field for u s businesses that invest domestically rather than abroad when the products and services are sold to foreign customers the overall effect is a dramatic change in the net incentives to invest in the united states revenue outlook tcja reduced corporate income tax receipts receipts in fiscal 2019 were 230 billion down from 344 billion in 2015 this drop was to be expected the congressional budget office cbo however projects receipts to steadily rise over the next decade and reach 406 billion in 2030 at the same time corporate receipts will rise as a share of total receipts reaching a peak of 8 5 percent well above the 6 1 percent in 2018 as part of the debate over the appropriate level of corporate taxation it has become an unfortunate tradition in the corporate taxation debate to analyze the securities and exchange commission sec filings of public u s firms and pretend to do their taxes the result is typical an outcry against u s firms that are not deemed to have paid their fair share the problem is that this exercise is detached from tax reality the most important point to understand about any of these types of analyses is that financial reports such as forms 10k and 10q are not tax returns any analysis purporting to compute the taxable income of a u s firm is necessarily speculative why does it matter that financial reports are not the same as tax returns financial reports adhere to generally accepted accounting principles gaap as set forth by the financial accounting standards board gaap or book income departs substantially from tax returns firms financial statements are reported on an accrual basis where tax returns are based on firm cash flows moreover firms have some degree of flexibility in determining their own fiscal years the internal revenue service has a rather more rigid schedule for tax payments these distinctions are principally about timing accrual accounting is based on present values which includes a time value financial reports may not cover the same period of time as a tax return this difference can animate substantial differences in firms tax obligations between those reported in financial statements and those filed with the sec one of the largest differences in financial reporting and tax returns is in the treatment of investment under gaap accounting firms can only deduct or expense a portion of a given capital investment unlike labor costs which are fully deductible except for some limitations on executive compensation but under federal tax law firms could deduct a greater share of their capital investments for tax purposes than was allowable under gaap accounting the tax incentive for investment has been a deliberate tax policy choice over many administrations and congresses indeed prior to the tcja s temporary full expensing provision investment was fully deductible under the obama administration in 2011 all else equal for a firm making an investment this means that reported profit will be higher under gaap accounting than for tax purposes some critics exploit this distinction suggesting firms that expense investment are engaging in tax avoidance where they are simply following the law this distinction also reflects a logical flaw in some of the critiques of the tcja it is contradictory to bemoan the pace of investment under the tcja and then begrudge the investment that gives rise to the utilization of investment tax incentives timing underpins another critical distinction between gaap derived tax estimates and real tax filings the tax code allows companies to smooth out income by allowing losses to be carried forward or backward for a number of years this provision makes practical sense for several reasons but lends itself to exploitation by critics a firm may be profitable in a given year but only after years of losses after the great recession this was common for many firms a snapshot of the company in its single year of profitability is a necessarily distorted view but one that some tax critics tend to highlight implementation it is important to recognize that passage of the tcja is not equivalent to implementation global companies affected by the international provisions in the base erosion and anti abuse tax beat global intangible lightly tax income gilti and the foreign derived intangible income fdii had to await final rulemaking by the department of the treasury post tcja performance recall that one of the most significant reforms in the tcja was the movement from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system in the former u s firms were taxed on profits regardless of where on the globe they were earned with the caveat that the final tax was not imposed until the money was brought back repatriated to the united states as a result many firms had elected to leave earnings overseas and the pile of unrepatriated cash was growing rapidly under the new system only those profits earned in the united states the territory will be subject to the regular corporate income tax taken at face value the switch from worldwide to territorial would permit those overseas stockpiles to escape tax entirely to remedy this potential pitfall the tcja contained a one time transition tax 15 5 percent for cash in liquid assets 8 percent on other assets on legacy overseas earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated that tax would be payable over the next 8 years this provision provides a quick test of the tcja s efficacy since firms owe the tax no matter what they should only repatriate the legacy earnings if the united states has a become a better environment in which to invest hence the interest in money being brought into the united states as shown in the chart below there has been a surge of repatriated funds into the united states in the aftermath of the tcja and repatriations remain above their pre reform norms based on data through the third quarter of 2019 u s companies are on pace to bring back 1 1 trillion of foreign earnings in the first two years after tax reform is a trillion dollars of repatriation large and does it indicate success for the tcja a recent wall street journal story seemingly would suggest not u s companies have moved cautiously in repatriating profits stockpiled overseas in response to last year s tax law rewrite after the trump administration s assertions that trillions of dollars would come home quickly and supercharge the domestic economy unfortunately this assessment is driven by a statement we expect to have in excess of 4 trillion brought back very shortly by president trump in august 4 trillion might reflect enthusiasm and aspiration but it is well north of any other estimate of the potential repatriation sum indeed most estimates clustered in the 1 to 1 5 trillion range which is roughly the current pace and this volume is well above historical norms the volume of repatriated earnings in the first half of 2018 alone is more than in all of 2015 2016 and 2017 combined so the impact of the tcja is fairly clear the success regarding inversions is even more striking after years of having five to six prominent companies annually depart the united states inversions have simply stopped multinationals are bringing operations back to the united states and many acquisitions of u s businesses now are made by u s firms rather than foreign buyers of course the bottom line is whether the plan has produced better growth certainly the top line rate of economic growth has improved growth ramped up in the immediate aftermath of the tcja while it still remains above the 2016 level the growth rate tailed off in 2019 this slowdown coincides with slower business investment below and especially the arrival of a full blown trade war as a point of comparison year over year growth in real gross domestic product gdp in the g20 averaged 0 9 percent over this same period with the most rapid growth being 1 1 percent growth in business investment nonresidential fixed investment adjusted for inflation reached a year over year peak of 6 9 percent in 2018 despite the headwinds in 2019 cumulative business investment in 2018 and 2019 was 5 7 trillion adjusting for inflation total business investment hit record highs in both 2018 and 2019 the growth in business investment since 2017 has greatly exceeded cbo s june 2017 forecast its last projection prior to tcja in 2018 business investment grew by 6 4 percent compared to cbo s 2017 forecast of 3 6 percent growth the level of business investment in 2019 was 8 6 percent higher than in 2017 compared to cbo s 2017 forecast of 5 9 percent on balance the investment performance in the united states has improved as time passes particularly with the prospect of reduced trade uncertainty it will become more possible to identify the component of growth due to the permanent reforms in the tcja conclusion prior to the enactment of the tcja the u s tax code hadn t been overhauled in over 30 years the tax code was widely viewed as broken a conspicuous drag on the economy that chased u s firms overseas while suppressing investment here at home major elements of the tcja particularly the lower corporate tax rate expensing of qualified equipment and the broad architecture of the international reforms should improve the investment climate in the united states how much of the recent improvement in economic performance can be attributed to the tcja as a matter of economic science it is certainly too soon to say but there are good reasons to credit the new law notes the views expressed here are my own and not those of the american action forum i have benefitted enormously from numerous discussions with my colleague gordon gray this section relies heavily on my testimony

by frank islam ians february 11 in her marathon 2 hours and 46 minutes speech introducing india s 2020 budget finance minister nirmala sitharaman painted an optimistic picture of the indian economy she stated at the outset that her budget s goal is to boost incomes and enhance purchasing power of the people of india only through higher growth can we achieve that and have our youth gainfully and meaningfully employed sitharaman added the finance minister s assessment that higher growth and employment are prerequisites for higher individual incomes and greater purchasing power is spot on her optimism is also understandable being the stewardess of a 3 trillion economy one expects her to have confidence in the policies she s proposing however the budget sitharaman presented on february 1 was the most comprehensive blueprint submitted by the government of prime minister narendra modi to date to revive the economy examining it contextually it falls short in a number of areas for some time india has been one of the brightest spots of the global economy currently however india is in the middle of a major slowdown the growth rate in the last fiscal quarter was the lowest in 11 years last month the international monetary fund downgraded its global growth forecast putting the blame squarely on india saying that its woes are dragging the world economy down at the moment india is experiencing its worst employment crisis in 45 years several sectors including financial real estate and automobile manufacturing are among the worst affected growth in private consumption in the sixth largest global consumer market has also been a concern for a while given all of this there were expectations that the budget would advance new major policy initiatives and significant reform measures to kick start the economy and change the current narrative this was especially the case because due to the huge mandate prime minister modi received last may the government had plenty of political capital if it wanted to spend some however sitharaman s 13 000 word budget speech contained no real bold or big ticket items instead what was put forward was a classic case of nibbling around the edges not surprisingly one of the first groups to express disappointment with the budget was india s investor community whose negative reaction was reflected in the sensex losing more than 1 000 points on the budget day the losses were erased in subsequent days three major drivers of economic growth are foreign direct investment fdi public and private consumption and exports there wasn t any serious effort on the part of sitharaman s budget to boost any one of these the finance minister indicated that she is betting on growing inflows of net fdi an all time high accumulation of foreign exchange reserves which stood at 457 5 billion in december and improvement in world bank s ease of doing business which now stands at 63 the budget did offer some sops to foreign portfolio investors such as tax exemptions to sovereign wealth funds that invest in infrastructure and other critical areas but it is not nearly enough while india remains one of the largest recipients of fdi foreign investments in sectors such as infrastructure are very modest a primary reason that foreign investors are reluctant to pump in top dollars in infrastructure development is india s cumbersome land acquisition laws as long as there is no change in the status quo in that area fdi in the sector will continue to lag export is another area where the right policies could make india one of the international leaders right now india stands behind even small nations such as hong kong and singapore in this area for that to change india s manufacturing capabilities will have to be upgraded substantially the budget did not outline clear plans to revive troubled sectors such as real estate financial and automobile manufacturing which have been adversely affecting the economy for india to turn the corner these sectors have to perform better and do so fast their enhanced performance would help stimulate public and private sector consumption another factor compounding india s economic problems is that one of the unintended consequences of a recent corporate tax cut was diminished tax revenue sitharaman s decision to levy tax on the indian income of non resident indians nri appears to be an attempt to address this by expanding the tax base however judging from the reactions from overseas that move does not appear to have gone well with the nri community which is traditionally a big backer of the ruling bharatiya janata party as a result it is likely to discourage nris from investing in india it should be noted that the budget did have some positives one of which was a proposal to invest rs 1 7 trillion to enhance india s transport infrastructure that will pay for upgrading key highways electrifying 27 000 km of railway tracks and building 100 new airports last year during her first visit to the united states as finance finister sitharaman said that prime minister modi s vision of making india a 5 trillion economy in the next five years was achievable but her first full budget as finance minister does not provide a sufficient platform for beginning to achieve that vision over the past year some of the adjectives used by the international media and pundits in the us and europe to describe the indian economy were words such as sagging stuttering and floundering this commentary continues into this new year within hours of the budget presentation the economist in its analysis opined it does too little to shore up the flailing economy and failing banks based upon the foregoing it must be concluded that with this budget the finance minister missed an opportunity to change the narrative about the economy and to initiate actions that will make an immediate and positive difference in it that s the bad news the good news is that a budget is what it is a plan for the next 12 months governments can and do make course corrections routinely during a year this budget needs course corrections sooner rather later the right ones addressing the items outlined in this piece and others will set the indian economy in the proper direction and benefit the indian people the modi administration and the world economy frank f islam is an entrepreneur civic and thought leader based in washington dc the views expressed here are personal

established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property impairment losses real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization gains and losses from property dispositions other than temporary impairments of unconsolidated real estate entities and impairment on our investment in real estate it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs we also believe that as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other reits ffo may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited other equity reits may not calculate or interpret ffo in accordance with the nareit definition as we do and accordingly our ffo may not be comparable to such other reits ffo ffo should not be used as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs including our ability to pay dividends ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance a reconciliation of net income the nearest gaap equivalent to ffo is set forth below core funds from operations core ffo we calculate core ffo by adjusting ffo to exclude the impact of certain items that we do not consider reflective of our core revenue or expense streams these adjustments consist of acquisition expenses management believes that core ffo is a useful supplemental measure as it provides a more meaningful and consistent comparison of operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the company s operating results because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations the utility of core ffo as a measure of our performance is limited other reits may not calculate core ffo in a consistent manner accordingly our core ffo may not

global equities are higher across the board as investor optimism grows that beijing is confident enough to allow its largest businesses to resume industrial production and on hopes that fed chair powell s testimony to congress will signal that the coronavirus impact to the global economy could warrant further stimulus from the fed it seems that beijing is losing patience with allowing the economy to fall to stall speed the worst levels in almost three decades president xi is pushing back and signaling leaders to avoid more restrictive measures the chinese death toll is now over a 1 000 and the number of confirmed cases has climbed to 42 638 but the trend in net daily changes seems to be declining the net daily change in globally confirmed cases almost reached 4 000 on february 4th and has since declined to the 2 548 as of yesterday the global stock market rally is being powered by central banks and with a lot of the january and february data being tossed out the window risk appetite may run wild for a few more weeks the pboc will remain active in delivering more easing and with the fed possibly on standby risky assets could remain attractive in the short term oil the bottom seems to be in place for oil prices it is way too early to be confident that peak of the virus will happen this month but optimism is growing that we could see beijing resume some normalcy in travel and trade outside of the hubei province it seems president xi can t stomach any further weakness to the growth outlook and we will see much of china return back to normal rather soon with no help from the opec alliance oil prices have managed to stabilize and move a way from the dangerous threshold that could have opened the door to extreme selling oil could see further upside today if powell delivers a dovish testimony that weakens the dollar the risks to the outlook are obvious and the fed could shift to ready to act mode gold with us stocks back in record setting mode and green everywhere else it is no surprise that gold prices are slightly softer today with investors focused on powell s testimony later today we could see gold s bullish momentum reassert itself as the fed chair might sound more dovish as he explains how the coronavirus in china presented a new risk to the outlook gold s longer term bullish backdrop will remain primarily supported on physical demand from central banks and rising risks to the global growth that will trigger another wave of worldwide stimulus em emerging markets have been feeling the pressure of coronavirus impact on the global

favorite trades heading into the new year was buying emerging market etfs and that streak of 16 consecutive weekly gains was snapped after almost topping 19 billion some investors may choose to hang onto the emerging market trade only if we see continued optimism that the coronavirus will peak by the end of the month with much of the emerging market central banks likely to signal more easing is on the way the dollar may remain stable this quarter if powell doesn t become dovish turkey the lira is getting hammered after the situation on the syrian border intensified following the turkish

adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure the company presents adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of its performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that the company s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items the company defines adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange e mutual fund income the company believes adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing the company s ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the company s operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation the company s management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis for more information please see the table

adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure the company presents adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of its performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that the company s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items the company defines adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange e mutual fund income the company believes adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing the company s ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the company s operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation the company s management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis for more information please see the table

quarter the business completed a detailed supply chain plan which will deliver our domestic customers all of their sugar needs despite having harvested half of our expected volume in taber said john holliday president and chief executive officer of rogers and lantic inc having gone through the exercise we are confident in our ability to produce the expected sales volume while minimizing the financial impact from a smaller crop and having some contingency plans for unexpected events for the maple products segment we have achieved meaningful gains in plant efficiencies and with the addition of some planned overtime we were able to increase production levels the footprint optimization project when completed in the second quarter will provide further improvement and support our

continued on the maple segment footprint optimization project during the quarter with the installation and commissioning of the new bottling line at the new granby location the project is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter and to generate significant long term benefits through improved efficiency and lower operating costs in addition production backlog was reduced through improved productivity and temporarily increasing headcount and overtime at the degelis and granby locations which increased operating costs in the current period free cash flow 1 for the trailing twelve months ending december 28 2019 was 11 4 million lower than the previous year mainly explained by a decrease in adjusted ebitda 1 an increase in capital and intangible spending net of

export 2 942 total variation 6 volume as at december 28 2019 188 379 industrial market segment volume decreased mostly due to non recurring sales to a competitor that occurred in the first quarter last year and due to timing in certain large industrial accounts total consumer volume increased for the current fiscal year due mainly to the additional volume negotiated with a national retail account for which additional shipments started in april of fiscal 2019 first quarter liquid market volume increased over the comparable quarter last year due mainly to additional volume from new and existing customers that were gained during fiscal 2019 finally as expected first quarter export volume decreased for the current quarter when compared to last year due to negotiated delays in shipments to mexico as we initiated our plans to manage the impact of the reduced factory output in taber resulting from the weather related loss in sugar beet production the reduction of mexico deliveries was slightly offset by an increase in deliveries of the canada specific quota to the united states due to timing revenues increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus the comparable period last year due to higher weighted average raw sugar values in canadian dollars which is passed on to all domestic customers in thousands of dollars except per metric tonne information first

adjusted gross margin for the current quarter was 1 5 million higher or 8 21 per metric tonne higher than the comparable quarter in fiscal 2019 mainly explained by lower energy costs as no carbon tax was incurred in taber during the current quarter compared to 1 51 per gj paid last year the benefit from the additional consumer volume was offset by additional maintenance costs in montreal associated with timing of work and higher operating costs in taber an early frost damaged the sugar beet crop which resulted in lower quality beets having to be processed administration and selling expenses were 0 2 million higher for the current quarter versus last year mainly due to additional employee benefits expenses distribution costs for the current fiscal year were 0 3 million higher

adjusted gross margins of 1 9 million adjusted to remove depreciation somewhat offset by higher administration and selling expenses of 0 2 million excluding depreciation and amortization expense as

new standard comparative information has not been restated and therefore may not be comparable adjusted gross margin for the current quarter was 2 0 million lower than the comparable period representing a decrease of 3 6 in adjusted gross margin percentage this was not unexpected as it in large part stems from a reduction in gross margin percentage for certain customers since the second half of fiscal 2019 as a result of competitive pressures in addition the maple products segment incurred additional labour costs of 0 3 million in the current quarter due to additional personnel and overtime in order to temporarily increase production capacity until the completion of the operational footprint optimization which is expected by the end of the second quarter of the current year finally depreciation expense increased by 0 3 million mainly due to additional property plant and equipment acquired as well as the start of the long term lease of the new granby location which started on october 15 2019 administration and selling expenses were 0 2 million higher than the first quarter last year due mainly to an increase in employee benefits associated with additional

discussed in note 3 b of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as is permitted with this new standard comparative information has not been restated and therefore may not be comparable adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by 1 7 million due to lower adjusted gross margins and an increase in administration and selling expenses as explained above the adoption of the new ifrs 16 leases standard did not have a material effect on the current quarter outlook sugar market conditions remain positive for our sugar business and despite challenges in our manufacturing and supply chain plans as a result of the smaller crop in taber we continue to expect that the sugar segment will exceed last fiscal year s adjusted ebitda as a result of severe adverse weather in late 2019 the beet harvest at taber was terminated early leading to lower than expected refined sugar volumes of approximately 65 000 metric tonnes compared to previous expectations of 125 000 metric tonnes as a result of the lower production volumes from taber the company has optimized its supply chain to continue to service its customers these changes mainly include the supply of cane sugar from the vancouver and montréal refineries as both refineries have excess capacity to supply to the company s domestic market the company will continue to mitigate the financial implication of a smaller sugar beet crop in taber given the smaller crop in taber export volume is expected to be approximately 15 000 metric tonnes lower than fiscal 2019 the company has a long term relationship with its customer in mexico and as a result we were able to reduce its shipments in fiscal 2020 and roll commitments into fiscal 2022 at no additional costs to the company shipments to the usa under the canada specific u s quota of 10 300 metric tonnes have been fully considered in our reconfigured supply chain and will be fully delivered in fiscal 2020 at this point in time the company does not anticipate any additional volume under the canada united states mexico agreement cusma for the current fiscal year despite the fact that it is anticipated to be ratified within the new few weeks the company anticipates that the consumer segment should be approximately 10 000 metric tonnes higher than fiscal 2019 last fiscal year the company gained additional business with an existing consumer account which started in april 2019 and as such will improve consumer volume in fiscal 2020 the taber factory delivers a significant portion of its volume to liquid customers which is still expected to occur in fiscal 2020 therefore the company s liquid segment is expected to be comparable to fiscal 2019 finally the industrial volume is expected to also be comparable to fiscal 2019 despite the challenges expected as a result of a small crop in taber the company anticipates that the overall sales volume in fiscal 2020 should be approximately 735 000 metric tonnes thus approximately 6 000 metric tonnes lower than fiscal 2019 energy costs and carbon tax savings of approximately 2 5 million are expected in the first half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the temporary removal of the carbon tax in alberta as well as the shorter slicing campaign in light of the smaller crop in taber it is expected that total distribution costs will increase in fiscal 2020 as we reconfigure our supply chains with the completion of the air emission project capital spend for the sugar segment is expected to return to a level of approximately 20 0 million including a high proportion of return on investment capital expenditures maple products the current quarter margins reflect the more competitive market conditions we are in today and as such we don t anticipate any short term change in gross margins in addition to defending our current market share the company will continue to invest in the business to lower operating cost and build new sales volume through the pursuit of new markets and value added products manufacturing throughput increased during the quarter with a combination of improved line efficiency in degelis and planned overtime the transition to the new manufacturing network is expected by the end of the second quarter which is expected to reduce operating costs and increase the overall network capacity as well as allow for growth the company expects to spend approximately 8 0 million for its footprint optimization slightly higher than anticipated of which approximately 4 7 million will be spent in fiscal 2020 to complete the granby

hedges derivative financial instruments pertaining to sugar futures and foreign exchange forward contracts are marked to market at each reporting date and are charged to the consolidated statement of earnings the unrealized gains losses related to natural gas futures and interest rate swaps are accounted for in other comprehensive income the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is removed and included in net earnings under the same line item in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income as the hedged item in the same period that the hedged cash flows affect net earnings reducing earnings volatility related to the movements of the valuation of these derivatives hedging instruments management believes that the company s financial results are more meaningful to management investors analysts and any other interested parties when financial results are adjusted by the gains losses from financial derivative instruments these adjusted financial results provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business this measurement is a non gaap measurement see non gaap measures section management uses the non gaap

variations see non gaap measures section cumulative timing differences as a result of mark to market gains or losses are recognized by the company only when sugar is sold to a customer the gains or losses on sugar and related foreign exchange paper transactions are largely offset by corresponding gains or losses from the physical transactions namely sale and purchase contracts with customers and suppliers see non gaap measures section on october 2 2016 the company adopted ifrs 9 2014 financial instruments and designated natural gas futures as an effective cash flow hedging instrument the transitional balances representing the mark to market value recorded as of october 1 2016 are subsequently removed from other comprehensive income when the natural gas futures will be liquidated in other words when the natural gas is used as a result in fiscal 2020 the company removed a nominal gain from other comprehensive income and recorded a gain of the same amount in cost of sales for the first quarter the transitional balance relating to natural gas futures will be fully depleted in the current fiscal year see non gaap measures section the above described adjustments are added or deducted to the mark to market results to arrive at the total adjustment to cost of sales for the first quarter of the current year the total cost of sales adjustment is a gain of 2 5 million to be deducted from the consolidated results versus a loss of 2 5 million to be added to the consolidated results for the comparable quarter last year see non gaap measures section segmented information the

market segment is mostly due to non recurring sales to a competitor that occurred in the first quarter last year and due to timing in certain large industrial accounts total consumer volume increased for the current fiscal year due mainly to the additional volume negotiated with a national retail account for which additional shipments started in april of fiscal 2019 the volume for the liquid market for the current quarter was higher than the comparable quarter last year due mainly to additional volume from new and existing customers that were gained during fiscal 2019 finally as expected export volume decreased for the current quarter when compared to last year due to negotiated delays in shipments to mexico as we initiated our plans to manage the impact of the reduced factory output in taber resulting from the weather related loss in sugar beet production the reduction of mexico deliveries was slightly offset by an increase in deliveries of the canada specific quota to the united states due to timing the increase in revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus the comparable period last year is mainly explained by an increase in the weighted average raw sugar values in canadian dollars which is passed on to all domestic customers gross margin two major factors impact gross margins the selling margin of the products and operating costs in thousands of dollars except

adjusted gross margin results adjusted gross margin for the current quarter was 1 5 million higher or 8 21 per metric tonne higher than the comparable quarter in fiscal 2019 mainly explained by lower energy costs as no carbon tax was incurred in taber during the current quarter compared to 1 51 per gj paid last year the benefit from the additional consumer volume was offset by additional maintenance costs in montreal associated with timing of work and higher operating costs in taber an early frost damaged the sugar beet crop which resulted in lower quality beets having to be processed

adjusted gross margin percentage this was not unexpected as it in large part stems from a reduction in gross margin percentage for certain customers since the second half of fiscal 2019 as a result of competitive pressures in addition the maple products segment incurred additional labour costs of 0 3 million in the current quarter due to additional personnel and overtime in order to temporarily increase production capacity until the completion of the operational footprint optimization which is expected by the end of the second quarter of the current year finally depreciation expense

3 3 million for the first quarter when compared to the same period last year the improvement in revenues is explained by higher revenues in the sugar segment slightly offset by lower revenues in the maple product segments as explained above gross margin gross margin of 39 0 million for the quarter does not reflect the economic margin of the company as it includes a gain of 2 5 million for the current quarter for the mark to market of derivative financial instruments see adjusted results section in fiscal 2019 a mark to market loss of 2 5 million was recorded for the first quarter resulting in gross margin of 34 5 million for the period excluding the mark to market of derivative financial instruments adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of the current year decreased by 0 5 million the adjusted gross margin for the maple products segment resulted in a reduction of 2 0 million due mainly to competitive pressures and temporarily higher operating costs as explained above the decrease from the maple products segment was partially offset by an improvement in adjusted gross margin for the sugar segment of 1 5 million due mainly to lower energy costs associated with lower carbon tax in taber as explained above results from operating activities ebit ebit is defined as earnings before interest and taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 ebit amounted to 26 8 million an increase of 3 8 million as mentioned above the gross margin comparison does not reflect the economic results from operating activities which were positively impacted by 5 0 million for the current quarter due to the period over period variation in mark to market of derivative financial instruments excluding the mark to market of derivative financial instruments adjusted ebit for the current quarter stood at 24 2 million versus 25 4 million a decrease of 1 2 million this is mainly explained by a lower contribution from the maple products segment somewhat offset by better results from the sugar segment as a result of a variation in adjusted gross margin as well as higher administration and selling expenses for both segments as explained above net finance costs net finance costs consisted of interest paid under the revolving credit facility as well as interest expense on the convertible unsecured subordinated debentures and other interest it also includes a mark to market gain on the interest swap agreements the net finance costs breakdown is as follows in thousands of dollars first quarter fiscal 2020 2019 interest expense on convertible unsecured subordinated

obligations 177 amortization of transition balances and net change in fair value of interest rate swap agreements 66 98 net finance costs 4 881 4 642 net finance costs for the current quarter were 0 2 million higher than the same quarter last year which is mainly explained by the impact from the adoption of ifrs 16 leases the other interest expense pertains mainly to interest payable to the ppaq on syrup purchases in accordance with the ppaq payment terms as mentioned above on october 2 2016 the company adopted ifrs 9 2014 financial instruments and designated interest rate swap agreements as effective cash flow hedging instruments the transitional balances representing the mark to market value recorded as of october 1 2016 are subsequently removed from other comprehensive income when each of the fixed interest rate tranches is liquidated in other words when the fixed interest rate is paid as a result the company removed a gain of 0 1 million from other comprehensive income and recorded a gain of the same amount in net finance costs for both the current quarter and the comparable quarter last year see adjusted results section taxation the income tax expense is as follows in thousands of dollars fiscal year 2020 2019 current 5 430 6 260 deferred 476 1 331 income tax expense 5 906 4 929 the variation in current and deferred tax expense period over period is consistent with the variation in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2020 deferred income taxes reflect temporary differences which result primarily from the difference between depreciation claimed for tax purposes and depreciation amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes employee future benefits and derivative financial instruments deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates anticipated to apply to income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be realized or reversed the effect of a change in income tax rates on future income taxes is recognized in income in the period in which the change occurs net earnings net earnings were 2 6 million higher than the comparable quarter last year the increase is mostly explained by the after tax impact of the period over period variation of the gains and losses on the mark to market of derivative financial instruments somewhat offset by the negative variation of a

period results include the impacts from the adoption of the new ifrs 16 leases as discussed in note 3 b of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as is permitted with this new standard comparative information has not been restated and therefore may not be comparable historically the first quarter october to december of the fiscal year is the best quarter of the sugar segment for adjusted gross margins and adjusted net earnings due to the favourable sales mix associated with an increased proportion of consumer sales during that period of the year at the same time the second quarter january to march historically has the lowest volume as well as an unfavourable customer mix resulting in lower revenues adjusted gross margins and adjusted net earnings there is minimal seasonality in the maple products segment liquidity cash flow generated by lantic is paid to rogers by way of dividends and return of capital on the common shares and by the payment of interest on the subordinated notes of lantic held by rogers after taking a reasonable reserve for capital expenditures debt reimbursement and working capital the cash received by rogers is used to pay

been restated and therefore may not be comparable cash flow from operating activities increased by 13 1 million which is mainly explained by a positive non cash working capital variation of 8 3 million lower interest and income taxes paid of 3 5 million and 2 6 million respectively somewhat offset by a decrease in adjusted ebit of 1 2 million and an increase in pension plan contribution of 0 3 million the negative variation in cash flow used in financing activities of 14 6 million is mainly attributable to the reduction of 12 5 million in borrowings from the revolving credit facilities net of the variation in bank overdraft versus the comparable period last year in addition the increase in repurchases under the normal course issuer bid ncib of 1 1 million also had a negative impact on cash flow from financing activities finally the adoption of ifrs 16 leases resulted in an increase of 1 0 million in cash outflow used in financing activities as a result of payments made for leases obligation the cash outflow used in investing activities increased compared to fiscal 2019 by 1 1 million due mainly to greater capital spending during the current quarter when compared to the same period last year in order to provide additional information the company believes it is appropriate to measure free cash flow that is generated by the operations of the company free cash flow is a non gaap measure and is defined as cash flow from operations excluding changes in non cash working capital mark to market and derivative timing adjustments and financial instruments non cash amounts and including funds received or paid from the issue or purchase of shares capital expenditures net of operational excellence capital expenditures and the payment of capital leases free cash flow is as

therefore may not be comparable free cash flow for the trailing twelve months end december 28 2019 amounted to 34 9 million representing a decrease of 11 4 million for the comparative period last year the reduction is free cash flow is mainly explained by a decrease in adjusted ebitda 1 of 11 2 million an increase in capital and intangible spending net of operational excellence capital of 2 4 million higher payments for capital leases of 1 0 million associated with the adoption of ifrs 16 leases and higher income taxes paid of 1 9 million somewhat offsetting this negative variance is a reduction in interest paid and shares purchased and cancelled under the ncib of 2 9 million and 2 3 million respectively as well as lower pension plan contribution of 0 4 million capital and intangible assets expenditures net of operational excellence expenditures increased by 2 4 million compared to last year s rolling twelve months due to timing in spending free cash flow is not reduced by operational excellence capital expenditures as these projects are not necessary for the operation of the plants but are undertaken because of the substantial operational savings that are realized once the projects are completed financing charges are paid when a new debt financing is completed and such charges are deferred and amortized over the term of that debt the cash used in the year to pay for such fees is therefore not available and as a result is deducted from free cash flow payments made for capital leases are deducted from free cash flow as such cash flow is no longer reflected as a reduction in cash flow from operation and is therefore not available the company declared a quarterly dividend of 9 0 cents per common share every quarter totalling 36 cents for both trailing twelve months periods the slight decrease in 2020 versus the comparable period is due to the purchase and cancellation of shares under the ncib which reduced the dividend paid changes in non cash operating working capital represent year over year movements in current assets such as accounts receivable and inventories and current liabilities such as accounts payables movements in these accounts are due mainly to timing in the collection of receivables receipts of raw sugar and payment of liabilities increases or decreases in such accounts are due to timing issues and therefore do not constitute free cash flow such increases or decreases are financed from available cash or from the company s available credit facility of 265 0 million increases or decreases in bank indebtedness are also due to timing issues from the above and therefore do not constitute available free cash flow the combined impact of the mark to market and derivative timing adjustments amortization of transitional balances and financial instruments non cash positive amount of 7 4 million for the current rolling twelve months does not represent cash items as these contracts will be settled when the physical transactions occur which is the reason for the adjustment to free cash flow contractual obligations there are no significant changes in the contractual obligations table disclosed in the management s discussion and analysis of the september 28 2019 annual report as at december 28 2019 lantic had commitments to purchase a total of 1 057 000 metric tonnes of raw sugar of which 297 625 metric tonnes had been priced for a total dollar commitment of 121 6 million capital resources the company has a total of 265 0 million of available working capital from which it can borrow at prime rate libor rate or under bankers acceptances plus 20 to 250 basis points based on achieving certain financial ratios as at december 28 2019 a total of 423 2 million of assets have been pledged as security for the revolving credit facility compared to 393 1 million as at december 29 2018 including trade receivables inventories and property plant and equipment at december 28 2019 188 0 million had been drawn from the working capital facility and 2 6 million in cash was also available cash requirements for working capital and other capital expenditures are expected to be paid from available cash resources and funds generated from operations management believes that the unused credit under the revolving facility is adequate to meet any future cash requirements outstanding securities a total of 104 701 023 shares and 104 029 669 shares were outstanding as at december 28 2019 and february 11 2020 respectively 105 008 070 as at december 29 2018 during the period a total of 75

lanticrogers com outlook sugar market conditions remain positive for our sugar business and despite challenges in our manufacturing and supply chain plans as a result of the smaller crop in taber we continue to expect that the sugar segment will exceed last fiscal year s adjusted ebitda as a result of severe adverse weather in late 2019 the beet harvest at taber was terminated early leading to lower than expected refined sugar volumes of approximately 65 000 metric tonnes compared to previous expectations of 125 000 metric tonnes as a result of the lower production volumes from taber the company has optimized its supply chain to continue to service its customers these changes mainly include the supply of cane sugar from the vancouver and montréal refineries as both refineries have excess capacity to supply to the company s domestic market the company will continue to mitigate the financial implication of a smaller sugar beet crop in taber given the smaller crop in taber export volume is expected to be approximately 15 000 metric tonnes lower than fiscal 2019 the company has a long term relationship with its customer in mexico and as a result we were able to reduce its shipments in fiscal 2020 and roll commitments into fiscal 2022 at no additional costs to the company shipments to the usa under the canada specific u s quota of 10 300 metric tonnes have been fully considered in our reconfigured supply chain and will be fully delivered in fiscal 2020 at this point in time the company does not anticipate any additional volume under the canada united states mexico agreement cusma for the current fiscal year despite the fact that it is anticipated to be ratified within the new few weeks the company anticipates that the consumer segment should be approximately 10 000 metric tonnes higher than fiscal 2019 last fiscal year the company gained additional business with an existing consumer account which started in april 2019 and as such will improve consumer volume in fiscal 2020 the taber factory delivers a significant portion of its volume to liquid customers which is still expected to occur in fiscal 2020 therefore the company s liquid segment is expected to be comparable to fiscal 2019 finally the industrial volume is expected to also be comparable to fiscal 2019 despite the challenges expected as a result of a small crop in taber the company anticipates that the overall sales volume in fiscal 2020 should be approximately 735 000 metric tonnes thus approximately 6 000 metric tonnes lower than fiscal 2019 in 2019 the alberta legislature announced that bill 1 an act to repeal the carbon tax became effective as of june 1 2019 on october 30 2019 in response to the federal government legal challenge the alberta government proposed a new carbon tax on large emitters called the technology innovation and emissions reduction tier system that would tax large emitting facilities as of january 1 2020 under normal operating conditions these changes will result in a reduction in carbon tax on the taber operation energy costs and carbon tax savings of approximately 2 5 million are expected in the first half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the temporary removal of the carbon tax in alberta as well as the shorter slicing campaign in light of the smaller crop in taber it is expected that total distribution costs will increase in fiscal 2020 as we reconfigure our supply chains with the completion of the air emission project capital spend for the sugar segment is expected to return to a level of approximately 20 0 million including a high proportion of return on investment capital expenditures maple products the current quarter margins reflect the more competitive market conditions we are in today and as such we don t anticipate any short term change in gross margins in addition to defending our current market share the company will continue to invest in the business to lower operating cost and build new sales volume through the pursuit of new markets and value added products manufacturing throughput increased during the quarter with a combination of improved line efficiency in degelis and planned overtime the transition to the new manufacturing network is expected by the end of the second quarter which should reduce operating costs and increase the overall network capacity as well as allow for growth the company expects to spend approximately 8 0 million for its footprint optimization slightly higher than anticipated of which approximately 4 7 million will be spent in fiscal 2020 to complete the granby relocation see

are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and the company assumes no obligation to update these forward looking statements use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure the company presents adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of its performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that the company s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items the company defines adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange e mutual fund income the company believes adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing the company s ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the company s operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation the company s management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis for more information please see the table

to our results and outlook for 2020 we had a strong performance in 2019 we met earnings per share and free cash flow growth target we set for the year we are committed to achieving our 2020 financial guidance and in fact we are raising our earnings per share target range by 0 50 joe will provide the financial details on both the quarter and our 2020 guidance now let me pull up for a few minutes to share our high level views on clinical and on policy we are in an exciting time for kidney care we are bridging the transition of care from the nephrologist s office to different types of care we are working with our payers to use predictive analytics to identify ckd patients with the highest risk of transitioned to esrd once we support these patients we will work on avoiding or delaying the onset of kidney failure we remain excited about nephrology care lines the new physician led entity with nearly 1 100 nephrologists that will be the vehicle to connect davita to the nephrologists practice the goal is simple provide world class analytics and education to help physicians best deploy their time to care for the right person at the right time for those patients who do transition to esrd with both a leading education platform to empower patients to choose to start on the right treatment modality or for them for patients who chose home modality we continue to invest in our leading home platform where we serve the most home patients of any provider in 2019 we saw our high our highest growth ever in pd modality we are working to maintain our leadership in the home dialysis with a 2020 goal of achieving double digit growth in the pd modality moving on to policy we continue our multi year journey towards integrated care we are encouraged by the quality improvement that are evident in our demonstration such as the esco we are hopeful that there will be additional models and opportunities to scale integrated care for esrd patients at national levels we remain optimistic about the administration s view for value based care models we believe that the capabilities that weâ ve built will support our collective goal to improve clinical outcomes while managing total cost there has been a lot of recent conversation about medicare advantage and the 21st century cures act we would remind everyone that congress pass this legislation with the intent of making additional insurance options available to medicare eligible patient esrd patient with respect to expectations of adoption no one really know what choices will be made by the patient we continue to believe that the selection into ma will be more gradual we look forward to working with plan partners to manage the care and the cost of these patient in parallel our advocacy efforts are focused on ensuring adequate funding in both medicare fee for service and ma and as weâ ve said before we remain ready and eager to advance integrated care for medicare fee for service population shifting to state policy we will keep advocating for our patients in california and other states where some labor unions are pursuing policies that are not good for patients costs or the care delivery system now let me transfer it on to joe so he will provide additional details on the quarter and specific on 2020 guidance joel ackerman thanks javier before i begin i would like to point out that weâ ve adjusted the first section of the press release this quarter we hope this format will give investors easier access to some of the most important results that have historically appeared later in the release now i will start with q4 results and then move to 2020 guidance we generated 2 9 billion of revenue in the quarter an increase of 2 75 over q4 2018 our operating income was 463 million which included approximately 67 million in profit related to calcimimetics resulting in an operating margin of 16 earnings per share from continuing operations was 1 86 now let me take through some of the underlying drivers starting with the components of the u s dialysis and lab segment non acquired growth for the quarter was 2 1 relatively flat with the prior two quarters revenue per treatment was down sequentially by 1 10 which includes a 1 68 per treatment decrease in revenue attributable to calcimimetics excluding calcimimetics rpt was up by 0 58 to recap performance for the full year 2019 versus guidance to exclude the impact of calcimimetics we finished at the high end of our rpt guidance range of 0 to 1 we sell outside of the very narrow range that we provided on commercial mix and ended 2019 with a year over year decrease of approximately 20 basis points although this decline did not have a meaningful impact on our revenue per treatment combined patient care costs and dialysis and lab segment g a expense was down approximately 2 per treatment quarter over quarter driven primarily by lower compensation and benefits costs turning to calcimimetics we generated operating income of approximately 67 million in the fourth quarter and revenue per treatment and cost per treatment of 12 86 and 4 19 respectively for the full year we generated approximately 220 million in operating income as we negotiated significant cost decreases on oral calcimimetics for 2020 we now expect approximately 40 million to 70 million of operating income from calcimimetics with approximately half of this to be realized in the first quarter as we expect asp reimbursement to decline in subsequent quarters with that said there are still significant uncertainty around this outlook given the complexity in the asp methodology now turning to international for the quarter operating income was approximately 2 million including an fx loss of 4 million for the full year we generated positive adjusted operating income of 2 million excluding goodwill impairments and including an fx loss of 2 million our effective tax rate on adjusted income attributable to davita from continuing operations for the quarter was 25 2 and was 27 5 for the full year our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from a decrease in our estimated state tax rate now on to cash flow the full year 2019 operating cash flow from continuing operations with 2 billion and our free cash flow was 1 1 billion both operating cash flow and free cash flow were positively impacted by significant improvements in our dsos and unusually low cash taxes in 2019 these two factors combined to improve cash flow during the year by approximately 300 million we do not expect these to recur in 2020 capex for the year was 728 million slightly below the revised guidance range of 740 million to 780 million and well below our initial guidance from the year of 800 million to 840 million the better results in q4 was due to the timing of certain project that were pushed into 2020 since october 1 2019 we purchased almost 8 7 million shares at an average amount of 64 80 per share as a result of our recent repurchases we reduced our share count by approximately 41 3 million shares or 24 8 since the close of the dmg transaction in june 2019 this week we expect to complete our repricing of our 2 7 billion term loan b that will reduce the interest rate on this tranche of debt by 50 basis points we now expect our debt expense to be approximately 90 million in q1 2020 and then approximately 85 million per quarter in the subsequent quarters i will conclude with some comments on our guidance ranges for 2020 we re updating our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance by 0 50 per share to 5 75 to 6 25 as a reminder this includes the expected benefits from calcimimetics as well as the expected cost of ballot initiative in california due to the timing of calcimimetics that i mentioned and the expected timing of ballot related costs in the second half of the year we expect some fluctuations in earnings per share between quarters this year our revenue guidance for the year is 11 5 billion to 11 7 billion and our operating income margin guidance is consistent with the target range of 13 to 14 that we talked about at our capital markets day we expect to generate approximately 600 million to 800 million of free cash flow this year i will point out that cash flow is inherently subject to greater swing than its operating income due to the time of working capital and other items such as the timing of payroll cycle tax payments and inter period changes in the collections of ar this worked in our favor in 2019 and could swing the other way at some point in the future operator let s now open the line for questions question and answer session operator thank you and our first question will come from justin lake with wolfe research your line is now open justin lake thanks good afternoon i wanted to go through a couple of moving parts here first in terms of the higher eps range year over year is it fair to think about it as two thirds coming from calcimimetics benefit that wasnâ t in numbers before maybe the rest coming from lower debt costs or maybe you could tell us any kind of moving part other moving parts including california kind of delaying implementation of the legislation out there on the acas joel ackerman sure so justin youâ ve got the basics right calcimimetics is the biggest component of this and a decrease in the in our expected cost for ab 290 plays into this as well those are the two big things i d call out there are a lot of other moving pieces in here our share count moves around as the stock price goes up and a whole bunch of other things related to core oi but i would say calcimimetics in the ab 290 are the two big things to call out justin lake great maybe you can just give us an update on is there any change in terms of the sustainability of calcimimetics in your mind beyond 2020 or do you still expect that to migrate down to kind of neutral and then do you have a new ab 290 number for us i think the old one was 25 to 40 joel ackerman sure so on calcimimetics we still expect under the current tdapa that it will migrate down to zero over the course of 2020 we have been we as you can see we ve not been able to predict how asp would come down the positive numbers for 2020 is the result of asp not coming down the way we expected it would three months ago i don t know that our visibility on how the rest of the industry has behaved combined with some of the black box natures of asp have improved but we do think this has to get down pretty close to zero by the end of the year in terms of ab 290 we don t have a new number clearly the number will be smaller that said there will be some legal costs associated with ab 290 and there certainly is the possibility that it gets implemented towards the end of the year so the numbers are getting to a size where i don t think it s worth calling out a specific number but clearly below the 25 to 40 justin lake okay just one last follow up before i jump back in the queue the calcimimetics is it fair to say here that you think costs have come down to a kind of normal range and we just need to track the asp and so it falls to that 4 number kind of joel ackerman yes iâ m not saying cost couldnâ t continue to drift down a little bit but the real action for 2020 is on the trajectory of asp justin lake thatâ s helpful thanks guys operator the next question will come from kevin fischbeck with bank of america your line is now open kevin fischbeck great wanted to ask a little bit about this year s guidance kind of in the context of your 2022 guidance because it looks like youâ re kind of there in a lot of your metrics i guess at the midpoint for 2 revenue growth per year so i guess just wanted to understand that jumping point off is that still the right point or are there things in here that now maybe there is a different way to think about the long term trajectory and i guess trying to think about this year s guidance versus the 22 number i guess the 22 number is going to have a headwind of calcimimetics coming out and then i guess your guidance still assumes that ab90 goes into place just wanted to make sure that that s one thing we have to figure out if we are trying to joel ackerman yes so you re spot on both those factors of calcimimetics coming out of here and ab 290 going into place in terms of some of the other things i ve call out on the cash flow number 2019 was surprisingly high and we called out in the script two of the factors which are the dsos having come down as well as cash taxes i d also note cash flow was helped by calcimimetics as well and the impact that had on oi so that happened faster than expected we also benefited to some extent in the year by some of the capex we re expecting late in the year getting pushed into 2020 so the 2020 number might get impacted by that to the negative there is certainly the possibility that at the end of 2020 we will see some push into 2021 and that could flip either way the one other thing i d call out is the margins we spoke about margins of 13 to 14 we are not changing that view of the world and so as you think about what the margins could be in 2022 i d stick with that number kevin fischbeck okay that s helpful and then i appreciate the preliminary comments on ma but i guess it sounds like some of the managed care companies are starting to worry this is going to be an issue for them in into 2021 so i was wondering if you could talk about your conversations that youâ re having with your ma companies is there pushback on rates or anything that you would kind of highlight there that could impact the or change the impact it s going to have on you over the next few years javier rodriguez thanks kevin this is javier we ve gotten a fair amount of questions on ma and so i think it s useful to just pull up a little and revisit the origin of it number one this is the only patient population the esrd population that was excluded from having the right to pick ma and so it was fixing a deficiency in the system number two what is our role going forward and our role is to just make sure that our patients are well informed so they can make the best decision individually point number three is everybody is trying to size it and when you try size something like this there s two variables of course one is rate and the other one is volume and so what weâ ve said is that our rate is above medicare but substantially below commercial we are not going to give anymore on that variable the one thatâ s most sort of undecided at this juncture is the pickup of the volume and all of you know the same as we do which is there s a lot of variables at play when individual has the primary insurance the secondary insurance do they have medigap coverage etcetera so we continue to think that itâ s reasonable to think that penetration will reflect the overall market in addition many people believe that our patients will have sort of a quick trigger to pick an insurance when there s so many complicated variables and they have many of them been in medicare for quite some time status quo might just keep going so we re literally asking how will our patients interpret their benefit and so we don t know and so many people are continuing to size that it s going to be some kind of an aggressive movement and we continue to think that it ll be more gradual kevin fischbeck i guess that s definitely helpful i guess two thoughts on that is there anything that you would think of as you think about that rate differential that you currently get that makes you think that whatever reason it wouldn t be sustainable i guess obviously by any standard measure you just want to bring that delta down over time but is there any reason why you think that could be the case or but maybe you could keep those economics that maybe change the way that you actually contract with managed care take more risk things like that joel ackerman yes i would think it as an opportunity for us to expand the way we talk to our contract and to our payer providers it s an exciting time where we re all aligned in trying to make sure that we have integrated care for our patients and so we re leaning in and trying to see how we can best serve them and be a partner and if they think that the ma volume is going to be higher than us that might also be an opportunity to contract in that way so we re excited obviously they want lower rates we would like higher rates and that dance is never going to change and then the question is can we all get creative when coming up on a win win situation kevin fischbeck okay and then i guess to your point about the shift into ma point well taken that inertia tends to be the way people tend to act when it comes to health insurance because it s kind of daunting to shift for that but i would assume that the fact that youâ re able to meet with these people three times a what the options are would potentially change that dynamic and where we do our analysis in the 20 states where medsup isn t available for people under 65 in an affordable way then i would think that adoption will be quite large the question ends up being so that where in those states where it is available is there a rationale for those patients to switch from a medsup plan into an ma plan and then similarly in a for a dual eligible populations which is 40 of your medicare book is there an incentive for those patients to move and why would either of those classes see the benefit of an ma plan javier rodriguez yes the first premise that you discussed which is access to the patient is worth exploring because you might be more talented than us that when you talk to people about their insurance it s not usually like netflix or anything they don t want to keep watching the next episode people usually start to glaze over a bit and say when you talk about deductibles when you talk about coinsurance when you talk about those kind of thing it is not normal vernacular for most of these folks and theyâ ve been on medicare for some time and it works for them and so then you got to start to explain that maybe it s more restrictive maybe they can t see their doctor but it s got other benefits and you get into it and then you can see that some people just tune out and so the question is is it our obligation to go back at them and the answer i think is no because youâ re satisfied with the insurance we just have to make sure that you have a new option and so on all these on the dual sometimes that could actually have very little out of pocket and so you might not want to switch that situation so it is very specific to each individual but again the net of it is that we think we are not going to look very different than the overall population but there is the range that we re all playing with kevin fischbeck and just last question is there a time period when you feel like you will know how that shift is going will you know during the open enrollment period in q4 or do you actually have to wait till january for the patient claims actually start coming in under the new payers javier rodriguez well i think weâ re going to have to wait till january we will have some preliminary stuff but unlikely that we re going to want to predict how that ll play until we see it since it s the first time we re experiencing it kevin fischbeck right great thank you javier rodriguez thank you kevin operator the next question will come from pito chickering your line is now open with deutsche bank pito chickering hey guys thanks for taking my questions a few ones here on the 2020 revenue guidance what are you guys assuming in terms of organic treatment growth and revenue per treatment and how does the commercial reimbursement look for 2020 javier rodriguez sure so hey on nav weâ ve we are guiding to 1 5 to 2 5 in terms of revenue per treatment we are not going to guide to rpt anymore in the level of specificity we have in the past that said i think it s safe to say going forward that it ll look similar to what it looked like in the recent past the same dynamic in terms of commercial rpt medicare rpt and mix should play out next year the way they have in the recent two years the one big change obviously is on medicare fee for service reimbursement we got that in 19 and we see that continuing forward so again as we think about the how we want to guide and this is consistent with what weâ ve raised at capital markets day more of a focus on margin than on any of the individual inputs that said if you think about the inputs of rpt and the subcomponents there as well as cost per treatment and the other things we don t see anything particularly different next year to call out than what we ve seen in the recent past pito chickering great and then on the 2020 margin guidance let me ask this a different way if we exclude calcimimetics for 2020 the operating income margin is i think 12 5 if we exclude 47 million of calcimimetics for 2020 it looks as though youâ re guiding to about 50 basis points improvement in 2020 versus 2019 first quarter 18 was a very easy comp so if you exclude calcimimetics for 2019 and 2020 and easy comp of first quarter 19 how should we think about core operating income margin in 2020 versus 2019 joel ackerman okay pito you lost me there on your math but i will tell you the way i think about my math and i apologize if this doesn t kick in tight to what you asked but you can follow with jim afterwards so for adjusted normalized numbers so this excludes calcimimetics we came in just north of 14 in 2019 we expect that and again we are not guiding to oi so we again we said that calcimimetics at capital markets day we are sticking with that that said either through a top down analysis using revenue and our margin guidance or bottoms up through eps you can all do the math and come up with a range so iâ m going to give some high level thoughts relative to whatâ s probably the middle of the range of what you should be thinking about which should show you a little bit of margin compression in 2020 versus 2019 although still very much in that 13 to 14 range we talked about at capital markets day and if i have to point out what is driving that you got a little bit of ab 290 in there you ve got the continued pressure on labor costs associated with the strong environment we are in and we are also looking at making some investments in the form of operating costs investing in our future around things like home things like integrated kidney care things like data and analytics so if you put those all those things together you would come up with a little bit of margin pressure in 2020 over 2019 but still very much in the range of what we talked about at capital markets is that helpful pito chickering yes very much so which actually sort of the last question at the analyst day you talked about capital capital growth with capex coming down to 615 in 2022 and you sort of you just mentioned sort of kidney start home based programs can you quantify how many of your centers have separate home treatments options today and how many are freestanding home centers as well joel ackerman i donâ t know the answer to that javier rodriguez we will follow up on it joel ackerman we can follow up with you on that pito pito chickering great thanks so much guys i appreciate it operator the next question will come from andrew mark with barclays your line is now open unidentified analyst hi good afternoon just wanted to follow up on the 2020 guidance components given all the moving parts you raised eps guidance by 0 50 it sounds like that increase is largely accounted for by the benefit from calcimimetics and the reversal of ab 290 so is it fair to say that the underlying assumptions on share repurchase remain the same given the 2 4 billion of share repurchase you did in 2019 combined with the nice volume of stock price in the last few months how should we think about the size and cadence of share repurchase in 2020 javier rodriguez sure so the fundamentals of our share repurchase philosophy havenâ t changed in terms of focusing on intrinsic value and ensuring we are not buying at what we believe above what we believe intrinsic value is also with the general expectation to stay most of the time although not all of the time within our leverage guidance of 3x to 3 5x i will take a second here to notes that you ll see the leverage number in the press release is around 3 1 which would bring it in at the low end of our range if you think about that excluding calcimimetics which i think is a better way to think about it it would put it at the higher end of our range but with all that said our philosophy on buybacks has not changed i think what has changed since we spoke to you in november is the stock is up from the high 50s low 60s to now in the 80s and that does impact our share buyback thinking really in two fundamental ways one is that the dollars we would apply to share buybacks will just buy that many fewer shares because the stock price is up and second as we think about intrinsic value and comparing that to where the stock is this where the stock is will fundamentally impact how we think about buybacks so we re going to give you any foresight in what we plan to do weâ ve always shied away from that but i wanted to give you kind of a bit of an update there on how we are thinking about things quarter great i appreciate the color and then second question on the home dialysis front the mandatory model from the executive order was supposed to go into effect last month and now thatâ s delayed are you hearing anything out of d c on why that model got delayed and does the temporary or even permanent delay of the model impact your strategy that increase home penetration javier rodriguez no in general i think the executive order had a lot in it and they asked for comments and the community was very united on its views and so we are glad that the administration has taken its time because we want a good outcome rather than meeting a deadline and no to the other question which is while policy of course impact at the end of the day the patient and the physician pick the modality and that s what s driving the movement to home people picking it or not picking it as opposed to any policy changes at this juncture unidentified analyst okay great thanks javier rodriguez thank you operator the next question will come from steve tanal with goldman sachs your line is now open stephen tanal good afternoon guys thanks for the question so i wanted to go back to the 2021 rule change i guess where iâ m struggling with the idea that penetration of esrd patient should reach the overall market is just this notion that today i mean penetration of esrd patients is 25 for the market at large despite the fact they can t freely enroll in the plan so wouldnâ t that tell us that this patient panel probably prefers ma and that penetration could exceed 35 over time and i guess i know we are still anchoring to that but it looks like cms last week with the changes in the advanced notice for ma rates took their forecast up to 33 and 21 and then going to 42 41x22 2024 then 42 thereafter so obviously a much much more optimistic outlook than you guys have so any thoughts on those pieces there javier rodriguez yes steve i think that all of the opinions are quite reasonable and we don t proclaim to be right we are all doing it the same data as to economic deductibles out of pocket max sort of coordination of care network narrow networks or broader network and so when we put all the variables in place we just think that in general we think that it ll take a little bit longer for people to settle in to the choice than others that think that it will be what i call a very efficient and effective market and we of course could be wrong and so there is that range that it let s call it the low the base case and the high case and we don t have any additional insight that you or cms doesn t there s no detail information that we are relying on stephen tanal helpful okay and then i just heard you correctly joel in terms of making sure your patients are aware of their options i imagine that applies to all states regardless of whether there s guaranteed issue for medsup or not is that correct joel ackerman yes stephen tanal okay and then i guess i wanted to also ask about another part of that proposed rule to the extent you guys have the time to go through all this but the network adequacy proposals there s a few things in there i won t go through all of them here but some could be presumably read as maybe mitigating some of the market power and dialysis how do you guys think about that dynamic in general i guess i d leave it open ended there i donâ t want to dissuade any or share maybe i guess joel ackerman i appreciate steve obviously network adequacy is critical in any disease state when you are signing up for a product you want to make sure that it got coverage so that if you end up signing up and then you have esrd then you don t end up having some kind of restricted network and of course it matters whether it s in there or not the plans have been quite vocal and from our perspective what we want to do is going back to our conversation earlier is we want to change the dynamics with our payer partners so that they see what we re doing and how we are adding value so that they do want to contract with us in a way thatâ s a win win stephen tanal perfect helpful and maybe one more on this and then i will yield just going back to the treatment deltas the ma fee for service i guess i appreciate that you guys donâ t want to give a certain difference but maybe you can comment on how much variability there is in that spread and what factors dictate his davita s willingness to contract for lower versus higher spreads of different ma plans javier rodriguez well i appreciate the question steve but i think you probably know it had low odds being answered every plan is steering right now at how they want to contract with us and actually even if i try to answer it and be helpful the contract is very specific to each plan and their ability to take risk and our ability to take risk and so it s very specific and so unfortunately i can t give you more detail on that stephen tanal thatâ s fine thanks a lot appreciate it joel ackerman thank you operator the next question will come from whit mayo with ubs your line is now open whit mayo hey thanks good afternoon just a couple here on calcimimetics youâ re guiding to 40 million to 70 million of oi this year 50 of that is falling in the first quarter which implies about 25 of today s run rate of 220 million in the first quarter so iâ m just curious what you re basing that on is that based off of asp for the quarter today how much visibility do you have into the first quarter contribution at this point i guess this is what iâ m asking joel ackerman weâ ve got pretty good visibility with that the asp number came out i think in december not perfect visibility but so in q1 we ve got that the trajectory of what that looks like going forward though is where we don t have perfect visibility and we won t know asp for q2 for a little while now whit mayo okay so that looks like thatâ s about a 60 sequential decline of the fourth quarter for asp is that right javier rodriguez whit we are â whit mayo do you know â joel ackerman there are other factors that go into that in terms of the cost decline the changing mix between sensipar and parsabiv and parsabiv cost differential so i m not sure you can get as cleaner number as you d like from that but â whit mayo is it i mean presumably the asp numbers available so can you disclose what it is for the quarter joel ackerman yes it s down a little bit more than 40 whit mayo okay so some other factor would be driving your cost up to lower the oi by 60 javier rodriguez well there is there are other factors besides cost because there s a mix issue between the oral and the iv as well whit mayo yes yes got it got it okay that s and thinking about the remaining 50 million or not 50 million but the remaining earnings how do you i mean are we how should we think about the progression of that earnings is it fall ratably throughout the year i donâ t know just any help i mean i know youâ ve about as much visibility into this as we do javier rodriguez yes if you think about it getting cut in half each quarter going forward thatâ s a reasonable algorithm to use and then it goes to zero by the end of the year whit mayo okay javier rodriguez again thatâ s not a prediction that s just to help you all with your modeling whit mayo yes is there a scenario where by the time the industry sort of sees the benefit of calcimimetics zero out that you are still carrying some level of earnings from calcimimetics given that youâ ve presumably been buying below the market for some time joel ackerman unlikely just because the numbers get so small in terms of the cost i think the more interesting question about calcimimetics is ultimately how it gets bundled whit mayo bundled yes joel ackerman the tdapa stuff will play out relatively quickly whit mayo okay just a couple of other quick ones so just back to the nag guidance of 1 5 to 2 5 that does implies some level of deceleration just joe maybe any factors influencing your decision to bring the range down javier rodriguez let me grab that this is javier we continue to look at the macro ranges and we just think that is the right place to land we re continuing to invest in our missions in our it in all other operations to simplify patient placement but at the end of the day what we are focusing is ensuring that we have the discipline and capital so that we have profitable growth and so we re not going to chase volume it s just not the right thing for us and so we re comfortable with that range of 1 5 to 2 5 whit mayo okay thanks javier rodriguez and just as an fyi my memory has me right that is not a change from capital markets we had at 1 5 to 2 5 but i could be wrong so let s check that operator thank you and the next question comes from gary taylor with jpmorgan your line is now open gary taylor hi good evening just a couple of questions left for me the first just going back to the question about the etc the mandatory demonstration that s been delayed do you have any visibility on when that would start are you incurring any costs to prepare for it and i presume since that model had some dialysis center reimbursement cuts which you could potentially earn back since this is delayed any potential financial impact is not contemplated in the 2020 guidance javier rodriguez the short answer is we do not have any more information than any of you we were given an opportunity just like all providers to give our opinions and insight and we did and theyâ re processing that and we have not heard back we are not incurring any costs right now associated with it and it was not embedded in our guidance so right now you re even steven if you will there s no changes gary taylor right thanks my last one to joel i just wondered if you would perhaps just review and clarify for us either on an eps basis or a dollar basis what actually is in 2020 for advocacy costs because i know in the third quarter you bumped that up 0 50 or call it 87 million pre tax but that i think was on top of what you view as your recurring sort of normal advocacy but then with the ab 290 delay maybe some of that costs came back in your direction so maybe just some help on when we think about the 2020 guide how much above sort of your what you d call your normal advocacy spend is built into 2020 joel ackerman sure so nothing has really changed in that gary there hasnâ t been any interplay between 2020 ballot initiative spend and ab 290 theyâ re pretty independent so the 0 50 per share is the right number and that s over and above the 30 million baseline that we plan to spend year in year out the one correction i would make to your numbers is this ballot initiative costs is not tax deductible so your 87 million pre tax is overstated because i my guess is you got to that calculation assuming this would tax deductible gary taylor yes i recall you told us that somewhere like 60 million 65 million range probably so â joel ackerman we are sticking with 0 50 a share so â gary taylor okay all right thank you operator the next question is from justin lake with wolfe research your line is now open justin lake thanks just figure out one through what s left of my question list here do you guys so first on the cash available for deployment at your end i think if my recollection is correct you guys typically want to run around 500 million at the parent at quarter end so is to fair to think about you guys have another 500 million give or take of deployable cash at your end is that right joel ackerman yes thatâ s about right 500 million is typically what we want to have in the system so yes the 600 million is the number above that justin lake okay thatâ s helpful and then joe you spend time talking about the intrinsic value kind of coming into repo and given that you did a tremendous amount of repo at really attractive price for the benefit of shareholders now that the stocks in the 80s it looks like you are going to little bit less at those levels is there anything we should read into your view of the intrinsic value here at the current price and how you expect above x stock could you give us a kind of at the moment update joel ackerman yes we are weâ ve never really been willing to talk about what our views of intrinsic value are at any moment in time and i donâ t expect to deviate from that here i think the one thing i would point out is intrinsic value is a moving target it s not something that stays static and its impacted by our results and it can be impacted by our buybacks and everything else so i think what our views of intrinsic value were six months ago are necessarily the same with our views of intrinsic value today javier rodriguez one dynamic justin that is rarely talk about publicly also is that we have big blackout periods and then you have plan and we have restrictions and whatnot and so what you want to do is not look at one quarter or two quarters but overall what is our track record and i think you see our track record over time it s quite fluid consistent with what joe said justin lake that absolutely makes sense thanks and then just quickly on your commercial mix joe you said it was down 20 basis points year over year but not really immaterial impact on revenue per treatment can you just give us some more color on that given how key that metric is joel ackerman yes look not every commercial payer is created equal and if the mix comes from payers with lower rates it has much less impact on our rpt than a payer who is at an average rate justin lake and so would you say this is instead of it being just kind of normal aging of the population type of thing did you proactively kind of walk away for some contrast that were lower priced or was that just kind of the way things fell javier rodriguez yes i would say that what joe start off with on an early question still holds which is there s no new dynamic and sort of the ecosystems negotiation is relatively stable there was no big decision one way or another and it will play out the way it is justin lake okay just a few couple of others here one joe just to make sure we understand youâ re not giving oi guidance but you back to pito s question on margins core margins ex kind of moving parts are down a little year over year revenue is up a little bit so kind of core oi changes things like that are is effectively flat year over year within your guidance is that a reasonable way to think about it joel ackerman iâ m reluctant to get drawn into the oi guidance question because we re not guiding on oi that said i think again you can look at the range is top down or bottoms up i would say it s fair to say that at the middle of the range is you should expect some oi growth year over year justin lake at core like ex moving parts joel ackerman with margin compression which would say it s not going to grow at the rate of revenue justin lake okay joel ackerman and that s justin yes thatâ s core excluding calcimimetics and other stuff other noise justin lake got it and then maybe quick commentary i think you the industry was going to run its own ballot initiative in california and then decided to back off that is there some reason why you decided to back off or do i have that wrong javier rodriguez no you have it right and i think the right way to think about it justin is very early on you have to explore all your options and so there s some filing restrictions etcetera so we were exploring option making sure that we had everything at our disposal after evaluating it we did not think that that was something that we should pursue it s not in the best interest of our strategy and thatâ s cleaner to go right after it literally straight at it as opposed to doing a counter measure justin lake okay thanks for all the time guys javier rodriguez thank you justin operator the next question will come from maggie jiang with bank of china new york branch your line is now open maggie jiang thank you for taking my call my question here is what is your priority inters of the international expansion i see that there are about 241 centers in the international as of 2018 not sure if that number goes up in 2019 joel ackerman sure so our priorities for international are similar to our priorities in the u s which is capital efficient growth we continue to see it as a growth business we continue to deploy capital there in the markets that we see is having the best opportunities and those are opportunities where we can either acquire things at attractive rates or build de novos at attractive rates and where we have an opportunity to add value so growth in 19 was relatively in line with our expectations we see 2020 continuing along that path maggie jiang okay and in terms of the long term growth for the international business do you expect the just because different regions will have different type of reimbursement system affordability and customers clientele so do you would you expect the international profitability versus your core in u s javier rodriguez i think that will vary very much country by country as you noted some countries have better reimbursement others less so so i think it will be a bit of a mix and where it winds up relative to the u s will depend a lot on the different mix in the different countries and where we chose to prioritize our investments so it s hard to predict now what the ultimate margin will be relative to the u s margin maggie jiang okay and since that the revenue coming from the international is roughly about 4 5 however the growth if i just purely look at q4 2018 versus q4 2019 the growth from the international revenue is 6 45 so that seems to be a brighter spot than the aggregate revenue growth around 2 7 so do you think that you will continue to approach international particularly in china however on the other hand we do see profit net operating loss from international javier rodriguez so yes i do think we are going to continue to invest in international whether it grows faster than the u s we are not giving specific guidance on that although i think looking at the past is a reasonable guide to the future there so yes maggie jiang i see and then in terms of asia footprint in asia i see there are a few branches a few centers in taiwan and china and youâ re also working with apac jv can you just give me a sense in terms of whatâ s your business model and how do you approach china or greater china javier rodriguez so we generally don t get into too much detail on any individual countries so iâ m going to pass on that one maggie jiang thank you javier rodriguez thank you maggie operator speakers there are no questions in queue at this time javier rodriguez well i want to thank you all for investing the time we look forward to talking to you again and we are going to do our hardest to deliver on all that we committed thank you and talk again soon operator and that concludes todayâ s conference thank you for your participation you may now disconnect

adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure the company presents adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of its performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that the company s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items the company defines adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange e mutual fund income the company believes adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing the company s ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the company s operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation the company s management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis for more information please see the table

by navid barani for six years iran had been attempting to integrate with the global economy after signing the 2015 nuclear deal however trump s unilateral decision to pull out from the deal has forced iran to rethink its re entry into the global economy crippling sanctions imposed by the trump administration have severed iran s access to international markets placing iran in a dire economic crisis jobs are rather scarce as one in four youth is unemployed and food prices and consumer goods are soaring the economy contracted at 9 5 in 2019 and iran s key export oil was effectively zero in december 2019 although it is speculated that smugglers have been able to transport unknown volumes of oil in light of these hardships iranians are becoming more and more restless in retaliation to trump s maximum pressure campaign iran has slowly rolled back its commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal and symbolically removed all limits to nuclear enrichment in january this has forced germany france and britain to intensify pressure on iran by triggering a dispute mechanism the european powers will have 60 days to get iran to comply with the nuclear agreement and failure to do so will lead to the snapback of united nations sanctions the economy contracted at 9 5 in 2019 and iran s key export oil was effectively zero in december in response to increasing pressure to comply with the 2015 nuclear deal iranian foreign minister javad zarif stated that iran would withdraw from the non proliferation treaty npt if europeans continued with what he called their improper behavior or referred iran to the un security council over its alleged violations of the 2015 deal foreign minister javad zarif also pulled out of the world economic forum wef in davos switzerland due to the backdrop of uncertainty in the middle east can iran become economically self sufficient iran has a history of being cut off from international markets and investors stemming from the iranian revolution in 1979 which led to wide reaching sanctions to the recent sanctions in 2012 which were imposed due to iran s nuclear activity this economic isolation has led iran to create a so called resistance economy which involves the state subsidizing strategic industries investing heavily while replacing imported goods with domestic production the concept of a resistance economy has become a national ethos for the iranian government as it s seen as the only way to effectively ensure iran s long term economic survival against western aggression president rouhani has already warned iranians to brace for difficult times while noting that the government will use its strength in the near future to mitigate declining economic conditions the concept of a resistance economy has become a national ethos for the iranian government as it s seen as the only way to effectively ensure iran s long term economic survival against western aggression a vital sector that iran has invested in is its military industrial complex which is now self sufficient in producing drones ballistic missiles tanks and other weaponry by indigenizing its ability to build weapons iran strives to be self reliant when it comes to national defense another initiative undertaken by iran to strengthen its resistance economy was the creation of the iranian oil bourse in 2008 which sought to end reliance on the us dollar for the trade of oil a month after iran decided to abandon the petrodollar russia followed suit and stated it would allow the sale of oil in rubles furthermore in december of 2019 during a conference of muslim leaders in malaysia iran spearheaded an initiative for a new trading system based around the gold standard and barter to help countries not only to survive but to thrive under sanctions iran continues to avoid sanctions and actively encourage other nations to consider the possibility of a world free of america s monetary dominance in july 2019 iran had also stated that it would soon launch a gold backed cryptocurrency to circumvent us sanctions though initially suspicious of cryptocurrency iran now seeks to use this untraceable exchange as a method for its customers to purchase its oil china and russia have also sought to adopt cryptocurrency as a way to protect their national and economic interests from the united states and conduct trade with sanctioned countries such as iran consequently these moves have enraged us officials as iran continues to avoid sanctions and actively encourage other nations to consider the possibility of a world free of america s monetary dominance what are the implications of iran s resistance economy unlike venezuela which has had its economy crippled by us sanctions that have essentially cut off all government income iran continues to persist in the face of us sanctions iran is also more heavily sanctioned than venezuela russia north korea combined which is a testament to its resistance economy despite the negative repercussions on the iranian economy iran s leaders still prioritize one goal above all others their survival however that doesn t mean that iran isn t feeling the pressure some economists have stated that iran s resistance economy has only delayed the inevitable as iran s budget and banking system are under heavy strain its national currency has plummeted unemployment has surpassed 17 and annual inflation has been put at 31 this year according to the international monetary fund despite the negative repercussions on the iranian economy iran s leaders still prioritize one goal above all others their survival sanam vakil the deputy director of the middle east and north africa program at chatham house has stated that he hard liners are willing to impoverish people to stay in power the islamic republic does not make decisions based on purely economic outcomes the ongoing rivalry with america gives hard liners the chance to develop the resistance economy while at the same time fueling a politically useful nationalist anger though it is predicted that iran has enough foreign reserves to last two years its leaders should be cautious to recognize the risks that economic distress can pose to established powers though iran s leaders continue to place their bets on its resistance economy at its current stage it is only a band aid solution to its economic situation which prolongs the rate of the regime s survivability at the cost of iranian citizens in the past year lebanon and iraq iran s close allies have witnessed uprisings due to deteriorating living standards and endemic corruption last november iran itself faced civil unrest as its citizens protested the government s decision to end fuel subsidies which led to deadly clashes in several iranian cities though iran s leaders continue to place their bets on its resistance economy at its current stage it is only a band aid solution to its economic situation which prolongs the rate of the regime s survivability at the cost of iranian citizens if iran truly wants its resistance economy to flourish it cannot do it in isolation instead iran needs to form a coalition of resistance economies which put more effort into adopting cryptocurrency barter and are willing to stand against american economic hegemony by ending their reliance on the dollar navid barani is a foreign affairs consultant and a freelance writer on current

federal reserve chairman jerome powell warned lawmakers on tuesday that the coronavirus epidemic sweeping china could pose broader economic risks even as he signalled that the central bank is comfortable holding interest rates steady for now fed chair jerome powell has again come in for criticism from president trump credit ap we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus which could lead to disruptions in china that spill over to the rest of the global economy powell told house financial services committee members the central bank chief is also set to testify before the senate banking committee on wednesday the fed is treading cautiously as the economy continues to add jobs but inflation remains low an initial trade deal with china has eased one major source of economic uncertainty but tariffs remain on chinese goods and tensions with other nations could reignite and the new virus which has killed more than 1 000 people and sickened tens of thousands has emerged as an economic wild card
federal reserve chairman jerome powell called on congress to reduce the u s federal budget deficit to ensure the central bank could adequately respond to a financial crisis or recession powell told a house committee tuesday that lawmakers should curb federal spending while the economy is running strong before a downturn forces congress or the fed to pump stimulus spending into the u s putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn powell said tuesday before the house financial services committee a more sustainable federal budget could also support the economy s growth over the long term powell s comments come one day after president trump proposed a budget for fiscal 2021 with a 1 trillion deficit that puts the u s on track to balance its spending in 15 years those projections assume the economy growing at a far faster rate than predicted by most economists powell a republican widely seen as moderate has frequently called on congress to reduce the deficit throughout his tenure as fed chairman the fed chief is among several policymakers and economists concerned about how a combination of low interest rates and high debt could hamstring policymakers if the economy slows down the fed has historically responded to economic downturns with drastic interest rates cuts reducing the cost of borrowing to stimulate the economy the bank reduced interest rates to zero percent after the 2007 financial crisis and gradually raised them to a baseline range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent by december 2018 a global economic slump forced the fed to reverse course last year cutting rates to the 1 5 percent to 1 75 percent range with rates well below the historic average of 5 percent some economists fear that interest rates are currently too low for a swift rate cut to stave off a recession that would likely boost pressure on congress to pass a massive stimulus bill akin to the 2009 measure enacted by former president obama the current low interest rate environment means that it would be important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it weakens powell said tuesday fiscal advice is one of the few areas directly beyond the fed s mandate where powell is willing to offer policy prescriptions before joining the fed in 2012 the chairman was a crucial republican advocate for raising the federal debt limit during the obama administration as a visiting scholar at the bipartisan policy center but beyond budgeting powell has largely rejected lawmakers requests to opine on issues relegated to congress while guarding the central bank s independence amid trump s constant criticism trump bashed powell on twitter in the middle of his testimony blaming the fed chief for a slight dip in the dow jones industrial average that began during his house appearance when jerome powell started his testimony today the dow was up 125 heading higher as he spoke it drifted steadily downward as usual and is now at 15 germany other countries get paid to borrow money we are more prime but fed rate is too high dollar tough on exports trump tweeted while stocks are historically sensitive to commentary from fed chiefs it s unclear what role powell s testimony actually played in the dow s minuscule loss powell at the hearing painted an optimistic picture of a sturdy economy that is likely to hold steady amid a series of global threats but could be hampered by fallout from the lethal coronavirus per custom powell brushed off trump s attack when asked to respond i m not following the market as i sit here answering your questions powell said lawmakers squabbled over trump s constant pressure even before the president weighed in on the hearing rep maxine waters d calif who chairs the financial services panel condemned trump for impeding on the fed s independence prompting rebukes from committee republicans every president in the last 100 years has had some private criticism and we ve found out at some point about that criticism said rep patrick mchenry r n c the panel s ranking member but here on the hill we can make negative comments about the fed and attack the president for having negative comments about the fed rep bill posey r fla suggested later that the fed should face an audit of its monetary policymaking process even though the fed releases minutes and full transcripts of its rate setting meetings which are public but the hearing highlighted the challenge powell faces in trying to sidestep a partisan and sharply divided washington powell even faced criticism of his own personal conduct despite a reservoir of goodwill among lawmakers in both parties rep katie porter d calif questioned powell on why he attended a party at the washington d c home of amazon ceo jeff bezos that was attended by several top white house officials including jared kushner and ivanka trump and jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon i would just suggest that this attendance at this kind of event with these kinds of people is inconsistent with what i would otherwise commend you on for doing a very good job porter said powell responded that he did not talk to any of the people porter named and merely introduced his son and daughter in law to former defense secretary james mattis who resigned in protest from the trump administration in december 2018

india s budget 2020 needs a few course corrections in her marathon 2 hours and 46 minutes speech introducing india s 2020 budget finance minister nirmala sitharaman painted an optimistic picture of the indian economy she stated at the outset that her budget s goal is to boost incomes and enhance purchasing power of the people of india only through higher growth can we achieve that and have our youth gainfully and meaningfully employed sitharaman added the finance minister s assessment that higher growth and employment are prerequisites for higher individual incomes and greater purchasing power is spot on her optimism is also understandable being the stewardess of a 3 trillion economy one expects her to have confidence in the policies she s proposing however the budget sitharaman presented on february 1 was the most comprehensive blueprint submitted by the government of prime minister narendra modi to date to revive the economy examining it contextually it falls short in a number of areas for some time india has been one of the brightest spots of the global economy currently however india is in the middle of a major slowdown the growth rate in the last fiscal quarter was the lowest in 11 years last month the international monetary fund downgraded its global growth forecast putting the blame squarely on india saying that its woes are dragging the world economy down at the moment india is experiencing its worst employment crisis in 45 years several sectors including financial real estate and automobile manufacturing are among the worst affected growth in private consumption in the sixth largest global consumer market has also been a concern for a while given all of this there were expectations that the budget would advance new major policy initiatives and significant reform measures to kick start the economy and change the current narrative this was especially the case because due to the huge mandate prime minister modi received last may the government had plenty of political capital if it wanted to spend some however sitharaman s 13 000 word budget speech contained no real bold or big ticket items instead what was put forward was a classic case of nibbling around the edges not surprisingly one of the first groups to express disappointment with the budget was india s investor community whose negative reaction was reflected in the sensex losing more than 1 000 points on the budget day the losses were erased in subsequent days three major drivers of economic growth are foreign direct investment fdi public and private consumption and exports there wasn t any serious effort on the part of sitharaman s budget to boost any one of these the finance minister indicated that she is betting on growing inflows of net fdi an all time high accumulation of foreign exchange reserves which stood at 457 5 billion in december and improvement in world bank s ease of doing business which now stands at 63 the budget did offer some sops to foreign portfolio investors such as tax exemptions to sovereign wealth funds that invest in infrastructure and other critical areas but it is not nearly enough while india remains one of the largest recipients of fdi foreign investments in sectors such as infrastructure are very modest a primary reason that foreign investors are reluctant to pump in top dollars in infrastructure development is india s cumbersome land acquisition laws as long as there is no change in the status quo in that area fdi in the sector will continue to lag export is another area where the right policies could make india one of the international leaders right now india stands behind even small nations such as hong kong and singapore in this area for that to change india s manufacturing capabilities will have to be upgraded substantially the budget did not outline clear plans to revive troubled sectors such as real estate financial and automobile manufacturing which have been adversely affecting the economy for india to turn the corner these sectors have to perform better and do so fast their enhanced performance would help stimulate public and private sector consumption another factor compounding india s economic problems is that one of the unintended consequences of a recent corporate tax cut was diminished tax revenue sitharaman s decision to levy tax on the indian income of non resident indians nri appears to be an attempt to address this by expanding the tax base however judging from the reactions from overseas that move does not appear to have gone well with the nri community which is traditionally a big backer of the ruling bharatiya janata party as a result it is likely to discourage nris from investing in india it should be noted that the budget did have some positives one of which was a proposal to invest rs 1 7 trillion to enhance india s transport infrastructure that will pay for upgrading key highways electrifying 27 000 km of railway tracks and building 100 new airports last year during her first visit to the united states as finance finister sitharaman said that prime minister modi s vision of making india a 5 trillion economy in the next five years was achievable but her first full budget as finance minister does not provide a sufficient platform for beginning to achieve that vision over the past year some of the adjectives used by the international media and pundits in the us and europe to describe the indian economy were words such as sagging stuttering and floundering this commentary continues into this new year within hours of the budget presentation the economist in its analysis opined it does too little to shore up the flailing economy and failing banks based upon the foregoing it must be concluded that with this budget the finance minister missed an opportunity to change the narrative about the economy and to initiate actions that will make an immediate and positive difference in it that s the bad news the good news is that a budget is what it is a plan for the next 12 months governments can and do make course corrections routinely during a year this budget needs course corrections sooner rather later the right ones addressing the items outlined in this piece and others will set the indian economy in the proper direction and benefit the indian people the modi administration and the world economy
in particular we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus which could lead to disruptions in china that spill over to the rest of the global economy powell said in remarks before u s lawmakers tuesday powell stopped short of saying the outbreak had changed the fed s baseline outlook for the u s economy or the expectation among many members of the federal open market committee that rates will remain on hold this year u s equities climbed as investors digested the latest views from the fed chair and treasuries slipped the fomc believes that the current stance of monetary policy will support continued economic growth a strong labor market and inflation returning to the committee s symmetric 2 objective powell said as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate coronavirus which has killed more than 1 000 people has prompted the world s largest known quarantine effort and slowed large portions of china s economy disrupting travel and commerce worldwide powell faced questions from lawmakers of the house financial services committee about the potential impact of the virus on the u s economy we know that there will be some very likely be some effects on the united states he said adding that the question for the fed is whether they ll be persistent and material it s just too early to say powell said the fed chief is also scheduled for a hearing before the senate banking committee at 10 a m wednesday as part of his semi annual testimony to congress fed officials have dialed up their concern over the coronavirus in public remarks in recent days vice chairman richard clarida called it a wild card on jan 31 the fed s semiannual monetary policy report released feb 7 said it was a new risk that could potentially interfere with trade depress commodity prices and cause the u s dollar to appreciate some private sector economists have been less cautious marking down their estimates for first quarter growth in the u s while investors are betting the fed will respond with an interest rate cut later this year in his prepared remarks powell provided a mostly positive picture of the u s economy which was dented but not significantly damaged by slower global growth and international trade disputes in 2019 economic activity increased at a moderate pace and the labor market strengthened further as the economy appeared resilient to the global headwinds that had intensified last summer he said his comments followed data released last week showing u s employers added a better than expected 225 000 new jobs in january powell said the central bank had been successful in containing a sudden september spike in overnight funding rates that briefly pushed the fed s benchmark lending rate to stray outside its target range the central bank has conducted emergency lending into the market for repurchase agreements and in october began purchasing 60 billion a month in treasury bills the latter move has boosted bank reserves allowing banks to feed money into the repo market in place of the fed as our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions we intend to gradually transition away from the active use of repo operations he said we intend to slow our purchases to a pace that will allow our balance sheet to grow in line with trend demand for our liabilities powell repeated his concerns over longer term issues holding back growth in the u s economy finding ways to boost labor force participation and productivity growth would benefit americans and should remain a national priority he said he also warned lawmakers the economy would need support from fiscal policy in the event of a downturn and pressed them to put the federal budget on a sustainable path the white house on monday released president donald trump s proposed 2021 federal budget which included deficit spending of about 1 trillion trump has repeatedly criticized powell for not lowering interest rates further coronavirus emerged as an economic threat in recent months just as the global outlook was beginning to brighten powell and his colleagues cut rates three times in 2019 to guard against the risks posed by trade tensions slow global growth and below target inflation since late last year however fed officials have said monetary policy was in a good place and would remain unchanged unless their outlook for the economy changed materially completion of the china phase one trade deal britain s avoidance of a sudden no deal exit from the european union and a slight improvement in global manufacturing data pointed to a more stable outlook for 2020 after a decidedly rocky 2019 some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently but risks to the outlook remain powell said

change global carbon dioxide emissions must be cut by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and then eliminated entirely by 2050 to have even a reasonable chance of preventing global warming of 1 5 c above pre industrial levels we need quick wins warns the united nations environment programme in its latest emissions gap report or the 1 5 c goal of the paris agreement will slip out of reach that is an understatement even if the current nationally determined contributions ndcs under the 2015 paris accord are met emissions in 2030 will be 38 per cent above where they need to be global average temperatures will be on track to rise by a disastrous 2 9 3 4 c by 2100 with continuing increases thereafter the ndc targets would need to be roughly tripled just to limit warming to 2 c and would have to increase fivefold to achieve the 1 5 c goal that is not going to happen the only time in recent history when co2 emissions have looked as though they might plateau was in2014 2016 owing to weak global growth according to the global carbon project emissions have since increased again by 2 7 per cent in 2018 and 0 6 per cent in 2019 making matters worse the december 2019 un climate change conference cop25 was a dismal failure resulting in no new climate pledges or clear messages of intent for this year s cop26 summit in glasgow why is humanity so reluctant to save itself first many people simply do not accept the predictions issued by climate scientists but denialism is the least serious of the three main obstacles there will always be a minority for whom facts and logic are unwelcome distractions yet even us president donald trump must realise by now that climate change will undermine the future viability and profitability of mar a lago as the real world costs of climate driven disasters mount over time denialism will become less of an issue indeed a november 2019 yale university survey finds that 62 per cent of registered voters in the united states already would support a president declaring global warming a national emergency if congress does not act the second major challenge is that ghg emissions are the quintessential global economic externality climate change doesn t respect borders ghgs emitted anywhere will affect everyone eventually that means there is a massive free rider problem under current circumstances it will always be individually rational to let others cut back on their emissions rather than doing so yourself the only way to correct this problem is through collective rationality or enlightened self interest but given the current state of multilateralism expecting a truly global effort in pursuit of the common good is a tall order the third obstacle is that effective policies to reduce ghg emissions disproportionately hurt the poor both globally and within countries the international monetary fund recently calculated that the current effective global price of co2 emissions is a mere 2 per tonne to limit global warming to less than 2 c however would require an average effective price of 75 per tonne by 2030 i agree with harvard university economist kenneth rogoff that a uniform global carbon emissions tax is likely to be the best solution to the climate challenge at least from an environmental perspective but with such a tax in place average household electricity prices over the next decade would increase cumulatively by 45 per cent and gasoline prices by 15 per cent hence even within rich countries the distributional consequences would be difficult to handle as france s government found out after it tried to introduce a modest fuel tax in 2018 worse since the 1980s effective redistributive fiscal mechanisms in most advanced economies have been emasculated moreover the larger distributional burden of a global carbon tax would fall disproportionately on poor countries that are hoping to pursue rapid development in the coming decades around 570 million people in sub saharan africa alone lack access to basic electricity globally the number is closer to 1 2 billion needless to say long overdue growth in developing and emerging economies will bring massive increases in energy consumption and ghg emissions in india china and many other countries coal fired power plants will likely continue to be built for years to come clean and renewable energy from solar and wind will complement but not displace fossil fuels in these countries despite the strides made in battery storage technology the intermittency problems associated with wind and solar imply a continuing role for fossil fuels and nuclear power consider india which accounts for 7 per cent of annual global ghg emissions making it the world s fourth largest emitter after china 27 per cent the us 15 per cent and the european union 10 per cent that is despite the fact that india s per capitaenergy consumption is around one tenth of america s and even if that figure doubles by 2030 it will still be only half of what china s was in 2015 countries like india and those in sub saharan africa are not going to sacrifice their economic development for the sake of emissions reductions the only way to square the circle is to extend financial aid to developing and emerging economies undergoing unavoidably energy intensive development so that they can afford to internalise the ghg externality through an appropriately steep tax on emissions unfortunately sustained large scale international aid programmes are deeply unpopular and given that domestic fiscal solidarity is already wanting cross border fiscal solidarity seems like a non starter unless and until that changes an existential crisis of our own making will only worsen willem h buiter a former chief economist at citigroup is a visiting professor at columbia university

chief executive officer thank you debbie and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today in my remarks today i will focus on virtu s fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial and business performance 2019 milestones and the progress we ve made toward our strategic key initiatives before discussing goals for 2020 and the future of virtu following my remarks alex ioffe our cfo will provide additional details on our financials including an update on our integration related expenses and expense forecast for 2020 turning to our fourth quarter results which are summarized on slide 5 i m very pleased to discuss our strong outperformance in the last quarter we generated 4 08 million per day in the fourth quarter an increase of over the prior period despite significantly lower opportunities this quarter as demonstrated by a 3 decline in us equity average daily volumes and a 35 decline in realized volatility of the s p 500 index versus the prior quarter for the full year 2019 virtu generated 3 88 million per day of adjusted net trading income as we pre announced last week we also generated between 100 million and 105 million of adjusted net trading income nearly 5 million per day in january and our robust performance has continued into february our outperformance in the fourth quarter and in the start of 2020 is the result of investments we have made in technology integrating our firms deploying strategies to new projects new products and thereby making previously unaddressable opportunities addressable one of the hallmarks of virtu has always been our relentless effort to invest in scaling and improving our offerings across both our business segments offerings that are designed to drive organic revenue growth in any environment we also always focus on cost optimization to illustrate the benefits of virtu s operating leverage this quarter s 5 increase in average daily adjusted net trading income combined with reduction in expenses drove a 29 increase in our non gaap adjusted earnings per share of 0 27 per share compared to 21 0 21 excuse me in the prior quarter on a gaap basis we generated basic and diluted loss per share of 0 16 versus 0 04 in the third quarter 2019 both driven by acquisition related costs i m very proud of our performance in the quarter as it reflects our disciplined focus on achieving and executing on our strategic and sustainable growth initiatives across both our business segments even in the face of a difficult operating environment for the full year 2019 adjusted eps was 0 96 and for the fifth consecutive year we ve completed our mission to return capital to our shareholders in the form of our 0 24 per quarter dividend our adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter was 114 million an increase of 10 compared to the prior quarter as you know our results are primarily driven by our two main business segments market making and execution services slides 9 and 10 provide an illustration of our business today in our market making segment our average daily adjusted net trading income increased by 8 5 to 2 4 million per day in the fourth quarter this increase included a 25 increase in our average daily adjusted net trading income from global equities despite the noted declines in market volumes and realized volatility specifically as i just mentioned a 35 decline in realized s p volatility in addition to an 11 decline in realized euro stoxx and a 15 decline in nikkei realized volatility compared to the prior quarter our enhanced market making performance was driven by improvements we deployed to existing strategies in both our customer and non customer market making businesses in us equities we benefited from the introduction of zero commission training and the increase in retail volumes and an increase in our 605 market share in us equities our outperformance in global equities this quarter was also boosted by improvements in our european operations where we achieved significant organic growth as a result of recently relaunched market making strategies that combined the best of virtu and kcg our market making segment s results included a 35 decline in our average adjusted net trading income in global ficc stemming from significant declines in market volumes across these asset classes and in realized volatility across ficc globally specifically volatility indices for currencies and commodities including the cvix index jp morgan g7 fx index and the gs commodities index declined 36 40 and 81 respectively as a reminder by comparison the previous quarter experienced the highest level of realized volatility in crude that we have seen in some time the tax on saudi arabia has significant impacts on the crude markets that had made comparison to the third quarter very challenging turning to our execution services segment our adjusted net trading income was 1 68 million per day in the fourth quarter a slight 0 5 decline compared to the prior period as discussed previously this segment generates revenue that is recurring and relatively stable in nature looking at recent periods you can see that our adjusted net trading income for execution services has been relatively constant between 1 67 million to 1 69 million per day in each of the last three quarters given the contraction of the buy side s execution wallet and declining volumes year over year particularly in europe our steady performance is especially impressive and is a testament to the value we bring to our clients trading and investment processes and the progress we ve made in cross selling additional products to customers quickly looking ahead to slide 6 you will see the upward trajectory of our daily adjusted net trading income over the past several quarters which has continued into 2020 on expenses we continue to make progress in integrating and enhancing the various products acquired in the itg transaction and realizing efficiencies by the end of 2019 we had exceeded our initial synergy target several months ahead of schedule alex will provide more details along with 2020 expense guidance but we remain highly focused as always in managing our costs and meeting and outperforming guidance as we recently announced we opportunistically refinanced our term loan just last week to take advantage of lower rates available in the market i m pleased to report that this meaningfully lower our financing costs over the next five years to the tune of approximately 11 2 million cumulatively the results of transactions undertaken in the past two quarters yielded a total of 26 million in annual interest expense reductions approximately 23 of the annual interest expense from when we closed the itg transaction less than a year ago in just two and a half weeks we ll mark the first anniversary of our transformative merger with itg and we witness as we have witnessed over the last year the transaction combined two highly complementary businesses and created incremental operating scale that is allowing both of our both our market making and execution services segment to continue investing in our offerings while we remain open to strategic inorganic growth opportunities we have successfully invested and launched a number of organic growth initiatives in the first year at little if any incremental costs each new offering or product that we deliver across our unified global technology platform adds to our scale further strengthening our sustainable competitive advantages as well as our client relationships the organic and integrate inorganic initiatives we launched in 2019 have enhanced our operating leverage and increased the total addressable market of both of our operating segments as discussed in prior calls these and other initiatives are in line with our strategic vision to unify to utilize our unified technology platform to deliver more products services and data to more markets and clients as we grow our recurring revenues as we remain focused on helping our clients meet their trading goals we will naturally continue to uncover opportunities to strengthen these relationships by offering competitive transparent and sustainable technology lead solutions while we have accomplished humbling achievements in short of a year we remain excited for the new opportunities that await virtu and our clients around the globe turning to our market making segment on slide 12 we re very pleased to report on our robust outperformance compared to the industry benchmarks for the fourth quarter our average daily adjusted net trading income in market making increased by 8 5 to 2 4 million per day in the fourth quarter as mentioned a moment ago the environment during the fourth quarter presented reduced opportunities as declines in market volumes and volatilities that we witnessed in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter however despite these declines in opportunities in the period our outperformance was more than offset by organic growth in both our customer facing and non customer market making businesses turning to slides 13 and 14 in our customer market making business we achieved a 12 increase in our market share of marketable rule 605 order flow as we executed on opportunities to organically grow our results and win larger shares of flow from key brokers on a profitable basis we also saw significant organic growth in our non customer market making business from our focus on investing in recently launched market making strategies in europe growth in our etf block desk globally as well as developing our options capabilities let me talk first about our etf block business overall our firmwide footprint in etf is significant transacting more than 2 5 trillion usd of etf in 2019 the focus on our etf block desk was a major initiative for us in 2019 that continues to generate significant value and we are in the early stages in terms of its growth in addition to increasing the number of etps we quote by over 30 we grew adjusted net trading income on the desk by over 40 in 2019 compared to 2018 as the largest lead market maker in etfs in the united states virtu is well known is a well known authorized participant and an on screen market maker however creating a scalable etf desk to serve the needs of institutions as well as the funds themselves is a relatively new priority for virtu combining the global financial technology of virtu with the trading and distribution capabilities of kcg and itg is a winning formula similar to how we are leveraging our trading capabilities and technology to offer more services to more clients across our execution services segment the launch of our global etf block desk to expand our role across the etf ecosystem is a great example of an organic growth opportunity that resulted from the combination of virtu kcg and itg this is an exciting opportunity that favors scaled operators like virtu who can leverage a global technology platform and data processing plant to form prices distribute liquidity and execute on clients needs that said a significant amount of opportunity awaits as we are still developing our offerings in new asset classes like fixed income and our operations outside the united states additionally favorable regulatory trends such as mifid ii and improving best execution requirements will continue to increase the addressable size of the etf market further still as the global turnover and aum of etfs continues to grow so does the opportunity for our etf block desk globally and client demand for our services options on our last call i mentioned briefly our expansion with options i m pleased to report that our focus on growing our options footprint continues to show results in 2019 our volume in us cash equity options increased 32 and the number of symbols we trade increased 30 the pace of our growth in options is accelerating as our volume in january is up over 50 versus the fourth quarter and we are now quoting 13 more symbols than in the fourth quarter we are still in the very early innings in our expansion into options and there is a significant amount of runway ahead as we develop our options capabilities we expect we will be able to find opportunities to quickly deploy our scalable technology to address incremental markets including some of the world s largest and most active markets in addition to growing these new market making capabilities we continue to evaluate new markets from multiple perspectives as a result we are shortly going to commence being a multi asset class market maker onshore in india the markets in india represent significant opportunities in equities and commodities trading and our onshore operations and registrations will be important to position virtu for success in this important market expanding our etf block desk becoming a market maker in options and entering india are all examples of how virtu is adding incremental organic growth opportunities to our existing fixed cost plan to achieve great operating leverage turning now to revenue synergies specific to our market making segment we continue to benefit from deploying legacy kcg quantitative market making strategies on virtu technology and incorporating legacy kcg logic into certain virtu market making strategies our market making segment achieved over 50 million of adjustable net trading income attributable to organic growth in 2019 driven by enhancements from the combination of kcg and virtu turning now to our execution services business on slide 15 as you can see our results for the fourth quarter were nearly flat and we outperformed compared to the more significant declines in many market volume and volatility benchmarks looking at the market environment for the full year 2019 versus 2018 you can see how the average daily turnover declined significantly across the globe especially in europe and apac where notional turnover declined 22 and 19 respectively next i d like to update you on the deployment of a number of organic growth initiatives we announced last year specifically the launch of virtu execution services our outsourced trading offering our multi asset class analytics offering and triton enhancements and others while it s still early days since launching ecs last fall we have onboarded clients and we have many more global clients in the onboarding queue as a broker neutral platform virtu ecs provides clients with a suite of non conflicted execution services that are scaled to fit their needs clients appreciate that we are broker neutral and the research providers they use like that we are not competing with their research we are now in the process of building our network of brokers both in the united states and in europe and are launching a new sales campaign for 2020 to both build awareness and proactively identify and pursue opportunities audit and alert enhancements we rolled out many technological enhancements in 2019 but few where as immediately impactful to our clients as the technology upgrades and structural changes we made to reduce latency on our posit alert block crossing platform as we mentioned on our last call the upgrades we made reduced latencies by more than 70 resulting in sustained jump a sustained jump in our market share multi asset class triton we continue to deploy our next generation multi asset class ems platform triton valor since the end of the third quarter we have continued to roll out new valor platforms and a number of migrated firms increased from 14 to over 50 analytics also on the multi asset class front in the fourth quarter we announced the launch of our new fx benchmarks available within our broker neutral analytic suite the new fx benchmarks leverage virtu s technology platform and experience as a major liquidity provides the global fx markets to provide virtu s unbiased view a fair value for a given currency at any point in time our fx tca clients use the new benchmarks to measure the quality of brokers liquidity and the performance of algorithmic executions with enhanced levels of granularity virtu capital markets since our last earnings call our capital markets business has onboarded its first set of clients and and conducted its first atm trades virtu capital markets continues to focus corporate issuers that are looking for alternatives to tap into our capital markets via atm offerings and stock buybacks these are just a few of the initiatives that we are confident that our disciplined client centric focus is creating value for both our clients and our shareholders on slide 17 we outline our path to higher returns while our plans for virtu may seem ambitious we know we have the right level of talent commitment and client support to be sure we deliver the benefits our clients expect as i wrap up my prepared remarks i want to reiterate how proud we are at the success we have achieved for our company and for our clients in 2019 moving forward into 2020 across the firm we are steadfast in our commitment and determination to continuously improve the quality scalability and reliability of our global multi asset class offering i remain confident we are moving virtu in the right direction and we will continue this year as we capitalize and continue to grow momentum generated in 2019 we look forward to providing you with more updates on our next call and with that i d like to turn the call over to alex to review the financial details before we open the call up for questions alex alex ioffe executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you doug good morning everyone doug is a hard speaker to follow next part of the call will be quieter but i think equally as exciting to investors i m pleased to report a strong quarter and a number of positive developments in the business our gaap results were revenues of 405 million for the fourth quarter and 1 5 billion for the full year we generated basic and diluted gaap loss per share of 0 16 in the fourth quarter and basic and diluted loss per share of 0 53 for the full year both driven by acquisition related expenses as a reminder our 2019 results included only 10 months of itg itg transaction closed on march 1 of this year removing one time integration costs and non cash items normalized adjusted earnings per share was 0 27 for the fourth quarter and 0 96 for the full year total dividend for the year was also 0 96 per share adjusted net trading income anti which is our trading gains net of direct trading expenses was 257 million for the quarter or 4 1 million per day which is 5 better than the prior quarter in unique market conditions as we recently reported the first quarter of this year was off to a strong start with anti for january estimated between 100 million and 105 million for the full year our execution services segment comprised one third of total anti as compared to 9 5 for prior year this shift was in great part due to the acquisition of itg which diversified our revenues while leveraging our core technology as doug mentioned the fourth quarter demonstrated the leverage and ongoing improvements in our efficiency a 5 increase in anti coupled with decreases in operating expenses and financing costs yielded 29 increase in normalized eps from 0 21 in the third quarter to 0 27 in the fourth quarter a good story this quarter were improvements in our financing costs in the past three weeks we took the advantage of favorable market conditions last week we launched and priced the refinancing of our term loan our 1 925 billion of term loan debt was reduced by reduced 0 50 lower from libor plus 350 basis points to libor plus 300 basis points we paid 1a s issuer discount for only 12 5 basis points in conjunction with the repricing moody s issued a corporate family rating for virtu which was a notch higher than the existing term loan issuer rating while reaffirming the issuer rating the corporate family rating reflects virtu s quoting moody s franchise as a technology driven provider of market making and related execution services etc we are pleased to have this rating in addition at the end of january we did a fixed to floating interest rate swap to lock in a lower interest rate for five years on 1 billion of our term loan the fixed to floating libor sprout was in addition to the 525 million swap we did effective beginning in the fourth quarter concurrent with the conversion of 6 75 senior secured notes to an upsized term loan and a subsequent pay down of net 25 million of the term loan cumulatively we paid down 75 million of term loan since the itg acquisition as a result of these actions as you can see on slide 19 we will pay a fixed effective rate of 4 3 for five years on 1 5 billion of our debt the remaining 400 million of the outstanding term loan will remain floating and indexed to libor but at a spread that is now 50 basis points less as we reported last night and doug mentioned earlier cumulatively the result of the new financing transactions undertaken in the past two quarters and debt pay down yielded a total of 46 million in annual interest expense reductions or approximately 43 lower annual interest expense run rate these savings amount to approximately 0 10 per share in our earnings for convenience on slide 20 we added a recap of the key terms and covenants of our term loan some investors had questions on this please note that there are no ongoing leverage covenants or interest coverage covenants on this loan okay switching to expense synergies our integration with itg is proceeding well as can be seen on slide 21 through the fourth quarter we realized 137 million of synergies slightly above our original total synergies target of 133 million but we are not done we are on track to reach the higher end of the increased synergies guidance of 182 million by the end of 2020 this would put us on an operating expense run rate of 155 million per quarter compared to a pre merger combined run rate for virtu and itg of 200 million for the quarter the 155 million per quarter is an average run rate for the year we expect continuous improvements throughout the year with the last quarter of this year or the exit quarter expenses being lower than average annualized we expect our total adjusted operating expenses to be 620 million this year down 22 7 from 802 million spent by virtu and itg in 2018 last full year before the merger and this yields 182 million of savings that i mentioned a couple of minutes ago to wrap up for your convenience on slide 23 and 44 in the earning supplement we presented a gaap p l in order to show direct expenses below corresponding revenues to better show adjusted net trading income which is a key measure we use to track our business we ve then showed the rest of the gaap p l then we layer in ebit ebitda and adjusted net income and adjusted eps to give you a concurrent view of these key measures we present these measures we presented these measures in the past but we think this play out is easier to follow and as part of our efforts to make virtu easier toward the step in the next few months we will start publishing monthly data to provide you the investors view into our monthly market making activity and we will plan to introduce notes of our key developments in our business with these releases finally we declared customer s a 0 24 dividend for the quarter which will be paid on march 13 now i would like to turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers thank you questions and answers operator and your first question comes from rich repetto with piper sandler richard repetto sandler o neil analyst yeah good morning doug and good morning alex i guess the first question is on the market making results doug and slide 13 which shows the rule 605 the marketable volume i guess it seems like it s highly correlated with your results showing volume and market share improvement from 2q and i guess could you go a little bit deeper on what might be the drivers of that and then i know we get some other extraneous factors like the zero commissions and how sustainable is it going forward i guess douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah thanks good question so a couple of things one i ve always said on these calls and i ve said in my investor rounds that market share is not to be all end all market share with profitability is the be all end all so we could have a significantly larger market share across the various asset classes and geographies in which we participate that would entitle tightening bid offer spreads and property and liquidity at a price that s not ultimately profitable to the firm we think we can do that very well and better than competitors because we ve got a scaled and fixed cost plan etc etc you guys know the story obviously us equities is our largest asset class it s the largest asset class in the world so we spend a lot of time iterating on it and improving within us equities our customer facing segment or the rule 605 segment is a significant portion of our business it s what we acquired as part of the knight transaction and as we ve said many times on these calls and in sessions with investors we spent a lot of time investing in one replatforming those strategies and migrating them to virtu technology and some of the virtu post trade analytical solutions we think that helped the trading and then as well constantly iterating on the strategies to make them better to more performance and give a better result to our end users in the form of price improvement but also enable the firm to be profitable as part of that obviously we re competing with great firms to get market share from the 200 odd retail brokers so if we can do that in a profitable way we ll do that and think of that as same store sales part of the strength of the combination of virtu is our ability to internalize a lot of net flow across desks and across asset classes we ve got a lot of non customer market making businesses once we ve internalized that order it s we can deal with it as we choose because we ve given the customer a price so those are the kind of antecedents if you will and the rationale for the combination of the business and so we ve done better internally by investing certainly from a macro perspective rich and you hit on it the implementation by the large retail brokers of zero commissions has driven more retail volumes so retail volume overall was up and that benefits the firm because that s more of an addressable marketplace the other significant part of a zero commission world is flow segmentation so when you have brokers now that are not getting paid on a per trade basis their interests are 100 aligned with the market maker not just virtu but our competitors to segment flow which may be more toxic maybe more professional in nature and candidly more difficult for a market maker to handle we don t have any magic elixir around large correlated orders that really are more institutional in nature than retail and so when you align the interest of the retail broker with the market maker you can have a better performance we can allocate our price improvement dollars more adroitly to real through retail orders that are deserving of those dollars and not get run over frankly by orders that may come through a retail pipe but look feel and smell an awful lot like an institutional order so that s a long winded answer to your question of the various inputs that led to a better performance and that has continued in the first quarter rule 605 volumes are all public you can see that the zero commission phenomena has driven more interest some of that also is when you see stocks like tesla that retail in particular is very interested in you ll see a spike in activity richard repetto sandler o neil analyst thanks that s helpful on the segmented flow i guess my one follow up would be on the expense side alex you talked about glad you pointed to the very low end of the expense range high end of the synergy range but as and you talked about an exit quarter that was low because if you look at the quarter the 159 million of adjusted expenses so that s only slightly 16 million higher than that 620 million and but you did say it was a quarter that exit low so can you just talk about what the incremental expenses that are coming out whether it be i guess from itg in 2020 and how the fourth quarter might be an exiting low quarter alex ioffe executive vice president and chief financial officer right thank you rich so we expect to make improvements throughout the year which is why i referred to the exit quarter being lower for example communications and data expenses we expect a meaningful amount of savings as a final run rate at the end of this year but we re layering in these savings or expectation of these savings across the year 3 first quarter 5 next quarter and so forth similarly we find ourselves an accidental landlord as a result of two acquisitions so we have quite a few office spaces that we no longer need but have to rent out that takes time and that gets layered into the results across the year and there are other similar examples richard repetto sandler o neil analyst okay all right that s helpful thanks alex alex ioffe executive vice president and chief financial officer yup operator your next question comes from ken worthington with jpmorgan jenny nie jp morgan analyst hi good morning this is actually jenny nie filling in for ken worthington i m wondering maybe more comments on the competitive landscape we are seeing more electronic market makers and high frequency trading firms reducing staff in light of the really challenging market conditions given low volatility does this at all change your competitive landscape and where do you see competition going forward thanks a lot douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah thank you for your question yeah i mean really what you re seeing playing out is what we have been talking about really since we went public which is the virtu story it s all around scale when vinnie and i envisioned this firm a dozen years ago the mantra was get big and be multi asset class and multi geographic as quickly and as a low cost manner in which you can because we recognized that bid offer spreads were going to collapse we weren t thinking about commission wallets but commission wallets we re going to compress and so we built a very large fixed cost plant a technological company a financial technology company that can process a lot of widgets across asset classes and geographies right we did that on purpose because if you re only focused in a single asset class or if you re waiting for volatility or if you have a quant strategy that s working in a particular marketplace those things are going to ebb and flow but ultimately your costs are going to continue to get to increase look at what the exchanges are doing look at the need to invest in new technologies around microwave etc and so if you don t have that global scale if you re not truly a multi asset class you re very strategically limited in what you can do and so you ve seen i m not going to comment on specific firms because i have no information other than what i read in the paper the same way you do but if you look at a firm that is limited only to us equities or a firm that s focused on fixed income or just fx or limited only to the united states i would argue that they re very strategically challenged over the next three to five years and scale in firms like virtu and there are other firms that get this mantra as well firms like virtu are not only going to be the survivors but we re going to be we re going to prosper because we ve built this fixed cost plant we have always always managed it four times of a famine and when there s times of feast you see the outsized returns that we can generate and as alex just mentioned regardless of what 2020 brings in terms of opportunity set on the revenue side i can promise you that there s one thing that we control with costs and we will exit 2020 with a significantly lower cost base than when we entered it and all of those incremental dollars will provide significant operating leverage and operating scale to our model so that s really what you re seeing that theme will continue because the world is just getting more and more competitive and you need to continue to invest in these new technologies which aren t cheap jenny nie jp morgan analyst thanks a lot douglas cifu chief executive officer thank you operator and your next question comes from dan fannon with jefferies dan fannon jefferies llc analyst thanks good morning so i guess my first question is on options curious as to kind of what s changed to allow you to grow at the rate you are is it more just we obviously know industry volumes are up but you re obviously participating in that more so than a year ago douglas cifu chief executive officer no i mean dan that s a great question i think it s really two things one is as i just mentioned the scale of the firm we are global and so we are in all these different marketplaces but more importantly we invested in the last 18 to 24 months in a scalable options architecture transacting and being a market maker in a quote based as opposed to an order based marketplace is very very different and so we got to take our architecture which is really geared more toward the order based environment i e the equities markets of the world and the future markets of the world and transform that into a truly scaled options capable firm we have a lot of competitors that have years and years of a head start and so we re playing a little bit of catch up but most importantly we have the scale so we have the low latency connectivity that one needs between chicago and new york we have the low latency connectivity around europe and in asia in the korean market we re connected to all these places so the incremental cost of us getting into these various options markets around the world is frankly de minimis once we have the technological footprint so we made that investment over the last two years we feel very good about where we are from a technology perspective we know that we are ahead of the pack when it comes to latency and risk management and cost of execution so now it s just a question of having the right personnel rolling out these strategies to the options market which is not an easy surface trick in and of itself but i m very very optimistic that we can grow this business organically dan fannon jefferies llc analyst got it and then just to follow up i just want to clarify on the expense guidance obviously the slide says 620 million to 650 million but i think for prepared comments you said 620 million is the target at the low end douglas cifu chief executive officer that s right yes dan fannon jefferies llc analyst okay great thank you douglas cifu chief executive officer thanks dan operator and your next question comes from ken hill with rosenblatt ken hill rosenblatt analyst hi good morning just had a question so on the preliminary results you guys kind of mapped out the adjusted net trading income for january at 100 million to 105 million i was hoping you could parse apart maybe what parts of that were related to some of the volatility or and what was kind of maybe more of a kind of ongoing portion of your business and the run rate moving forward and then also got to ask you could you provide any color on the february activity through the first part of the month here douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah yeah well look i mean it s always difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff right i mean clearly volumes in 2020 are higher than volumes for the certainly for the fourth quarter and for the vast majority of 2019 and that helps us i would comment and note however that realized volatility has not significantly spiked you would think given the macro events out there with this horrible virus that s circumnavigating the world etc that you would see a spike a significant spike in realized volatile you ve seen some of it but it hasn t been as dramatic as one would think and so i m very bullish on our performance we continue to do well in global equities and in the other asset classes the execution services business has seen an uptake an uptick excuse me a lot of that is volume driven and i did say so that s kind of the color i can give you there obviously the quarter is still has about 35 ish or so trading days to go so i don t want to prognosticate it too much on where it s going to end up i did say in my prepared remarks that february has continued the pace of january which is good for us to see but again it s still less than half of the way through the quarter but i m very optimistic and bullish about our performance i think 2020 because of all these macro events we ve got us election going on we ve had this contagion issue and it just seems like there s going to be more volume and volatility for the first time in europe we had a week where the notional turnover was more than 30 billion i thought europe had forgotten how to trade for a while so you re seeing glimmers of a resurgence of a marketplace coupled with our organic growth and our better performance really that s and our reduction in cost that s the multiplier effect from the virtu model ken hill rosenblatt analyst got it thanks for the color there just had one also on kind of capital with the refinancing complete i know you mentioned some changes in covenants going forward with leverage ratios can you talk about the capital priorities and maybe any additional appetite for kind of acquisitions in the space right now douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah just for clarity there were no covenant changes ok i think there was confusion i ll put it nicely from the last call that somehow virtu had maintenance covenants we do not have and have never had any maintenance covenants so the maintenance the leverage targets that i annunciated are just that they re just targets they re just targets there s zero financial exposure if you will to virtu the loans are extended to 2026 right we just repriced them again reduced our interest burden by 26 million in the last six months so from a capital structure perspective this firm is in great shape that being said as historically we did in the knight transaction and we announced when we bought itg we thought they were 125 million of capital synergies we ve already paid back 75 million from the itg transaction you can look at our balance sheet which we put out today there was a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the year a good chunk of that is excess and as we continue to combine broker dealers from a regulatory perspective both here and abroad we will free up that cash and pay back term debt i m not a guy that likes to have lot of debt against the company but given our performance and given the friendliness if you will of the fixed income market i feel very very confident about our capital structure alex i don t know if you want to add anything alex ioffe executive vice president and chief financial officer that s pretty much it douglas cifu chief executive officer okay thanks ken hill rosenblatt analyst okay thanks thanks for taking my questions douglas cifu chief executive officer thank you operator and your next question comes from alex kramm with ubs alex kramm ubs analyst hey good morning everyone just wanted to ask the january february first quarter question a little bit different can you maybe just talk about how the mix may have changed a little bit or if it s basically consistent with the fourth quarter and i m asking for example because energy volumes have been really rock solid in the first quarter so far and i know that s historically been an area where you ve made a lot of money so just curious if you can give us a little bit more color on maybe some of the other businesses and how they re trending douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah this is i guess this is the problem with giving january numbers because we were doing a financing i give a little bit you guys always want more right alex look i mean alex kramm ubs analyst always douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah exactly exactly and i appreciate you got a job to do i get it i get it look i mean our market making business was up substantially from the fourth quarter not surprisingly and a lot of that is still driven by us equities because that s a large portion of the marketplace you can see what the 605 volumes are it s no surprise it will be no surprise to you that the performance in that segment of our business continues to proceed i think i ll highlight again our european equities business post mifid ii it was really kind of kick in the teeth having dark pools and broker crossing networks effectively being outlawed by mifid ii and so we see we continue to see growth and an uptick there on the execution services side i commented before that a lot of that is volume driven right and europe really had a down year last year in terms of volumes that really impacted particularly the historical itg business which was very dependent on european buys particularly in our alert product in europe and so you ve seen a bit of resurgence there as european volumes again kicked back to more than 30 billion notional turnover per day so and as well asia alert has experienced an uptick as well so i think it s really all of those things again the quarter is less than halfway done so i don t really want to comment more on it i just wanted to give you guys a sense because we had disclosed january as part of our refinancing efforts that we are seeing a resurgence of opportunity set across the market and i think look at some point we re going to soon as i ve mentioned we re going to be putting out monthly revenue capture in index if you will that is bespoke of virtu to give you guys a little more insight into the business alex is working on that and once we get our 10 k filed we ll sit down with you guys and kind of take you through that so we could give a little more clarity into how we re performing month to month and you can see the capture ratios and then you can ask me all kinds of great questions going forward alex kramm ubs analyst all right fair enough and then i guess secondly to stay consistent with always wanting more you have that impressive etf slide obviously in your deck but the one thing that s missing is any sort of revenue indication so i assume it s pretty small still but maybe you can just tell us how much roughly this business is contributing today to the overall business and then maybe more importantly like how do you view the total addressable market there maybe in terms of revenues and how you really think you re going to be gaining share is it just to being better than others in terms of technology is it being aggressive on price so a little bit more color would be helpful thank you douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah sure i mean look in fairness when you have a company that s got more than 1 billion in net revenues things are going to look small in comparison i m very proud of the business it is a single digit percentage of what we do right so it s an eight figure business and it grew 40 last year it was an eight figure business the year before right so it s not an insignificant business in this grand scheme of things it s virtu s style and that it s not overstaffed and it s scaled and use of technology and good risk management and all those kind of things and i m a big believer in the gross the growth excuse me of passive products around the world and we ve been a valued partner frankly with every of every etf issuer there is out there and so the addressable market is large you re very familiar with it there is a number of competitors out there and if you look at the total addressable market of being andrew is telling me somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 billion to 30 billion globally trillion excuse me during the year we around 10 of that pass through the virtu pipes either on a screen or through an rfq system and whatnot so it s really building up that capability we ve never been an rfq or block style market maker at legacy virtu knight never really did it in any meaningful way outside of the united states and so we re very confident that we ve built a product suite in the united states that s very successful the revenue number i gave you is from before is 99 us and as we move that product to europe and to asia in a virtu style way i e with just a handful of people we think we can be competitive for two reasons one we have the lowest fixed cost plant out there and two thanks to our great friends at itg in europe and in asia and here in the united states we have an unbelievable distribution network we have very very talented itg former itg employees in the us asia and in europe in particular that have real subject matter expertise in the etp market and have real distribution our friends at itg were as i like to refer to them as sort of like a human rfq machine before virtu got involved with them they had a significant etf business i give them all the credit in the world without a principal trading capability so marrying virtu s principal trading capability with the trusted distribution capabilities and network that the talented people had at itg and i ve neglected to include canada as well it would be in canada where there s a significant etf market and itg previously had been a bit of a market maker up in canada that s a recipe for success so combining the technology and risk management of virtu with the acumen around actually how to trade blocks and respond to rfqs that knight brought and marry that with the distribution of itg i think that s the game winning formula alex kramm ubs analyst all right thanks for the additional color douglas cifu chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from kaimon chung with evercore kaimon chung evercore isi analyst hi so appreciate your comments on the performance of global ficc maybe i m just looking to get a little more color just what drove the softness there particularly maybe provide any color on the progress with the cross sell opportunities with marketaxess such as like your enav product i know you touched upon your etf offering douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah i m sorry the first part of the question was about global ficc and the performance in the fourth quarter is that what you re asking kaimon chung evercore isi analyst yeah and then just maybe just an updated progress with of the cross sell opportunities there with your marketaxess partnership douglas cifu chief executive officer sure sure got it yes so look i mean the fourth quarter was disappointing in terms of the performance of global ficc however if you look at the indices right particularly around volatility it was the opportunity set was very muted to put it mildly i mean the i think this is someone told me this is the lowest volatility that one has ever seen in the fx market in something like 20 years in the fourth quarter so we re not alone in that paradox of trying to squeeze juice out of a lemon that unfortunately was not a very robust lemon in the fourth quarter so i think that s a little bit in the marketplace look but again i come back to hey we re a scaled very efficient market maker so our fx business although it struggled it s got a dozen people in it globally so we still if you will a very large contributor to the bottom line here in terms of new products and the enav product in particular the sales effort there has been nothing short of terrific our friends at marketaxess are very enthusiastic about it i think it s a unique product because frankly from what i m told that no one else really has something that is as real time and robust and so the marketaxess virtu partnership is working out to be everything i thought it was going to be kaimon chung evercore isi analyst cool and then just maybe shifting gears i just wanted to get your thoughts on things like fractional shares and direct indexing and how you foresee that impacting the business longer term douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah good question so look i mean all of these things are intended to drive more participation into the capital markets right and we encourage those things as long as they re done in a thoughtful transparent way where investors know where they re getting themselves into so fractional shares is obviously a symptom of a marketplace we have companies that are not doing stock splits right and people find it challenging to come up with a couple of thousand dollars to buy amazon that type of thing so that s obviously a good incentive from our perspective right because it s driving new participants into a marketplace where hopefully they will get experience and then become more significant participants in the marketplace those are all good things more perspective so we work very very closely with our retail partners to ensure that they have a product that they can offer to their end users that is as transparent and efficient as possible so that these new participants can enter into the marketplace in a way that they feel good about so all of those initiatives are ultimately products that we work with our retail partners to help fashion and ultimately we think are beneficial for our business kaimon chung evercore isi analyst thank you douglas cifu chief executive officer thank you operator next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs sheriq goldman sachs analyst hi this is sheriq filling in for alex can you talk about the m a opportunities that you re seeing and where and what you ve been focused is it more on the market making side or is it on the agency side douglas cifu chief executive officer thank you yes so obviously we re a public company this is an fd compliant forum so there are no plans or nothing pending right now i think look what i ve said in prior calls is i m very comfortable where the firm is right now we have a large suite of products on the institutional side we cover everything from pre trade to post trade and everything in between other than exchange and we own a piece of an exchange as you guys know on the market making side we re global and multi asset class and we firmly believe we can get into every other asset class we want to be in an organic fashion we re doing that in fixed income we re doing it in options if there is an opportunity to accelerate that growth by doing something that is strategic and accretive right to my shareholders i ll always look at it so not surprisingly because we have a currency and we have a track record of execution and mr rosenthal has joined us for this is one of his purposes and mandates here we ve been inundated with opportunities and we will continue to be inundated with opportunities because the world is getting a lot more efficient and as i was asked in the prior question there are firms that will are struggling and will continue to struggle again we re not going to do anything that we don t feel really good about that is not keenly additive and strategic to what we re trying to do and if not either immediately or very imminently accretive to our shareholders we don t need to do anything right so we re going to be an opportunistic purchaser i m a big believer in doing that because i think we can create a lot of value for our shareholders but ultimately that s the beginning middle and end of every discussion how does this benefit virtu how is it going to make us a better firm does it provide us an opportunity set we otherwise would have available to us and from a financial perspective is it accretive to our results and we have the capacity to do this we have a currency and we ve got borrowing capacity to do this and that s the important mandate for our firm sheriq goldman sachs analyst thank you operator and your last question comes from chris allen with compass point chris allen compass point analyst good morning guys i wanted to drill into a little bit those share gains in the 605 i was wondering if you were doing anything differently to gain incremental share or competitors were pulling back and whether you think that was due to the market environment or something specifically from a competitive perspective douglas cifu chief executive officer yeah it s a good question i mean it s always hard chris to say again is it a wheat or chaff right is it the fact that we ve gotten better right and so we can sustain a more acute price improvement schedule i e we re collapsing the bid offer more or is it a competitor frankly just has had enough because they re losing money in providing this price improvement i think it s probably both i want to repeat again for the nth time this is a very competitive very difficult business to be in if you re not scaled if you don t have the benefit of 20 years of knight capital and if you don t have a low latency very adroit technology platform you can t be in this business we are providing real price improvement right better than the national best bid offer to like 99 ish or so of the orders that we that come to virtu and then i ll have the final numbers but we provided somewhere in the zip code of 350 million or more of price improvement in 2019 in 2018 that was 433 million so anybody that thinks that these orders come in and we just kind of clip 0 01 on them is spending way too much time on twitter right this is a very very difficult business to be in and so yeah competitors ebb and flow but ultimately because we re a scaled firm that s multi asset class that can internalize a lot of this and have great people and great models and now great financial technology we think that ultimately scale begets scale and we re going to continue to be a winner in this space chris allen compass point analyst thanks and just one quick follow up i was just wondering if there s any kind of market anomalies that you guys have been benefiting from recently i m thinking specifically about tesla which you mentioned earlier i know you guys are set up to take advantage of these anomalies i was just wondering again getting back to the question of sustainability moving forward douglas cifu chief executive officer no i mean i wouldn t call tesla market i mean it trades the way it trades right i don t comment on individual stocks and i have no frankly clue why it trades the way it does i m a micro market structure person i think people overstate oh my god that s great because tesla was trading when it has really sharp moves like that it s not the easiest thing in the world for a market maker to handle right i mean again we don t have a magic elixir around predicting the direction of markets it s a very very challenging thing to do so there are plenty of times where we might have a portfolio that s longs something and the stock moves the other way and we lose a whole bunch of money right so it s not like a single instrument ends up being a significant part of what we do it s really the full compendium of all those instruments the reason i mentioned tesla is because it did drive a significant amount of volume that s really the key this firm is really about spread capture right and about volume and then volatility so when there s more volume when i look on the screen and we print a 7 4 billion share day or an 8 billion a day and europe is doing 32 billion god forbid 38 billion notional maybe it will hit 40 billion again right that s a good thing ultimately for the firm and we ve invested a lot of money time and resource over the last three years to ensure that we continue to get better qualitatively and then quantitatively that we re there to capture this volatility and volume as it appears episodically around the globe chris allen compass point analyst thanks guys operator and there are no more questions at this time douglas cifu chief executive officer all right i want to thank everybody for their participation i would be remiss if i did not thank andrew smith for his many dedicated years in investor relations he s now been taken over by deborah who s now going to be providing that but andrew is still with the firm still deals a lot of market structure and runs a lot of products for us so thank you andrew and i look forward to talking with you guys next quarter thank you alex ioffe executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator duration 63

1 8 billion in us taxpayer funds that quietly went missing back in 2014 and most likely ended up in the offshore bank account of some ukrainian oligarch in the last days of the obama administration then vice president joe biden took a swan song trip to ukraine a notoriously corrupt country where he had been the administration s point person on the eve of this trip the country announced it would end a criminal investigation into an infamous company connected to the loss of 1 8 billion in aid funding a company whose board of directors included biden s son hunter tonight around at 2 00 am an unregistered transport plane took off took off from boryspil airport according to boryspil staff prior to the plane s appearance four trucks and two cargo minibuses arrived at the airport all with their license plates missing fifteen people in black uniforms masks and body armor stepped out some armed with machine guns these people loaded the plane with more than forty heavy boxes after this several mysterious men arrived and also entered the plane the loading was carried out in a hurry after unloading the plateless cars immediately left the runway and the plane took off on an emergency basis airport officials who saw this mysterious special operation immediately notified the administration of the airport which however strongly advised them not to meddle in other people s business later the editors were called by one of the senior officials of the former ministry of income and fees who reported that according to him tonight on the orders of one of the new leaders of ukraine all the gold reserves of the ukraine were taken to the united states according to official statistics the nbu the amount of gold in the vaults should be eight times more than is actually in stock at the beginning of this month the volume of gold was about 1 billion or 8 of the total gold reserves now this is just one percent according to recent data the value of ukraine gold should be 988 7 million that is the value of gold proportion of gold in gold reserves is 8 if you believe gontareva it turns out there is a mere 123 6 million in gold remaining the figure is fantastic considering that the amount of gold at the end of february when the new authorities have already taken key positions was 1 8 billion or 12 of the reserves in other words since the beginning of the year gold reserves dropped almost 16 times gold stock in february were approximately 21 tons of gold the presence of which was once proudly reported by sergei arbuzov who led the nbu in 2010 2012 so what happened to 20 8 tons of gold explaining the dramatic reduction in the context of the hryvnia devaluation through gold sales is impossible after all 92 of the reserves of the national bank is in the form of a foreign currency that is much easier to use to maintain hryvnia levels and cover current liabilities besides since march the international price of gold has plummeted selling gold under such circumstances is a crime in fact it would be more expedient to increase gold reserves through currency conversion in precious metals but apparently the result is not due to someone s negligence or carelessness the gold reserve has been actively carted out of the country as a result of the very vague economic and political prospects of ukraine something similar happened to the gold reserves of the ussr when the gorbachev elite realized that perestroika is leading the country to the abyss gold simply disappeared in an unknown direction now that the trump impeachment farce is finally over vindicating the president and in the process for the first time boosting the president s approval rating higher than where obama was at this time in his first term much to the embarrassment of nancy pelosi whose impeachment gambit has backfired spectacularly just as nancy knew it would and is why she delayed triggering it until a critical mass of ultra left wing demands in congress made it impossible for her to ignore any longer the democrats great diversion from trump s core question did the bidens willfully engage in and benefit from corruption in the ukraine corruption which may have been enabled and facilitated by billions in taxpayer funds originating from the obama administration no less is over however while trump has finally moved on beyond what in retrospect was and implemented by congressional democrats who are now watching the chances of the democratic party winning the 2020 presidential election melt before their eyes some long overdue questions surrounding the bidens involvement in one of the world s most corrupt nations according to the world economic forum especially around the time of the 2014 presidential coup and the months immediately following are about to be asked and haunt joe biden and his son like a very angry and vengeful ghost only this time there will be no trump impeachment to distract from revealing the shocking answers needless to say we are delighted by this outcome because as regular readers will recall there are many unanswered questions that emerged back in 2014 some from following the money both in and out of ukraine and some from followingbut before we get there first we need to a rather lengthy detour into the history of ukraine corruption since the february 2014 euromadian revolution for conveniently pj media s senior editor tyler o neill did just that almost two years ago in march 2018 here s what he said back then together with some additions from zh peter schweizer revealed the former vice president s role in his new book secret empires how the american political class hides corruption and enriches family and friends secretary of state john kerry announced the u s support for ukraine s nationalist government in march 2014 a month after a mass uprising pushed pro russian president viktor yanukovych out of office and inspired a corresponding pro russian uprising in the east it was also at this time that a leaked recording between us assistant secretary of state victoria fuck the eu nuland and the us envoy to the ukraine geoffrey pyatt emerged a clip which as the ft said then could also bolster that the protests that erupted against ukraine s president viktor yanukovich last november are being funded and orchestrated by the us in other words the clip confirmed that the us was masterminding the entire euromaidan process all along and deciding who should be in ukraine s next government in short finally it was also the time that biden became the obama administration s point person for the country on april 16 2014 shortly after the february 2014 ukrainian revolution which culminated with the overthrow of democratically elected president yanukovich biden met with devon archer a former star fundraiser for john kerry s 2004 presidential run and business partner in rosemont capital with biden s son hunter federal agents would later arrest archer in may 2016 for defrauding a native american tribe less than a week later april 22 came an announcement that archer had joined the board of burisma a secretive ukrainian natural gas company on may 13 hunter biden would also join the company s board on the day before archer s hiring april 21 the vice president landed in kiev for high level meetings with ukrainian officials he spearheaded the effort to invest 1 billion from the u s and the international monetary fund imf into ukraine schweizer notes the choice of hunter biden to handle transparency and corporate governance of burisma is curious because biden had little if any experience in ukrainian law or professional legal counsel period furthermore hunter biden seemed undeterred by the fact that as he was joining the burisma board the british government s serious fraud office sfo was seizing 23 million from zlochevsky s bank accounts furthermore a year after biden joined the firm experienced industry observers warned investors that burisma was still a company to be avoided on the other hand ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world out of 148 nations studied by the world economic forum ukraine ranks 143 for property rights 130 for irregular payments and bribes 133 for favoritism in decisions of government officials and 146 for protection of minority shareholders interests two major figures in this corruption feature prominently in biden s ukraine investment he also had a flare for lavishness running a super exclusive fashion boutique named after himself burisma s major subsidiaries ended up sharing the same business address as the natural gas firm controlled by ukrainian oligarch ihor kolomoisky he controlled the country s largest financial institution privatbank through which the ukrainian military and government workers got paid he also owned media companies and airlines in violation of ukraine law he maintained ukrainian israeli and cypriot passports rival oligarchs have sued him for alleged involvement in murders and beheadings related to a business deal he also allegedly used hired rowdies armed with baseball bats iron bars gas and rubber bullet pistols and chainsaws to take over a steel plant in 2006 for these and other reasons the u s government placed kolomoisky on its visa ban list prohibiting him from entering the country legally according to a follow up report in 2016 today the oligarch mainly resides in switzerland he spends much time in the united states and is getting less and less involved in the ukrainian affairs archer and the younger biden brought other benefits to burisma however archer represented the company at the louisiana gulf coast oil exposition in 2015 biden addressed the energy security for the future conference in monaco the vice president s son brought much needed legitimacy to the shoddy gas company less than a month after archer joined burisma s board the company hired another kerry lackey david leiter as a lobbyist in washington d c he successfully lobbied for more aid to the country and would disappear according to the ukrainian anti corruption watchdog nashi groshi this transaction of 1 8 billion with the help of fake contracts was simply an asset siphoning operation what is even more fascinating is that in the chaos following the february 2014 revolution ukraine appears to have embezzled money from none other than the imf whose biggest source of funds is the us as german newspaper deutsche wirtshafts nachrichten reported as the german publication went on to add in april 2014 3 2 billion was immediately disbursed to ukraine and over the following five months another 4 5 billion was disbursed to the ukrainian central bank in order to stabilize the country s financial system the money should have been used to stabilize the country s ailing banks but 1 8 billion disappeared down murky channels dwn wrote dwn also reported that according to the imf in january 2015 the equity ratio of ukraine s banking system had dropped to 13 8 percent from 15 9 percent in late june 2014 by february 2015 even privatbank had to be saved from bankruptcy and was given a 62 million euro two year loan from the central bank so where have the imf s billions gone the racket executed by kolomoiski s privatbank was first uncovered by the ukrainian anti corruption initiative nashi groshi meaning our money in ukrainian according to nashi groshi s investigations the products were then used as collateral for the loans taken out from privatbank however the overseas suppliers never delivered the goods and the 42 companies took legal action in court in dnipropetrovsk demanding reimbursement for payments made for the goods and the termination of the loans from privatbank the court s ruling was the same for all 42 companies the foreign suppliers should return the money but the credit agreement with privatbank remains in place explained journalist lesya ivanovna of nashi groshi then in march 2015 kolomoiski whom some have described as the tony soprano of ukraine and increasingly a pariah in the country that made him a billionaire was dismissed from his position as governor of dnipropetrovsk after a power struggle with ukrainian president petro poroshenko the fraud was carried out while he was governor of the region in east central ukraine officially it now looks like as if the bank has the products but in reality they were never delivered said ivanovna such business practices which earned kolomoskyi a fortune estimated by forbes in march 2012 to be 3 billion were known to investigators beyond ukraine s borders kolomoiski was once banned from entering the us due to suspicions of connections with international organized crime but then biden s involvement quietly lifted the visa ban despite these suspicions after he fled ukraine in early 2015 not long after kolomoiski fled ukraine in december 2016 ukraine s government nationalize his privatbank in order to shore up ukrainians savings a ukrainian lawmaker called it the greatest robbery of ukraine s state budget of the millennium a few months earlier in february 2016 the government seized burisma founder zlochevsky s assets and placed him on ukraine s wanted list the ukrainian prosecutor general s office seized burisma s gas wells devon archer left the scandal plagued company at the end of 2016 although a clueless hunter biden remained on the board through october 2019 well after his presence there sparked the biggest political scandal since the bill clinton impeachment providing legal assistance in exchange for millions of dollars received from the gas giant archer and biden have not been required to disclose their compensation from burisma but bowling green state university professor oliver boyd barrett wrote potentially the biden family could become billionaires so did joe biden get burisma off the hook for 1 8 billion in lost aid funding did he or his son get kolomoisky off the visa ban list to be sure many questions still remain and were all conveniently swept under the rug over the faux outrage over the trump impeachment farce butincidentally anyone who is confused by the narrative above and how 1 8 billion in taxpayer dollars disappeared in ukraine starting in september 2014 when the money was deposited in privatbank is encouraged to watch the following video by glenn beck who does a surprisingly good job at connecting the confusing dots behind what may be one of the greatest sovereign corruption and money heist stories in history the good news is that there are so many loose threads in this narrative that any real probe will have little difficulty in getting to the bottom of where and how the 1 8 billion in us taxpayer funding to ukraine disappeared and whether biden both father and son are indeed involved and just to help them out one place where any serious probe can start is with a story we wroteneedless to say there was no official confirmation of any of this taking place and in fact our report in which we mused if the price of ukraine s liberation was the handover of ukraine s gold to the fed led to the usual mainstream media mockery but then everything changed in november 2014 when in an interview on ukraine tv none other than theas ukraina reported at the time this stunning revelation means that not only has ukraine been quietly depleting its gold throughout the year but that the latest official number according to which ukraine gold was 8 times greater than the reported 1 was fabricated and that the real number is about 90 lower assuming gonaterva s admission was true it would imply that the official reserve data at the central bank was clearly fabricated prompting questions about just how long ago the actual gold displacement took place could it have been during a cold night in march when more than 40 heavy boxes full of gold were loaded up on the plane and flown off to an unknown destination in the us to help out in this puzzle we got some additional information from rusila which in nov 2014 reported that ukraine s gold reserves disappeared oddly enough there was no official gold reduction just prior to the time when victoria fuck the eu nuland was planning yanukovich s ouster and as shown above quite the contrary it is a little more odd that it was during the period when ukraine was supported by its western allies that several billion dollars worth of physical gold the people s gold just vaporized which brings us to the 1 8 billion question what happened to ukraine s gold becauseat this point there are certainly many pressing questions but one stands out was the real quid pro quo not one of trump holding up payments to kiev in exchange for a probe of biden which after reading all of the above is more than warranted but if the quo namely us support for regime change in ukraine and almost two billion in now missing taxpayer funds which ended up in an oligarch s bank and mysteriously vaporized but not before said oligarch hired the son of the us vice president wasn t the quid to some 40 tons of ukraine leaving forever to an unknown destination in the us we hope that trump s second term will provide ample time and opportunity to answer this critical question and just to set off investigators on the right track we believe that any investigation should begin with the former central bank head failing that one can always check the flight manifests and the cargo contents of all planes that left the ukraine and arrived in the us on march 7 2014 with a cargo consisting of billions of dollars in gold
new york over the last decade the world economy has experienced a steady build up of debt now amounting to 230 per cent of global gdp the last three waves of debt caused massive downturns in economies across the world the first of these happened in the early 1980s after a decade of low borrowing costs which enabled governments to expand their balance sheets considerably interest rates began to rise making debt service increasingly unsustainable mexico fell first informing the united states government and the international monetary fund in 1982 that it could no longer repay this had a domino effect with 16 latin american countries and 11 least developed countries outside the region ultimately rescheduling their debts in the 1990s interest rates were again low and global debt surged once more the crash came in 1997 when fast growing but financially vulnerable east asian economies including indonesia malaysia south korea and thailand experienced sharp growth slowdowns and plummeting exchange rates the effects reverberated worldwide but it is not only emerging economies that are vulnerable to such crashes as america s 2008 subprime mortgage crisis proved by the time people figured out what subprime meant the us investment bank lehman brothers had collapsed triggering the most severe crisis and recession since the great depression the world bank has just warned us that a fourth debt wave could dwarf the first three emerging economies which have amassed a record debt to gdp ratio of 170 per cent are particularly vulnerable as in the previous cases the debt wave has been facilitated by low interest rates there is reason for alarm once interest rates begin to rise and premia inevitably spike the mechanics of such crises are not well understood but a 1998 paper by stephen morris and hyun song shin on the mysterious origins of currency crises and how they are transmitted to other economies shows that a financial tsunami can make landfall far from its source how the source of financial trouble can vanish leaving others stranded was illustrated in the delightful short story rnam krttva by the celebrated twentieth century indian writer shibram chakraborty in the story which i translated into english and included in my book an economist s miscellany the desperate shibram asks an old school friend harsha to lend him 500 rupees 7 on a wednesday to be repaid the following saturday but shibram squanders the money so on saturday he has little choice but to ask another school friend gobar for a loan of 500 rupees to be repaid the next wednesday he uses the money to repay harsha but when wednesday rolls around he has no way of repaying gobar so reminding harsha of his excellent repayment record he borrows from him again this becomes a routine with shibram repeatedly borrowing from one friend to repay the other then shibram runs into both harsha and gobar one day at a crosswalk after a moment of anxiety he has an idea every wednesday he suggests harsha should give gobar 500 rupees and every saturday gobar should give the same amount to harsha shibram assures his former school friends that this will save him a lot of time and change nothing for them and he vanishes into kolkata s milling crowds so who are the likely harshas and gobars in today s debt wave according to the world bank they could be any country with domestic vulnerabilities a stretched fiscal balance sheet and a heavily indebted population there are several countries that fit this description and run the risk of being the conduit that carries the fourth debt wave to the world economy among advanced economies the united kingdom is an obvious candidate in 2019 the uk narrowly avoided a recession with a growth rate a shade above zero the weakest growth in a non recession period since 1945 the country is also about to undertake brexit conservatives in britain have promised that a tidal wave of business investment will follow this is unlikely if there is a tidal wave it will probably be one of debt instead among emerging economies india is especially vulnerable in the 1980s india s economy was fairly sheltered so the debt wave back then had little impact at the time of the east asian crisis in 1997 india had just begun to open up and it experienced some slowdown in growth by the time of the debt wave in 2008 the country had become globally integrated and was severely affected but its economy was strong and growing at nearly 10 per cent annually and it recovered within a year today india s economy is facing one of its deepest crises in the last 30 years with growth slowing sharply unemployment at a 45 year high close to zero export growth over the last six years and per capita consumption in the agricultural sector decreasing over the last five years add to this a deeply polarised political environment and it is little wonder that investor confidence is rapidly declining it is not too late for countries to build seawalls to protect against debt tsunamis while india s political problems will take time to solve the union budget to be presented on february 1 is an opportunity for preemptive action the fiscal deficit needs to be controlled in the medium term but the government would be wise to adopt expansionary fiscal policy now with money channeled into shoring up infrastructure and investment managed properly this can boost demand without increasing inflationary pressures and strengthen the economy in order to withstand a debt wave the country s leaders must seize this opportunity the alternative is to adopt the brace position kaushik basu former chief economist of the world bank and former chief economic adviser to the government of india is professor of economics at cornell university and non resident

executive officer thank you operator good morning everybody welcome to our earnings call and thank you for your interest in xpo i m joined here this morning by matt fassler our chief strategy officer and tavio headley our senior director of investor relations i m pleased to report that we delivered a solid full year performance capped by a strong fourth quarter i m particularly pleased that on a year over year basis our fourth quarter adjusted eps was up 56 coming in at 1 12 versus 0 72 last year and our adjusted ebitda was 432 million for the quarter up 14 from the prior year with margin up 170 basis points full year adjusted ebitda was up 7 to 1 67 billion we beat on free cash flow for the quarter at 221 million full year free cash flow was 628 million just above the midpoint of the higher guidance we issued in august in ltl we had the best fourth quarter adjusted operating ratio in our history coming in at 82 3 year over year this was an improvement of 500 basis points and excluding real estate it was an improvement of 150 basis points ltl yield excluding fuel remained strong up 3 1 year over year pricing on contract renewals was also strong at 3 4 our team in truck brokerage executed remarkably well in the quarter we re continuing to automate brokerage and improve productivity in the fourth quarter we grew volume 1 with nearly 20 fewer people excluding the downsizing of our largest customer volume was up 19 we ve been experiencing exponential growth in xpo connect our digital freight marketplace we exceeded our goal of 100 000 driver downloads of our drive xpo app in december in european transportation we generated low double digit organic revenue growth in the uk and high single digit organic revenue growth in spain this offset a mid single digit decline in france in logistics in the fourth quarter we achieved a double digit adjusted ebitda margin for the first time since 2015 we ve been laser focused on cost control and also exited some low margin business last week we announced we signed up a new customer waitrose one of the biggest supermarket chains in the uk this is one of the largest logistics contracts in our history we will be operating two critical logistics hubs for waitrose starting mid year and distributing an estimated 143 million cases of product annually we are proud that they chose us for our expertise in omnichannel distribution based on signed contracts and a strong pipeline we have excellent visibility into significant revenue growth into 2021 in our logistics segment to sum up the companywide results we delivered a good quarter and a good year despite a choppy macro we remain disciplined on cost and pricing and we continue to reap the benefits of our tech initiatives for 2020 we expect organic revenue growth of 3 to 5 adjusted ebitda growth of 7 to 10 and robust free cash flow in the range of 600 million to 700 million as you know on january 15 we announced we re exploring the sale or spin off of some of our business units as we said we re not considering the sale or spin of north american ltl this process is consistent with our long held priority of maximizing shareholder value we are proud of the outsized returns we ve already delivered for our shareholders but we continue to trade at a significant discount to the sum of our parts and to the valuation of our pure play peers the process is off to an excellent start but we have no updates to share with you on this call finally i want to welcome david wyshner who will become our new cfo on march 2 david is a fantastic hire his 28 year career includes 13 years of cfo experience with multibillion dollar public companies that completed major asset sales spin offs and acquisitions during his tenure you ll get to meet him on our next call with that i ll turn the presentation over to matt matt matthew fassler chief strategy officer thanks brad as i review the numbers you ll see that we re harnessing our tech driven initiatives in each business unit to drive solid results against a mixed macro backdrop i ll start by going through the fourth quarter numbers and our strategic focus by business unit we ll begin with our transportation segment in north american ltl we improved profitability despite softer demand growth in yield and pricing on new contracts reflected the rational market pricing we ve seen all year tonnage declined by 6 3 year over year due to softer results for many of our industrial customers this is consistent with the us industrial sector s performance in general by contrast most of the metrics related to volume for our customers and the consumer sector were steady our adjusted operating ratio improved by 500 basis points to 82 3 excluding gains on sale of real estate this year and last our adjusted or improved by 150 basis points to 85 8 as brad said it s our best fourth quarter adjusted or ever this strong performance was the result of steady yield improvement and tight cost control our optimization of pricing and labor using our proprietary technology also continues to contribute to these results within freight brokerage we increased volume while remaining disciplined on price our freight brokerage gross revenue declined by 12 year over year a slight improvement over q3 excluding the previously announced decrease in the brokerage business from our largest customer our underlying freight brokerage gross revenue fell 6 our net revenue margin eased across freight brokerage by 70 basis points to 17 9 as contractual rates declined and the spot market stabilized in truck brokerage specifically loads increased by 1 after declining 4 in q3 importantly excluding brokerage business with our largest customer our load count grew by 19 our xpo connect digital freight marketplace is giving our customers more visibility enhancing price discovery and contributing to our market share gains turning to our last mile operation revenue declined 24 year over year in the wake of the wind down of our postal injection business in q1 excluding postal injection growth in our core last mile heavy goods business accelerated to 7 we brought on new customers particularly through our hub network where our investment paid off through strong growth in volumes in its first full year net revenue margin in last mile increased sharply year over year this was primarily due to mix as we discontinued our postal injection business earlier in the year and as we increased margin for our core heavy goods business by almost 200 basis points we expect ongoing organic revenue growth for this line of business in 2020 in europe revenue declined by 1 7 in our transportation business during the quarter fx weighed on revenue by about 2 percentage points transportation revenue trends in europe measured in local currency were excellent in the uk and spain they were softer in france as social unrest emerged again late in the quarter we are the biggest ltl provider in france top 3 for dedicated truckload and ltl in the uk and a leader in european brokerage our competitive position in european transportation is strong and we re excited for our prospects across the region looking across our transportation segment overall revenue was down 8 3 but adjusted ebitda was up 12 5 and adjusted ebitda margin rose by 220 basis points to 11 8 driven by improved margins in north american ltl intermodal managed transportation and last mile turning to the logistics segment in north america our revenue declined 0 8 reflecting the downsizing of business with our largest customer which impacted revenue by about 3 and exiting of some lower margin sites growth in the consumer packaged goods aerospace and food and beverage sectors offset this decline in europe logistics revenue declined 2 5 fx had a negative impact of about 2 percentage points e commerce and chemicals were our strongest verticals in european logistics we continue to build on our market leading position as the largest outsourced provider of e fulfillment logistics in europe we re confident about contract logistics revenue trends during the second half of this year for a lot of reasons including the lapping of the downsizing of our largest customer recently signed new business our robust pipeline and the ramp up of previously signed contracts that have longer implementation lead times like our nestle warehouse of the future in the uk we see excellent visibility into 2021 and 2022 as well adjusted ebitda for logistics as a whole rose 28 year over year and adjusted ebitda margin rose to 10 4 our improved profitability reflects strong cost management including savings from recent restructurings and positive results from our technology initiatives xpo smart continues to deliver strong productivity gains in the us and we started to roll out more of these capabilities in europe we exercise pricing discipline as we seek to deliver profitable growth recall that increasing our european supply chain margins is one of our 10 profit levers we executed well in europe during peak and reduced the number of loss making sites also our xpo direct shared distribution platform is delivering better profitability giving more scale and the optimization of our linehaul model we are enthusiastic about the growth we re seeing from xpo direct it continues to offer enormous opportunities for new business and we re in active discussions with a compelling list of new customers we ended 2019 with a companywide sales pipeline that surpassed 4 billion in fact our pipeline exceeded 4 billion in every quarter of 2019 it rose 22 year over year and was up double digits in both transportation and logistics new business wins declined 7 year over year cyclically lower truckload market pricing put pressure on the dollar value of our brokerage new business won supply chain new business won increased year over year and we re starting to see the logjam associated with brexit in the uk clear up as customers get more clarity about the path forward our ltl new business won increased year on year for the eighth quarter in a row moving down the income statement interest expense rose to 74 million from 52 million a year ago this reflects our debt issuance earlier in the year to fund our share buyback program our gaap effective tax rate fell to 22 from 23 a year ago our weighted average diluted share count was 103 million at year end compared with 137 million shares a year ago the year over year decrease reflects our share buyback activity there was no meaningful change quarter to quarter as we didn t repurchase any shares in q4 our diluted earnings per share was 0 93 up 50 from 0 62 a year ago our adjusted diluted eps rose to 1 12 up 56 from 0 72 a year ago our buyback activity was 0 13 accretive to adjusted eps for q4 and 0 37 accretive for full year 2019 q4 gross capital expenditures increased to 188 million from 138 million a year ago with the increase reflecting timing between quarters net capital expenditures were 128 million compared with 87 million a year ago all in for the quarter free cash flow was 221 million versus 479 million a year ago for the year free cash flow was 628 million compared to 694 million a year ago in q4 we had asset sales of 60 million including 52 million from real estate and the remainder from equipment we booked a gain on sale of assets of 37 million in the quarter of which 36 million related to real estate we had a sequential benefit to free cash flow from trade receivables programs of 60 million in the quarter for the full year these programs provided an incremental benefit to free cash flow of 110 million detailing our 2020 guidance we expect organic revenue growth of 3 to 5 this is based on gradual improvement in transportation markets in the second half of the year as brad said earlier we expect growth in adjusted ebitda of 7 to 10 we expect free cash flow of 600 million to 700 million this includes gross capex of 600 million to 650 million and asset sales of 150 million to 175 million implying a net capex in the range of 475 million to 525 million we expect cash interest in the range of 285 million to 305 million and cash taxes in the range of 155 million to 180 million we expect an effective tax rate for full year 2020 in the range of 24 to 27 all of our forecasts exclude the potential impact of transaction related expenses we continue to make significant progress on the 10 operating initiatives that are driving 700 million to 1 billion of potential ebitda improvement by year end 2022 speaking to some of the specific initiatives our tech work streams across the company continue to gain momentum in ltl we rolled out our smart workforce planning platform to our full network during q4 we are seeing great results for instance dock operations productivity improved 9 we ve launched a new p d platform for route planning and rolled it out to all of our terminals we will start seeing results through the course of 2020 we introduced an automated rfp platform for local account pricing 50 of all new opportunities in the local channel in the quarter were fully automated leading to quicker turnaround times and aiding our ability to close new business we launched many advances in linehaul including a visual monitoring tool that helps supervisors determine how full a trailer is so they can manage the dock more efficiently in freight brokerage our counteroffer capability within xpo connect enables us to work with carriers to negotiate a fair and competitive price contributing to our share gains as it has since we launched it in 2018 while our technology is a fantastic gateway to our service our carrier relationships are critical to delivering that service to our customers we have strategic relationships with thousands of contracted carriers in north america for which we re a significant source of freight and revenue overall we are experiencing dramatic growth in users bids and book loads and we re using the dynamic max pay capability we developed in north america to drive share in our european brokerage line of business in contract logistics our ability to assess the customer supply chain recommend optimal cost efficient solutions and implement them with speed is winning us high quality long term contracts with blue chip customers it starts with tech leadership our sales platform is backed by investments we ve made in big data analytics when a customer comes to us with large amounts of data our ability to deploy that data to create a customized solution exceeds that of anyone else in the marketplace we have our own warehouse management and order management platforms these integrate well with robotics and we are accelerating the pace of automation in our warehouses this is resonating across verticals ranging from omnichannel retail to consumer technology to aerospace and defense to broader industrial and to many more i m proud to say that we were named to the fortune most admired companies list for the third straight year and ranked number one in the category of trucking transportation and logistics we were named to the top 100 of america s most responsible companies by newsweek and ranked in the top 5 in our category on the corporate equality index by the human rights campaign foundation underscoring our commitment to the lbgtq community with that i ll turn it back to the operator and we ll take your questions questions and answers operator our first question is coming from chris wetherbee from citi your line is now live christian wetherbee citigroup analyst hey thanks good morning guys bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer good morning christian wetherbee citigroup analyst i guess maybe starting on the specific can you talk a little bit about the ltl side and maybe the tonnage declines that you saw in the quarter wanted to get a sense of sort of what s happening there where you think is customer attrition as you go through i was wanting to get a sense that it looked like it was a step down from what we had seen earlier in the year bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer hi chris it s brad good morning i don t think it s specific to us for the better or for the worse i think it s just the market i think the industrial economy has been soft for quite a long time now and it was soft in the fourth quarter we do see some potentially encouraging signs in january and year to date numbers where in ltl tonnage is definitely still down but it s down less than it was in the fourth quarter and by the same token yield is up and up more than it was in the fourth quarter so i think it s too early to call a definitive bottom and have high conviction with that but there are some encouraging signs about what s going on in the industrial economy christian wetherbee citigroup analyst okay that s helpful i appreciate that and then i know you probably don t want to talk too much about the m a process or the divestiture process but when you think about if you could maybe give us a little bit of sort of the roadmap of what to expect from here in terms of either timing or process standpoint i think it d be helpful just to kind of frame up what you think is going to happen as you play out over 2020 bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer the process is off to an excellent start there s a lot of good momentum more than we had expected we don t have any further updates to share with you at this time and when we do we will do it publicly christian wetherbee citigroup analyst okay i appreciate it if i can squeeze one more in just what do you think about the 700 million to 1 billion potential cost savings that you ve outlined over the course of the next couple of years how much do you think is included in guidance or how do you think about that is that still the opportunity set as you think about it maybe putting that aside relative to the divestiture process and how much should we think about in 2020 bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer so the 10 lever process is still front and center of what we re working on it s our main focus throughout the company the major projects like automated pricing like many forms of automation including robotics productivity enhancements especially workforce planning through the smart labor tools attacking that 1 3 billion a year we spend on linehaul in ltl and so forth these are big ticket items these are ones that can have very demonstrable improvement in results and we re not taking our foot off the pedal at all on that independent of the process to evaluate strategic alternatives for four of our business units six of those 10 levers are driven by technology and we re still investing in technology and still developing that competitive advantage when you look at the business split and you look at that 700 million to 1 billion of potential profit improvement over the next couple of years about half of it is in supply chain with a little bit more in north america versus europe about 30 is in ltl and about 20 is in transportation again a little bit more in north america than in europe so we re still moving full speed ahead on those 10 levers and we re on track with all of them and that s because of the intense focus we have as a management team on them christian wetherbee citigroup analyst okay but no sort of any sense of what it s going to actually be in 2020 how to do it is that sort of back end loaded do you think it s sort of linear throughout the period i guess that s what i was sort of looking for bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer some of those we ve already started to see some benefit from some of those are more longer term in nature and require more investment and more time there is some benefit from them embedded in the 2020 budget and the guidance and those were all created on a bottoms up basis from the field with people tying their compensation to those results so while we don t want to quantify in specific dollars each one of the levers and how much hits each quarter i hope i m giving you a feel of there is a beginning of results already coming in and that increases quarter after quarter year after year christian wetherbee citigroup analyst got it thanks very much for the time appreciate it bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from amit mehrotra from deutsche bank your line is now live amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst thanks operator hi everybody thanks for taking my question brad i just wanted to circle back on the strategic alternatives i fully appreciate you do not want to talk about it but i guess the question comes from a little bit of a different perspective because you and the board have characterized it as a sale or a spin a sale is obviously not in the company or board s control given it depends on the pricing you get out in the marketplace but the spin of the businesses are completely in your control or the board s control so really in that context i just want to understand how committed are you to actually separating the ltl businesses from the non ltl businesses and what are the circumstances whereby you don t pursue a spin off given the avenue is completely in the management and board s control bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer well good morning amit what i can tell you is we re 100 committed to creating shareholder value and that s always been our plan and still is our plan and in our estimation today the best way to create substantial shareholder value is to run a process for four of those business units but not ltl and see what our options are in terms of valuation that comes back from those we re not putting a huge amount of effort right now into the spin because the sales process is in full gear so let s see how that goes and then we ll take it step by step amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst okay and then can you just also talk about the disruption that this process has had on the business one i mean you have obviously i don t know 10 000 plus employees related to the businesses maybe even more that you re looking to spin off or sell what are you doing there to retain them and then what has the customer reaction been given some of these contracts in logistics in particular are multiyear and i would just imagine that it has an impact in the customer mindset with respect to potential changes in control or management bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer yeah well in terms of employees we have a large amount of goodwill that we ve built up over the years with our employee base there are 100 000 members of the xpo logistics family and one of the reasons that we have that immense goodwill is that we ve been very transparent and very communicative and very straightforward with everything that we re always doing and people appreciate that and we ve kept them in the loop of what our plans are just as we ve kept the street and they appreciate that and nobody likes well i shouldn t say nobody but most people don t like change most people don t like ambiguity but our organization is agile it s flexible it s dynamic and it s used to dealing with rapid change all the transformation projects that we ve had in order to grow revenue 2 billion organically over the last few years and grow ebitda 0 5 billion over the last few years that s because we had tens and tens of thousands employees who were highly motivated to succeed and to contribute to a major major process so some people are actually excited that they could be part of a smaller more focused business unit but frankly many people are mixed about it because we ve created a great global family atmosphere and if we end up selling or spinning these four units that will go but in terms of your question about what we ve done for retention we ve obviously spent a lot of time on retention and on incentivization programs and i feel we the team in the hr and the comp ben group s done an excellent job at taking care of that in terms of customers customers also appreciate open communication they just want to get the job done so if they re in the transportation part of the business they want goods moved from here to there if they re in the supply chain part of the business they want everything that goes on in the four walls of that warehouse to be done with maximum efficiency and productivity and nothing has changed in that respect we re still having very high levels of execution in our supply chain business we ve been winning new contracts we recently won waitrose the large supermarket chain in the uk and we recently won mercedes benz which is another big contract we got over in europe so we re winning contracts even after we ve announced the strategic alternatives process amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst okay i ll keep it at two thank you very much good luck in the process appreciate it bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from scott schneeberger from oppenheimer your line is now live scott schneeberger oppenheimer co analyst thanks very much good morning everyone i guess on the guide on the guidance for 2020 organic revenue and ebitda could you speak i guess to how you look at it by segment and cadence and kind of macro versus internal thank you matthew fassler chief strategy officer sure so as you think about cadence we re expecting one of the premises of the guide is that the industrial economy and the transportation markets show some recovery in the second half of the year so the revenue momentum embedded in that 3 to 5 would build over the course of the year if you think about ltl we expect adjusted or improvement of approximately 100 basis points or more so at least 100 basis points and then you can think about relatively even ebitda growth among our transportation and logistics segments scott schneeberger oppenheimer co analyst great thanks for that and then i want to over to capex a big tickup year over year on what you re planning to spend could you speak a little bit to where that s going i presume a lot into the it budget and just how much of that may or may not be spent given the strategic alternatives and how that could potentially influence what the plans are there thanks matthew fassler chief strategy officer so the capex budget is based on the company and its current structure and from a capex perspective and investment perspective it s business as usual we re investing in all of our businesses now the gross capex number of 600 million to 650 million is kind of at the 2019 number at the low end and slightly above at the high end the net number is a bit bigger because the asset sales embedded in the guide of 150 million to 175 million are lower than the level that we had in 2019 recall that in 2019 we sold an office property with proceeds in excess of 70 million that s really the delta in the asset sales and that s a big piece of the delta in the net capex number scott schneeberger oppenheimer co analyst thanks very much i ll turn it over bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from allison landry from credit suisse your line is now live allison landry credit suisse analyst good morning thanks so just a question on ltl in terms of bridging to the 1 billion of profits by 2021 how should we think about the pace of improvement this year versus next year and would you expect ebit to grow faster in 2020 or more back end loaded and then if you think about just sort of the different buckets whether it s linehaul p d utilization price where do you think you have the most opportunity left there matthew fassler chief strategy officer sure so as you think about growth in ebitda i mean i ll let you do the specifics of your model let me just give you a couple of the premises that back our guidance we do expect a better tonnage environment as the year progresses based both on comps and our expectation that the industrial economy stabilizes and begins to grow we sized our expected adjusted or improvement at 100 basis points or more you can use that certainly to get to an ebitda number you d probably look at something close to even pacing between the years but again you should work out the details on your own in terms of the four specific levers within our strategic initiatives that are driving ltl we re seeing the earliest benefits from pricing and that s manifested both in yield and also to some degree in market share our automated pricing effort for example helps us get to local accounts quicker we expect it to increase our conversion also as we said earlier on the call we finished the rollout of smart to all of our ltl terminals so that is starting to have an impact on dock productivity today besides that number in the fourth quarter but pound for pound it s only really been in place through the network for a very short period of time we spoke also during the call about the rollout of our p d and linehaul initiatives among the four those are the two more back end loaded initiatives so you ll see implementations and some benefits this year but those are more stories for 2021 and beyond allison landry credit suisse analyst okay thanks so the other question i wanted to ask so in the past you ve highlighted that a number of your customers use more than one xpo service and that s been a key selling point i know you just signed a couple of big contracts but for shippers that you re trying to get new business with and that are also looking to use more than one service have you noticed in the conversations with them that there has been sort of any less willingness to sign contracts because of the strategic exploration bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer a little bit allison but not a lot people have confidence whatever decision we make will maintain high levels of customer service and execution a little bit of delays in some customers but not a big trend on the cross selling we still see a significant and growing amount of cross selling within north american transportation and within european transportation actually i would say the momentum of cross selling within north american transportation is increasing we had about a little over 300 million of cross selling within north american transportation in 2019 that was up about 37 from the previous year which was up about 26 from 2018 and in europe we had about eur170 million of cross selling within european transportation in 2019 and that was up not quite as much as it was in north america but it started after north america that was up about eur10 million year over year so when you look at the 2 billion of increase in revenue that we organically drove from 2015 to 2019 about 500 million of that was from cross selling and nearly all of it was within those two business units that i just mentioned allison landry credit suisse analyst okay that s really helpful thank you guys bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from brian ossenbeck from jpmorgan your line is now live brian ossenbeck jpmorgan analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the question i just wanted to ask about competition more broadly in the softer freight market are you seeing any indications across the business lines of discipline slipping on price more than you would expect at this point in time and then maybe specifically in brokerage it looks like truckload held up pretty well in terms of margin but have you seen anything in europe where a few additional competitors especially uber freight has started to launch and roll out more scale in that region specifically bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer brokerage always in every part of the cycle has a wide range of competitors some of which are being more disciplined and some of which being less disciplined on price depending on their strength depending on where they stand in the marketplace what i m very excited about is in truck brokerage we grew year over year volumes when you exclude the largest customer downsizing by 19 in the fourth quarter our volumes were up 19 year over year if you take that largest customer s downsizing out of both periods even if you include that downsizing volumes are still up they re up about 1 on nearly 20 fewer heads so the automation that we ve been focusing on the technology that we ve been focusing on here in the company has dramatically improved productivity where we can be growing volumes with about a fifth less headcount and we have an enormous opportunity in brokerage to target tier 2 and tier 3 so mid sized or smaller sized customers because our main focus has been on those tier 1 customers so i m encouraged by what we re doing in freight brokerage i can t say the freight brokerage market is vibrant or even very healthy it s loose pricing is weak it s soft volumes and soft pricing but we ve been able to continue to stay focused on what we do well and the applications that we re using our technology for to grow despite the external environment now you asked about uber and europe we have a tremendous amount of respect for uber we think that they have a tremendous and really enviable cultural ability to think big and to move fast and these are things that we value in ourselves as well they understand the importance of tech they really just bring a lot of dynamism to the industry and it s just exciting to have a competitor that s got a lot of energy going on there in europe they ve just begun so we really haven t seen any effect on our business there but frankly we haven t seen a whole lot of effect on our business here from uber so we have another competitor coming into the market like we have for years and they have big plans and we wish them the very best brian ossenbeck jpmorgan analyst okay and just to follow up on the technology can you give some more context around the xpo connect platform what s the size either on a run rate basis or growth or anything you can give us just in terms of the context of how big that is is it reaching critical mass with shippers i know you highlighted you got about 100 000 drivers to download the app to connect into it what s your sense of the retention for people who are downloading and using it are they increasing in the stickiness with this platform as it continues to grow bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer we have not reached critical mass by a long shot with shippers we ve made huge and by the way i don t think anybody has the vast majority of brokerage is still done over the telephone with human beings for the most part throughout the industry that s changing there is a trend for sure for it to be more digitally enabled and we are really at the forefront of that our strategy has been a little bit different than some of our competitors our strategy has been to go in two phases where the first phase is intensely focused on carriers and particularly what we call our core carriers that handle most of our business there we have reached critical mass there we have 40 000 different trucking companies having downloaded drive xpo and that represents about 100 000 drivers so we have a very strong digital platform with the carrier base we did not want to go to the shipper community until we had that critical mass with the carrier community we have that now and so phase two will begin where we very aggressively market to the shipper universe with the system fully worked out and with access to very large amounts of capacity we also and you saw that we exceeded our 100 000 download target by the end of december of drive xpo we also launched a special app for last mile carriers that plugs right into connect and now in europe connect also went live and 100 of our loads there are now published digitally and we re rolling out connect to ltl customers in the uk france and spain but our strategy will be very similar and consistent we perfect the technology we market to carriers we gain tremendous access to capacity so when we go to a customer on the system they get very competitive bids the last thing in the world we want is to roll out to customers they put freight on the system and it s slower than just calling somebody on the telephone so i like the progress we ve made in xpo connect it s very methodical and i m very optimistic on its future brian ossenbeck jpmorgan analyst hi brad thanks for the details bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question today is coming from brandon oglenski from barclays your line is now live brandon oglenski barclays analyst hey good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question brad i guess i wanted to ask about the dual narratives i m hearing on the call here because you guys are talking about potentially 50 improvement in earnings in the next couple of years a lot of it s like overhead procurement common tech platform cross selling but at the same time the strategic review kind of wants to break up some of those opportunities so can you talk about why the best path forward isn t just pursuing this 700 to 1 billion of ebitda improvement as opposed to potentially breaking that up and take it away some of those opportunities bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer we ve always been focused on creating tremendous shareholder value in both transportation and logistics the strategy has always been consistent and that s why one of the reasons why we were the seventh best performing stock of the decade of the fortune 500 we ve been agile and we ve adapted to evolving circumstances as they change the possibility to continue in an intact company with the profit improvement opportunities of up to 1 billion is very attractive frankly and that s not a bad plan b it s actually an excellent plan b but plan a is to get more shareholder value creation in the here and now because the reality is that the market has given us what we call a conglomerate discount and we trade at a very significant discount to the sum of our parts as well as to the valuation of our peers and therefore if we take these four business units and market them in sales there is a very good chance that we re going to get multiples that exceed by a substantial amount what we trade for as a conglomerate so to speak and while we re in love with the multimodal solution and the global reach the market does not reward us for that and as the saying goes don t fight with reality because reality always wins the reality is what we ve put together here is a great company that customers appreciate that employees love gets about 8 times ebitda and now even with this announcement only about 9 and a bit times ebitda so we think the opportunity to create shareholder value in the here and now in a significant way is best served by exploring these options it s strictly math brandon oglenski barclays analyst well i ll follow you on that at a moment in time brad but i guess if you have tremendous amount of confidence in this earnings outlook i would like to think that not only would shareholders benefit from the earnings upside that you guys are projecting but also most likely an improved valuation range at that level of profitability so i guess again it just conveys this dual narrative if you have a lot of confidence in that earnings expansion why even risk the cultural shock the potential breakup potentially losing employees over what could be a very uncertain future for the organization bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer so it really comes down to whether i agree or disagree with one of your sentences that the market is likely to give us a much higher multiple as they recognize our consistent profit improvement i haven t seen it brandon i haven t seen it despite many analysts including yourselves on rooftops saying how great the company is the reality is the market has given us a high single digit ebitda multiple and we have to accept that reality i don t feel there is a big risk to the things you mentioned about cultural shock and employees and customers these are temporary situations that will get resolved very easily any issues that come up on that the basic business is very very strong we ve got the second largest contract logistics company in north america we re a leader in fast growing reverse logistics and omnichannel we ve got an unmatched blue chip customer list we re the leader in automation and in robotics and then if you look in europe in our supply chain business there too we ve got leading positions in the fastest growing parts of logistics we re the second largest contract logistics provider in europe we re the number one e fulfillment platform in most european markets we are the leader in click and collect we re a top 3 logistics company in france we re managing logistics for the biggest fresh foods network in spain we are a top 5 industrial tenant in europe and if you look in europe in transportation an extremely strong position where we re the number one transportation company in france and spain we re the biggest ltl provider in france we re a top 3 truck broker in france top 2 full truckload in france top 3 ltl in uk top 3 dedicated transport in uk number one truck broker in spain long list of great blue chip customers and if you come over to north america and looked at our north american transportation unit we are i don t know if we re the third or fourth depending on how you count it largest truck broker in north america we have technology that s proven we have management that s been together for years and very stable and three quarters of our truck brokerage leadership has held every single job function in truck brokerage we re very long in the tooth in expertise on how to make money in truck brokerage we re number one in last mile for heavy goods we re a top 5 managed transportation company we re the third largest intermodal company we have one of the largest drayage networks in the united states we re number one in expedite so i could go on and on and on for hours but we ve built up a very strong company and i don t think the public markets have given us value for that if i agreed with you that we would get value for that to the same extent we ll get in a sale we wouldn t consider a sale thank you brandon oglenski barclays analyst all right thank you brad bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from stephanie benjamin from suntrust your line is now live stephanie benjamin suntrust analyst hi good morning thank you for the question bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer good morning stephanie benjamin suntrust analyst i wanted to switch to the logistics segment contract logistics and this very strong margin expansion you saw in the fourth quarter could you maybe give us a little bit of color on how we should think about the opportunity in 2020 i understand that there s a lot of labor tools and productivity initiatives that went into place toward the end of 2019 so maybe how we should think about the run rate going forward in terms of margin improvement that would be helpful thank you matthew fassler chief strategy officer sure good morning stephanie so looking at adjusted ebitda margin across the businesses this was a year in contract logistics a quarter and a year where we exercised excellent cost control really across the franchise we rolled out our smart workforce productivity tools generated strong pricing we spoke about the progress that we made addressing loss maker sites in europe exiting some low margin business we spoke to you a bit about xpo direct and improved profitability there we executed very well at peak we benefited from some restructuring in q3 which helped us rethink our sg a org chart and drove benefits there there was really no single magic bullet that helped us optimize profitability in contract logistics in 2019 as i said earlier as we look at the breakout between the two major segments contract logistics and transportation i think about ebitda growth at roughly similar levels in the same neighborhood within our 7 to 10 overall adjusted ebitda growth in 2020 we have a number of initiatives that have excellent long term payout in fact as brad highlighted a moment ago contract logistics represents 50 of the ultimate benefit from among our business units from our seven to 10 levers thinking specifically about some of the larger ones they include automation and xpo direct they re two of the biggest contributors to the profit levers overall and that s obviously a three year effort from here stephanie benjamin suntrust analyst great and lastly if you could provide a little bit of an update on just your xpo direct platform i think you ve said that you ultimately believe this could be a 1 billion business where we are today or after 2019 kind of how you saw the business performing in the fourth quarter particularly around the holiday season so any additional color there would be great thank you bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer so xpo direct is our shared space distribution network and we serve omnichannel e comm and retail and manufacturing customers in north america we don t have xpo direct in europe this was a start up we started roughly about a year ago as all start ups do they lose money at first and true to form xpo direct lost its fair share of money i m pleased that we ve improved the profitability of it in a significant way recently and expect it to break even here in the first quarter which is great because revenue is growing and we want profitability to grow we are confident that we will be on a 1 billion revenue run rate by the end of 2022 that is the glide path that we re on you asked about how it performed over peak or holiday it performed very well and that s why xpo direct is working and working well is because customers are getting good results from it stephanie benjamin suntrust analyst and that s it for me thank you so much bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from ariel rosa from bank of america your line is now live ariel rosa bank of america analyst hey good morning guys nice quarter in the face of tough macro just wanted to touch on the outlook first so i hear you saying getting contract renewals on ltl in the 3 range i wanted to contextualize that against the outlook for 3 to 5 revenue growth obviously lapping the loss of a large customer in 2020 what are you kind of assuming in terms of the volume growth picture because i guess i would have expected that to be a little bit stronger against the context of about 3 pricing gains so is there something that i m kind of missing or is there one segment that you expect to maybe contract a little bit more in terms of facing continuing headwinds on the volume side bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer i ll let matt answer the majority of that i want to say just one thing you ll recall that when we had our largest customer insource 600 million of business roughly about a year ago we said 2019 is going to be a year where we rebuild that we replace the business that we lost and then regrow rebuild from there and after which resume growth from there i m happy we did that i m happy we started the year with 600 million in the hole and still were able to produce fantastic numbers in a lousy market so i m very happy about that in terms of the guidance for this year we assume a slight recovery in the second half in the industrial economy but not a huge one we assume that the consumer still continues to stay reasonably strong which it is and has been incredibly resilient which was one of the reasons we had 7 organic revenue growth in our big and bulky last mile business we re assuming that truck brokerage recovers somewhat but not humongously it does recover a bit in the second half because that cycle is getting a little old now and you re starting to see rebalancing mechanisms take place we re not assuming any impact from the strategic alternatives process we re not assuming any major geopolitical shocks so that s our overview of the guidance that we gave matt did you want to add to that matthew fassler chief strategy officer yeah just at a very high level considering that ltl is really an extremely stable business you don t have there s not a ton of volatility in the revenue line so we do expect to see some recovery in ltl revenue we expect to see tonnage improve gradually we expect yield growth to hold at or improve a bit from current strong levels but there s probably a little more swing in some of the other areas of the business that get us to the 3 to 5 guidance level ariel rosa bank of america analyst okay great that s terrific color so thank you for that just for my second question i wanted to ask it seems like a lot of the it initiatives and the tech initiatives around efficiency savings have been driven by tech teams looking across the platform and i just wanted to understand better as you think about divestitures how does that kind of how do you think about spreading the efforts of the tech team across those divisions does that change the nature of how xpo thinks about allocating resources for its tech team who stays in the case that you have spin offs obviously xpo has done a lot of great work around implementing technology but how does that division look subsequent to some of these spin offs bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer so our tech organization is structured in two ways we have robust tech professionals embedded within each business unit and over that we have mario s group that s leading the strategic vision and transplanting and cross planting things that work in one area to another area so for example smart the genesis of smart was in our logistics business in north america and it was showing mid to high single digit labor productivity out of the gate we said wow this is a really good invention and so we transplanted that into ltl we transplanted that into europe and those processes are going under way so the cross fertilization of best practices is really done top side so you won t have that going forward if we split into five different companies you will still have each business unit with a very mature substantial tech organization each of which has a leader each of which has a great leadership team and is extraordinarily effective the kinds of initiatives that we ve got going in ltl will just continue will continue as is all the p d linehaul the pricing the cross dock and the last part of your question about where does technology go the technology goes where it belongs so for example we were talking about smart a minute ago smart will be licensed in one form or another to the contract logistics businesses here and in europe if we end up divesting or spinning them off and it will also be in the ltl business because we need it there as well we don t need smart in the more non asset parts of the business so that doesn t really apply to there the pricing algorithms are specifically designed for the most part specific to each business unit because the business is different and so they have different algorithms so the part that is appropriate to them which they ve already been using they ll continue using that so mario and the team have worked through a very careful plan that if we end up divesting these four companies the technology will be where it needs to be operator thank you we have reached the end of our question and answer session now let s turn the floor back over to brad for any further or closing comments bradley jacobs chairman and chief executive officer okay well thank you everybody we had a good quarter anytime eps is up 50 and adjusted eps is up 56 we re going to say we have a good quarter and be justified in saying that we do feel that we re well positioned going into 2020 you saw our guidance of adjusted ebitda up 7 to 10 and free cash flow of 600 million to 700 million in ltl we re proud of the record or we re completely on track for the 1 billion of ebitda that we ve committed to for next year on the cfo the culmination of the cfo search i think we ve found the perfect match for what we need and the strategic alternatives process is going very very very well and the final point is you can count on us no matter what the situation is to do what s best for the shareholders thank you very much

measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the sec and available on our website i will now turn the call over to javier rodriguez javier rodriguez chief executive officer thank you jim and good afternoon everyone we appreciate your interest in davita and look forward to your questions and comments i ll start with clinical highlights as a reminder of life sustaining care that we provide to more than 235 000 people while we discuss clinical outcomes and lowering the total cost of care our goal is to improve our patients quality of life one specific example has been to focus on reducing infections in our patients dialysis patients are prone to infection which can often lead to lengthy hospitalization stays and increase in mortality i m excited to report that our efforts have paid off in 2019 we reduced the rate of bloodstream infection by 13 and improved the rate of peritonitis by 20 versus the prior year this is a meaningful improvement that kept many of our patients out of the hospital now let me transition to our results and outlook for 2020 we had a strong performance in 2019 and met the earnings per share and free cash flow growth targets we set for the year we re committed to achieving our 2020 financial guidance in fact we re raising our earnings per share target range by 0 50 joel will provide the financial details on both the quarter and our 2020 guidance now let me pull up for a few minutes to share our high level view on clinical and on policy we are in an exciting time for kidney care we re bridging the transition of care from the nephrologist s office to different types of care we re working with our payers to use predictive analytics to identify ckd patients with the highest risk of transition to esrd once we support these patients we will work on avoiding or delaying the onset of kidney failure we remain excited about nephrology care lines the new physician led entity with nearly 1 100 nephrologists that will be the vehicle to connect davita to the nephrologist practice the goal is simple provide world class analytics and education to help physicians best deploy their time to care for the right person at the right time for those patients who do transition to esrd we built a leading education platform to empower patients to choose to start on the right treatment modality for them for patients who choose home modality we continue to invest in our leading home platform where we serve the most home patients of any provider in 2019 we saw our highest growth ever in pd modality we re working to maintain our leadership in the home dialysis with a 2020 goal of achieving double digit growth in the pd modality moving on to policy we continue our multiyear journey toward integrated care we re encouraged by the quality improvements that are evident in our demonstration such as the esco we re hopeful that there will be additional models and opportunities to scale integrated care for esrd patients at national levels we remain optimistic about the administration s view for value based care model we believe that the capabilities that we ve built will support our collective goal to improve clinical outcomes while managing total cost there s been a lot of recent conversation about medicare advantage and the 21st century cures act we would remind everyone that congress passed this legislation with the intent of making additional insurance options available to medicare eligible patient esrd patients with respect to expectations of adoption no one really know what choices will be made by the patient we continue to believe that the selection into ma will be more gradual we look forward to working with plan partners to manage the care and the cost of these patients in parallel our advocacy efforts are focused on ensuring adequate funding in both medicare fee for service and ma and as we ve said before we remain ready in the year to advance integrated care for medicare fee for service population shifting to state policy we will keep advocating for our patients in california and other states where some labor unions are pursuing policies that are not good for patients cost or the care delivery system now let me transfer it on to joel so he will provide additional details on the quarter and specifics on 2020 guidance joel ackerman chief financial officer thanks javier before i begin i d like to point out that we have adjusted the first section of the press release this quarter we hope this format will give investors easier access to some of the most important results that have historically appeared later in the release now i ll start with q4 results and then move to 2020 guidance we generated 2 9 billion of revenue in the quarter an increase of 2 75 over q4 2018 our operating income was 463 million which included approximately 67 million in profit related to calcimimetics resulting in an operating margin of 16 earnings per share from continuing operations was 1 86 now let me take you through some of the underlying drivers starting with the components of the u s dialysis and lab segment non acquired growth for the quarter was 2 1 relatively flat with the prior two quarters revenue per treatment was down sequentially by 1 10 which includes 1 68 per treatment decrease in revenue attributable to calcimimetics excluding calcimimetics rpt was up by 0 58 to recap performance for the full year 2019 versus guidance which excludes the impact of calcimimetics we finished at the high end of our rpt guidance range of zero to 1 we fell outside of the very narrow range that we provided on commercial mix and ended 2019 with a year over year decrease of approximately 20 basis points although this decline did not have a meaningful impact on our revenue per treatment combined patient care costs and dialysis and lab segment g a expense was down approximately 2 per treatment quarter over quarter driven primarily by lower compensation and benefits costs turning to calcimimetics we generated operating income of approximately 67 million in the fourth quarter on revenue treatment and cost per treatment of 12 86 and 4 19 respectively for the full year we generated approximately 220 million in operating income as we negotiated significant cost decreases on oral calcimimetics for 2020 we now expect approximately 40 to 70 million of operating income from calcimimetics with approximately half of this to be realized in the first quarter as we expect asp reimbursement to decline in subsequent quarters with that said there is still significant uncertainty around this outlook given the complexity in the asp methodology now turning to international for the quarter operating income was approximately 2 million including an fx loss of 4 million for the full year we generated positive adjusted operating income of 2 million excluding goodwill impairment and including an fx loss of 2 million our effective tax rate on adjusted income attributable to davita from continuing operations for the quarter was 25 2 and was 27 5 for the full year our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from a decrease in our estimated state tax rate now on to cash flow for the full year 2019 operating cash flow from continuing operations was 2 billion and our free cash flow was 1 1 billion both operating cash flow and free cash flow were positively impacted by significant improvements in our dsos and unusually low cash taxes in 2019 these two factors combined to improve cash flow during the year by approximately 300 million we do not expect these to recur in 2020 capex for the year was 728 million slightly below the revised guidance range of 740 to 780 million and well below our initial guidance from the year of 800 to 840 million the better result in q4 was due to the timing of certain projects that were pushed into 2020 since october 1 2019 we purchased almost 8 7 million shares at an average amount of 64 80 per share as a result of our recent repurchases we reduced our share count by approximately 41 3 million shares or 24 8 since the close of the dmg transaction in june 2019 this week we expect to complete a repricing of our 2 7 billion term loan b that will reduce the interest rate on this tranche of debt by 50 basis points we now expect our debt expense to be approximately 90 million in q1 2020 and then approximately 85 million per quarter in the subsequent quarters i ll conclude with some comments on our guidance ranges for 2020 we are updating our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance by 0 50 per share to 5 75 to 6 25 as a reminder this includes the expected benefits from calcimimetics as well as the expected cost of ballot initiatives in california due to the timing of calcimimetics that i mentioned and the expected timing of ballot related costs in the second half of the year we expect some fluctuations in earnings per share between quarters this year our revenue guidance for the year is 11 5 billion to 11 7 billion and our operating income margin guidance is consistent with the target range of 13 to 14 that we talked about at our capital markets day we expect to generate approximately 600 to 800 million of free cash flow this year i will point out that cash flow is inherently subject to greater swings than its operating income due to the time of working capital and other items such as the timing of payroll cycle tax payments and intra period changes in the collections of ar this worked in our favor in 2019 and could swing the other way at some point in the future operator let s now open the line for questions questions answers operator our first question comes from justin lake with wolfe research your line is now with justin lake wolfe research analyst thanks good afternoon wanted to go through a couple of moving parts here first in terms of the higher eps range year over year is it fair to think about it as two thirds coming from calcimimetics benefit that wasn t in the numbers before maybe the rest coming from lower debt costs and maybe you could tell us any kind of moving other moving parts including california kind of delaying implementation of the legislation out there on the acas joel ackerman chief financial officer sure so justin you ve got the basics right calcimimetics is the biggest component of this and a decrease in the in our expected cost for ab 290 plays into this as well those are two big things i d call out there are a lot of other moving pieces in here our share count moves around as the stock price goes up and a whole bunch of other things related to core oi but i would say calcimimetics and the ab 290 are the two big things to call out justin lake wolfe research analyst great maybe you could just give us an update on is there any change in terms of the sustainability of calcimimetics in your mind beyond 2020 or do you still expect that to migrate down to kind of neutral and then do you have a new ab 290 number for us i think the old one was 25 to 40 joel ackerman chief financial officer sure so on calcimimetics we still expect under the current tdapa that it will migrate down to zero over the course of 2020 we have we ve been we as you can see we ve not been able to predict how asp would come down the positive numbers for 2020 is the result of asp not coming down the way we expected it would three months ago i don t know that our visibility on how the rest of the industry has behaved combined with some of the black box nature of asp have improved but we do think this has to get down pretty close to zero by the end of the year in terms of ab 290 we don t have a new number clearly the number will be smaller that said there will be some legal costs associated with ab 290 and there certainly is the possibility that it gets implemented toward the end of the year so the numbers are getting to a size where i don t think it s worth calling out a specific number but clearly below the 25 to 40 justin lake wolfe research analyst ok and just one last follow up before i jump back in the queue the calcimimetics is it fair to say here that you think costs have come down to a kind of normal range and we just need to track the asp and so it falls to that 4 number joel ackerman chief financial officer yes yes i m not saying cost couldn t continue to drift down a little bit but the real action for 2020 is on the trajectory of asp justin lake wolfe research analyst that s helpful thanks guys operator next question will come from kevin fischbeck with bank of america your line is now open kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst great i wanted to ask a little bit about this year s guidance kind of in the context of your 2022 guidance because it looks like you re kind of there in a lot of your metrics i guess at the midpoint the midpoint you re guiding for 2 revenue growth per year so i guess just want to understand that jumping point off is that still the right point or are there things in here that now maybe there s a different way to think about the long term trajectory and i guess trying to think about this year s guidance versus the 22 number i guess the 22 number is going to have a headwind of calcimimetics coming out and then i guess your guidance still assumes that ab 290 goes into place just want to make sure that that s one thing we d have to figure out if we re trying to joel ackerman chief financial officer yes so you re spot on on both those factors of calcimimetics coming out of here and ab 290 going into place in terms of some of the other things i d call out on the cash flow number 2019 was surprisingly high and we called out in the script two of the factors which are the dsos having come down as well as cash taxes i d also note cash flow was helped by calcimimetics as well and the impact that had on oi so that happened faster than expected we also benefited to some extent in the year by some of the capex we were expecting late in the year getting pushed into 2020 so the 2020 number might get impacted by that to the negative there is certainly the possibility that at the end of 2020 we ll see some pushed into 2021 and that could flip either way the one other thing i d call out is the margins we spoke about margins of 13 to 14 we re not changing that view of the world and so as you think about what the margins could be in 2022 i d stick that number kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok that s helpful and then appreciate the preliminary comments on ma but i guess it sounds like some of the managed care companies are starting to worry this is going to be an issue for them into 2021 i was wondering if you could talk about your conversations that you re having with ma companies is there a pushback on rates or anything that you would kind of highlight there that could impact the or change the impact it s going to have on you over the next few years javier rodriguez chief executive officer thanks kevin this is javier we ve gotten a fair amount of questions on ma and so i think it s useful to just pull up a little and revisit the origin of it number one this is the only patient population the esrd population that was excluded from having the right to pick ma and so it was fixing a deficiency in the system number two what is our role going forward and our role is to just make sure that our patients are well informed so they can make the best decision individually point number three is everybody is trying to size it and when you try to size something like this there s two variables of course one is rate and the other one is volume and so what we said is that our rate is above medicare but substantially below commercial we re not going to give any more on that variable the one that s most sort of undecided at this juncture is the pickup of the volume and all of you know the same as we do which is there s a lot of variables at play one individual has a primary insurance a secondary insurance do they have medigap coverage etc so we continue to think that it s reasonable to think that penetration will reflect the overall market in addition many people believe that our patients will have sort of a quick trigger to pick an insurance when there are so many complicated variables and they have many of them been in medicare for quite some time status quo might just keep going so we re literally asking how will our patients interpret their benefit and so we don t know and so many people are continuing to size that it s going to be some kind of an aggressive movement and we continue to think that it will be more gradual kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst i guess that s definitely helpful i guess two follow ups on that is there anything that you would think of as you think about that rate differential that you currently get that makes you think that for whatever reason it wouldn t be sustainable i guess obviously by any standard measure you just want to bring that delta down over time but is there any reason why you think that could be the case or maybe you could keep those economics or maybe change the way that you actually contract with managed care take more risk things like that javier rodriguez chief executive officer yes i would think it as an opportunity for us to expand the way we talk to our contracts and to our payer providers it s an exciting time where we re all aligned in trying to make sure that we have integrated care for our patients and so we re leaning in and trying to see how we can best serve them and be a partner and if they think that the ma volume is going to be higher than us that might also be an opportunity to contract in that way so we re excited obviously they want lower rates we would like higher rates and that dance is never going to change and then the question is can we all get creative on coming up on a win win situation kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then i guess to your point about the shift into ma point well taken that inertia tends to be the way people act when it comes to health insurance because it s kind of daunting to shift for that but i would assume that the fact that you re able to meet with these people three times a week and plan what the options are would potentially change that dynamic and when we do our analysis in the 20 states where medsup isn t available for people under 65 in an affordable way then i would think the adoption would be quite large the question ends up being about where in those states where it is available is there a rationale for those patients to switch from a medsup plan into an ma plan and then similarly in a for a dual eligible population which is 40 of your medicare book is there an incentive for those patients to move and why would either of those classes see the benefit of an ma plan javier rodriguez chief executive officer yes the first premise that you discussed which is access to the patient is worth exploring because you might be more talented than us but when you talk to people about their insurance it s not usually like netflix or anything they don t want to keep watching the next episode people usually start to glaze over a bit and say when you talk about deductibles when you talk about coinsurance when you talk about those kind of things it is not normal vernacular for most of these folks and they ve been on medicare for some time and it works for them and so then you got to start to explain that maybe it s more restrictive maybe they can t see their doctor but it s got other benefits and you get into it and then you can see that some people just tune out and so the question is is it our obligation to go back at them and the answer i think is no if you re satisfied with your insurance we just have to make sure that you know that you have a new option and so on all these on the duals sometimes that could actually have very little out of pocket and so you might not want to switch that situation so it is very specific to each individual but again the net of it is that we think we re not going to look very different than the overall population but there is the range that we re all playing with kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then just last question is there a time period when you feel like you will know how that shift is going will you know during the open enrollment period in q4 or do you actually have to wait until january for the patient claims to actually start coming in under the new payers javier rodriguez chief executive officer well i think we re going to have to wait until january we will have some preliminary stuff but unlikely that we re going to want to predict how that will play out until we see it since it s the first time we re experiencing it kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you operator the next question will come from pito chickering with deutsche bank your line is now open pito chickering deutsche bank analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions a few ones here on the 2020 revenue guidance what are you guys assuming in terms of organic treatment growth and revenue per treatment and how does the commercial reimbursement look for 2020 joel ackerman chief financial officer sure so pito on nav we ve we re guiding to 1 5 to 2 5 in terms of revenue per treatment we re not going to guide to rpt anymore in the level of specificity we have in the past that said i think it s safe to say going forward that it will look similar to what it looked like in the recent past the same dynamic in terms of commercial rpt medicare rpt and mix should play out next year the way they have in the recent few years the one big change obviously is on medicare fee for service reimbursement we got that in 19 and we see that continuing forward so again as we think about the how we want to guide and this is consistent with what we raised at capital markets day more of a focus on margin than on any of the individual inputs that said if you think about the inputs of rpt and the subcomponents there as well as cost per treatment and the other things we don t see anything particularly different next year to call out than what we ve seen in the recent past pito chickering deutsche bank analyst great and then on the 2020 margin guidance let me ask this in a different way if we exclude calcimimetics for 2019 the operating income margin is about 12 5 if you exclude 40 to 70 million of calcimimetics for 2020 it looks as though you re guiding to about 50 basis point improvement in 2020 versus 2019 first quarter 19 was a very easy comp so if you exclude calcimimetics for 2019 and 2020 and easy comp of first quarter 19 how should we think about core operating income margin in 2020 versus 2019 joel ackerman chief financial officer ok pito you lost me there on your math but i ll tell you the way i think about my math and i apologize if this doesn t tick and tie to what you asked but you can follow up with jim afterwards so for adjusted normalized number so this excludes calcimimetics we came in just north of 14 in 2019 we expect that and again we re not guiding to oi so again we said that at capital markets day we re sticking with that that said either through a top down analysis using revenue and our margin guidance or bottoms up through eps you can all do the math and come up with a range so i m going to give some high level thoughts relative to what s the probably the middle of the range of what you should be thinking about which should show you a little bit of margin compression in 2020 versus 2019 although still very much in that 13 to 14 range we talked about at capital markets day and if i had to point out what is driving that you ve got a little bit of ab 290 in there you ve got the continued pressure on labor costs associated with the strong environment we re in and we are also looking at making some investments in the form of operating cost investing in our future around things like home things like integrated kidney care things like data and analytics so if you put those all those things together you d come up with a little bit of margin pressure in 2020 over 2019 but still very much in the range of what we talked about at capital markets is that helpful pito chickering deutsche bank analyst yes very much so which is actually sort of the last question at the analyst day you talked about capital growth with capex coming down to 650 million in 2022 and you sort of you just mentioned sort of kidney start home based programs can you quantify how many of your centers have separate home treatment options today and how many are freestanding home centers as well joel ackerman chief financial officer i don t know the answer to that jim gustafson vice president of investor relations we ll follow up on it joel ackerman chief financial officer we can follow up with you on that pito pito chickering deutsche bank analyst thanks so much guys appreciate it operator the next question will come from andrew mok with barclays your line is now open andrew mok barclays analyst hi good afternoon i just wanted to follow up on the 2020 guidance components given all the moving parts you raised eps guidance by 0 50 it sounds like that increase is largely accounted for by the benefit from calcimimetics and the reversal of ab 290 so is it fair to say that the underlying assumptions on share repurchase remain the same given the 2 4 billion of share repurchase you did in 2019 combined with the nice run in the stock price the last few months how should we think about the size and cadence of share repurchase in 2020 joel ackerman chief financial officer sure so the fundamentals of our share repurchase philosophy haven t changed in terms of focusing on intrinsic value and ensuring we re not buying at what we believe above what we believe intrinsic value is also with the general expectation to stay most of the time although not all of the time within our leverage guidance of 3 to 3 5 times i will take a second here to note that you ll see the leverage number in the press release is around 3 1 which would bring it in at the low end of our range if you think about that excluding calcimimetics which i think is a better way to think about it it would put it at the higher end of our range but with all that said our philosophy on buybacks has not changed i think what has changed since we spoke to you in november is the stock is up from the high 50s low 60s to now in the 80s and that does impact our share buyback thinking really in two fundamental ways one is that the dollars we would apply to share buybacks will just buy that many fewer shares because the stock price is up and second as we think about intrinsic value and comparing that to where the stock is where the stock is will fundamentally impact how we think about buybacks so we re not going to give you any foresight in what we plan to do we ve always shied away from that but i wanted to give you kind of an update there on how we re thinking about things andrew mok barclays analyst great i appreciate the color and then second question on the home dialysis front the mandatory model from the executive order was supposed to go into effect last month and now that s delayed are you hearing anything out of d c on why that model got delayed and does the temporary or even permanent delay of the model impact your strategy to increase home penetration javier rodriguez chief executive officer no in general i think the executive order had a lot in it and they asked for comments and the community was very united on its views and so we are glad that the administration has taken its time because we want a good outcome rather than meeting a deadline and no to the other question which is while policy of course impacts at the end of the day the patient and the physician pick the modality and that s what s driving the movement to home people picking it or not picking it as opposed to any policy changes at this juncture andrew mok barclays analyst ok great thanks operator the next question will come from steve tanal with goldman sachs your line is now open steve tanal goldman sachs analyst good afternoon guys just wanted to go back to the 2021 rule change i guess where i m struggling with the idea that penetration of esrd patients should reach the overall market is just this notion that today i mean penetration of esrd patients is already 25 for the market at large despite the fact that they can t freely enroll in the plan so wouldn t that tell us that this patient panel probably prefers ma and that penetration could exceed 35 over time and i guess i know we re still anchoring to that but it looks like cms last week with the changes in the advanced notice for ma rates their forecast up to 33 and 21 and then going to 42 41 by 2024 then 42 thereafter so obviously a much more optimistic outlook than you guys have so any thoughts on those pieces there javier rodriguez chief executive officer yes steve i think that all of the opinions are quite reasonable and we don t proclaim to be right we are all doing it the same data as to economics deductibles out of pocket max sort of coordination of care networks narrow networks or broader network and so when we put all the variables in place we just think that in general we think that it will take a little bit longer for people to settle in to the choice than others that think that it will be what i d call a very efficient and effective market and we of course could be wrong and so there is that range that is let s call it the low the base case and the high case and we don t have any additional insights that you or cms doesn t there s no detailed information that we re running on steve tanal goldman sachs analyst helpful ok and then i just heard you correctly joel in terms of making sure your patients are aware of their options i imagine that applies to all states regardless of whether there s a guaranteed issue for medsup or not is that correct joel ackerman chief financial officer yes steve tanal goldman sachs analyst ok and then i guess i wanted to also ask about another part of that proposed rule to the extent you guys have had the time to go through all this but the network adequacy proposals there s a few things in there i won t go through all of them here but some could be presumably right as maybe mitigating some of the market power in dialysis how do you guys think about that dynamic in general i guess i d leave it open ended there i don t want to dissuade any or share maybe i guess javier rodriguez chief executive officer i appreciate it steve obviously network adequacy is critical in any disease state when you are signing up for a product you want to make sure that it s got coverage so that if you end up signing up and then you have esrd that you don t end up having some kind of restricted network and of course it matters whether it s in there or not the plans have been quite vocal and from our perspective we want to do is going back to our conversation earlier is we want to change the dynamics with our payer partners so that they see what we re doing and how we re adding value so that they do want to contract with us in a way that it s a win win steve tanal goldman sachs analyst perfect helpful and maybe one more on this and then i ll yield just going back to the treatment deltas the ma versus fee for service i guess i appreciate that you guys don t want to give a certain difference but maybe you can comment on how much variability there is in that spread and what factors dictate davita s willingness to contract for lower versus higher spreads of the different ma plans javier rodriguez chief executive officer well i appreciate the question steve but i think you probably know it had low odds of being answered every plan is steering right now as to how they want to contract with us and actually even if i try to answer it and be helpful the contract is very specific to each plan and their ability to take risk and our ability to take risk and so it s very specific so unfortunately i can t give you more detail on that steve tanal goldman sachs analyst that s fine thanks a lot appreciate it operator the next question will come from whit mayo with ubs your line is now open whit mayo ubs analyst just a couple here on calcimimetics you re guiding to 40 to 70 million of oi this year 50 of that is falling in the first quarter which implies about 25 of today s run rate of 220 million in the first quarter so i m just curious what you re basing that on is that based on asp for the quarter today how much visibility do you have into the first quarter contribution at this point i guess is what i m asking joel ackerman chief financial officer we ve got pretty good visibility with the the asp number came out i think in december not perfect visibility but so in q1 we ve got that the trajectory of what that looks like going forward though is where we don t have perfect visibility and we won t know asp for q2 for a little bit of while now whit mayo ubs analyst ok so that looks like that s about a 60 sequential decline off the fourth quarter for asp is that right joel ackerman chief financial officer hold on with we re there are other factors that go into that in terms of the cost decline the changing mix between sensipar and parsabiv and parsabiv cost differential so i m not sure you can get as clean a number as you d like from that whit mayo ubs analyst but is it i mean presumably the asp number is available so can you disclose what it is for the quarter joel ackerman chief financial officer yes it s down a little bit more than 40 whit mayo ubs analyst ok ok so some other factor would be driving your cost up to lower the oi by 60 joel ackerman chief financial officer well there s there are other factors besides cost because there s a mix issue between the oral and the iv as well whit mayo ubs analyst yes yes yes got it got it got it ok that s i m thinking about the remaining 50 million or not 50 million but the remaining earnings how do you i mean how are we how should we think about the progression of that earnings does it fall ratably throughout the year i don t know just any help i mean i know you have about as much visibility into this as we do joel ackerman chief financial officer yes if you think about it getting cut in half each quarter going forward that s a reasonable algorithm to use and then it goes to zero by the end of the year again that s not a prediction that s just to help you all with your modeling whit mayo ubs analyst yes is there a scenario where by the time the industry sort of sees the benefit of calcimimetics zero out that you are still carrying some level of earnings from calcimimetics given that you ve presumably been buying below the market for some time joel ackerman chief financial officer unlikely just because the numbers get so small in terms of the cost i think the more interesting question about calcimimetics is ultimately how it gets bundled whit mayo ubs analyst bundled yes joel ackerman chief financial officer the tdapa stuff will play out relatively quickly whit mayo ubs analyst ok just a couple of other quick ones here just back to the nag guidance of one and a half to two and a half that does imply some level of deceleration just joel maybe any factors influencing your decision to bring the range down javier rodriguez chief executive officer let me grab that this is javier we continue to look at the macro ranges and we just think that that is the right place to land we are continuing to invest in our admissions and our it and all our operations to simplify patient placement but at the end of the day what we re focusing is ensuring that we have the discipline in capital so that we have profitable growth and so we re not going to chase volume it s just not the right thing for us and so we re comfortable with that range of one and a half to two and a half and just as an fyi if my memory has me right that is not a change from capital markets we had it at one half to two and a half but i could be wrong so let s check that operator and the next question comes from gary taylor with jp morgan your line is open gary taylor j p morgan analyst hi good evening just a couple of questions left for me the first just going back to the question about the etc the mandatory demonstration that s been delayed do you have any visibility on when that would start are you incurring any costs to prepare for it and i presume since that model had some dialysis center reimbursement cuts which you could potentially earn back since this is delayed any potential financial impact is not contemplated in the 2020 guidance javier rodriguez chief executive officer the short answer is we do not have any more information than any of you we were given an opportunity just like all providers to give our opinions and insights and we did and they re processing that and we have not heard back we are not incurring any costs right now associated with it and it was not embedded in our guidance so right now you re even steven if you will there s no change gary taylor j p morgan analyst my last one to joel i just wondered if you would perhaps just review and clarify for us either on an eps basis or a dollar basis what actually is in 2020 for advocacy costs because i know in the third quarter you bumped that up 0 50 or call it 87 million pre tax but that i think was on top of what you view as your recurring sort of normal advocacy but then with the ab 290 delay maybe some of that costs came back in your direction so maybe just some help on when we think about the 2020 guide how much above sort of your what you d call your normal advocacy spend is built into 2020 joel ackerman chief financial officer sure so nothing s really changed in that gary there hasn t been any interplay between 2020 ballot initiative spend and ab 290 they re pretty independent so the 0 50 per share is the right number and that s over and above the 30 million baseline that we plan to spend year in year out the one correction i would make to your numbers is this ballot initiative cost is not tax deductible so your 87 million pre tax is overstated because i my guess is you got to that calculation assuming this was tax deductible gary taylor j p morgan analyst yes i recall you told us that somewhere like 60 65 million range probably so joel ackerman chief financial officer we re sticking with 0 50 a share so gary taylor j p morgan analyst all right thank you operator the next question is from justin lake with wolfe research your line is now open justin lake wolfe research analyst thanks just figured i d run through what s left of my question list here if that s all right with you guys so first on the cash available for deployment at year end i think if recollection is correct you guys typically want to run around 500 million at the parent at quarter end so you is it fair to think about you guys having another 500 million give or take joel ackerman chief financial officer i think it s justin lake wolfe research analyst of deployable cash kind of at year end is that right joel ackerman chief financial officer yes that s about right 500 million is typically what we want to have in the system so yes the 600 million is the number above that justin lake wolfe research analyst ok that s helpful and then joel you spent time talking about the intrinsic value kind of coming into repo and given that you did a tremendous amount of repo at a really attractive price for the benefit of shareholders now that the stock is in the 80s it looks like you bought a little bit less back at those levels is there anything we should read into your view of the intrinsic value here at the current price and how you expect to buy back stock could you give us a kind of at the moment update joel ackerman chief financial officer yes we ve never really been willing to talk about what our views of intrinsic value are at any moment in time and i don t expect to deviate from that here i think the one thing i would point out is intrinsic value is a moving target it s not something that stays static and it s impacted by our results and it can be impacted by our buybacks and everything else so i think what our views of intrinsic value were six months ago aren t necessarily the same as our views of intrinsic value today javier rodriguez chief executive officer one dynamic justin that is rarely talked about publicly also is that we have big blackout periods and then you have plans and you have restrictions and whatnot and so what you want to do is not look at one quarter or two quarters but overall what is our track record and i think you see our track record over time is quite fluid consistent with what joel said justin lake wolfe research analyst that absolutely makes sense and then just quickly on your commercial mix joel you said it was down 20 basis points year over year but not really a material impact on revenue per treatment can you just give us some more color on that given how key that metric is joel ackerman chief financial officer yes look not every commercial payer is created equal and if the mix comes from payers with lower rates it has much less impact on our rpt than a payer who is at an average rate justin lake wolfe research analyst and so would you say this is instead of it being just kind of normal aging of the population type of thing did you proactively kind of walk away from some contracts that were lower priced or was that just kind of the way things fell javier rodriguez chief executive officer yes i would say that what joel started off with an early question still holds which is there s no new dynamic and sort of the ecosystem negotiation is relatively stable there was no big decision one way or another and the world played out the way it did justin lake wolfe research analyst ok just a few couple others here one joel just to make sure we understand you re not giving oi guidance but you back to pito s question on margins core margins ex kind of moving parts are down a little bit year over year revenues up a little bit so kind of core oi call it ex calcimimetics changes things like that are is effectively flat year over year and within your guidance is that a reasonable way to think about it joel ackerman chief financial officer i m reluctant to get drawn into the oi guidance question because we re not guiding on oi that said i think again you can look at the ranges top down or bottoms up i would say it s fair to say that at the middle of the ranges you should expect some oi growth year over year justin lake wolfe research analyst at core like that s moving parts joel ackerman chief financial officer but with margin compression which would say it s not going to grow at the rate of revenue and that s just yes that s core excluding calcimimetics and other noise justin lake wolfe research analyst got it and then maybe a quick commentary i think the industry was going to run its own ballot initiative in california and then decided to back off that is there some reason why you decided to back off or do i have that wrong javier rodriguez chief executive officer no you have it right and i think the right way to think about it justin is very early on you have to explore all your options and so there s some filing restrictions etc so we were exploring our option making sure that we had everything at our disposal after evaluating it we did not think that that was something that we should pursue that it s not in the best interest of our strategy and that it s cleaner to go right after it literally straight at it as opposed to doing a countermeasure justin lake wolfe research analyst ok thanks for all the time guys operator the next question will come from maggie jiang with bank of china new york branch your line is open maggie jiang bank of china new york analyst thank you for taking my call my question here is what is your priority in terms of the international expansion i see that there are about 241 centers in the international as of 2018 i m not sure if that number goes up in 2019 javier rodriguez chief executive officer sure so our priorities for international are similar to our priorities in the u s which is capital efficient growth we continue to see it as a growth business we ve continued to deploy capital there in the markets that we see as having the best opportunities and those are opportunities where we can either acquire things at attractive rates or build de novos at attractive rates and where we have an opportunity to add value so growth in 19 was relatively in line with our expectations we see 2020 continuing along that path maggie jiang bank of china new york analyst ok and in terms of the long term goal for the international business do you expect the just because different regions will have different type of reimbursement system affordability and customers clientele so do you what do you expect in international profitability versus your core and u s javier rodriguez chief executive officer i think that will vary very much country by country as you noted some countries have better reimbursement others less so so i think it will be a bit of a mix and where it winds up relative to the u s will depend a lot on the different mix in the different countries and where we choose to prioritize our investments so it s hard to predict now what the ultimate margin will be relative to the u s margin maggie jiang bank of china new york analyst ok and it seems that the revenue coming from the international is roughly about 4 5 higher but the growth if i just purely look at q4 2018 versus q4 2019 the growth from the international revenue is 6 45 so that seems to be a brighter spot than the aggregate revenue growth around 2 7 so do you think that you ll continue to approach international particularly in china however on the other hand we do see profit net operating loss from international javier rodriguez chief executive officer so yes i do think we re going to continue to invest in international whether it grows faster than the u s we re not giving specific guidance on that although i think looking at the past is a reasonable guide to the future there so yes maggie jiang bank of china new york analyst i see and then in terms of your asia footprint in asia i see there are a few branches a few centers in taiwan and china and you re also working with your apac jv can you just give me a sense in terms of what s your business model and how do you approach china greater china javier rodriguez chief executive officer so we generally don t get into too much detail on any individual countries so i m going to pass on that one operator speakers there are no questions in queue at this time javier rodriguez chief executive officer well i want to thank you all for investing the time we look forward to talking to you again and we re going to do our hardest to deliver on all that we committed thank you and talk again soon operator duration 57 minutes

new york feb 11 2020 prnewswire ondeck nyse ondk the leader in online lending for small business today announced fourth quarter 2019 net income of 9 3 million adjusted net income of 3 3 million and gross revenue of 111 7 million ondeck also announced it had repurchased 7 5 million shares for 33 0 million during the fourth quarter of 2019 bringing full year 2019 repurchases under its 50 million common stock repurchase program to 10 7 million shares for 44 0 million our fourth quarter closed out a year of significant progress at ondeck highlighted by solid growth in us lending advancement of our strategic initiatives and improved capital efficiency said noah breslow chief executive officer in 2019 we grew average loans and finance receivables 15 expanded odx our platform as a service business combined with a leading on line small business lender in canada and repurchased 14 of our outstanding shares we enter 2020 well positioned to further expand the core us lending business scale our international operations to profitability drive value in the odx platform and advance our efforts to obtain a bank charter while increasing earnings per share and return on shareholders equity review of financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019 net income was 9 3 million or 0 13 per diluted share compared to 8 7 million 0 11 per diluted share in the prior quarter and 13 9 million or 0 17 per diluted share in the year ago period adjusted net income was 3 3 million or 0 05 per diluted share compared to 7 8 million or 0 10 per diluted share in the prior quarter and 15 7 million or 0 20 per diluted share in the year ago period loans and finance receivables grew 38 million or 3 sequentially and 96 million or 8 from a year ago to 1 3 billion reflecting growth in all loan types and the closing of the evolocity transaction in april 2019 annual growth was also driven by lengthening the duration of the portfolio as the weighted average maturity of term loans originated in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 13 2 months compared to 11 8 months in the year ago quarter origination volume of 618 million decreased 2 from the prior quarter and 6 from the year ago quarter primarily reflecting lower conversion rates on higher application volume and longer portfolio duration demand for lines of credit remained strong which now account for 23 of total loans and finance receivables at quarter end up from 21 at september 30 2019 and 16 a year ago gross revenue of 111 7 million was essentially flat with the prior periods as the benefit from portfolio growth in interest and finance income was offset by a decline in other revenue portfolio yield of 34 8 decreased from 35 1 in the prior quarter and 36 5 in the year ago quarter reflecting a lower blended yield on new originations higher past due balances and an increased proportion of lines of credit other revenue was down slightly due to lower fee income in odx reflecting the wind down of a bank relationship interest expense decreased slightly from the prior quarter and prior year to 10 7 million reflecting improved borrowing costs as debt balances increased to fund portfolio growth and share repurchase the cost of funds rate improved to 4 8 from 5 6 in the year ago quarter and 5 3 in the prior quarter reflecting lower market interest rates and lower borrowing spreads on issued debt net interest margin was 29 1 essentially flat with the prior quarter and down from 29 9 in the year ago quarter as a lower portfolio yield was partially offset by improved funding costs provision for credit losses was 44 0 million up slightly from the prior quarter and up 4 2 million from the year ago quarter largely reflecting increased reserves for portfolio growth the allowance for credit losses increased to 151 million at year end up 3 million from the prior quarter end and 11 million from a year ago the reserve ratio was 12 2 at december 31 2019 essentially unchanged from the prior and year ago quarters the provision rate of 7 1 increased from 6 8 in the prior quarter and 6 0 in the year ago quarter the net charge off rate improved slightly from the prior quarter to 13 5 reflecting higher recoveries and increased from 12 0 in the year ago quarter the 15 day delinquency ratio increased to 9 0 from 8 5 the prior quarter reflecting softness in certain industries including wholesale trade manufacturing and transportation total operating expense of 54 4 million increased 2 7 million from the prior quarter and 9 5 million from the year ago quarter the sequential increase was driven by several items including a write down of certain capitalized software costs an increase in reserves for unfunded commitments and severance costs the annual change also reflected costs related to our strategic initiatives including our acquisition in canada the efficiency ratio increased to 48 7 from 45 9 the prior quarter and 41 1 the year ago quarter while the adjusted efficiency ratio increased to 46 7 from 43 8 the prior quarter and 39 4 the year ago quarter we had a net benefit for income taxes of 5 4 million in the fourth quarter which was driven by a 7 5 million reversal of the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax asset there was a net tax benefit of 1 6 million in the prior quarter which included a 2 8 million tax credit related to prior years research and development costs excluding these benefits provision for income taxes was approximately 2 1 million in the fourth quarter and 1 2 million the prior quarter there was no income tax expense in the year ago quarter as taxable income was completely offset by net operating loss carryforwards total assets increased 2 from the prior quarter and 12 from a year ago to 1 3 billion reflecting portfolio growth cash and cash equivalents were 56 million down from approximately 60 million in the prior and year ago quarters debt increased to 915 million from 871 million at september 30 2019 driven by the funding of portfolio growth and the share repurchase program and increased 12 from 816 million a year ago primarily reflecting loan growth total ondeck stockholders equity of 294 million was down from 315 million the prior quarter as the 33 million of share repurchases outpaced fourth quarter retained earnings and equity issued for stock based compensation however book value per diluted common share outstanding increased to 4 26 from 4 15 at september 30 2019 and 3 75 a year ago as the diluted share count decreased from 79 5 million a year ago and 75 9 million the prior quarter to 69 0 million at december 31 2019 review of financial results for full year 2019 net income of 28 0 million or 0 36 per diluted share increased from 27 0 million or 0 34 per diluted share in 2018 adjusted net income of 26 0 million or 0 34 per diluted share decreased from 44 8 million or 0 57 per diluted share in 2018 gross revenue increased 12 to 444 5 million primarily due to increased interest and finance income driven by portfolio growth average loans and finance receivables grew 15 from 2018 and net interest margin increased 30 basis points to 29 2 as funding cost improvements outpaced yield compression other revenue increased slightly from 2018 credit performance normalized in 2019 after a strong 2018 provision for credit losses increased 17 to 173 4 million and the corresponding provision rate increased from 6 0 to 7 0 the net charge off rate increased to 13 6 due in part to elevated losses on loans originated in the second half of 2018 and the 15 delinquency ratio increased to 9 0 due in part to our decision to retain and collect late stage delinquent accounts in house the allowance for credit losses increased at a rate commensurate with portfolio growth and the reserve ratio of 12 2 was unchanged from a year ago operating expenses increased to 206 3 million driven by investments in our strategic growth initiatives including developing a new modular platform for odx investments in the international business including the acquisition of evolocity in canada launching equipment finance and costs related to our pursuit of a bank charter these investments resulted in our efficiency ratio and adjusted efficiency ratio increasing to 46 4 and 44 0 respectively ondeck accrued for income taxes in 2019 as us federal net operating loss carryforwards were fully utilized however the company recorded a net 3 5 million tax benefit in 2019 driven by a 7 5 million reduction in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset and 2 8 million tax credit related to prior year research and development costs the full year 2019 effective tax rate is not indicative of an ongoing effective tax rate due to the aforementioned 10 3 million of discrete items excluding those items our effective tax rate would have been approximately 34 which is above the us statutory rates primarily because we do not record tax benefits from losses in our international subsidiaries authorization to repurchase common shares on july 29 2019 the ondeck board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million of common stock with the shares to be held in treasury and available for possible re issuance during the third quarter of 2019 ondeck repurchased 3 2 million shares for 11 0 million and during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company repurchased 7 5 million

securities current expected credit loss cecl implementation ondeck adopted the new accounting standard for measuring credit losses on financial instruments january 1 2020 upon adoption the net change in the required allowance for credit losses was minimal with an approximately 3 million decrease driven by lower required reserves for lines of credit additionally the 7 million reserve for unfunded line of credit commitments previously included in other liabilities was eliminated as part of the adoption these changes resulted in a net increase of approximately 10 million in stockholder s equity upon adoption the prospective impact on the company s provision for credit losses and reserve ratio is expected to be immaterial and is included in the 2020 financial guidance provided below however the new cecl methodology will increase cyclical volatility in the measures due to the requirement to incorporate future economic impact predictions in the analysis 2020 financial guidance ondeck

international funds have been on a joy ride over the past few years specifically in 2019 of the 471 funds ranked on the basis of their returns during the year the top 12 were international schemes be

remove ad according to value research international funds as a category delivered 13 38 per cent over the last one year compared to the 14 05 per cent returns that multi cap funds gave this performance may look unattractive but international funds come in various hues look closer and you ll see that funds investing in the us markets did phenomenally well last year us focussed international funds gave 26 38 percent returns in 2019 however the performance chart is headed by edelweiss greater china equity offshore fund with 45 74 per cent return in 2019 investing overseas story continues below advertisement remove ad central bankers worldwide cut interest rates last year to spur growth it resulted in strong rally in both bond and stock markets with a significant amount of developed market debt trading at near zero yields there is not enough room for further easing in rates and equity markets are already trading at above average valuations it is unlikely that this performance would sustain in 2020 says rajesh cheruvu chief investment officer validus wealth though you should be diversifying overseas using international equity funds if you are going to invest in us focussed equity funds going by their returns in the last one year then it is highly likely that you will be disappointed says ashish shanker head investment advisory motilal oswal private wealth management put simply investors must moderate their return expectations from mutual fund schemes investing overseas especially usa focussed funds story continues below advertisement remove ad of course there is the benefit of diversification when the indian equity markets do not do well there is a fair chance that markets overseas may be doing well says vikas gupta chief investment strategist omniscience capital investing in diverse geographies help to reduce risk by investing overseas investors can ring fence the portfolio from local issues that sometimes affect the indian economy which in turn destroy the returns said deepak chhabria founder and managing director of axiom financial services given that india is still import dependent the rupee dollar exchange rate becomes important to benefit from the global themes you should invest some part of your equity portfolio in overseas markets if you are likely to spend on dollar dependent goods and services the best way to protect yourself is to allocate some of your funds to dollar denominated investments where should you invest there are many themes and industries that cannot be found in indian equity markets for instance a lot has been talked about the disruption caused by technological advances in indian markets we do not get access to themes such as search engines e commerce artificial intelligence internet of things if you invest in developed markets you get to invest in companies that operate in such emerging themes low correlation with developed markets also helps to bring down portfolio volatility especially when panic sets in for example s p 500 index fell 38 5 per cent in 2008 when nifty 50 index halved though investing overseas can be a good idea low familiarity with global markets can be a big impediment for most investors it is better to invest through regulated products such as mutual funds low cost index funds and actively managed funds investing in us equities are effective tools to invest overseas says shanker indian investors have exposure to one of the best emerging markets india to begin with hence they should be investing in the developed markets start with the us said gupta it is better to invest in a staggered manner investors should avoid investing in thematic funds investing overseas these themes include commodities energy agriculture consumer real estate gold mining and technology chhabria points out that investors may not manage to time the entry and exit well how much to invest some experience in domestic investing would help before you take the overseas route your portfolio size and your investment needs should dictate the allocation to global stocks if you have financial goals such as funding the education of your kids abroad and foreign vacations you can have exposure to overseas stocks you can invest up to 20 per cent of your equity portfolio overseas cheruvu says invest through systematic investment plans aim for minimum five per cent exposure to international markets say experts beware of risks though investing in overseas markets gives diversification to your portfolio there are risks issues in the geographies in which you have invested will influence your returns for example the recent corona virus problem is expected to hurt the chinese economy currency fluctuation is also a risk adverse currency movements can eat into your returns factor in rupee depreciation against the dollar into your return expectation though international mutual fund schemes invest in stocks they are treated as debt funds for the purpose of taxation capital gains earned on units held more than three years are taxed at 20 per cent after indexation benefit if redeemed earlier the capital gains are taxed at the slab rate of the investor invest around 5 10 percent of your corpus in international funds international funds can be considered once your domestic portfolio is well diversified the 40 consumption and currency risk argument should be elaborated a bit and a lot simplified
luis arce catacora bolivian presidential candidate for the movement towards socialism party mas is held up by supporters as he is welcomed at the airport before he departs el alto bolivia jan 28 arce was endorsed by exiled president evo morales as his party s candidate for may 3 presidential elections juan karita ap bolivia s presidential elections are scheduled to take place on may 3 2020 the elections will be organized by the transitional government of jeanine áñez who seized power in a u s backed military coup on november 10 2019 the coup forced out the democratically elected leftist indigenous government of evo morales who presided over an economic boom following a rejection of imf imposed neoliberal measures the elections that brought áñez to power were announced after a pacification of the country that saw two massacres of indigenous protesters who rose up by the hundreds of thousands calling for the return of morales the u s embassy hailed the transitional period as a courageous defense of democracy and praised the commitment of the áñez administration to free and fair elections the technical organization of the elections will be carried out in conjunction with usaid and the organization of american states oas the election run up has already been marked by persecution and threats against the most prominent figures of morales s movement towards socialism mas party nevertheless the mas is keen to go ahead with the elections and polls show that they still wield considerable influence in the country the mas has also selected candidates choosing luis arce catacora and david choquehuanca to run for president and vice president respectively catacora served as morales s economy minister while choquehuanca was his longest serving foreign minister the two were initially selected on january 19 by a commission of social movement and party leaders who traveled to buenos aires they were then approved on the following thursday by the pacto de unidad the unity pact of mas affiliated social movements catacora and choquehuanca are likely to face an array of right wing candidates almost all of whom have deep and direct ties to washington that long pre date the november coup that forced morales to flee the country they range from centrist neoliberals to far right authoritarians the u s state department is flexible in whom it works with this article is the first installment of a two part series covering the coming election this article will focus on the mas candidates look at their politics and track record in government and will judge the strength of morales s party in this new climate of persecution against them the second installment will explore the pro coup candidates and their ties to washington the instrumento the mas as an organization certainly isn t a party with orthodox structures and organization it grew out of debates within the indigenous campesino movement about the need for a political instrument to represent the country s indigenous majority and in particular organized rural campesinos farmers and peasants who had never had the opportunity to participate in mainstream politics long dominated by a tiny white urban elite by the time the mas was fully formed it had grown to become a coalition of the most important organized indigenous movements in alliance with a collection of middle class urban marxist intellectuals who had broken with dogmatic thinking that looked down on the indigenous campesino movement choquehuanca and catacora come precisely from those two currents respectively the two ideological currents are born from entirely distinct cultures and experiences but nevertheless have managed to coexist within the party for 20 years with varying levels of tension indigenism and economic stability the newspaper página siete labeled the duo as representing indigenism and economic stability as they struggled to find a basis with which to smear two of morales s most popular former ministers catacora had served as morales s economy minister throughout the entire process of change he is seen as the brains behind bolivia s economic miracle that followed the nationalization of natural resources and strategic industries fake charges were drawn up against him by the áñez administration less than 24 hours after he was announced as a candidate catacora was born and raised in urban la paz studying economics at the highest levels he went on to earn a master s degree from warwick university in the uk a ph d in bolivia and a job at the central bank yet catacora really earned his stripes during the years of social struggle in the early 2000s when evo morales was a union leader during those years he ran a marxist study circle in la paz called los duendes made up of former members of marcelo quiroga s socialist party los duendes was part of a web of new radical intellectual circles grappling with what the future of the left would be following the collapse of the soviet union and what a transition to socialism would look like in the new age of globalization in a 2015 interview he recalled the kind of discussions they had in the 90s the privatizations began the book the end of history by francis fukuyama came out where capitalism was said to be the last stage in los duendes we argued that this was impossible we set out to present what comes after neoliberalism this research would later be reflected in the plans of the mas we had to work on proposing an economic model that we could later implement there were a number of such groups the most prominent being former vice president álvaro garcía linera s comuna group commenting on his relationship with linera s group catacora said in a meeting of the duende group with álvaro garcía linera we agreed on several positions and realized that we spoke the same language pursued the same objective but using different instruments and tools comuna observed the sociological political process in great depth while duende worked on the transition to socialism from the point of view of the construction of a new economic model his role in this milieu of heterodox marxist intellectuals is how catacora earned his place in the movement towards socialism he and álvaro garcía are representatives of this scene par excellence but it s also the reason there s been some disquiet among some sections of the indigenous movements some see this layer as a privileged group the invitados who are bequeathed with candidacies to high office despite not rising through the ranks of the indigenous and workers movements it s a complaint i ve heard repeatedly at internal party and union meetings across the country even in morales s ultra loyal base in the chaparé region though this creative tension has always existed in his speech proclaiming catacora as candidate morales repeated his understanding of the movement as an alliance of indigenous groups and the blancos sanos the good whites sumaq qamaña david choquehuanca the vice presidential candidate was morales s first and longest serving foreign minister and the second longest serving minister after catacora in a cabinet that was otherwise changing every season choquehuanca is himself indigenous aymara and is overwhelmingly favored by indigenous movements across the country i was in huanuni oruro at a meeting of pacto de unidad when one member after another nominated him for president in fact some are now upset that he s been selected for the lesser role of vice president choquehuanca is the mas s primary theorist of its indigenous wing as foreign minister he convened conferences across latin america to expound the concept of sumaq qamaña living well sumaq qamaña is a philosophy based on indigenous principles of reciprocity collectiveness balance with mother nature pachamama decolonization recuperation of indigenous music art dance and forms of living not as a folkloric or ethnic part of bolivian culture but as the central basis of national identity choquehuanca summed it up as to live well sumaq qamaña is to look for the experience in community where all members care for all the most important thing is not the human prioritized by socialism nor money prioritized by capitalism but life it is intended to seek a simpler life become the path of harmony between nature and life choquehuanca s résumé would suggest a life on the traditional marxist left he received a scholarship to study at a political cadre school in cuba and after leaving the foreign ministry he became secretary of alba the principal international organization of the latin american left nevertheless his championing of indigenous philosophy and proximity to campesino movements rather than the urban left have won him a solid base of support particularly in the andean departments of bolivia he received crucial backing in the indigenous city of el alto where in mid december he was proclaimed the chosen candidate at a meeting of mas aligned movements in the city the mood among attendees was hopeful but also determined to have choquehuanca and no one else as candidate the chair of the meeting didn t mince words he s a man who looks for unity for the sumaq qamaña that s why we ve attached ourselves to him as an indigenous leader as a leader for the unity of the whole country we respect the decision of the rank and file to back choquehuanca we re not going to allow impositions when it was announced that choquehuanca was chosen to run as vice president those same movements were enraged choquehuanca himself came out to calm fears praising catacora and pointing out that the right want to divide us and they ll have a party if we let ourselves be divided whatever concerns there are about the pair it s undeniable that they better than anyone represent the two ideological currents that made the mas into what it is today in power catacora and choquehuanca steered the two most important policy transformations of their period in government bolivia s foreign policy has seen the most dramatic change since the coup in just a couple of months the áñez administration has re established full diplomatic relations with the united states and israel withdrew from alba recognized the self declared juan guaidó as president of venezuela cut ties with cuba and rolled out the red carpet for usaid it was choquehuanca s work building an anti imperialist foreign policy that was undone with the most haste it was under his leadership at the foreign ministry that the u s ambassador was expelled u s military bases were closed and bolivia restricted israeli visas in solidarity with the people of gaza choquehuanca also oversaw bolivia s policy of solidarity with venezuela cuba and other progressive countries when they were under attack by the united states these issues are likely to surface prominently in the coming election the economic miracle as crucial as foreign policy has been for the regime the bolivian economic model brainchild of catacora is the centerpiece of the mas electoral campaign the early phase of the model can be summarized as the nationalization of strategic industries the profits from which provide the bolivian state the resources to invest in previously non existent infrastructure and social spending this stimulates internal demand and feeds the growth of the private sector in particular the tertiary sector the next phase which bolivia had only just begun to embark on before the coup was the industrialization of natural resources the aim was to surpass the country s former position in the global south condemned to live off the export of cheap raw materials european social democratic parties such as the uk labour party often limit nationalization plans to industries they consider to be vital public services like health transportation and utilities in bolivia nationalization reached the upper echelons of the economy and in early years included natural resources natural gas some mining lithium telecommunications entel airports transport boa the national airline teleférico and manufacturing including numerous state owned factories in a variety of industries from cement to paper this meant that profits stayed in the country and allowed the government to cover its costs and embark on ambitious social spending rural development and infrastructure projects like building highways in areas of the country that had only ever known seclusion and dirt roads this in turn stimulated the private sector the movement of goods along with higher living standards meant that the number of registered businesses grew by 500 percent by the end of morales s second term in the years prior to the mas economic reforms bolivia could only generate enough cash to cover basic costs and debts by printing money resulting in an annual inflation rate of over 27 000 by 1985 though the hyperinflationary era was overcome the neoliberal shock therapy that was used to overcome it left the government as little more than an estado mendigo beggar state a term morales often used to describe the period of dependency on western financial institutions and aid western ngos flourished in bolivia as attempts to deal with the humanitarian crisis were farmed out to them by 2005 the year before morales was first elected outgoing neoliberal president carlos mesa s resignation speech turned into a bizarre tirade as he explained the extent to which the bolivian economy was no longer able to pay for even the most basic functions of the state mesa explained how even public sector salaries were only being paid at all thanks to the charity that he had begged for at the imf and other western institutions in addressing the economic failures of the neoliberal period the results are undeniable the economy today is over three times the size it was in 2005 the purchasing power of minimum wage workers has skyrocketed as rapid wage growth has been combined with low inflation the rate of general poverty that once stood at over 60 in 2005 dropped to around 34 percent by 2018 in 2005 35 of bolivians belonged to the middle class now over 60 percent do that s around three million people in a country of 11 million cities like el alto are no longer centers of appalling poverty and underdevelopment but are engines of growth for the whole country indeed el alto has been host to a particular kind of growth that has meant some of its newly wealthy indigenous residents have produced a new modern and luxury evolution of andean culture rather than turning to western chain stores and miami holidays like other latin americans who have dollars to spare the interior and exterior of the cholets mansions owned by indigenous residents of el alto incorporate andean colors and designs into their property in flagrant defiance of western architectural norms the next phase of the economic model was industrialization a path that was just beginning to be realized before it was interrupted by the coup the idea is simple and was already yielding results not content with merely redistributing the profits of exporting raw materials the bolivian government was preparing the industrialization of those natural resources meaning that rather than exporting crude gas or lithium in its natural state the government would invest in building the industrial capacity to process those materials in bolivia and sell value added finished products this was already taking place with bolivia s vast lithium reserves the country was producing its first domestically manufactured cars that included batteries made with lithium when evo morales first came to power bolivia exported natural gas but imported refined gas used for cooking and heating now however bolivia is a net exporter of refined gas this is only possible because of state investment in nationalized companies enormous challenges ahead the mas has chosen its candidates the social movements that form the party back them they re ahead in the polls and the u s backed right is divided among at least four candidates in normal conditions this would bode extremely well for the party but of course these elections are not taking place in a normal environment they re taking place in an environment where mas activists are being jailed on charges of sedition for posting memes where arrest warrants are issued to those who hosted left wing radio shows where even the mas s presidential candidate has fake charges hanging over him charges that were invented the day after his candidacy was announced will he spend election day in a cell there s every reason to believe that even if the elections aren t rigged then the persecution against the mas could well be ramped up to the extent where they cannot in any way campaign openly will the u s human rights industry and the oas speak up bolivians are not holding their breath this article was first published here on mintpress news reposted by permission
intellectual property raises costs of living kuala lumpur malaysia feb 11 2020 ips many medicines and medical tests are unaffordable to most of humanity owing to the ability of typically transnational pharmaceutical giants to abuse their monopoly powers enforced by intellectual property laws to set prices to maximize profits over the long term most basic research is funded by government grants and in recent years by philanthropic initiatives when a profitable opportunity presents itself venture capitalists fund last leg efforts to patent an innovation and take it to market as the patent holder takes all patents a form of intellectual property rights iprs are believed by many to be necessary to incentivise innovation and to recover research and development costs by creating a temporary legal monopoly iprs are monopoly rights after securing patents patent holders typically take additional measures to deter and undermine potential competitors and to consolidate and extend their monopoly position for as long as possible by any means available private companies have then used their monopolies to charge exorbitant prices in 2015 turing pharmaceuticals bought the rights to daraprim a drug used by cancer and hiv patients to fight deadly parasitic infections raising its price 50 fold from usd13 50 to usd750 the price gouging company was controlled by martin shkreli dubbed pharma bro by the us media and once deemed america s most hated man private companies eager to extend their monopolies try to evergreen them by registering follow on patents involving minor variations closely linked to the original invention by evergreening the patents system has been used by companies to create long term monopolies others engage in patent trolling obtaining many patents to profit from litigation or licensing without inventing anything or making products of their own trolling enables patent owners to blackmail those in need to their patents sometimes by creating patent thickets webs of overlapping iprs and related bottlenecks limiting utilization of patented knowledge and effectively hindering further innovation before the us withdrew from the trans pacific partnership tpp in january 2017 tpp provisions would have extended ip protections to cover biologics i e naturally occurring substances such as insulin for diabetes patients these onerous tpp provisions have been suspended in the successor comprehensive and progressive tpp cptpp following us withdrawal but can easily be reinstated e g to induce the us to rejoin the tpp tripping up public health through various means us style ipr regimes have spread worldwide since adoption of the world trade organization s wto agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips under trips all wto members have to provide a minimum level of ipr protection which includes among other things patent protection for a minimum of 20 years including for imported iprs registered in other countries trips also stipulates conditions for using the compulsory licence concession allowing governments to license the use of a patented invention to a third party or government agency without the consent of the patent holder there is moot evidence that trips benefits developing countries by attracting foreign investment promoting technological transfer and increasing innovation instead trips has imposed substantial avoidable costs on developing countries where developing countries have made use of trips concessions they have faced international pressure from pharmaceutical giants and their governments to limit if not eliminate the scope of these exceptions malaysia is the first country to use compulsory licencing under trips to produce sofosbuvir for hepatitis c treatment the drug from patent owner gilead costs almost rm300 000 usd68 000 for the full course while generic substitutes cost just over rm1000 us big pharma has applied pressure on malaysia to stop using its compulsory licence ip for intellectual piracy developing countries are generally unable to check the monopolistic practices of transnational pharmaceutical conglomerates due to underdeveloped antitrust regimes weak law enforcement capacities and their influential partners such companies may re package medicinal products and processes from developing countries traditional knowledge systems to secure patents on them including naturally occurring substances known as biologics turmeric is widely used in india for medicine food and dye among other things in 1995 the us granted the university of mississippi medical center a patent for the use and administration of turmeric powder to heal wounds granting it an exclusive right to sell and distribute turmeric the indian council for scientific and industrial research csir objected arguing that turmeric had been so used in india for centuries providing historical references in sanskrit urdu hindi and other languages the us patent was eventually revoked because it lacked the novelty element but it required herculean efforts alternatives developing countries are now no longer able to require technology transfer further limiting their ability to develop their own technological capacities and capabilities hence many developing country governments are told they have no other way to industrialize except by generously inducing transnational companies to locate parts of their value adding activities in their economies innovation intellectual property and development by joseph stiglitz dean baker and arjun jayadev suggests alternatives to incentivise innovation especially relevant for developed economies these include centralized direct r d financing decentralized funding through tax breaks for research spending using prizes to recognize and reward innovative research and establishing open source platforms to promote free knowledge flows without the strong private monopolies enabled by current ip rules the currently unaffordable prices of medicines and other products can be significantly reduced while developing countries will have much better prospects for developing internationally competitive industrial

federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the u s central bank is keeping a close eye on fallout from the deadly coronavirus outbreak in china singling it out among risks threatening the u s and world economy in particular we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus which could lead to disruptions in china that spill over to the rest of the global economy powell said in prepared remarks he s scheduled to deliver before u s lawmakers tuesday powell stopped short of saying the outbreak had changed the fed s baseline outlook for the u s economy or the expectation among many members of the federal open market committee that rates will remain on hold this year the fomc believes that the current stance of monetary policy will support continued economic growth a strong labor market and inflation returning to the committee s symmetric 2 objective powell said as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate coronavirus which has killed more than 1 000 people has prompted the world s largest known quarantine effort and slowed large portions of china s economy disrupting travel and commerce worldwide powell is set to appear before the house financial services committee at 10 a m in washington the fed chief will answer questions from lawmakers following his prepared remarks he s also scheduled for a hearing before the senate banking committee at 10 a m wednesday as part of his semi annual testimony to congress fed officials have dialed up their concern over the coronavirus in public remarks in recent days vice chairman richard clarida called it a wildcard on jan 31 the fed s semiannual monetary policy report released feb 7 said it was a new risk that could potentially interfere with trade depress commodity prices and cause the u s dollar to appreciate some private sector economists have been less cautious marking down their estimates for first quarter growth in the u s while investors are betting the fed will respond with an interest rate cut later this year labour market in his prepared remarks powell provided a mostly positive picture of the u s economy which was dented but not significantly damaged by slower global growth and international trade disputes in 2019 economic activity increased at a moderate pace and the labor market strengthened further as the economy appeared resilient to the global headwinds that had intensified last summer he said his remarks followed data released last week showing u s employers added a better than expected 225 000 new jobs in january powell said the central bank had been successful in containing a sudden september spike in overnight funding rates that briefly pushed the fed s benchmark lending rate to stray outside its target range repo operations the central bank has conducted emergency lending into the market for repurchase agreements and in october began purchasing 60 billion a month in treasury bills the latter move has boosted bank reserves allowing banks to feed money into the repo market in place of the fed as our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions we intend to gradually transition away from the active use of repo operations he said we intend to slow our purchases to a pace that will allow our balance sheet to grow in line with trend demand for our liabilities powell repeated his concerns over longer term issues holding back growth in the u s economy finding ways to boost labor force participation and productivity growth would benefit americans and should remain a national priority he said federal budget he also warned lawmakers the economy would need support from fiscal policy in the event of a downturn and pressed them to put the federal budget on a sustainable path the white house on monday released president donald trump s proposed 2021 federal budget which included deficit spending of about 1 trillion trump has repeatedly criticized powell for not lowering interest rates further coronavirus emerged as an economic threat in recent months just as the global outlook was beginning to brighten powell and his colleagues cut rates three times in 2019 to guard against the risks posed by trade tensions slow global growth and below target inflation since late last year however fed officials have said monetary policy was in a good place and would remain unchanged unless their outlook for the economy changed materially completion of the china phase one trade deal britain s avoidance of a sudden no deal exit from the european union and a slight improvement in global manufacturing data pointed to a more stable outlook for 2020 after a decidedly rocky 2019 some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently but risks to the outlook remain powell said

nnn earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 national retail properties inc nnn 1 10 q4 2019 earnings call 10 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen hello and thank you all for joining this national retail properties fourth quarter 2019 operating results conference call and with that i am pleased to turn the floor over to chief executive officer mr jay whitehurst welcome jay julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer thank you jim good morning and welcome to the national retail properties fourth quarter 2019 earnings release call joining me on this call is our chief financial officer kevin habicht after some opening remarks i ll turn the call over to kevin to discuss our financial results in more detail 2019 was a year of significant milestones for national retail properties our 35th year in business our 25th year listed on the new york stock exchange and most importantly our 30th year of consecutive annual dividend increases very few public companies and only two other reits has matched this impressive track record of increasing the dividend for 30 consecutive years maintaining and safe and growing dividend is at the heart of our corporate culture and there s nothing in which we take more pride than returning to the owners of the company a meaningful cash return on their investment each year with a dividend coverage ratio of 72 as of year end we remain well positioned to continue the string of dividend increases into the future our steady execution continue to produce impressive outcomes as our core ffo per share increased by 4 2 over 2018 and our total shareholder return was 14 8 for 2019 as you ve heard many times before we run our business with a long term focus on multiyear results true to that philosophy national retail properties delivered total shareholder returns that exceeded the reit averages and many major indices over the past 2 3 5 10 15 20 and 25 year periods respectively turning to our quarterly and annual results our broadly diversified portfolio of over 3 100 single tenant retail properties remains healthy with an occupancy rate of 99 which exceeds our long term average of 98 our high lease renewal rate continued in 2019 approximately 85 of our expiring leases were renewed by the current tenants at approximately 104 of the expiring rent without material investment of lease incentives or tenant improvement dollars on the acquisition front we concluded an active fourth quarter investing 243 million in 79 new single tenant retail properties at an initial cash cap rate of 6 8 for the year 2019 we invested 752 5 million in 210 single tenant retail properties at an initial cash cap rate of 6 9 and with an average lease duration of almost 18 years at an average acquisition price of about 3 5 million per property we continued our underwriting emphasis on low cost and low rent per property which we believe are meaningful contributors to our high occupancy rate and steady income stream over 80 of our dollars invested in 2019 were with our portfolio of relationship tenants we invested in properties leased to almost three dozen relationship tenants in 2019 including 11 relationship tenants with which we did no business in the prior year we also had an active fourth quarter of dispositions selling 16 properties for over 31 million for the year 2019 we sold 59 properties raising 126 million of capital to be recycled into new investments our disposition cap rate in 2019 was 5 9 which is significantly below our yield on new investments accretive recycling of capital remains a strategic advantage for national retail properties as we look ahead to 2020 there are a few other strategic differences between national retail properties and many other reits that i would like to highlight we ve mentioned these differences previously but they bear repeating first per share results are what really matter you will never meet a management team more concerned with per share results and less concerned with growth for the sake of growth than the management team at national retail properties reit headlines are often devoted to the volume of acquisitions in any given quarter or year to us what matters is consistent multiyear growth in per share results while maintaining a conservative balance sheet not headline growth in our asset base this approach to creating shareholder value allows us to be highly selective in our acquisitions and positions us to perpetuate our long term track record of consistent core ffo per share growth with less execution risk and more focus on quality real estate second national retail properties portfolio embodies the healthy vibrant segment of retail and retail real estate our tenants typically operate large regional and national businesses that focus on customer services customer experiences and e commerce resistant consumer necessities we had very little exposure to apparel or other retail concepts that are struggling with e commerce and getting negative headlines the primary lines of trade to make up our tenant mix are expanding and adding stores and our major tenants are playing offense in their respective businesses moreover our focus is on acquiring good real estate locations at reasonable rents by concentrating our underwriting on these factors we create an enduring margin of safety that better withstands any turmoil in the general economy or in any tenants individual business during the depth of the recession in 2008 and 2009 our occupancy rate never dipped below 96 4 and for the last seven years our occupancy rate has hovered around 98 to 99 third and probably most important our exceptional people make all the difference in all aspects of our business we re running a marathon not a sprint and that philosophy is reflected in our dedicated and talented associates the long tenure of our team is a key strategic benefit our senior executives average 19 years with the company more than 50 of our associates have been with us for at least 10 years and over 70 of our associates have been with the company for five years or more this is a stark contrast to many other reits and a competitive advantage when it comes to institutional memory and commitment to our business model i m awed and humbled every day by the talent and commitment of our associates along this line i also want to note the continued evolution of our board of directors in the last few years we have refreshed our board with new high powered talented directors bringing broader diversity of background experience tenure and gender than ever before our board of directors is well positioned to provide effective and valuable oversight as we look ahead to the new decade let me comment briefly on one last key differentiator which investors should consider consistency as we ve said before the best word to describe national retail properties is consistent consistent investment focus on single tenant retail properties consistency of people and culture consistently raising the dividend for 30 consecutive years consistent conservative balance sheet philosophy that maintains flexibility and dry powder and consistently generating mid single digits per share growth on a multiyear basis our consistent business plan focus and execution has positioned national retail properties to weather inevitable market turmoil and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise let me now turn the call over to kevin for more color on our quarterly and annual numbers kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jay and as usual i ll start with the cautionary statement that we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward looking statements under federal securities laws and the company s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in these forward looking statements and we may not release revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect changes after the statement four main factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are disclosed from time to time in greater detail the company s filings with the sec and in this morning s press release with that headlines from this morning s press release report quarterly core ffo results of 0 70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 full year 2019 core ffo results were 2 76 per share which is 4 2 higher than prior year results and is consistent with our projections and guidance we continue to grow per share results while maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet as jay mentioned and we re required to say every 15 minutes we increased our annual dividend for 30 consecutive years in 2019 and our affo dividend payout ratio for the year was 72 2 which was down a modest 20 basis points from 2018 occupancy was strong at 99 at december 31 g a expense was 5 8 of revenues for the fourth quarter and 5 6 for the year 2019 for purposes of modeling future results the annual base rent for all leases in place as of december 31 2019 was 674 3 million so the one way to model rent for 2020 is to use this amount as your annual run rate as of january 1 2020 and then add or subtract rent for assumed acquisitions or dispositions this alleviates needing to try to estimate the timing of q4 acquisitions and dispositions for purposes of projecting 2020 you all are obviously aware that the capital markets environments for both debt and equity have been favorable we continue to take advantage of that in 2019 and raised 525 million of common equity via our drip as well as an equity offering in september and our atm additionally we sold 126 million of properties in 2019 so this 126 million of disposition proceeds plus 525 million of new common equity plus 129 million of retained operating cash flow that s after all dividend payments totaled 780 million of equity like capital raised in 2019 which notably exceeds the 752 million of total 2019 acquisition activity as we pointed out in the past and consistent with our past couple of decades of practice we expect to behave in a relatively leverage neutral manner over time we remain in very good leverage and liquidity position which will allow us to maintain an active acquisition effort into 2020 this morning we also we maintained our 2020 core ffo guidance of 2 83 to 2 87 per share and affo guidance of 2 90 to 2 94 per share which implies 3 to 4 growth in per share results and that s consistent with where we started our guidance for growth in 2019 assumptions for 2020 guidance can be found on page seven of the press release and include 550 million to 650 million of acquisitions in the mid fixed cap range g a expense of 42 million to 43 million which is 5 9 of revenues no real change in occupancy property expenses net of reimbursement of 8 million to 9 million and property dispositions of 80 million to 120 million we do not give guidance on capital markets plan while we clearly have made some assumptions in that regard we never feel particularly bound to follow them we try to be opportunistic in getting capital when it s available and well priced and when in doubt get more sooner as i believe i mentioned on the call last quarter we try to keep capital raising and capital deploying somewhat separated in our mind but you should expect our behavior to remain consistent with the past 25 years meaning maintaining a conservative leverage profile with a multiyear view of managing the company and the balance sheet our investment strategy in terms of property type tenant type balance sheet strategy have been very consistent for many years looking at the balance sheet we ended 2019 with 134 million outstanding on our 900 million bank line notably our weighted average outstanding balance for 2019 was only 24 million and only averages 75 million for the past six years in october 2019 we redeemed 287 5 million of our 5 7 preferred stock we were able to redeem this preferred equity with common equity proceeds on an accretive basis which does not happen often with a 5 7 coupon preferred leverage metrics remain very strong our next debt maturity is october 2022 and our weighted average debt maturity is now 8 3 years our balance sheet remains in good position to fund future acquisitions and to weather potential economic and capital market turmoil quarter end and year end leverage metrics net debt to gross book assets was 35 3 as you know we re not particularly sound market cap based leverage metrics particularly relevant more relevant net debt to ebitda was 4 9x at december 31 interest coverage was 5 0x and fixed charge coverage was 4 0x for 2019 only five of our 3 118 properties are encumbered by mortgages totaling 12 million so 2019 was a down the middle year for us and 2020 looks to be another year of solid growth in operating results but we trust but i should say trust that as we move through 2020 we are also thinking about how to continue those results in 2021 and 2022 with that jim we will open it up to any questions questions and answers operator gentlemen thank you for your remarks we ll hear first from the line of christy mcelroy at citi christy mcelroy citi analyst hey good morning thanks guys kevin i appreciate your comments on leverage and i understand you don t give guidance on capital market plans but just more philosophically in regard to maintaining that conservative leverage level is it a fair assumption that embedded in your 2020 assumptions you would be you would maintain a consistent leverage level with what you averaged during 2019 kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think that s generally fair i will say in both 2018 and 2019 we over equitized a bit and i will say too i think at this point i ll point out while we raised a lot of equity like capital in 2019 i view the preferred that we redeemed as equity and so in my mind and i know not all investors think of preferred and the equity bucket but in my mind we reduced equity somewhat and so i view that i understand it s a deleveraging action but i view it as eliminating some equity so some of that was tempered some of the equity raised from 2019 was tempered by the fact we were deemed preferred equity but to answer your question yes you should assume we re going to be leverage neutral for the year julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes christy this is jay just to add on to that we as you know we re very committed to maintaining a significant volume of dry powder all the time but in the event the need to use some of that dry powder were to arise due to market conditions or some great opportunity we re prepared to use it christy mcelroy citi analyst okay thanks for that and then i guess just sort of in that context as you think about your acquisition pipeline and what you might have in the deal pipeline currently and what you might have completed or have under contract year to date i m wondering how we should be thinking about timing in regard to your guidance and also if you could maybe comment on cap rate trends that you re seeing kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer sure well i ll start with the last part first cap rates the last two years probably i ve said cap rates are generally flat to maybe trending down a little bit and so let me just reiterate that comment again cap rates are not going up by any means they may be drifting down a little bit we ve been consistent in the 6 8 6 9 initial yield ballpark for the last couple of years and we think it may be it may trend down a little bit this year but generally stay pretty close to where they ve been pipeline looks good out there but the vast majority of our acquisitions are through our relationship tenants and we continue to do off market direct business with those relationship tenants that gives us great comfort about deal flow julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer i think kevin i d say our guidance is a little bit back end loaded kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer yes which is fairly typical for us i think of it as kind of 40 60 if you will first half second half of 2019 probably in that ballpark again this year julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer we had a very active fourth quarter where some of the things that might have slipped into the beginning part of this year we closed at the end of last year so an active fourth quarter sets you up nicely for the upcoming year christy mcelroy citi analyst okay that s helpful thanks guys appreciate it operator thank you next we ll hear from the line of brian hawthorne with rbc capital brian hawthorne rbc capital analyst good morning can you talk about the key relationship unit growth expectations for 2020 and then all the units that you guys are buying are these units that are available because they were new to the relationships so that they brought them to market or are these kind of older properties that have been owned by your key owned by the key relationships for a while now julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes yes brian our the business that we do with our relationship tenants runs the gamut of both of the types of transactions that you described in some instances it s funding new construction or new buildings for them in some instances it s doing sale leaseback of existing built landed building that is on the tenant s books in some instances sometimes our relationship tenants are doing m a activities they re acquiring another company and using the real estate of the target company to be part of their capital structure for that acquisition so when we have a relationship with these tenants there s all kinds of different programs that we offer to them and different ways for us to do business with them we do in the last few years it s been around 80 of our dollars invested have been with our relationship tenants this year maybe i expect we ll be somewhere in that same kind of ballpark but it just depends on what else is for sale out there and that so we don t give guidance on the level of volume with our specifically with our relationship tenants but to follow up on the first question and yours we remain very comfortable with the overall acquisition guidance that s out there brian hawthorne rbc capital analyst great thank you operator thank you next we ll hear from the line of rob stevenson over at janney rob stevenson janney analyst good morning guys jay when looking at your leasing data at the back of the supplemental anything abnormal about the mix of renewals with the same tenant versus vacancy release to the new tenant mix in 2019 versus prior years and versus what it s likely to be in 2020 i mean you re releasing totals close to flat in 2019 is that something that we should be expecting in 2020 and rolling forward here is there anything abnormal that happened in 2019 that would impact that one way or the other julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes no rob that s a good question and i would say there s really nothing abnormal at all it felt very consistent and down the middle of the fairway to me the renewals with the same tenants it was about 85 of the leases that came due renewed with the same tenant at 104 of prior rent and so that s actually a little bit better than our long term average our long term average is around 80 renewals at about 100 of prior rent so that was a little bit to the good side but generally consistent with history and then on releasing the 23 properties that we released at just about 80 of prior rents that was also probably on the high side of the bandwidth we what we ve told folks all along is that generally our releasing is of those few properties that don t get renewed our releasing is around 70 of prior rent so we did a little bit better in 2019 but again i wouldn t take that as any kind of a particular trend i do want to stress on the releasing that we re very focused on releasing the properties as is as opposed to putting in ti dollars and lease incentive dollars that might make the releasing stats look better but we don t think that s a great investment of our capital we would rather release properties as is and keep the rent as low as possible rather than put money in and crow about a higher releasing spread rob stevenson janney analyst okay and then how are you guys feeling these days about the auto parts business number nine line of trade for you guys obviously advance auto parts has had some issues some of the other guys have had issues on and off or whatever how do you guys think about that and your mix within the auto parts business rolling forward for the next few years julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes we re the tenants that we that make up that category for us are some of the strong national tenants so we feel very good about the overall companies that are our tenants there and the real estate that makes up those properties there s a lot of smaller retail locations at very reasonable low rents and so yes over time we think those real estate locations will if necessary find another user over time that their we have good security in that real estate we feel like rob stevenson janney analyst okay and then kevin how are you feeling about preferred stock these days and where do you think you d price today at a 155 treasury kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer yes my gut is at the moment we re not leaning in that direction the way we think about this and stacking up alternatives is thinking about 10 year debt 30 year debt and then perpetual preferred and comparing those absolute rates as well as the relative rates between those and today i d probably lean more in the debt category than the preferred equity category but it s not to say we won t do it again we have one existing preferred tranche outstanding 5 2 345 million or 5 2 preferred i don t that feels like a good piece of capital for us but today preferred would get price close to a 5 rate maybe a touch lower and so it is attractive i don t think that s something we plan to pull the trigger on this year but as i said we don t give guidance around that we try to be opportunistic but at the moment it doesn t feel like that s the route to go rob stevenson janney analyst okay thanks guys appreciate it operator spenser allaway with green street advisors please go ahead with your questions your line is open spenser allaway green street advisors analyst thank you would you mind providing some color on your tenant watch list and maybe just along the same lines just curious how much of your disposition guidance do you guys expect to be strategic just in terms of reducing exposure to their particular segments or tenants julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes i mean i ll speak to the watch list it hasn t changed materially since we last talked a quarter ago we ve got logan s roadhouse on there barnes nobles on there ruby tuesday is on there pier 1 petsmart petco but the sum total of all those or i should say each of those are under 1 exposures and in total the composition and size of the watch list as we define it which is a bit of an art form is not changed from where it was a quarter ago we currently have two tenants that are in bankruptcy but the total of those two are less than 1 of our total annual base rent so we don t expect any real noise there kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer spenser i d add that that s our credit watch list separately we also analyzed the underlying real estate parcels for what s a good location what are reasonable rents with these tenants that are on the credit watch list and the culling in our disposition process where we sell some of our noncore properties are typically the ones where we might be worried about the tenant s credit or thinking about the tenant s credit but we also look at the real estate and say this is going to be harder to replace this rent with a second tenant a lot of the vast majority of the real estate owned by the tenants or leased to the tenants on our credit watch list are good locations that we re happy with and feel like we can do well enough if we have to get them back spenser allaway green street advisors analyst okay thank you operator todd stender at wells fargo please go ahead your line is open todd stender wells fargo analyst i may have missed this i didn t hear what you sold in the quarter maybe you can characterize some of the by lease term maybe rent coverage or tenant any characteristics you can share julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes todd the broadly i think for the dispositions for the quarter were maybe 2 3 vacant properties and 1 3 leased properties any one particular quarter i think i wouldn t put too much emphasis on because it s such a small subset of the whole thing over the course of the year our dispositions i think were around kind of 60 of the dollar volume was vacant properties and 40 was leased properties at the 5 9 cap rate job one as it relates to vacant properties job one here is to release those vacancies and but what i what we realized over time was that we were carrying properties for a longer period of time than we probably should have before we said that we re not going to successfully release these properties in a fashion that feels like a good risk adjusted decision to us and so let s go ahead and sell them the duration of the vacant properties that we sold in 2019 was a little bit under a year it was like nine average nine months to a year so you are more likely to see us going forward deciding to sell vacant properties after trying to lease those for that kind of a time period as opposed to continuing to hold on to them and bear the carrying costs while we re trying to find other tenants todd stender wells fargo analyst and no capex has to go in to those to sell them is that correct julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer correct correct they re sold as is todd stender wells fargo analyst okay does that drag down the cap rate i know year to date or for the full year 19 you had a cap rate in the 5s i think your cap rate in q4 was low 6 is that drag down julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer no the cap rate that we quote is just on the properties that are leased so it s not going into the vacants aren t going into the cap rate todd stender wells fargo analyst got it okay that s helpful just switching gears property tax increases have been elevated in texas and then there s certainly the threat of a repeal of prop 13 in california are these outsized increases or at least the threat of increases are they factoring into your underwriting at this point i know your leases are triple net but maybe you re more observant of rent coverage and the ability of the tenant to pay should there be a bigger increase julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes we do think about that in our underwriting and we talk with our tenants about that as we re as they re looking at their occupancy cost for the states where taxes may go up i will say it hasn t caused us to not buy anything yet but it s something else that you have to think out in your underwriting todd stender wells fargo analyst thank you operator thank you for your question todd next we ll go to ladenburg and i do apologize sir if i if i mispronounced your last name john massocca i d ladenburg please go ahead your line is open john massocca ladenburg analyst that was actually very good good morning everyone it s been put through way worse than that operator thank you john massocca ladenburg analyst so just a question a follow up on you mentioned the two small tenants that were currently going through bankruptcy are they current on the rent right now julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer no no not right now but they the process the bankruptcy process is relatively fresh for both of them so one of them we actually expect to get february rent shortly the court s just approved it just in recent day here but it s an amount on both of those that are not going to move our thoughts around numbers really at all john massocca ladenburg analyst okay and then as i think about kind of same store rent that you reported for the year is that number that we got for kind of the 2019 same store rent is that maybe typical of what we should expect on a go forward basis or was there something i know there was some vacancy kind of early in the year some kind of tenant credit issues early in the year that may have pulled that number down is that kind of 0 1 number maybe what we should expect on a kind of same store including vacancy as we look out to 2020 and 2021 julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer i d call it a little on the low side but i think i alluded to this on last quarter s call in my in general we get about a 1 5 rent increase but i always assume that there s going to be 1 of the 1 5 is going to get consumed by some sort or level of tenant pain and problem and so in my mind i think we should be closer to 0 5 than 0 1 and that s not a big difference so it might be a touch low for 2019 but yes it gets impacted by issues that s kind of just rolling through the numbers shopko or what have you and those kinds of things drive that down over time kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer yes john i would say this is anecdotal but i think if we look back over the last few years i suspect that kevin s right on that it s probably 0 5 plus or minus 0 5 john massocca ladenburg analyst okay understood and then it looked like your exposure to convenience stores jumped a little bit quarter over quarter is that going to be a big kind of acquisition avenue for you guys going forward and if so is that potentially being driven by maybe some of the m a activity in the space or is that more with existing tenants that are just looking for sources of capital to maybe fund their existing business julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer we do like the convenience store business a lot we think that s a very good business and we like convenience store real estate those are good well located often signalized corners or parcels along high traffic roads with good access and visibility and signage and our and they ve really been very we ve had very few problems with our convenience store real estate so you should expect us to continue to look at a lot of those deals and do the ones that make sense we did buy a small portfolio mid sized portfolio of convenience stores in the fourth quarter to add to that and the source of our convenience store business will be like you described john there will be some m a activity out there in the world that may be a source of some business for us as well as just some smaller transactions with relationship tenants but we remain very interested in doing convenience store transactions with strong operators john massocca ladenburg analyst that s it for me thank you very much operator thank you for your question today john we ll hear next from collin mings at raymond james collin mings raymond james analyst thanks good morning guys julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer good morning collin mings raymond james analyst first one for me just as it relates to making the sell decision on vacant properties a bit sooner than you have historically are you adjusting your thinking at all as it relates to investing tis and just other capital into assets historically as you ve noted i mean you ve seemed pretty reluctant to invest much capital into assets but just could you talk maybe does it make sense just as you look to avoid carrying vacancy to maybe be more active on investing capital on a selective basis julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer right no collin it s a good question we do think about it all the time it s just that we often come to the conclusion that it makes more sense to go ahead and sell a property as is but we do a full economic analysis our asset management and leasing folks do a very good job of presenting all the alternatives when we decide what we want whether we want to lease a property or sell it and redeveloping it or putting capex into the property is definitely on that menu of items that we look at kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer for yes for us it s really just a net present value exercise and so but what we ve seen many times in commercial real estate where tenant improvement dollars are added to projects the economic returns on those they re frequently dismal because those ti dollars have little use to the next tenant and so you just have to be thoughtful about that and realistic so we kind of demand that we get a return on the incremental capital we re putting in it s not just free money we re throwing in there it needs to carry itself and so that shows up in rent and would impact our decision whether to lease or sell collin mings raymond james analyst okay and then just one other question for me i just wanted to get an update on just how you re thinking about potential feeder investments at this juncture a little less than 5 of the portfolio down maybe just a hair what year over year but just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the exposure and appetite on the feeder front julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes we re comfortable with the portfolio that we ve got we ve looked at other portfolios and we ve passed on the other portfolios primarily due to cost per property some of the portfolios felt pricey per asset to us we ve got good relationships with amc and cinemark and so you may well see us do occasional theaters with our relationship tenants from time to time but it will be in situations where we feel like the price per property is a good number and the location is good as well as having a strong operator collin mings raymond james analyst okay thank you both operator and gentlemen we do have another signal from our listening audience today we ll hear next from vikram malhotra at morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer vikram vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst can you hear me hello can you hear me kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer the audio julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer can hear you vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst is it better okay so thanks for squeezing me i saw i dialed in late and if i missed this i can follow off line but you mentioned two specific bankruptcies i caught could you say which tenants or sectors are those and then specifically do you have any exposure to any of the sonic franchises in sd holdings that just filed julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes that is why yes we generally don t talk about specifics but yes sonic is one of them that is in the public domain the other one is a small very small private operator but yes that s the sonic we own a number of those stores and those are in two master leases and it s going through the process now it appears the franchisor sonic is going to get involved in pushing that through bankruptcy but time will tell kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer and i will add to that again we don t comment about these things kind of while they re in process but that bankruptcy was not driven by their performance of our locations it was driven by other factors at the tenant our stores continued to perform well but again just a reminder the sum total of those two bankrupt tenants is less than 1 of our annual base rent vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and i think you mentioned you ve built some of that into your guidance you usually do every year julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer yes yes we always like i said we always assume we ve got a level of pain in whether it shows up in occupancy or just lower rent and again it shows up in the same store rent number we just talked about we always assume there s probably 1 of pain in there i m not saying we re going to have any notable pain from either of these two i mean time will tell but many times you a tenant gets into bankruptcy and you come out just fine and so we ll see how these play out vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay and then just last question just wondering how you re thinking about funding sort of the deals going forward in terms of equity issuances versus sort of hitting the atm and just sort of leverage overall you ve let that drift down for several years now including the payout just sort of wondering how you re thinking about the mix and equity specifically kevin b habicht executive vice president and chief financial officer yes again probably not looking to change the mix notably at all as jay mentioned we have the cushion to do that if we so chose but at the moment i think the best base case assumption to make is we re going to behave in a leverage neutral manner and go from there and that s what it feels like today given where debt and equity is priced vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst got it okay thank you julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer vikram thank you for your question and thank you to each of our audience members who signaled for a question today operator we have no question standing by mr whitehurst i d like to turn it back to yourself and to the leadership team for any additional or closing remarks julian e whitehurst president and chief executive officer thanks jim and we thank you

president donald trump s budget request for fiscal year 2021 arrives at the house budget committee on capitol hill in washington on feb 10 2020 ap photo j scott applewhite washington ap president donald trump unveiled a 4 8 trillion election year budget plan on monday that recycles deep previously rejected cuts to domestic programs like food stamps medicaid and housing as the recipe for wrestling the federal budget back into balance trump s fiscal 2021 plan promises the government s deficit will crest above 1 trillion only for the current budget year before steadily decreasing to more manageable levels but only by relying on optimistic economic projections dramatically scaled back military operations overseas and proposed cuts to agency budgets that run directly opposite to two previous budget deals signed by trump the budget sets the course for a future of continued american dominance and prosperity trump said in a message accompanying the document there is optimism that was not here before 63 million americans asked me to work for them and drain the swamp trump said for decades washington elites told us that americans had no choice but to accept stagnation decay and decline we proved them wrong our economy is strong once more in a white house appearance trump said the plan had no chance even before trump s impeachment scorched washington its cuts to food stamps farm subsidies subsidized housing for the poor medicaid and student loans couldn t pass when republicans controlled congress much less now with liberal house speaker nancy pelosi d calif setting the agenda trump s budget follows a familiar formula that exempts seniors from politically toxic cuts to medicare and social security while targeting benefit safety net programs for the poor domestic programs like clean energy and student loan subsidies it again proposes to dramatically slash funding for overseas military operations to save 567 billion over 10 years but adds 1 5 trillion over the same time frame to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent law trump s proposal would cut 465 billion from medicare providers such as hospitals which prompted howls from democrats such as former vice president joe biden who said it eviscerates medicare while top senate democrat chuck schumer of new york said trump is planning to rip away health care from millions of americans with cuts to medicare and the medicaid health program for the poor trump s gop allies generally issued only faint praise if commenting at all senate budget committee chairman mike enzi r wyo called it just a list of suggestions while top house budget committee republican steve womack of arkansas took aim at its rosy predictions of economic growth and lower interest rates both of which help trump s budget add up trump s budget would also shred last year s hard won budget deal between the white house and pelosi by imposing an immediate 5 cut to non defense agency budgets passed by congress slashing cuts to the environmental protection agency and taking about 900 billion out of medicaid over a decade are also nonstarters on capitol hill but both the white house and democrats are hopeful of progress this spring on prescription drug prices the trump budget is a blueprint written under washington rules as if he could enact it without congressional approval it relies on rosy economic projections of 2 8 economic growth this year and 3 over the long term in addition to fanciful claims of future cuts to domestic programs to show that it is possible to bend the deficit curve in the right direction the economy grew by 2 1 last year and congress spent much of the past decade reversing agency spending cuts imposed by a failed 2011 budget pact that sleight of hand enables trump to promise to whittle down a 1 08 trillion budget deficit for the ongoing budget year and a 966 billion deficit gap in the 2021 fiscal year starting oct 1 to 261 billion in 2030 balance would come in 15 years the reality is that no one trump the democratic controlled house or the gop held senate has any interest in tackling a chronic budget gap that forces the government to borrow 22 cents of every dollar it spends the white house plan proposes 4 4 trillion in spending cuts over the coming decade trump s reelection campaign meanwhile is focused on the economy and the historically low jobless rate while ignoring the government s red ink ever since his days as a presidential candidate trump has been promising a health care plan the budget repeats that promise but offers few details it lays out a health reform vision that calls for better care at lower cost and protecting people with preexisting medical conditions trump has also signed two broader budget deals worked out by democrats and republicans to get rid of spending cuts left over from a failed 2011 budget accord the result has been eye popping spending levels for defense to about 750 billion this year and significant gains for domestic programs favored by democrats trump s new budget essentially freezes defense at current levels while proposing a 3 military pay hike the white house hasn t done much to draw attention to this year s budget release though trump has revealed initiatives of interest to key 2020 battleground states such as an increase to 250 million to restore florida s everglades and a move to finally abandon a multibillion dollar never used nuclear waste dump that s political poison in nevada the trump budget also promises a 3 billion increase to 25 billion for nasa in hopes of returning astronauts to the moon and on to mars it touts a beefed up 10 year 1 trillion infrastructure proposal but 800 billion of that comes through existing surface transportation programs it contains a modest parental leave plan championed by first daughter ivanka trump and includes 135 billion in savings over the coming decade as part of an unspecified set aside to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs this year trump s u s mexico border wall would receive a 2 billion appropriation more than provided by congress but less than the 8 billion requested last year trump has enough wall money on hand to build 1000 miles 1 600 kilometers of wall a senior administration official said most of it obtained by exploiting his budget transfer powers the official requested anonymity to discuss the budget before it is made public the reduced wall request could ease the way for action on appropriations bills in the gop held senate where a fight over last year s far larger wall request stalled work on the annual spending bills for months trump has proposed modest adjustments to eligibility for social security disability benefits and he s proposed cuts to medicare providers such as hospitals but the real cost driver of medicare and social security is the ongoing retirement surge of the baby boom generation and health care costs that continue to outpace inflation with medicare and social security largely off the table trump has instead focused on medicaid which provides care to more than 70 million poor and disabled people president barack obama successfully expanded medicaid when passing the affordable care act a decade ago but trump has endorsed gop plans they failed spectacularly in the senate two years ago to dramatically curb the program indeed trump s proposed cuts to medicaid and subsidies for so called obamacare health insurance policies total almost 1 trillion over 10 years according to calculations by the liberal leaning center on budget and policy priorities whose president robert greenstein called the trump plan stunningly harsh trump would also revive a plan rejected by lawmakers in the past to cut food stamp costs by providing much of the benefit as food shipments instead of cash he s also proposing work requirements for safety net programs like medicaid food stamps and federally subsidized housing other cuts outlined in an annual major savings and reforms volume that s ignored every year include eliminating heating subsidies for the poor and 405 million worth of grants to boost community service work by senior citizens along with plans to dramatically slash legal aid to the poor the national endowment for the arts and subsidies to states such as california saddled with high costs for jailing criminal migrants who enter the country illegally
this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated washington president donald trump unveiled a 4 8 trillion election year budget plan on monday that recycles deep previously rejected cuts to domestic programs like food stamps medicaid and housing as the recipe for wrestling the federal budget back into balance trump s fiscal 2021 plan promises the government s deficit will crest above 1 trillion only for the current budget year before steadily decreasing to more manageable levels but only by relying on optimistic economic projections dramatically scaled back military operations overseas and proposed cuts to agency budgets that run directly opposite to two previous budget deals signed by trump the budget sets the course for a future of continued american dominance and prosperity trump said in a message accompanying the document there is optimism that was not here before 63 million americans asked me to work for them and drain the swamp trump said for decades washington elites told us that americans had no choice but to accept stagnation decay and decline we proved them wrong our economy is strong once more in a white house appearance trump said the plan had no chance even before trump s impeachment scorched washington its cuts to food stamps farm subsidies subsidized housing for the poor medicaid and student loans couldn t pass when republicans controlled congress much less now with liberal house speaker nancy pelosi d calif setting the agenda trump s budget follows a familiar formula that exempts seniors from politically toxic cuts to medicare and social security while targeting benefit safety net programs for the poor domestic programs like clean energy and student loan subsidies it again proposes to dramatically slash funding for overseas military operations to save 567 billion over 10 years but adds 1 5 trillion over the same time frame to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent law trump s proposal would cut 465 billion from medicare providers such as hospitals which prompted howls from democrats such as former vice president joe biden who said it eviscerates medicare while top senate democrat chuck schumer of new york said trump is planning to rip away health care from millions of americans with cuts to medicare and the medicaid health program for the poor trump s gop allies generally issued only faint praise if commenting at all senate budget committee chairman mike enzi r wyo called it just a list of suggestions while top house budget committee republican steve womack of arkansas took aim at its rosy predictions of economic growth and lower interest rates both of which help trump s budget add up trump s budget would also shred last year s hard won budget deal between the white house and pelosi by imposing an immediate 5 cut to non defense agency budgets passed by congress slashing cuts to the environmental protection agency and taking about 900 billion out of medicaid over a decade are also nonstarters on capitol hill but both the white house and democrats are hopeful of progress this spring on prescription drug prices the trump budget is a blueprint written under washington rules as if he could enact it without congressional approval it relies on rosy economic projections of 2 8 economic growth this year and 3 over the long term in addition to fanciful claims of future cuts to domestic programs to show that it is possible to bend the deficit curve in the right direction the economy grew by 2 1 last year and congress spent much of the past decade reversing agency spending cuts imposed by a failed 2011 budget pact that sleight of hand enables trump to promise to whittle down a 1 08 trillion budget deficit for the ongoing budget year and a 966 billion deficit gap in the 2021 fiscal year starting oct 1 to 261 billion in 2030 balance would come in 15 years the reality is that no one trump the democratic controlled house or the gop held senate has any interest in tackling a chronic budget gap that forces the government to borrow 22 cents of every dollar it spends the white house plan proposes 4 4 trillion in spending cuts over the coming decade trump s reelection campaign meanwhile is focused on the economy and the historically low jobless rate while ignoring the government s red ink ever since his days as a presidential candidate trump has been promising a health care plan the budget repeats that promise but offers few details it lays out a health reform vision that calls for better care at lower cost and protecting people with preexisting medical conditions trump has also signed two broader budget deals worked out by democrats and republicans to get rid of spending cuts left over from a failed 2011 budget accord the result has been eye popping spending levels for defense to about 750 billion this year and significant gains for domestic programs favored by democrats trump s new budget essentially freezes defense at current levels while proposing a 3 military pay hike the white house hasn t done much to draw attention to this year s budget release though trump has revealed initiatives of interest to key 2020 battleground states such as an increase to 250 million to restore florida s everglades and a move to finally abandon a multibillion dollar never used

the united states of america gaap akamai provides additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with gaap non gaap management uses non gaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decision making for planning and forecasting purposes to measure executive compensation and to evaluate akamai s financial performance these non gaap financial measures are non gaap income from operations non gaap operating margin non gaap net income non gaap net income per share adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below management believes that these non gaap financial measures reflect akamai s ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business as they facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies management also believes that these non gaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate akamai s operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management these non gaap financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature infrequent or not reflective of akamai s ongoing operating results the non gaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of akamai s gaap financial results and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for akamai s financial results presented in accordance with gaap akamai has provided a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure used in its financial reporting and investor presentations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure this reconciliation captioned reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures can be found on the investor relations section of akamai s website the non gaap adjustments and akamai s basis for excluding them from non gaap financial measures are outlined below amortization of acquired intangible assets akamai has incurred amortization of intangible assets included in its gaap financial statements related to various acquisitions akamai has made the amount of an acquisition s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each

amortization of capitalized stock based compensation although stock based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to akamai s employees the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant varying valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types this makes the comparison of akamai s current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret therefore akamai believes it is useful to exclude stock based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock based compensation from its non gaap financial measures in order to highlight the performance of akamai s core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate its performance and compare its operating results to peer companies although stock based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to akamai s employees the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant varying

acquisition related costs include transaction fees advisory fees due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities in addition subsequent adjustments to akamai s initial estimated amounts of contingent consideration and indemnification associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition related costs these amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions akamai excludes acquisition related costs from its non gaap financial measures to provide a useful comparison of akamai s operating results to prior periods and to its peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition transactions and do not reflect akamai s core operations acquisition related costs include transaction fees

statements primarily related to workforce reductions and estimated costs of exiting facility lease commitments akamai excludes these items from its non gaap financial measures when evaluating its

expense excluded from akamai s non gaap results is comprised of these non cash components and is excluded from management s assessment of the company s operating performance because management

useful to investors as this one time expense is not representative of its core business operations during the second quarter of 2018 akamai incurred a charge to endow the akamai foundation akamai believes excluding this amount from non gaap financial measures is useful to investors as this one time expense is not representative of its core business operations transformation costs akamai has incurred professional services fees associated with internal transformation programs designed to improve its operating margins and that are part of a planned program intended to significantly change the manner in which business in conducted akamai believes excluding these amounts from its non gaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events and activities giving rise to them

core business operations and ongoing operating performance income and losses from equity method investment akamai records income or losses on its share of earnings and losses of its equity method investment akamai excludes such income and losses because it lacks control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of its core business

the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of its core business operations income tax effect of non gaap adjustments and certain discrete tax items the non gaap adjustments described above are reported on a pre tax basis the income tax effect of non gaap adjustments is the difference between gaap and non gaap income tax expense non gaap income tax expense is computed on non gaap pre tax income gaap pre tax income adjusted for non gaap adjustments and excludes certain discrete tax items such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances if any akamai believes that applying the non gaap adjustments and their related income tax effect allows akamai to highlight income attributable to its core operations akamai s definitions of its non gaap financial measures are outlined below non gaap income from operations gaap income from operations adjusted for the following items amortization of acquired intangible assets stock based compensation amortization of capitalized stock based compensation amortization of capitalized interest expense acquisition related costs restructuring charges gains and losses on legal settlements costs from professional service providers related to a non routine stockholder matter costs incurred related to the establishment of an endowment to the akamai foundation transformation costs and other non recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time non gaap operating margin non gaap income from operations stated as a percentage of revenue non gaap net income gaap net income adjusted for the following tax affected items amortization of acquired intangible assets stock based compensation amortization of capitalized stock based compensation acquisition related costs restructuring charges gains and losses on legal settlements costs from professional service providers related to a non routine stockholder matter costs incurred related to the establishment of an endowment to the akamai foundation transformation costs amortization of debt discount and issuance costs amortization of capitalized interest expense certain gains and losses on investments income and losses from equity method investment and other non recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time non gaap net income per share non gaap net income divided by basic weighted average or diluted common shares outstanding basic weighted average shares outstanding are those used in gaap net income per share calculations diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in non gaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to akamai pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuances of 1 150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 and 2025 under gaap shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully diluted share calculation until they are delivered however the company would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of operating performance with respect to the convertible senior notes due in each of 2027 and 2025 unless and until akamai s weighted average stock price is greater than 116 18 and 95 10 respectively the initial conversion price there will be no difference between gaap and non gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding adjusted ebitda gaap net income excluding the following items interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stock based compensation amortization of capitalized stock based compensation acquisition related costs restructuring charges gains and losses on legal settlements costs from professional service providers related to a non routine stockholder matter costs incurred related to the establishment of an endowment to the akamai foundation transformation costs foreign exchange gains and losses interest expense amortization of capitalized interest expense certain gains and losses on investments income and losses on equity method investment and other non recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue capital expenditures or capex excluding stock based compensation and interest expense purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software development costs presented on an accrual basis which differs from the cash basis presentation included in the statements of cash flows the primary difference between the two is the change in purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software development costs accrued for but not paid at period end versus prior periods impact of foreign currency exchange rate revenue and earnings from international operations have historically been an important contributor to akamai s financial results consequently akamai s financial results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken our consolidated results stated in u s dollars are negatively impacted because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period to period comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period akamai statement under the private securities litigation reform act this release and or our quarterly earnings conference call scheduled for later today contain information about future expectations plans and prospects of akamai s management that constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act

increased the productivity of our business development representatives with the implementation of a leading sales engagement technology platform enabling our teams to generate more prospects and convert those prospects into sales opportunities we re entering 2020 with an optimized ratio of business development representatives to account executives and the lead generation from the team has increased substantially as a result of these changes we ve also implemented software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation across the company and for the first time ever we re taking a multi touch attribution approach to measuring the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns to drive efficiency in our go to market efforts and ensure we re getting the greatest return on our marketing dollars this is just one of the many examples of how we re optimizing our structure tools and processes to better address our large vertical market opportunities we ve made big strides employing the foundation to develop a highly productive and scalable operating model which included significant organizational structure changes as we centralized many back office functions and aligned our go to market efforts by vertical this transformation is now behind us putting us in a position to drive improved productivity across our vertical sales teams a good example is in our non profit vertical where operation smile chose to partner with blackbaud because of our proven industry depth customer knowledge purpose built solutions and partnership with microsoft the chief development officer at operation smile said and i quote blackbaud work closely with our team to come up with creative cost effective solutions some of the challenges we anticipated which we found inspiring these tenets coupled with our trust in the people working directly with our teams is why we chose blackbaud i ll now turn to our third strategy which is tam expansion the acquisition of yourcause a little over a year ago positions us as a global industry leader in enterprise corporate social responsibility and employee engagement technology in fact a third of the fortune 500 companies trust blackbaud as their csr technology partner and in 2019 alone yourcause solutions processed over 1 billion in donations and grants which benefited over 170 000 social good organizations

business within the company our total adjustable market currently stands at over 10 billion and we remain active in the evaluation of opportunities to further expand our tam through acquisitions and internal product development our final strategic initiative is a focus on operational efficiency to strengthen the business and position us for long term success as you know we ve been executing a comprehensive workplace strategy to better align our organizational objectives with our geographic footprint we designated charleston austin london and sydney as our hub locations and we re leveraging a more flexible office strategy to replace and upgrade some of our existing offices and expand our footprint into new locations for customer facing roles most recently we moved our london offices into a new flexible workspace marking a significant milestone in the integration of our blackbaud europe and justgiving teams in 2019 we largely completed this optimization effort and we will continue to evaluate our footprint in alignment with our global workplace strategy the key for us is optimizing our office utilization improving our geographic sales coverage and enhancing our employees daily experience to improve productivity and effectiveness overall we had a strong finish to 2019 as we furthered our strategic initiatives and delivered on our full year financial guidance heading into 2020 we have a positive outlook as the market remains solid and we continue to be uniquely positioned to enable digital transformation within the markets we serve we ve made truly transformational

opportunities in front of us the significant structural changes in the business are now behind us and we re well positioned to further differentiate ourselves as the leading cloud software company powering social good and deliver increased value to our customers employees and shareholders i ll now turn the call over to tony to cover our financial performance in greater detail before we open it up for q a tony anthony boor chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance and administration thanks mike good morning everyone over the course of 2019 we made strategic investments to further expand our go to market model drive cloud innovation for our customers and ensure scalability in our business our fourth quarter results allowed us to deliver on our full year financial guidance and we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance ranges on both revenue and earnings per share please refer to yesterday s press release and the investor materials posted to our website for the full detail of our q4 and full year financial performance today i ll focus on key highlights so we can get to your questions fourth quarter recurring revenue increased 9 8 over q4 of 2018 and 6 7 on an organic basis we posted solid recurring revenue growth through 2019 anticipate carrying that performance into 2020 we continue to see a healthy shift in mix of recurring revenue as one time services and other revenue represented only 8 of our total revenue mix during the fourth quarter and declined 3 million in the quarter which is a 15 decline versus q4 of 2018 on a full year basis we delivered 902 million in revenue which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and represents 6 growth over 2018 or 3 1 on an organic basis recurring revenue represented 92 of total revenue which is 260 basis points higher than 2018 and grew 5 8 on an organic basis we continue to focus on opportunities to further shift our bookings mix toward arr and to optimize the mix of business within the arr bucket one time services and other revenue represented 8 of our total revenue mix and declined nearly 18 million which is a 20 decline versus 2018 this decline is healthy for the long run and as expected this was an accelerated rate of decline when compared to the 17 decline in 2018 i ll also note that yourcause performed in line with our expectations and we continue to be excited about that acquisition and the opportunity in the space yourcause was excluded from our organic revenue calculations in 2019 but will be included in 2020 turning to profitability our fourth quarter gross margin was 56 for the full year our gross margin was 59 1 which is a 170 basis point decline versus 2018 we generated full year operating income of 152 million representing an operating margin of 16 8 and diluted earnings per share of 2 24 strong execution on our internal initiatives enabled us to deliver on our full year guidance for operating margin and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance for diluted earnings per share 2019 was an investment year for us as we further expanded our go to market model brought new solutions to market continued our efforts to migrate our cloud infrastructure to public cloud service providers and grew our partner program including third party implementation partners we ve been aggressively hiring in sales and we ended the year with 560 direct quota carrying sales headcount representing 8 growth versus 2018 as i mentioned on our last call in 2019 we made the last major structural change to the sales organization when we reallocated most overlay and associated account executives to first dollar quota carrying account executives as expected this drove heightened levels of attrition within our sales force that we expect to normalize going forward the key is that in 2019 we significantly improved the mix of quota carrying account execs carrying the full bag and with more than half being prospect account executives and we expect improved productivity in 2020 as we increased the time spent in territory for our sales reps and continue to execute on our sales effectiveness initiatives also as mike mentioned we have substantially completed our facilities optimization restructuring plan as part of our global workplace strategy and the cumulative restructuring costs incurred to date were 11 2 million this exceeded our estimated range of between 8 5 million and 9 5 million largely due to operating lease right of use asset impairment costs recorded during the fourth quarter related to our inability to sublease certain office space as we had previously ceased using these restructuring activities are expected to result in improved operating efficiencies and future annual before tax savings of between 5 0 million and 6 million beginning in 2020 moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet in q4 we generated 46 million in free cash flow we continued making necessary innovation and infrastructure investments to support our cloud operations amounting to 2 million in capex and 12 million in capitalized software development for the full year we invested 11 million in capex for property and equipment and 47 million for capitalized software development which when combined land slightly above our expectation of 45 million to 55 million in total capitalized costs for the year largely due to our heightened investments in innovation to bring new solutions to market and the integration of yourcause our full year free cash flow was 124 million a decrease of 25 million or 17 when compared to 2018 and our free cash flow margin was 14 for the full year free cash flow results were within our guidance range and included the heightened capitalized investments i just mentioned as well as expected impacts from the investments we re making into the business the 2018 cash tax refund of 7 million which didn t repeat in 2019 accelerated restructuring associated with our workplace strategy and impact from acquisitions of yourcause during the quarter we paid out 6 million in cash dividends to shareholders and ended with 435 million in net debt our capital strategy calls for a debt to ebitda ratio of less than 3 5 times and at the end of q4 we stood at 2 3 times now let s turn to 2020 we are guiding to non gaap revenue of 930 million to 955 million non gaap operating margin of 16 to 16 5 non gaap diluted earnings per share of 2 20 to 2 35 and free cash flow of 100 million to 115 million from a revenue perspective we expect another double digit decline in one time services and other revenue and we are anticipating organic recurring revenue growth to be slightly above our 2019 organic recurring revenue growth of 5 8 i ll also note that this could be the last year of material declines in one time services and other revenue from a profitability and cash flow perspective we will continue to invest to better position the business for accelerated growth and long term success we re under way in a multi year effort to enhance our scalability by migrating our cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers and we anticipate continued pressure on gross margins as we incur the necessary costs to make this shift we also expect to continue a heightened pace of investment in our go to market model and cloud innovation to support the future growth of the business our estimate for 2020 combined capital expenditures is expected to be 55 million to 70 million which is an increase over 2019 while capitalized software development has largely leveled off we re anticipating capex to increase year over year associated with one time costs related to our continued shift to the cloud and necessary maintenance upgrades to our existing colo data centers we re currently expecting to incur minimal before tax restructuring costs in 2020 as we ve largely completed the optimization phase of our workplace strategy we estimate our non gaap tax rate will remain consistent with 2019 rate of 20 and after paying minimum cash taxes in 2019 we are expecting a modest increase of a few million dollars in cash taxes in 2020 our free cash flow will be impacted from the investments we re making into the business the increases in capex and cash taxes i just mentioned and changes within working capital our deployment of capital strategy hasn t changed we will continue to pay a dividend invest in our growth and operating initiatives and continue paying down debt to provide capacity for expansion opportunities in summary we continue to executing against our strategic plan we re maintaining our disciplined approach to balanced investments to drive growth with improved profitability and we will continue to execute on our capital deployment strategy to maintain a strong balance sheet return capital to shareholders and create growth and scalability with that i d like to open up the line for your questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll now take our first question from the line of tom roderick with stifel please proceed with your question thomas roderick stifel nicolaus company inc analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions so mike i wanted to hit you on the first question here just talking a little bit more about the higher ed vertical and congrats on some of the early successes there i know you ve been a company with a large presence in higher ed for a long time i wanted to hear just a little bit more about this go to market function and what you ve been able to do to build out sales capacity drive more sales leads and in particular drive your existing installed base to some of the newer features within the product set can you talk a little bit more about what that s doing to deal sizes what that s doing to adoption rates just some more details around that higher ed vertical would be fantastic since it s getting off the ground in a nice fashion thank you michael gianoni president and chief executive officer sure tom thanks yeah i m really pleased with what s happening in higher ed we ve really moved in the last 18 months to a portfolio of sale and if you go back several years we re exclusively focused on fundraising in the foundation part of the higher ed institutions and now we re covering a much larger it wallet spend which is great we re starting with smaller universities that we ve announced and signing up a lot of universities for our education management platform what i mentioned in my prepared remarks around focus on sales expansion and lead generation also applies to higher ed as well we ve got a really good job in recruiting in that part of the business the marketing team has done a great job in that business in getting a much broader global footprint in higher ed it s showing up in a lot more places from a marketing standpoint we ve got continuing build of lots and lots of references most of the industry now is very aware of our move into the size of the business that runs the school which is great so i m really excited about what s happened in that business that vertical market for us and that expansion in the last couple of years is going quite well thomas roderick stifel nicolaus company inc analyst outstanding tony quick follow up for you just in thinking about the construction of 16 to 16 5 operating margin this year and you guys have been pretty forthright about the idea that you d have some duplicative costs some colo costs services hitting you a little bit that gross margins would still be on a little bit of a down trajectory take us through whether this 56 gross margin we saw in the fourth quarter is this the low watermark and then we start marching up from here how would you encourage us to model on the gross margin side relative to the construction of that operating margin and then should this year be the low watermark for gross margins thanks anthony boor chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance and administration yeah tom thanks i can t speak specifically the gross margin since we didn t guide to that but i d say that we do expect as we talked about in the prepared comments to see continued pressure on the gross margin side i think if you break that apart we ve not seen a downward pressure on gross margins from the payments business in more recent times than we saw historically and i think that s because as we ve talked about payments is not growing at a rate that s significantly faster than the rest of our subscriptions business and so that s not no longer creating downward pressure the real pressure is from the increase in cap software amortization as you know we ve been spending a significant amount of investment dollars on innovation not only with the existing product set and kind of converting those to the next generation products and building out the sky platform but also then as we were just talking about mike the entrance into the higher ed cloud and then also in the faith community so quite a bit of r d investment on innovation and that results in more cap software which now is catching up from an amortization perspective up in the gross margin line and then again as we ve spoken about quite a bit in the last year or so this conversion to third party service provider clouds away from our colo data centers is putting quite a bit of duplicative cost pressure on gross margins and that will continue for the foreseeable future that s a fairly long migration timeline to move out of all those colo data centers and then to third party cloud provider data centers and so i would expect you ll see that through 2020 and a bit beyond that as we continue that migration from an operating margin perspective there ll still be some incremental investment as mike spoke to in his prepared comments on the sales and marketing side of the business as we work to drive that i think we ve seen good leverage on the r d side of the business considering all the investments we ve made there and then obviously sg a we ve been able to hold the ground pretty well on that side which helps from the operating margin perspective but the majority of the pressure will continue to come from gross margin operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian peterson with raymond james please proceed with your questions brian peterson blackbaud inc raymond james thanks gentlemen so i wanted to start off on the guidance it looks like your guidance assumes that the organic recurring revenue base is going to accelerate just maybe double clicking on that what s giving you the confidence in that acceleration and maybe a couple of the products or segments that you think will ramp up in 2020 michael gianoni president and chief executive officer hey brian it s mike excuse me thanks for the question yeah this is really the first year that we haven t had a major organizational change in the company in a while as we restructured the business and most notably in sales so we have increased sales headcount last year at the rate that we wanted to but an even more important point is a year ago january we made some pretty big changes in sales we moved a few hundred people around and gave them sort of first dollar assignments we had a model where we had product specialists that had shared compensation with direct sellers and now there are essentially all direct sellers and so although we increased the sales headcount last year in total heads the actual increase is significantly more because of the reassignment and as you know in sales when you reassign you slow down productivity so we wanted to correct the operating model to have all direct sellers last year even though we take a little bit of a hit in productivity last year that s not reoccurring this year right everybody s in territory the entire team got there their plans and all their information in the first week of january we just had a great sales kick off here in charleston so lack of organizational change typically leads to much better productivity in any kind of role especially in sales brian peterson blackbaud inc raymond james well understood thanks mike and maybe just on yourcause as a follow up so 170 000 social good organizations received the donation this year i believe you only have about 40 000 or 50 000 customers so can you talk about how many of those 170 000 organizations would be addressable for blackbaud solutions and any synergies you ve seen in selling the blackbaud platform into that customer base thanks guys michael gianoni president and chief executive officer yeah sure yeah the yourcause platform has a wide reach over 170 000 social good organizations over 1 billion in donations and grants last year also one in four folks that have access to that platform are located outside the u s so those 170 000 there are some duplicate but not a lot those many are addressable by us we re starting to work on that frankly last year was really about getting the acquisitions sort of settled in integrating some of the back office executing on plans to grow their sales teams and so the cross sell opportunity is there was not a high focus in 19 but it s definitely an opportunity for us going forward operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rob oliver with baird please proceed with your question rob oliver blackbaud inc robert w baird co inc great thanks for taking my question good morning gentlemen mike one for you and then i had a quick follow up for tony we re a couple of years now into the microsoft partnership now mike and i was wondering if you could provide some color around the ways in which microsoft is contributing whether it be at higher ed where i know they have a big presence or as you guys expand your footprint within larger institutions just would love some more color on how that go to market partnership is working michael gianoni president and chief executive officer sure rob yeah it s coming along nicely we started years ago and the partnership was predominantly in engineering i mean we collaborated with them on architecture and for some things that eventually came to be our blackbaud sky engineering platform and then it sort of moved over more into using azure and we ve signed up as a big customer for the migration from our colos to azure which started a while ago and is under way and then it moved over into go to market last year we were awarded the 2019 microsoft partner of the year award in education which is pretty cool and so we ve sort of come out of the gate faster and earlier in the education business by basically connecting our education business units with theirs and then we ve now connected our non profit charity focused businesses with theirs because they have a aligning organization and now we re starting to do that with healthcare and so the way that we see success is we are sharing pipeline we are introducing each other s teams into opportunities and relationships we re winning deals together we ve announced a few in previous press releases like ducks unlimited and others and so we re in the market together now as well so there s several points around architecture engineering azure partnership and go to market that s just been a building relationship in the last several years and then i think it s a great fit for us we re also doing deeper integrations with things like microsoft office 365 and that platform is virtually everywhere in the world including all of our verticals so as we do a better job and deeper integration it s a natural synergy from a solutions standpoint for our customers so lot s happening there and yeah it s going well rob oliver blackbaud inc robert w baird co inc great thanks mike good color appreciate it tony i know you mentioned on the free cash flow guide it would be capex and cash taxes that were weighing on that number a little bit and just curious for any color you might be able to provide around the capex side in terms of maybe what the delta is relative to what you guys kind of had expected or for even delta is that around platform spend and cloud spend where did you guys kind of see that delta in terms of free cash flow thanks guys anthony boor chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance and administration yeah thanks rob the what i d say from a free cash flow perspective is we re going to have fairly strong cash earnings growth despite all the investments we re making in the business and that growth in cash earnings or ebitda will more than offset the impact of the increase in cash taxes those will still be kind of single digit millions of dollar increase from cash taxes based on current estimates and will also offset any increase in capex that we expect so really when you look at it the real impact on the free cash flow is working capital changes the capex side rob is the biggest majority of that is investments we re having to make to keep our current colo data centers and related equipment up to speed right we still got a lot of customers running on those rigs and equipment in our data centers and so unfortunately as part of this transition that s some of the duplicative cost we have to keep upgrading that equipment hardware software until we can get moved to the third party cloud and get out of that hardware business so that s just incremental investments we ve been trying to hold off on those investments as much as possible but we ve got to keep that equipment in good working order so that s what s driving that kind of increase and unfortunately i think we ll see a little bit of that in the next couple of years until we get all of the data centers moved the working capital one of the biggest chunks there is just we performed better this year compared to plan and so our bonus accrual would be quite substantially higher year over year versus what it was at the end of 2018 and so you just have a higher bonus accrual that we got to pay out this year in the first quarter and then change is really in cash conversion cycle days we ve made some really good improvement in dpo and dso over the last couple of years and those are just not something that you could repeat continually every year year in year out once you get dpo out there and dso down to kind of industry best practices year over year comparison wise that will be a bit of a hit on from a cash flow next period so that s really what s driving it and then just a minor individual timing related issues with specific vendors of when we purchased and when those payments would be due would be another piece of it so i would put almost the entirety of the free cash flow on working capital being the big driver operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kirk materne with evercore isi please proceed with your question peter levine evercore isi analyst thanks guys it s peter levine in for kirk two questions first one for mike could you give us kind of like an update on the faith based applications to kind of go to market strategy and the reps that you have in place today are they at full productivity and then how are the partner conversations coming along with these solutions michael gianoni president and chief executive officer yeah sure the faith based rollouts gone quite well we signed up a lot of customers of all sizes we ve built the sales team up quite a bit the entire sales team is not at productivity because some are new and as you know it takes a while to ramp up but the rollout has been great we ve got a new mobile app that we ve built and rolled out with the platform the market acceptance has been really great one of our challenges there is we re with this broad portfolio we re newer to the market and so there is some marketing efforts under way around brand awareness and trade show attendants and conferences and things which we started to work on a year ago and that s going well so in general products and production signing up a lot of customers it s building so the quota attainment looks pretty good revenue takes a while as you build these new businesses i can also mention that our r d team is just really doing a great job if you look at the number of features coming out it s built in our sky engineering platforms so it s a high velocity architecture and engineering environment that s really allowed us to bring a lot of features to production in q3 and q4 last year tens and tens of features which is great so the product gets more feature rich every couple of weeks as we continue to drive that and we re in pretty good spot we think we re going to be passing out the platforms in the marketplace related to capabilities now so it s fairly early days when you start something like this but we re really pleased with all the customers that have signed up the customers that are live and the references that we ve built in the last six months peter levine evercore isi analyst great thank you for the insight final question tony on the infrastructure investments you re making can you kind of give us a sense of where you are i mean are you 50 80 completed with kind of migrating out of these colo centers i mean just to get a sense of when we can kind of get a sense when this will come to an end and kind of see more gross margins i know you haven t guided but is this kind of when can we kind of see that level off thanks anthony boor chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance and administration yeah it s really difficult to give a percentage we have spun up a lot of environments in the new cloud and so we re preparing and then we re doing quite a bit of work also in our colo data centers to prepare moves we have over 38 39 years we have as you can appreciate a lot of data centers around the world that we had to migrate and so it s going to be a fairly lengthy project that said as we begin from a margin pressure perspective as we begin to migrate entire product sets or full data centers we will begin to shutdown networks and cost infrastructure and so it will be kind of a stair step approach that you see the savings come in over time but at least for the near term i would expect that we will continue to see some margin pressure at the gross margin line at least for the near term and then longer term we should start seeing some stair step improvements as we shut down networks and individual pockets of equipment and data centers themselves operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rishi jaluria with d a davidson please proceed with question hannah rudoff d a davidson analyst hi guys this is hannah on for rishi thanks for taking my questions so it s nice to hear that your faith based offering and higher ed offering are doing well and you guys mentioned successful engineering on this blackbaud sky platform so my question is how much could you add to your tam in the near term by adding new features and functionality to existing offering michael gianoni president and chief executive officer i ll take that this is mike right now for net new in the portfolio of our products the net new is the higher ed and the faith based so we don t have short term plans to create something organically from the scratch that s net new because there s a lot of work to do across the whole portfolio including higher ed and faith based but the other thing i d like to add is with this engineering platform we now have a platform where we can add either a wholly net new like we did in faith based or extensions that once in production are just naturally integrated to the core so there s not much work to do from an integration standpoint so the platform has really provided an environment for our entire engineering teams to be a lot more productive and bring solutions to market faster that run on just standard infrastructure with standard controls and integration so the velocity of innovation is really picked up across all the teams that are using this platform hannah rudoff d a davidson analyst great that s helpful and then maybe one for you tony what is the path to achieving a rule of 40 look like is this something you guys think about at all thanks anthony boor chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance and administration thanks hannah we continue to look at that as a benchmark obviously in the software space versus saas space that s a key benchmark folks look at we re much older typically than the peer saas company that s out there and much more mature we have broader product set i think when you look at our strategy that mike and i have talked about for numerous years now it s a balance between both growth and profitability or free cash flow i think we ve done a good job on that front and continue to balance that kind of way between investments and profitability we re in the midst of an investment phase to drive more tam as mike and you were just speaking about and more growth opportunities so what we re really pushing on now i think from our strategic direction is how much faster can we grow as a company in the current space in which we play and based upon what we re able to accomplish there i think we ll then determine how much focus we put in the future on profitability with a focus toward can we target getting to that kind of rule of 40 as a company and that s always in our forward looking views as a business today we re a bit in the investment phase of that and trying to drive more growth but over the long term continue to focus as our strategy always has been on balance sheet growth and profitability operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ryan macdonald with needham company please proceed with your question ryan macdonald needham company analyst yes good morning mike and tony thanks for taking my questions great to hear that this a lot of the sales reorganization really is behind you and you re now looking sort of into 2020 and focused on productivity can you walk us through a little bit of how we should start to think about that progression i think tony you mentioned that bbcon that about little less than half of your direct sales reps were on a full quota in 2019 what should we think that starts to look like as we get through 2020 here michael gianoni president and chief executive officer yeah i ll take it first this is mike so with those changes there is just with the lack of change we have people just in territory more which is always healthy we grew headcount by about 8 last year which we think is healthy we ve added to our key teams across the company including international by the way as well we think there are some interesting opportunities internationally it s pretty simple actually with a lack of a need for organization change and folks in territory more we ll just get more productivity the other thing that s important and i mentioned this in my prepared remarks is we continue to look at the whole ecosystem of sales which includes marketing and lead gen and we ve got an increased investment in our digital footprint and we re doing multi touch attribution and tracking that all the way through the process and so that s something we can dial up and dial down by geography or team which we think will also drive productivity we re doing that in a much bigger way than we have historically which i think is going to get some good results for us ryan macdonald needham company analyst excellent and then just in terms of a follow up you mentioned that peer to peer with justgiving is really tracking well i think you mentioned over half the customers you ve added are net new to blackbaud what is the cross sell and expansion opportunities look like for those customers michael gianoni president and chief executive officer yeah well basically we have that platform that can start with the customer handling their peer to peer pretty easy for a customer to get going on that and then we look to cross sell opportunities for sort of the middle and back office solutions that we have and if they re a customer of a right set of attributes and size it creates an opportunity for us for a full fundraising or financial platform so they move into looking like a prospect that s a traditional blackbaud prospect if they fit the profile once they sign up as a justgiving peer to peer customer operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark schappel with benchmark please proceed with your question mark schappel the benchmark company analyst hi good morning thank you for taking my questions tony starting with you with respect to the sunsetting of your legacy products and migrating those customers to your cloud products i was wondering if you just give us an update on where you are within your migration process here anthony boor chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance and administration yes mark the sunsetting for all intents and purposes is complete i mean we still have a few stragglers here and there but we completed our by far largest product which was the sphere product set last year early last year so there is still some stragglers and we ll always have some of those with acquisitions yourcause for instance results in some migration needs and ultimately product sunsets where you had competing products in the market so we ll have those as an ongoing but not at the level that we had obviously when we announced the 26 products that were all going to be sunset kind of simultaneously from a migration perspective continue to see really good progress in the re7 fe7 front that s kind of margin right ahead in the line with our plans as we continue to build out those next generation products we continue to get capabilities feature functionality in them that will allow us to move some of the more complex installed bases from re and fe and so that s a continued migration and it s progressing very well we re at the backside of that so from a revenue perspective even with the uplift we ve seen historically it s a tough growth compare now that we re on the backside of that kind of slope on the migrations but continues to progress well on all fronts there from a true sunset and then the migration perspective mark schappel the benchmark company analyst great thank you and then as a follow up tony on your payments business are you starting to see an uptick in that business yet anthony boor chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance and administration we had a good year in 18 we had a few surprises i think the u k market was off quite a bit that is still not great but it stabilized and we saw pretty good performance there the end of the year in 18 if you recall we had some performance issues in mid december it was kind of interesting because at the end of the year fairly strong but i think between tax reform potentially and then the market correction in december of 2018 we had some poor payments performance and then if you recall we also had some related to smart tuition and just some change in demographics and some of the parents associated with tuition management this year we finished the year fairly well givingtuesday was very positive i think across the board and then end of the year we finished up strong as well i think as an industry and payments overall there continuing to be a shift toward online donation in the market and so all things very positive on payments front that s said that s now a fairly big base of business for us so it doesn t grow at the kind of accelerated rate than it did when we first launched on a few years ago but it is quite a nice business for us and grew well and finished fairly strong operator thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to mr gianoni for any final comments michael gianoni president and chief executive officer thanks operator i ll just close by saying i m pleased with the progress we ve made against our objectives in 2019 and have a positive outlook on 2020 the structural changes in the business are now largely behind us and we re well positioned to further differentiate ourselves as the leading cloud software company powering social good ultimately delivering increased value for our customers employees and shareholders tony and i look forward to updating you on our progress on the next earnings call thank you everyone for your participation

this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated washington ap president donald trump unveiled a 4 8 trillion election year budget plan on monday that recycles deep previously rejected cuts to domestic programs like food stamps medicaid and housing as the recipe for wrestling the federal budget back into balance trump s fiscal 2021 plan promises the government s deficit will crest above 1 trillion only for the current budget year before steadily decreasing to more manageable levels but only by relying on optimistic economic projections dramatically scaled back military operations overseas and proposed cuts to agency budgets that run directly opposite to two previous budget deals signed by trump the budget sets the course for a future of continued american dominance and prosperity trump said in a message accompanying the document there is optimism that was not here before 63 million americans asked me to work for them and drain the swamp trump said for decades washington elites told us that americans had no choice but to accept stagnation decay and decline we proved them wrong our economy is strong once more in a white house appearance trump said the plan had no chance even before trump s impeachment scorched washington its cuts to food stamps farm subsidies subsidized housing for the poor medicaid and student loans couldn t pass when republicans controlled congress much less now with liberal house speaker nancy pelosi d calif setting the agenda trump s budget follows a familiar formula that exempts seniors from politically toxic cuts to medicare and social security while targeting benefit safety net programs for the poor domestic programs like clean energy and student loan subsidies it again proposes to dramatically slash funding for overseas military operations to save 567 billion over 10 years but adds 1 5 trillion over the same time frame to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent law trump s proposal would cut 465 billion from medicare providers such as hospitals which prompted howls from democrats such as former vice president joe biden who said it eviscerates medicare while top senate democrat chuck schumer of new york said trump is planning to rip away health care from millions of americans with cuts to medicare and the medicaid health program for the poor trump s gop allies generally issued only faint praise if commenting at all senate budget committee chairman mike enzi r wyo called it just a list of suggestions while top house budget committee republican steve womack of arkansas took aim at its rosy predictions of economic growth and lower interest rates both of which help trump s budget add up trump s budget would also shred last year s hard won budget deal between the white house and pelosi by imposing an immediate 5 cut to non defense agency budgets passed by congress slashing cuts to the environmental protection agency and taking about 900 billion out of medicaid over a decade are also nonstarters on capitol hill but both the white house and democrats are hopeful of progress this spring on prescription drug prices the trump budget is a blueprint written under washington rules as if he could enact it without congressional approval it relies on rosy economic projections of 2 8 economic growth this year and 3 over the long term in addition to fanciful claims of future cuts to domestic programs to show that it is possible to bend the deficit curve in the right direction the economy grew by 2 1 last year and congress spent much of the past decade reversing agency spending cuts imposed by a failed 2011 budget pact that sleight of hand enables trump to promise to whittle down a 1 08 trillion budget deficit for the ongoing budget year and a 966 billion deficit gap in the 2021 fiscal year starting oct 1 to 261 billion in 2030 balance would come in 15 years the reality is that no one trump the democratic controlled house or the gop held senate has any interest in tackling a chronic budget gap that forces the government to borrow 22 cents of every dollar it spends the white house plan proposes 4 4 trillion in spending cuts over the coming decade trump s reelection campaign meanwhile is focused on the economy and the historically low jobless rate while ignoring the government s red ink ever since his days as a presidential candidate trump has been promising a health care plan the budget repeats that promise but offers few details it lays out a health reform vision that calls for better care at lower cost and protecting people with preexisting medical conditions trump has also signed two broader budget deals worked out by democrats and republicans to get rid of spending cuts left over from a failed 2011 budget accord the result has been eye popping spending levels for defense to about 750 billion this year and significant gains for domestic programs favored by democrats trump s new budget essentially freezes defense at current levels while proposing a 3 military pay hike the white house hasn t done much to draw attention to this year s budget release though trump has revealed initiatives of interest to key 2020 battleground states such as an increase to 250 million to restore florida s everglades and a move to finally abandon a multibillion dollar never used nuclear waste dump that s political poison in nevada the trump budget also promises a 3 billion increase to 25 billion for nasa in hopes of returning astronauts to the moon and on to mars it touts a beefed up 10 year 1 trillion infrastructure proposal but 800 billion of that comes through existing surface transportation programs it contains a modest parental leave plan championed by first daughter ivanka trump and includes 135 billion in savings over the coming decade as part of an unspecified set aside to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs this year trump s u s mexico border wall would receive a 2 billion appropriation more than provided by congress but less than the 8 billion requested last year trump has enough wall money on hand to build 1000 miles 1 600 kilometers of wall a senior administration official said most of it obtained by exploiting his budget transfer powers the official requested anonymity to discuss the budget before it is made public the reduced wall request could ease the way for action on appropriations bills in the gop held senate where a fight over last year s far larger wall request stalled work on the annual spending bills for months trump has proposed modest adjustments to eligibility for social security disability benefits and he s proposed cuts to medicare providers such as hospitals but the real cost driver of medicare and social security is the ongoing retirement surge of the baby boom generation and health care costs that continue to outpace inflation with medicare and social security largely off the table trump has instead focused on medicaid which provides care to more than 70 million poor and disabled people president barack obama successfully expanded medicaid when passing the affordable care act a decade ago but trump has endorsed gop plans they failed spectacularly in the senate two years ago to dramatically curb the program indeed trump s proposed cuts to medicaid and subsidies for so called obamacare health insurance policies total almost 1 trillion over 10 years according to calculations by the liberal leaning center on budget and policy priorities whose president robert greenstein called the trump plan stunningly harsh trump would also revive a plan rejected by lawmakers in the past to cut food stamp costs by providing much of the benefit as food shipments instead of cash he s also proposing work requirements for safety net programs like medicaid food stamps and federally subsidized housing other cuts outlined in an annual major savings and reforms volume that s ignored every year include eliminating heating subsidies for the poor and 405 million worth of grants to boost community service work by senior citizens along with plans to dramatically slash legal aid to the poor the national endowment for the arts and subsidies to states such as california saddled with high costs for jailing criminal migrants who enter the country illegally
bloomberg argentine president alberto fernandez has likened negotiating the nation s debt to playing poker this week he ll have to show some of his cards to the international monetary fund imf negotiators land in buenos aires on wednesday for their first mission since the leftist president took office in december before agreeing to any changes in the terms of their current deal they will want to see fernandez s blueprint for tackling more than 320 billion in total debt and for rescuing an economy that s forecast to shrink for a third straight year talks with the imf to which argentina owes 44 billion will be key for an even bigger negotiation with bondholders to avoid a default if the fund declares the country s debt unsustainable as fernandez has repeatedly called it it could give him more leverage to impose steeper debt losses on other creditors if you talk to private creditors many of them see the imf as their worst enemy said jimena blanco head of latin america political research at consulting firm verisk maplecroft in buenos aires the imf could complicate a negotiation for bondholders in the end by agreeing that under the current terms argentina would be unable to meet is debt commitments beyond billions of dollars in debt a lot is on the line for both sides fernandez pledged to voters that he d turn around an economy that is suffering with 54 inflation and high unemployment the imf a perennial villain in argentina after more than 20 financing agreements since 1958 is hoping to recover some negotiating ground with its largest borrower after the record 56 billion loan approved in 2018 did little to improve the economy or its reputation in the country read more argentina s vague economic plans will soon be tested hiding cards two months into office fernandez has shelved any announcement of a comprehensible economic plan and resorted instead to an array of tax hikes price freezes and pay raises to appease voters his only major declaration on debt talks was that he wants to wrap them up by march 31 a deadline that will be hard to meet it s not true that we don t have plan we just don t announce it because we are in the middle of a negotiation and saying it would be showing our cards the president said earlier this month at an event in paris we are playing poker and not with kids one card the government did show was what it s asking of the imf more time to pay the capital amortization of its latest loan that comes due between 2021 and 2023 according to economy minister martin guzman otherwise it will take too long for the country to make interest payments to private creditors he said although fernandez lambasted the fund on the campaign trail saying it was partly responsible for argentina s crisis relations have thawed since he assumed power both sides have started speaking positively about each other more recently and just last week imf managing director kristalina georgieva said she had a very productive meeting with with guzman in rome it s unclear how much tolerance the fund will have for some of the heterodox policies in place in argentina these days including strict capital controls and negative real interest rates after five cuts to stimulate growth despite inflation risks the gap between the mindsets of the government and the imf is not that far apart in terms of fiscal policy the main problem is monetary policy said diego pereira an economist at jpmorgan who covers south american nations read more bcra slashes interest rates in argentina even if both parties reach an agreement it needs to be seen if the country will roll over its imf debt into a new version of the same deal known as a stand by arrangement or a longer term program that requires more reforms called an extended fund facility program argentina s economy ministry declined to comment for this story as did the imf catch 22 on top of hosting imf officials for a week gusman is scheduled to make his most detailed analysis yet on debt sustainability in a presentation to congress on wednesday fernandez faces no good options renegotiating argentina s debt with creditors if he proposes a small or negligible haircut argentina s debt remains unsustainable and the government gets little breathing room to grow the economy even if bondholders would celebrate but a debt haircut that investors perceive as too big could exclude argentina from bond markets for an extended period of time giving it no access to foreign currency in the end argentina may provide multiple options since different bonds hold varying maturities and yields rallying support beyond technical discussions fernandez will also need political support if he wants to convince the imf board of a deal while the president said he garnered support from germany france and spain during a trp to europe the u s the fund s largest shareholder and key member remains the elephant in the room president donald trump strongly backed fernandez predecessor mauricio macri when he sought imf aid macri labeled venezuelan leader nicolas maduro as a dictator serving as a trump ally on his top policy priority for latin america but fernandez shifted argentina to a more neutral position criticizing maduro s regime without using trump s language the thing fernandez needs most is u s support said hector torres a former imf executive board member who represented argentina and other nations i ve never seen a program approved without u s support or at least the u s acquiescence to contact the reporters on this story patrick gillespie in buenos aires

solely as supplemental disclosures management believes that adjusted ebitda may be a useful performance measure that is widely used within our industry and adjusted net income may be a useful

are not calculated in the same manner by all companies and accordingly may not be an appropriate measure for comparison management also believes that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per

useful information on our earnings from ongoing operations we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information on our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations and on our ability to fund our expected growth with internally generated funds non gaap measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider either of them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results or cash flows as reported under gaap some of these limitations are they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt although depreciation expense and container impairment are a noncash charge the assets being depreciated may be replaced in the future and neither adjusted ebitda adjusted net income or adjusted net income per diluted common share reflects any cash requirements for such replacements they are not adjusted for all noncash income or

andrew taylor the associated press washington president donald trump unveiled a 4 8 trillion election year budget plan on monday that recycles deep previously rejected cuts to domestic programs like food stamps medicaid and housing as the recipe for wrestling the federal budget back into balance trump s fiscal 2021 plan promises the government s deficit will crest above 1 trillion only for the current budget year before steadily decreasing to more manageable levels but only by relying on optimistic economic projections dramatically scaled back military operations overseas and proposed cuts to agency budgets that run directly opposite to two previous budget deals signed by trump the budget sets the course for a future of continued american dominance and prosperity trump said in a message accompanying the document there is optimism that was not here before 63 million americans asked me to work for them and drain the swamp trump said for decades washington elites told us that americans had no choice but to accept stagnation decay and decline we proved them wrong our economy is strong once more in a white house appearance trump said the plan had no chance even before trump s impeachment scorched washington its cuts to food stamps farm subsidies subsidized housing for the poor medicaid and student loans couldn t pass when republicans controlled congress much less now with liberal house speaker nancy pelosi d calif setting the agenda trump s budget follows a familiar formula that exempts seniors from politically toxic cuts to medicare and social security while targeting benefit safety net programs for the poor domestic programs like clean energy and student loan subsidies it again proposes to dramatically slash funding for overseas military operations to save 567 billion over 10 years but adds 1 5 trillion over the same time frame to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent law trump s proposal would cut 465 billion from medicare providers such as hospitals which prompted howls from democrats such as former vice president joe biden who said it eviscerates medicare while top senate democrat chuck schumer of new york said trump is planning to rip away health care from millions of americans with cuts to medicare and the medicaid health program for the poor trump s gop allies generally issued only faint praise if commenting at all senate budget committee chairman mike enzi r wyo called it just a list of suggestions while top house budget committee republican steve womack of arkansas took aim at its rosy predictions of economic growth and lower interest rates both of which help trump s budget add up trump s budget would also shred last year s hard won budget deal between the white house and pelosi by imposing an immediate 5 cut to non defense agency budgets passed by congress slashing cuts to the environmental protection agency and taking about 900 billion out of medicaid over a decade are also nonstarters on capitol hill but both the white house and democrats are hopeful of progress this spring on prescription drug prices the trump budget is a blueprint written under washington rules as if he could enact it without congressional approval it relies on rosy economic projections of 2 8 economic growth this year and 3 over the long term in addition to fanciful claims of future cuts to domestic programs to show that it is possible to bend the deficit curve in the right direction the economy grew by 2 1 last year and congress spent much of the past decade reversing agency spending cuts imposed by a failed 2011 budget pact that sleight of hand enables trump to promise to whittle down a 1 08 trillion budget deficit for the ongoing budget year and a 966 billion deficit gap in the 2021 fiscal year starting oct 1 to 261 billion in 2030 balance would come in 15 years the reality is that no one trump the democratic controlled house or the gop held senate has any interest in tackling a chronic budget gap that forces the government to borrow 22 cents of every dollar it spends the white house plan proposes 4 4 trillion in spending cuts over the coming decade trump s reelection campaign meanwhile is focused on the economy and the historically low jobless rate while ignoring the government s red ink ever since his days as a presidential candidate trump has been promising a health care plan the budget repeats that promise but offers few details it lays out a health reform vision that calls for better care at lower cost and protecting people with preexisting medical conditions trump has also signed two broader budget deals worked out by democrats and republicans to get rid of spending cuts left over from a failed 2011 budget accord the result has been eye popping spending levels for defense to about 750 billion this year and significant gains for domestic programs favored by democrats trump s new budget essentially freezes defense at current levels while proposing a 3 military pay hike the white house hasn t done much to draw attention to this year s budget release though trump has revealed initiatives of interest to key 2020 battleground states such as an increase to 250 million to restore florida s everglades and a move to finally abandon a multibillion dollar never used nuclear waste dump that s political poison in nevada the trump budget also promises a 3 billion increase to 25 billion for nasa in hopes of returning astronauts to the moon and on to mars it touts a beefed up 10 year 1 trillion infrastructure proposal but 800 billion of that comes through existing surface transportation programs it contains a modest parental leave plan championed by first daughter ivanka trump and includes 135 billion in savings over the coming decade as part of an unspecified set aside to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs this year trump s u s mexico border wall would receive a 2 billion appropriation more than provided by congress but less than the 8 billion requested last year trump has enough wall money on hand to build 1000 miles 1 600 kilometers of wall a senior administration official said most of it obtained by exploiting his budget transfer powers the official requested anonymity to discuss the budget before it is made public the reduced wall request could ease the way for action on appropriations bills in the gop held senate where a fight over last year s far larger wall request stalled work on the annual spending bills for months trump has proposed modest adjustments to eligibility for social security disability benefits and he s proposed cuts to medicare providers such as hospitals but the real cost driver of medicare and social security is the ongoing retirement surge of the baby boom generation and health care costs that continue to outpace inflation with medicare and social security largely off the table trump has instead focused on medicaid which provides care to more than 70 million poor and disabled people president barack obama successfully expanded medicaid when passing the affordable care act a decade ago but trump has endorsed gop plans they failed spectacularly in the senate two years ago to dramatically curb the program indeed trump s proposed cuts to medicaid and subsidies for so called obamacare health insurance policies total almost 1 trillion over 10 years according to calculations by the liberal leaning center on budget and policy priorities whose president robert greenstein called the trump plan stunningly harsh trump would also revive a plan rejected by lawmakers in the past to cut food stamp costs by providing much of the benefit as food shipments instead of cash he s also proposing work requirements for safety net programs like medicaid food stamps and federally subsidized housing other cuts outlined in an annual major savings and reforms volume that s ignored every year include eliminating heating subsidies for the poor and 405 million worth of grants to boost community service work by senior citizens along with plans to dramatically slash legal aid to the poor the national endowment for the arts and subsidies to states such as california saddled with high costs for jailing criminal migrants who enter the country illegally

michael bloomberg one of three billionaires in the race if you count donald trump bloomberg doesn t drew angerer getty images while michael bloomberg s presidential campaign has been marked by ridicule controversy and at least one semi hilarious prank he s also won a few major endorsements including from san francisco mayor london breed that endorsement is to say the least unexpected san francisco is at least performatively one of the most progressive cities in the u s and breed is the first black female mayor to lead it bloomberg on the other hand is the consummate old white guy he s a moderate billionaire with little popular support but a vast personal fortune to deploy on his campaign as the former republican mayor of new york he s particularly famous for enforcing stop and frisk policing which unfairly targets people of color and pulls them into the justice system and also for taxing big gulps his record as a philanthropist is more distinguished than his record as a political leader and yet london breed isn t alone bloomberg has also gotten endorsements from the mayors of oakland memphis washington dc louisville kentucky flint michigan and tacoma washington as well as from a handful of public figures like michael douglas tim gunn sam waterston and most importantly john cougar mellencamp at this point bloomberg still seems like an unlikely winner he decided to skip the first four primaries entirely but he s spending an enormous amount of money in super tuesday states and as forecaster nate silver wrote on fivethirtyeight bloomberg could easily become the nominee at a contested convention and a contested convention is a reasonably likely possibility bloomberg could somehow actually be a contender in this thing so it seems worth asking what are the dude s actual policy positions here are a few climate change climate change is undoubtedly where bloomberg is strongest according to inside climate news he has experience unmatched in the presidential field in international diplomacy through the un and the financial stability board in philanthropy through the sierra club and the state and local coalitions he helped to build and in managing new york city through crisis and recovery he s given many many millions of dollars to groups fighting climate change donations that in some cases have paused now that he s decided to run for president he served as a un climate envoy launched america s pledge which asks cities states corporations and major institutions to commit to the goals laid out in the paris climate accord and after hurricane sandy he developed what inside climate news calls the most ambitious city level efforts in the world to mitigate and adapt to global warming his current policy plans however likely won t appeal to left most portion of the environmental movement he s said the green new deal stands no chance in the senate which is true at least as long as mitch mcconnell runs it he s also however said that the us should move to 100 percent clean energy by 2050 his way of getting there would be to retire all remaining coal plants in the us phase out the construction of new gas plants set strict limits on pollution and carbon emissions end subsidies for fossil fuels place a moratorium fossil fuel leases on federal lands fast track clean energy projects and heavily invest in modernizing the energy grid and developing forms of clean energy he s also unlike bernie sanders and elizabeth warren open to nuclear energy which many environmentalists despise but which provides over 50 percent of america s current zero emissions power and will likely be required if we want to get off of fossil fuels in any kind of timely manner he s committed to addressing the threat of wildfires in the west including reducing wildfire caused damages by 50 percent within four years in office he also says he first act as president would be to re join the paris agreement and that climate change would be a top priority when it comes to both domestic and foreign policy education bloomberg s education plan is noticeably thin as president his campaign website reads mike will make it a top national priority to increase student achievement college preparedness and career readiness as for how exactly he would do that he doesn t say but as mayor of new york bloomberg pushed for the expansion of charter schools a democratic bugaboo that tends to be unpopular with public school advocates and teachers unions he s also endorsed expanding vocational and technical education which as he noted in 2015 can lead to greater income than a liberal arts degree from harvard with a fraction of the student debt when it comes to tackling the student debt crisis however bloomberg has been notably silent which is unlikely to win him support among debt burned millennials not that they were going to vote for him anyway health care bloomberg has endorsed a public option but unlike the candidates to his left he is not in favor of entirely dismantling the private insurance system basically he wants to build on and improve the affordable care act he says he would expand enrollment and subsidies increase standards for aca plans cap premiums at 8 5 percent of household income include dental coverage in the public option and work with congress to lower drug prices and cap out of pocket drug prices for medicare beneficiaries at 2 000 a year housing and homelessness in a proposal released last month bloomberg said he would cut homelessness in half by 2025 by increasing rental assistance for the lowest income americans and increasing the stock of affordable housing he also says he ll use federal funds to help people afford down payments and transition from renters to home owners and he has set a goal of creating a million new african american home owners and he does have a track record on housing as mayor of new york he oversaw the development of the largest affordable housing program in the country that said new york s housing crisis got worse during bloomberg s time in office and according to curbed by the time bloomberg left office median rents had risen by 19 percent some of which can be attributed to market forces and some of which falls squarely on bloomberg s administration he does however understand a few things for one you can t just build new housing without also building public transit and he s said he would prioritize new transportation funding for areas that have undertaken progressive zoning reform and reward municipalities that support affordable housing development in neighborhoods with good schools transportation and economic opportunity guns bloomberg announced his gun violence plan in aurora colorado alongside the father of a boy killed in the 2012 movie theatre massacre there like climate change this is one of the issues where he s actually gone deep and has a detailed proposal as well as a history of philanthropic giving his plan calls for a national gun licensing system stricter background checks closing the private sale loophole reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines repealing laws that make gun manufacturers and dealers immune from lawsuits passing red flag laws that would allow for the confiscation of guns from people deemed dangerous and spending hundreds of millions to enforce existing and future gun laws he s spent tens of millions of dollars supporting gun control groups and is further to the left of the rest of the pack when it comes to expanding laws designed to prevent gun violence in fact his plan is so comprehensive and progressive that immediately after he announced it versions of it were adopted by elizabeth warren bernie sanders and pete buttigieg reports the new york times immigration when it comes to immigration bloomberg says he will end trump s travel ban protect both daca and temporary protected status holders both programs imperiled by trump and focus on a place based visa system that will according to his plan allow localities to address unmet needs by channeling immigrants into cities towns and rural areas that are losing both population and workers also called
