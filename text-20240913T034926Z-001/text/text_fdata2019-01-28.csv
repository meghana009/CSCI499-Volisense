americans have been trained by decades of cold war propaganda to look for any confirmation that socialism means poverty but in the case of venezuela and other states not governed by the free market this cliche simply doesn t ring true by caleb t maupin washington analysis the political and economic crisis facing venezuela is being endlessly pointed to as proof of the superiority of the free market images and portrayals of venezuelans rioting in the streets over high food costs empty grocery stores medicine shortages and overflowing garbage bins are the headlines and the reporting points to socialism as the cause the chicago tribune published a commentary piece titled a socialist revolution can ruin almost any country a headline on reason s hit and run blog proclaims venezuelan socialism still a complete disaster the week s u s edition says authoritarian socialism caused venezuela s collapse indeed corporate owned mainstream media advises americans to look at the inflation and food lines in venezuela and then repeat to themselves clichés they heard in elementary school about how communism just doesn t work in reality millions of venezuelans have seen their living conditions vastly improved through the bolivarian process the problems plaguing the venezuelan economy are not due to some inherent fault in socialism but to artificially low oil prices and sabotage by forces hostile to the revolution starting in 2014 the kingdom of saudi arabia flooded the market with cheap oil this is not a mere business decision but a calculated move coordinated with u s and israeli foreign policy goals despite not just losing money but even falling deep into debt the saudi monarchy continues to expand its oil production apparatus the result has been driving the price of oil down from 110 per barrel to 28 in the early months of this year the goal is to weaken these opponents of wall street london and tel aviv whose economies are centered around oil and natural gas exports and venezuela is one of those countries saudi efforts to drive down oil prices have drastically reduced venezuela s state budget and led to enormous consequences for the venezuelan economy at the same time private food processing and importing corporations have launched a coordinated campaign of sabotage this coupled with the weakening of a vitally important state sector of the economy has resulted in inflation and food shortages the artificially low oil prices have left the venezuelan state cash starved prompting a crisis in the funding of the social programs that were key to strengthening the united socialist party corruption is a big problem in venezuela and many third world countries this was true prior to the bolivarian process as well as after hugo chavez launched his massive economic reforms in situations of extreme poverty people learn to take care of each other people who work in government are almost expected to use their position to take care of their friends and family corruption is a big problem under any system but it is much easier to tolerate in conditions of greater abundance the problem has been magnified in venezuela due to the drop in state revenue caused by the low oil prices and sabotage from food importers the bolivarian experience in venezuela americans have been trained by decades of cold war propaganda to look for any confirmation that socialism means poverty a quick simplistic portrait of the problems currently facing venezuela coupled with the fact that president nicolas maduro describes himself as a marxist can certainly give them such a confirmation however the actual undisputed history of socialist construction around the world including recent decades in venezuela tells a completely different story hugo chavez was elected president of venezuela in 1999 his election was viewed as a referendum on the extreme free market policies enacted in venezuela during the 1990s in december when i walked through the neighborhoods of central caracas venezuelans spoke of these times with horror venezuelans told of how the privatizations mandated by the international monetary fund made life in venezuela almost unlivable during the 1990s garbage wouldn t be collected electricity would go off for weeks haido ortega a member of a local governing body in venezuela said under previous governments we had to burn tires and go on strike just to get electricity have the streets fixed or get any investment chavez took office on a platform advocating a path between capitalism and socialism he restructured the government owned oil company so that the profits would go into the venezuelan state not the pockets of wall street corporations with the proceeds of venezuela s oil exports chavez funded a huge apparatus of social programs after defeating an attempted coup against him in 2002 chavez announced the goal of bringing venezuela toward 21st century socialism chavez quoted marx and lenin in his many tv addresses to the country and mobilized the country around the goal of creating a prosperous non capitalist society in 1998 venezuela had only 12 public universities today it has 32 cuban doctors were brought to venezuela to provide free health care in community clinics the government provides cooking and heating gas to low income neighborhoods and it s launched a literacy campaign for uneducated adults during the george w bush administration oil prices were the highest they had ever been the destruction of iraq sanctions on iran and russia strikes and turmoil in nigeria these events created a shortage on the international markets driving prices up big oil revenues enabled chavez and the united socialist party to bring millions of venezuelans out of poverty between 1995 and 2009 poverty and unemployment in venezuela were both cut in half after the death of chavez nicolas maduro has continued the bolivarian program housing missions have been built across the country providing low income families in venezuela with places to live the venezuelan government reports that over 1 million modern apartment buildings had been constructed by the end of 2015 the problems currently facing venezuela started in 2014 the already growing abundance of oil due to hydraulic fracturing or fracking was compounded by saudi arabia flooding the markets with cheap oil the result massive price drops despite facing a domestic fiscal crisis saudi arabia continues to expand its oil production apparatus the price of oil remains low as negotiations among opec states are taking place in the hopes that prices can be driven back up while american media insists the low oil prices are just the natural cycle of the market at work it s rather convenient for u s foreign policy russia venezuela ecuador and the islamic republic of iran all have economies centered around state owned oil companies and oil exports and each of these countries has suffered the sting of low oil prices the leftist president of brazil dilma rousseff has already been deposed due to scandal surrounding petrobras the state owned oil company which is experiencing economic problems due to the falling price of oil although much of brazil s oil is for domestic consumption it has been revealed that those who deposed her coordinated with the cia and other forces in washington and wall street utilizing the economic fallout of low oil prices to bring down the brazilian president the son of president ronald reagan has argued that obama is intentionally driving down oil prices not just to weaken the venezuelan economy but also to tamper the influence of russia and iran writing for townhall in 2014 michael reagan bragged that his father did the same thing to hurt the soviet union during the 1980s since selling oil was the source of the kremlin s wealth my father got the saudis to flood the market with cheap oil lower oil prices devalued the ruble causing the ussr to go bankrupt which led to perestroika and mikhail gorbachev and the collapse of the soviet empire the history of socialist construction prior to the 1917 revolution russia was a primitive agrarian country by 1936 after the completion of the five year plan it was a world industrial power surpassing every other country on the globe in terms of steel and tractor production the barren soviet countryside was lit up with electricity the children of illiterate peasants across the soviet union grew up to be the scientists and engineers who first conquered outer space the planned economy of the soviet union drastically improved the living standards of millions of people bringing them running water modern housing guaranteed employment and free education there is no contradiction between central planning and economic growth in 1949 china had no steel industry today more than half of all the world s steel is produced in china s government controlled steel industry cuba has wiped out illiteracy and cubans enjoy one of the highest life expectancies in latin america when the marxist leninist governments of eastern europe collapsed in the early 1990s economists like jeffrey sachs of columbia university who can be counted among capitalism s true believers predicted rapid economic growth since the 1990s conditions in what george w bush called the new europe have become far worse than under socialism the life expectancy has decreased and infant mortality has risen human and drug traffickers have set up shop in endless polls the people of eastern europe repeatedly say life was better before the defeat of communism russia s recovery from the disaster of the 1990s has come about with the reorientation of the economy to one centered around public control of its oil and natural gas resources much like venezuela the putin government has also waged a crackdown on the small number of oligarchs who became wealthy after the demise of the soviet union once strong state to control the economy was re established russia s gross domestic product increased by 70 percent during the first eight years of putin s administration from 2000 to 2008 poverty was cut in half and incomes doubled neoliberal capitalism has failed it is only because these facts are simply off limits in the american media and its discussions of socialism and capitalism that the distorted narrative about venezuela s current hardships are believed when discussing the merits of capitalism and socialism american media usually restricts the conversation to pointing out that socialist countries in the third world have lower living standards than the united states a country widely identified with capitalism without any context or fair comparison this alone is supposed to prove the inherent superiority of u s style capitalism if the kind of neoliberal free trade advocated by u s corporations was the solution to global poverty mexico a country long ago penetrated with the north american free trade agreement would be a shining example of development not a mess of drug cartels and poverty the same can be said for oil rich countries like nigeria where exports are massive but the population remains in dire conditions the governments of bangladesh honduras guatemala indonesia and the philippines have done everything they can to deregulate the market and accommodate western investment despite the promises of neoliberal theoreticians their populations have not seen their lives substantially improve if one compares the more market oriented economy of the u s not to countries in the global south attempting to develop with a planned economy but to other western countries with more social democratic governments the inferiority of the free market can also be revealed the u s is rated 43 in the world in terms of life expectancy according to the cia world factbook people live longer in germany britain spain france sweden australia italy iceland basically almost every other western country statistics on the rate of infant mortality say approximately the same thing national health care services along with greater job security and economic protections render much healthier populations even as the social democratic welfare states of europe drift closer to the u s economic model with austerity cuts the u s still lags behind them in terms of basic societal health western european countries with powerful unions strong socialist and labor parties and less punitive criminal justice systems tend to have healthier societies the american perception that socialism or government intervention automatically create poverty while a laissez faire approach unleashes limitless prosperity is simply incorrect despite the current hardships this reality is reflected in the last two decades of venezuela s history a punishment vote not a vote for capitalism the artificially low oil prices have left the venezuelan state cash starved prompting a crisis in the funding of the social programs that were key to strengthening the united socialist party it is odd that the mainstream press blames socialism for the food problems in venezuela when the food distributors remain in the hands of private corporations as venezuelan political analyst jesus silva told me recently most food in venezuela is imported by private companies they ask for dollars subsidized by the government oil sales to do that they rarely produce anything or invest their own money according to silva the economic sanctions imposed on venezuela by the u s in addition to the oil crisis have made it more difficult for the venezuelan government to pay the private food importing companies in u s dollars in response the food companies are running general sabotage venezuela s economy depends on oil sales now that oil prices are dropping down the challenge is to get other sources of economic income he explained meanwhile the opposition is garnering electoral support due to the current economic crisis when the united socialist party and its aligned patriotic pole lost control of parliament in december many predicted the imminent collapse of the bolivarian government however months have passed and this clearly has not taken place while a clear majority cast a voto castigo punishment vote in december punishing the government for mismanaging the crisis the maduro administration has a solid core of socialist activists who remain loyal to the bolivarian project across venezuela communes have been established leftist activists live together and work in cooperatives many of them are armed and organized in bolivarian militias to defend the revolution even some of the loudest critics of the venezuelan government admit that it has greatly improved the situation in the country despite the current hardships in december i spoke to glen martinez a radio host in caracas who voted for the opposition he dismissed the notion that free market capitalism would ever return to venezuela as he explained most of the people who voted against the united socialist party himself included are frustrated with the way the current crisis is being handled but do not want a return to the neoliberal economic model of the 1999s he said the economic reforms established during the chavez administration would never be reversed we are not the same people we were before 1999 martinez insisted the united socialist party is currently engaging in a massive re orientation hoping to sharpen its response to economic sabotage and strengthen the socialist direction of the revolution there is also talk of massive reform in the way the government operates in order to prevent the extreme examples of corruption and mismanagement that are causing frustration among the population the climate is being intensified by a number of recent political assassinations tensions continue to exist on venezuela s border with the u s aligned government of colombia the solid base of socialist activists is not going to let revolution be overturned and tensions continue to rise the maduro and the united socialist party s main task is to hold venezuela together and not let the country escalate into a state of

for the newcomer retail investor while seasoned market participants may know the vernacular while not understanding the etymological roots if you ve spent any time trawling the foreign exchange forums or economic news sites you ll have no doubt come across some most or all of the below currency and currency cross nicknames as so we ve prepared this list to help traders get to grips with industry accepted colloquialisms before we get into specific currency nicknames we need to address why the dollar is in fact called a dollar in the first place a variety of nations have adopted the dollar as the standard unit of currency from the united states of america us dollar to australia canada new zealand singapore and fiji plus many more the origins of the dollar is thought to stem from the low german or flemish word joachimsthal which referred in ancient times to joachim s valley an area renowned for silver mining minted coins from the mining area became known as joachimsthaler before the human tendency to shorten lengthy words prompted a reduction to thaler which subsequently morphed into the dollar we re all familiar with today the u s dollar the world s most traded and used currency has a variety of nicknames most notable among these is the greenback the term greenback stems from almost 200 years ago when during the american civil war in 1861 us dollars were printed on notes which had a distinctly green colouring on the back a secondary nickname you may have heard for the us dollar is the buck during frontier times in the u s native american indians would often trade using the hides of male deer or bucks with the introduction of the us dollar trading between natives and settlers prompted the adoption of the term bucks as a descriptor for the usd the pound sterling the official currency of the united kingdom has double barreled origins the pound aspect of the currency title is derived from the latin word poundus meaning weight while the sterling refers to times when one pound equated in value to a literal pound of silver in terms of nicknames the term quid is akin to the us dollar bucks however it s more of a colloquially accepted term within the uk as opposed to a globally adopted nickname interestingly nicknames have been extended to include currency crosses as well as singular currencies most notably among these is the cable which refers to the pound sterling to us dollar gbpusd currency cross in 1858 a literal physical telegraph cable was laid spanning the atlantic ocean to join the uk and usa the cable was used to transmit currency prices from london to new york s trading desks in order to synchronize the exchange rate hence the cable was born the currency which spans the european union excluding the uk while lacking an imaginative official title is also know by the term fiber as well as the more commonly used single currency while among currencies the euro is a relatively recent development contention over the origin of the fiber label abounds one theory purports that the nickname stems from the fact that euro banknotes were printed on paper derived from pure cotton fiber a secondary theory suggests the moniker comes in response to the gbp usd pairing s cable nickname with fibre optic being the modern day equivalent given the channel tunnel joins the uk to mainland europe the pound to euro gbpeur cross has been dubbed the rather unflattering abbreviation chunnel channel tunnel as a nickname while only introduced in 1990 the euro s adoption by eu member states has led to it quickly becoming the second largest reserve currency in the world behind the us dollar the fact that the currency is used by a host of eu member states lends to the moniker single currency the official swiss currency the swiss franc has recently been referred to as the chief among retail forex investors however this isn t a widely adopted moniker rather unimaginatively the usd chf cross has been dubbed the swissie on an interesting side note the ch portion of the three letter iso 4217 code for the swiss franc chf is an abbreviation of confoederatio helvetica the latin name for switzerland the canadian dollar has the quaint nickname loonie the name stems from the fact that the post 1987 canadian 1 dollar coin carries an image of the loon an aquatic bird found in many parts of north america with origins in the 13th century the ruble is one of the oldest currencies still in circulation today the word itself is thought to stem from the russian þóáèòü rubit meaning to cut or chop with rubles originally being bits

rep alexandria ocasio cortez has said it absolutely should be part of our conversation about the economy during the presidential campaign sen bernie sanders chief economist was an adherent but what the heck is modern monetary theory on this episode economist and aei scholar stan veuger breaks it all down discussing his latest article for aei economic perspectives titled modern monetary theory and policy stan veuger is a resident scholar here at aei where he specializes in political economy and public finance what follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation you can download the episode by clicking the link below and don t forget to subscribe to my podcast on itunes or stitcher tell your friends leave a review pethokoukis modern monetary theory is an economic idea that s sort of been bubbling around for a while on twitter i mean that s where i saw it but it s sort of now entered the political landscape there are politicians talking about it now with greater or lesser specificity they may not call it mmt modern monetary theory but they seem to like the idea what is the idea what is it and what isn t it what is its central claim veuger the central claim of mmt is that if you have borrowed money in your domestic currency in your own currency the currency that you as the government create then you can always pay back those claims right that s what we do in the united states it is yes so it is the idea is that the us government can create more dollars and then it can use those dollars to pay its debt that s the central idea that does not sound very interesting that sounds like something that s not a controversial statement so why are folks on the left and democratic politicians talking about this theory if that s the central claim because there s a few economists and other people who have turned this relatively uncontroversial claim into a broader political agenda and so what they say is because you can always live up to the financial obligations you incurred in your own domestic currency that means that there are no real borrowing constrains that you have to take into account that is i think a fair representation now some of the people who associate with this movement will push back and say no we do believe in resource constrains and things like that but only when they receive push back they typically do frame the idea as allowing for extrapolation from we can pay back what we owe in our own currency to we can take on significant additional spending programs without running into any kind of macroeconomic constraint now one thing to keep in mind is that part of why this theory if you want to call it that is poorly defined is that it s never really been spelled out there are very few explicit academic style articles on the topic there are no real articles in serious academic journals you know there s a book titled modern monetary theory that s by one of the proponents someone who s at the university of missouri kansas city but that book also contains some content that other people who on twitter identify as mmt proponents would not necessarily accept and so i think it s hard to move in specific terms beyond one the undisputed idea that you can pay off debt owed in your local currency and two that a lot of the proponents of the theory as a broader concept would like to see more public spending and are not worried about paying for it do you have a sense of the path this idea has taken now you have politicians like rep alexandria ocasio cortez talking about it and i also see other people talking about it again they may not use the phrase they seem to have heard the idea that there s a way that we can get our spending agenda through without having to raise any taxes anytime soon so how did this emerge yes i think it moved from a couple of heterodox economics departments to the policy sphere in a couple of ways so there s some blogging about it certainly since the fiscal policy changes induced by the great recession and one of the leading phd economists who was a proponent of mmt has long been a democratic political operative stephanie kelton worked for the senate budget committee and then she was chief economist on bernie sanders presidential campaign so she is really an important link between the few academic economists who think that these ideas are important and the policy dialogue and then for some reason it is also very popular on twitter but was this idea sort of out there 10 or 20 years ago and no one paid attention to it and then because of the great recession because there is a huge debt and because there was much questioning of traditional economics their idea was given space to emerge or is there something newer about it no actually the mmters the movement claims much older intellectual origins origins that go back to before the neoclassical the new classical economists and the new keynesian economists so they go back to the 50s and the 60s when people still believed in an unmovable phillips curve those kind of neo keynesian economists are ones they often refer back to so you know at least the lineage they claim goes back pretty far the uptick in popularity is certainly related to the fiscal austerity policies we ve seen since the great recession i think some of the pushback on calls for tighter fiscal policy and certainly tighter monetary policy since the great recession has been justified i just don t think that the jumps they re making are particularly useful obviously there s been pushback from mainstream monetary doves too people who think even now that the federal reserve shouldn t be tightening and there were people in 2010 who thought that european countries and the us should run larger fiscal deficits i mean that s fine that s a position a lot of people held none of that has as much to do with what the mmt people specifically claim as arguments for those policy stances right so you ve sort of had this environment where people were unsatisfied with the answers and policies they were given worry about debt worry that the big deficits are going to cause high inflation so there has been a pushback which has now resulted in a different way of looking at those issues but again what i m trying to get at is is it really just the framing device that s new and this is just another way to justify looser monetary policy or more spending or is there a new kind of economics you were talking about how it really all goes back to the 50s and it s keynesian is that really all it is no so that s the lineage the mmt claims i think there s less to it than that so if you look at the book i mentioned earlier by l randall wray who s at the university of missouri kansas city 80 percent of the book is account balances so it shows how the money goes from the central bank to the treasury there are some assets in the private sector there are some assets abroad it s a lot of moving things around on balance sheets the only really substantive economic point there is again that governments can pay off debt they owe in the currency they create and so it feels like there is a lot of thinking going on but in terms of economic substance it s very little do you think the proponents felt the need to sort of drive that point home since after the great recession you heard a lot of concern that the us was going to go bankrupt that it couldn t borrow that credit markets were going to shut down because of these huge trillion dollar deficits is what we re seeing kind of like an overkill to remind people that hey that s not what economics says and here s why yes i think that would be a generous interpretation but i think that s true i don t know there probably are people who believe that you can t just create money to pay off your domestic currency denominated public debt i don t really understand why you wouldn t believe that and i don t really see a counter argument to that very narrow point but this is sort of basic economics that if you have debt in your own currency you can print money is that a concession you re making i think mmters view that as a concession i think it would be a concession if i said that there were no potential downsides to printing money and there are many potential downsides to that so let s talk about two the first downside which is particularly important for the us context is that if you create enough new money at some point inflation will go up that was a big issue in the 70s and it is precisely why much of modern economics kind of ditched the intellectual predecessors of the mmt movement because we ran into stagflation the second point i would make is that policy makers are aware of the fact that they can just create more money and pay off their domestic currency denominated public debt but in some situations they don t do that precisely because there are downsides to it so there s work by wenxin du at the federal reserve board jesse schreger at columbia where they simply show that if you look even at domestic currency denominated sovereign debt markets price at a default risk and we ve seen situations in the past where countries have chosen to default on their domestic currency denominated public debt for example in russia in 98 mexico in 94 and there are good reasons for that one clear one is that if you created a lot more new domestic currency your exchange rate may depreciate now if there are domestic firms who have a lot of foreign currency denominated debt and their balance sheets are confronted with this depreciating exchange rate then they will not be able to pay to live up to those foreign currency denominated debt obligations and so there are real downsides to just cranking up the printing presses and if you don t acknowledge that then your theory is incomplete do you feel that s not being acknowledged well it s certainly not something they re open about which is remarkable for something that refers to itself as a monetary theory right you d think there would be a theory of the price level which is something that monetary economics is often very concerned with and so what they try to do is avoid talking about how they would deal with problems like that because sometimes they re pushed on it and they will say yeah sure if that happens we ll just raise taxes and that will as they say remove the money from the economy but at the same time they try to be a bit slippery about that and say no actually that s not what we re going to do are they saying something different about inflation at all because it seems to me that they point to the current inflation rate and the fact that we ve had big fiscal deficits and say inflation has remained very low are they saying something different maybe building on this secular stagnation idea does that come into play here well they do say those things that s their first line of defense when you say well look we can t just create as much money as we want and use it for public spending programs the first line of defense is that rather than that inflation is low but that s not different from what other more mainstream monetary doves say right at this point it s not even different from what most former monetary hawks say so i don t think that the theory as such adds any anything new to that where they have and i think this is a reasonable interpretation from the writing of at least a good subset of the mmt proponents a different view on inflation and how to deal with it is when that first line of defense is removed you say sure fine but what if we do get inflation and then they say okay then we use tax policy fiscal policy right which is different from the sort of more mainstream view where the monetary authority is in charge of controlling inflation so it s kind of a world turned upside down approach to macroeconomics right where you have the federal reserve in charge of financing these programs whether it s medicare for all or a job guarantee so they will print the money to finance those programs and then it will be up to congress if somehow inflation isn t forever and always low to drain the system of that money through tax increases that s right the house ways and means committee and senate finance well that seems novel is that novel is this what excites them yeah yeah that s novel i would say this is the core of the substantive novelty right i think that is a very bad idea to make that swap and put elected officials in charge of price stability while putting the monetary authority in charge of financing large public programs but i do think that that s really at the heart of what they re thinking get at the problem is that they re never particularly explicit about this part of the modern monetary theory in part of course because this is not the popular part the popular part is we have a way to get your program to spend a lot of money and we don t have to go through the difficult process of raising taxes that s right the unpopular part is when inflation escalates we re going to raise your taxes and if congress isn t fully functional then we re not going to deal with inflation that seems like a bad institutional design under such a system what do you really need a federal reserve for why don t you just have merge it with the treasury department i think that s what they have in mind the federal reserve would i guess do the equivalent of open market operations but to medicare providers yeah or financing the checks going to the job guarantee people so that is not a central bank as we currently envision it right so there s a weird line of logic that i don t understand at all among mmters much less so than this okay we re going to use taxes to ensure price stability sometimes some of the proponents of modern monetary theory say that actually the job guarantee program the universal job guarantee program is what will keep the price dynamics from spinning out of control it s very unclear how this works but the logic is okay well you give everyone a guaranteed fifteen dollars an hour job and that fifteen dollars an hour that somehow fully determines the price level i don t understand how that works at all but that s the only alternative i ve really seen them spell out the only alternative to the previous two options we ve mentioned one we just don t believe that inflation is going to be an issue and two we ll use tax policy to ensure price stability the only alternative to those two options that i ve heard is this that somehow the job guaranteed program will ensure price stability i don t really understand how that would work you would think that if that works then surely what we have now which is medicare fee for service payments that would also ensure price stability and yet no one believes that so where does the confidence come from that politicians in congress will take this kind of unpopular action that they will do that especially when we ve seen central banks at the behest of politicians make very bad decisions which is why we try to have independent central banks where does the confidence come from that flipping that around is going to work better well so i think this is why they are often hesitant to talk about this backstop is this like an anti technocrat kind of populist thing or intellectual cover for it i m not even sure that s the case i think that they just want the additional social spending and mmt provides i guess the intellectual veneer for doing that i think this is why the proponents become a little evasive when you press them on how to deal with inflation and how they sometimes contradict themselves it s precisely because i don t think they re super confident that having the house ways and means committee in charge of ensuring price stability is a good institutional design well couldn t you create some sort of independent body so you could have an independent fiscal authority instead of an independent monetary authority the concern there has typically been that fiscal policy choices often include many more direct distributional choices than monetary policy does the idea we re going to have a panel of unelected technocrats and they re going to figure out who pays what tax rate and what tax credits maybe get reduced that does seem like the job of congress right yeah those choices are much more inherently political than the monetary policy choices whatever concerns you may have about those but i think if you had to rank order them by what are the more politically sensitive choices i d say tax choices are more politically sensitive than setting the federal funds rate that s what it would come down to so the thing is they don t want to go down this route this far so i ve never seen an explicit institutional design featuring an independent fiscal authority alright do they have a point because i ve seen some more traditional left of center economists and they ll say well listen one thing this does it does kind of reframes the issue a little bit and we ve been too worried about debt i mean we ve seen the debt gdp ratio double over the past decade with no apparent impact on inflation or ability to borrow so to the extent that this trend nudges policy in a direction that seems to worry a bit less about debt it s a good thing so do the mmters have it more right than the people who were pushing for simpson bowles and who were saying we need to dramatically reduce the deficits is their story given what we ve seen the past more right than that story no well i wouldn t say so because again i don t think their story in the parts that are useful adds much to what people have been saying people have pointed to japan and said look they have a massive amount of debt and they re doing just fine you know i don t think the us itself we re running at 3 7 percent unemployment and we re a running 5 percent of gdp fiscal deficits i don t think in that debate that the people who say deficits don t matter and that we can just go ahead and spend need more help i think they re doing fine just by themselves as you look at what the left and the right have been saying about debts and deficits has the fact that folks on the right have their own theory of supply side economics which says debts and deficits don t matter we should cut taxes tax cuts will in many cases pay for themselves and in more extreme versions all tax cuts seem to pay for themselves given space for this idea to percolate well yes i do think in many ways it s the left wing equivalent of the we re always to the right of the peak of the laffer curve thinking which we ve seen on the right in the us over the past couple of decades for example last year when the tax cuts and jobs act passed basically every senior republican elected official said no it ll pay for itself say what you will about the world which derived the laffer curve guys they ve definitely convinced a lot of elected officials i think that s bad i don t think that s good and so i d be disappointed if the mmt guys succeed in doing the same thing to the center left do you think that current federal debt levels are anywhere close to being a problem whether it s the debt or the deficits which are also supposed to rise people always ask me what is the danger zone is it that debt as a share of gdp is it 100 percent is that the danger zone are we anywhere near that danger zone well i think one of the issues is that we don t really know where the danger zone is and i d say lower is better than higher we also have to remember that whatever the danger zone is higher federal debt levels crowd out private sector activity whether or not you re worried about an immediately looming financial crisis think of this past year i think there s pretty broad agreement that without the increased deficits from the tax bill fiscal stimulus and the spending bill fiscal stimulus i don t think we would have seen interest rates rise as much and so we wouldn t have seen that much crowding out of the private sector again is that a theory that s in dispute at all the impact of deficits on the crowding out of private enterprise and do mmters challenge that so it s hard to think of how they think of interest rates because their theoretical framework is balance sheets right so there are no dynamics in the end the interest rate is the relative price of consumption in one period and another and that there are no multiple periods in their economic thinking so i wouldn t be confident saying one way or another whether they are concerned about that just because i ve never really seen them develop a theory of how investment works so this is a in a sense a big difference with sort of other modern macro economic theories right so their models are basically accounting balance sheets whereas all modern mainstream economics starts from optimizing agents and firms who plan ahead who try to invest so as to reap benefits in future periods none of that is in their work i don t really find it easy to think of interest rates in the context of their theories i think some proponents would say that if you look at what the economy has done over the past decade that the performance and particularly what we ve seen with inflation should cause mainstream economists to take pause and think hard about whether they have the story right have you done that does anything whether it s persistently low inflation changed your thinking at all because there have been a variety of theories that have popped up to say that we had it wrong and now we re suffering from secular stagnation and persistent lack of demand and we need to do something different has anything happened in the past 10 years about how you think about these issues well i haven t been particularly worried about inflation over the past ten years and i think that the people who were worried have indeed changed their minds we ve seen that even in practice the european central bank basically made a 180 on its monetary policy stance after they realized and that there was no reason for them to be as concerned about inflation as they were right after the crisis hit so i do think we ve seen people reconsider really how large the inflation threat was in the early recovery from the financial crisis i don t think that has required a fundamental reshaping of their theoretical framework i think they ve just learned more about the way the economy works and i think that s been helpful i don t think that the mmt framework would have helped them much in 2009 because there s nothing even approaching empirical implementability so say it s 2008 and if we were all mmters what does the government do in reaction to an economy that seems to be collapsing i don t know i would imagine it implements a universal jobs program and so then we get to 2012 the federal government now employs an additional maybe 20 million people and those people are going to be employed by the federal government it s really hard to think of that kind of counterfactual especially if you implement it right when lots of people are losing their jobs presumably they will all get hired by the federal government it s not clear what they will do they ll be employed at fifteen dollars an hour it ll take a long time for the private sector to want to rehire them it s tough again there isn t much in terms of quantification in the theoretical framework i don t really know how to think about that but i think that would be the first order impact that the federal government would employ a lot more people than it did otherwise it s a question i get asked a lot i m not sure i give a very good answer but why is inflation still so low it seems unemployment is very low there s all this stimulus in the system and yet inflation seems low too well i think it s about where it is because that s what the federal reserve s inflation target is and so when inflation threatens to rise above 2 percent the federal reserve raises interest rates as it has been doing consistently for a couple years now the fed has not been proven powerless in fact it s been proven effective at keeping inflation down right yes exactly and it took really drastic measures during the great recession i don t really understand why the mmt people aren t giving them credit for it they took extraordinary measures that i don t think anyone could have predicted in 2005 and so in that sense they did what they were supposed to do but again the reason why inflation now is low is because the fed sets an inflation target and they re trying to stick to it right does part of this stem from the fact that this appears to be a novel way of looking at the world and a number of things have happened for example there have been a number of theories proposed over the past decade to explain what we ve seen in the job market and why the recovery has been weaker than what some people might have expected including this secular stagnation theory from larry summers these theories often point to corporations not investing because they re all short term oriented or that the labor market has changed and we now have a gig economy or that there s too much monopoly to explain what many people view as a malfunctioning economy is the right answer or simple answer still that we had a banking crisis housing crisis and financial crisis all rolled up in one 10 years ago and boy it s taking a while to heal yeah i think that s right and so a bunch of the theories a few of the things you mentioned are a little more recent vintage that people were very worried about earlier on during the depth of the great recession have bit by bit been proven not that concerning you don t hear people talk about the work disincentives in the affordable care act as much anymore even though casey mulligan used to argue that that was basically what explained all the job losses during the great recession the idea that uncertainty about obama economic policies was a depressant yeah i think that policy uncertainty is still not very helpful i think we now see on the trade side that that s still an issue but it is certainly not the only thing that explained the depth of the great recession i think recovery just takes a while recovery from financial crises has always been slow and then just as we wrap up mmters again they re not happy with the fed do we need a new and maybe it isn t modern monetary theory that we re getting theory of monetary policy or do the central bankers already have it right what i would like is a more explicitly developed version of modern monetary theory if that is what we re going to engage with then i would like for them to answer questions about the institutional design they have in mind i would like to see them try and quantify some of the mechanisms in their work that kind of stuff that seems like a good way for them to spend some of their intellectual energy i m going to end our chat the same way you end the paper which is a concern that mmt could lead to hyperinflation which doesn t necessarily mean wheelbarrows full of money but it does mean much higher inflation than we ve seen in this country in a long time do you think that s a genuine risk and what do you mean by hyperinflation what i mean is that if you take mmters at their word in the most aggressive sense then what you would see is a massive debt finance expansion of the welfare state with medicare for all with a jobs guarantee and with concerns about inflation being deferred entirely to elected officials who would have to raise taxes to keep it under control i think in a scenario like that we do run a risk of going back to the 1970s pre volker style macroeconomics and i think that would be bad
in january 1999 the euro was born the euro is a unique experiment in which a group of countries in europe have given their national currencies and have ceded control of their monetary policy to the european central bank ecb analysts and economists share their thoughts with cnbc on how the euro has fared and what it s future might hold january marks 20 years since the launch of the euro but whether it s been good for the region and whether it can survive another 20 years unscathed is hotly contested an economic and monetary union emu had long been an ambition of europe s integrationist politicians and was seen as a natural progression to the eu s ideals of ever greater union hence in january 1999 the euro a unique experiment in which countries in europe would give up their national currencies adopt the single currency and cede control of their monetary policy to a newly created supranational european central bank ecb was born the ecb had been established a year before to define and administer monetary policy for the euro zone and had the chief responsibility to maintain price stability with an inflation target of below but close to 2 percent in the meantime members retained control over their fiscal policies although there are overarching rules on these in the eu at its inception in 1999 the euro was adopted by 11 eu members but it was then joined by greece slovenia cyprus malta slovakia and then the baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania followed euro notes and coins were officially introduced as legal tender in 2002 twenty years on the euro is now used by over 340 million europeans with more eu countries expected to join the union and is one of the most important currencies in the world monetary union has been tested since its inception with first the global financial crisis and subsequent sovereign debt crises in the euro zone testing how far the region s politicians were willing to go to save the euro zone essentially a political project embodying the eu s aims at ever closer union story continues a slightly mad project analysts and economists shared their thoughts with cnbc on how the euro has fared and what it s future might hold one thing s for sure with the euro they note it s too late to turn back now the euro s main achievement is still being here and it s very likely that it s here to stay constantine fraser european political research analyst at ts lombard told cnbc this slightly mad project of a supranational currency union with wildly different economies within it has lasted 20 years and brought these economies and countries closer together fraser said that the biggest impact the euro has made in the region is that it has enormously raised the cost of backtracking on the european project the benefits of the euro quickly became apparent in its early years with the most obvious advantages being the removal of transaction costs the cost of exchanging currency increased price transparency and the simplification and stabilization of cross border trade investment and business cross border supply and cross border economies have grown up around it as a result of the euro fraser noted the euro has also thrown up disadvantages however with critics saying its one policy fits all approach is unfit for a region with massive variations in its member economies the loss of an independent monetary policy also means that members cannot devalue their own currencies in order to regain competitiveness this has been a major problem for countries like greece rules on budget deficits essentially limiting what countries can borrow have also led to criticisms that it s harder for these countries to bring about economic recovery and that they then have to resort to austerity measures which themselves can cause recessions the costs of leaving the single currency would be high but nonetheless recessions and crises within member economies have led to some nostalgia for former currencies and resentment at the loss of economic independence as we saw in greece amid its bailouts a seriously incomplete currency union economists tend to agree that a lot of the problems that the euro and its adherents has experienced were not foreseen by its creators monetary union also threw up challenges that european economies had not experienced before according to felix huefner a senior european economist at ubs in the 90s the challenges for european countries were more focused around exchange rate volatility with intra euro exchange rates fixed since 1999 any adjustments in competitiveness had to be done internally with wage restraint and structural reforms he said last week one lesson over the last 20 years is that that has proved to be tougher than initially thought the recent pushback against structural reforms in france is just one example he said while structural reforms remain a bone of contention in the modern day euro zone it s first major challenge a decade ago was the global financial crash of 2008 and subsequent sovereign debt crises of varying degrees and causes in greece portugal ireland spain and cyprus italy was also fragile but did not request any financial help although it remains a risk in the region with major economies in the euro zone at risk from economic collapse it fell to the ecb along with the european commission and international monetary fund collectively known as the troika to effectively save the single currency project by giving financial bailouts to euro zone members in order to prevent contagion and further collapse of the entire monetary union j p morgan economists david mackie and greg fuzesi noted that the ecb s role in the monetary union evolved in the first decade of its existence in the first decade the ecb achieved its objectives at least in terms of growth and inflation but beneath the surface stresses in the euro area were building in the form of large intra regional financial imbalances driven by excessive leverage in a number of individual countries spain portugal greece and ireland they said in a note last wednesday for all of the second decade from 2009 2018 the ecb was dealing with the macro consequences of the unwinding of the imbalances that had built in the first decade they said existential crisis the sovereign debt crisis showed that the euro zone was established without adequate thought given to the institutions that a currency needs according to ts lombard s fraser who added that this brought about something of an existential crisis for the currency between 2010 and 2015 the obvious failure of the euro is that it s a seriously incomplete currency union it was set up with only some of the institutions that a currency requires that and policy mistakes by member states such as the unnecessarily aggressive stance on deficit reduction and to a lesser extent mistakes by the ecb like the 2011 rate hikes caused a massive depression in the region he noted amid soaring bond yields and increasing fragility europe s commitment to the euro zone project was made no clearer than in july 2012 when the president of the ecb mario draghi made his now infamous whatever it takes speech credited with saving the euro a week later the ecb announced a program to buy the bonds of distressed euro members the policy was known as outright monetary transactions if necessary omt has never been used but the announcement alone along with draghi s remark was seen to have helped to lower bond yields in the euro zone draghi s pledge to do whatever it takes gave the euro zone the central bank backstop it needed and was also an important symbolic moment in making clear that the euro zone was here to stay and policymakers were committed to its survival ts lombard s fraser notes still the euro zone s integrity was again threatened in 2015 when greece came close to crashing out of the single currency at the height of its crisis a majority of greeks rejected taking another international bailout from the troika in a referendum but as the potential costs of leaving the euro and a likely debt default became clear the government backtracked and it reluctantly signed up to a third bailout with onerous conditions extraordinary measures in late 2014 the ecb embarked on a series of bond buying programs that morphed into a fully fledged quantitative easing asset purchase program that has only just been wound down in december 2018 the idea of qe was to boost money supply in the euro zone bank lending and consumer spending at the end of qe the ecb has accumulated over 2 trillion euros worth of assets while qe helped the region to recover from crisis to what extent is debatable the region s economic turmoil made it clear that more institutional reforms and more integration were needed in order to prevent or contain any future financial shocks replacing earlier funding programs and changing the way bailouts would be handled the european stability mechanism was created to cover any future lending to euro members in financial difficulty and was used in 2012 and 2013 for spain and cyprus bank recapitalization programs in order to prevent future financial crises or at least to see them coming and to prevent a so called doom loop between governments and european banks a loop of mutual reliance and fragility a banking union was also initiated in 2012 so that european banks would be subject to more supervision and rules from the ecb along with this single supervisory mechanism there is a second pillar of the banking union the single resolution mechanism srm this contains a fund a single resolution fund financed by contributions from the banking sector that was created to resolve failing banks in the region and to shore up the whole financial system the process is not yet finished however we ve seen the creation of a banking union with common banking supervision and a resolution fund the single resolution fund but there is still no european deposit insurance scheme in place ubs huefner said many analysts argue that the euro zone needs to become a fiscal union a centralized approach to revenue collection and expenditure which would entail a shared budget fiscal discipline and shared debt as well as monetary union in order to survive those in favor of fiscal union argue that it would promote more stability and equality in the region and that without it the euro zone remains vulnerable to economic shocks and imbalances critics say it cedes more sovereignty to the euro zone and takes away governments ability to set country specific spending and borrowing levels while a fiscal union is seen as a logical step in the quest for ever closer economic and political ties and is promoted by the likes of french president emmanuel macron it is nonetheless controversial while germany does not balk at the idea of a euro zone budget or euro zone finance ministry for example it is less than keen to see debt sharing in the region the mutualization of debt via the issuance of a euro zone bond could bring down borrowing costs for the region s weaker countries like greece but it is a thorny issue for germany which currently has low borrowing costs and fears becoming responsible and having to effectively underwrite its weaker riskier neighbors against this backdrop of resistance over more fiscal integration ubs huefner said the euro zone is not yet complete going further requires more burden sharing i e joint insurance of risks across euro zone countries but as we ve seen there is no consensus how far to go france is more in favor of this while there s more resistance from germany he said nonetheless huefner added that the euro zone project was essentially a political project rather than economic and that there is a commitment to ensure its survival ensuring the euro s survival after a prolonged period of expansionary monetary policy the ecb is now pursuing the normalization of policy essentially a return to conventional tools like interest rates at the center of its policy despite its massive asset purchase program over the last few years inflation remains low in the euro zone at 1 6 percent in december down from 1 9 percent the previous month amid a period of uncertain and mainly weak economic growth and this is a concern for the central bank the outlook for the region in 2019 is not great according to daniel lacalle chief economist at tressis gestion he told cnbc last wednesday that the euro zone economy is likely to enter a period of stagnation this year as france italy germany and spain post weaker growth figures than expected while weak commodity prices may help the euro zone avoid a recession he noted credit risks will probably intensify as the effect of ecb purchases ends and political unrest rises after a decade of recovery from the financial crisis political instability is now a larger and more unpredictable threat in the euro zone j p morgan s fuzesi and mackie said noting that the main challenge of the ecb s third decade is likely to be ensuring the survival of the monetary union not due to financial market stress but against the backdrop of significant populist pressure italy is a prime example of the charge of populist or grass roots politics and how they re becoming increasingly influential there a coalition of the right wing lega party and the anti establishment five star movement formed a government last june and they have wasted no time challenging the status quo in the euro zone in terms of spending plans and reforms as it tries to revamp italy s stagnating economy the euro zone s third largest economy is a major threat to and potential failure of the euro zone ts lombard s fraser said the single biggest and ongoing failure or problem or headache in the euro zone is italy it cannot grow it has a creaking economy it been out competed by the likes of china and it has an aging population if it had its own currency it could devalue it and become more competitive but it can t do that in the euro he said likening italy to a sovereign state that s become more like west virginia fraser said a lack of unified strategy or rescue plan when it comes to italy reflected a wider lack of solidarity in the euro zone and one that could prevent more integration europeans don t yet feel european enough to be happy with large fiscal transfers from one part of the euro zone to another he noted the euro zone is incomplete it has all these problems and it needs to get deeper it needs to integrate more it can t stand still otherwise it could fall there is the political will to make sure it survives but how fast it can move towards more integration by making small incremental changes is unknown

rep alexandria ocasio cortez has said it absolutely should be part of our conversation about the economy during the presidential campaign sen bernie sanders chief economist was an adherent but what the heck is modern monetary theory on this episode economist and aei scholar stan veuger breaks it all down discussing his latest article for aei economic perspectives titled modern monetary theory and policy stan veuger is a resident scholar here at aei where he specializes in political economy and public finance what follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation you can download the episode by clicking the link below and don t forget to subscribe to my podcast on itunes or stitcher tell your friends leave a review pethokoukis modern monetary theory is an economic idea that s sort of been bubbling around for a while on twitter i mean that s where i saw it but it s sort of now entered the political landscape there are politicians talking about it now with greater or lesser specificity they may not call it mmt modern monetary theory but they seem to like the idea what is the idea what is it and what isn t it what is its central claim veuger the central claim of mmt is that if you have borrowed money in your domestic currency in your own currency the currency that you as the government create then you can always pay back those claims right that s what we do in the united states it is yes so it is the idea is that the us government can create more dollars and then it can use those dollars to pay its debt that s the central idea that does not sound very interesting that sounds like something that s not a controversial statement so why are folks on the left and democratic politicians talking about this theory if that s the central claim because there s a few economists and other people who have turned this relatively uncontroversial claim into a broader political agenda and so what they say is because you can always live up to the financial obligations you incurred in your own domestic currency that means that there are no real borrowing constrains that you have to take into account that is i think a fair representation now some of the people who associate with this movement will push back and say no we do believe in resource constrains and things like that but only when they receive push back they typically do frame the idea as allowing for extrapolation from we can pay back what we owe in our own currency to we can take on significant additional spending programs without running into any kind of macroeconomic constraint now one thing to keep in mind is that part of why this theory if you want to call it that is poorly defined is that it s never really been spelled out there are very few explicit academic style articles on the topic there are no real articles in serious academic journals you know there s a book titled modern monetary theory that s by one of the proponents someone who s at the university of missouri kansas city but that book also contains some content that other people who on twitter identify as mmt proponents would not necessarily accept and so i think it s hard to move in specific terms beyond one the undisputed idea that you can pay off debt owed in your local currency and two that a lot of the proponents of the theory as a broader concept would like to see more public spending and are not worried about paying for it do you have a sense of the path this idea has taken now you have politicians like rep alexandria ocasio cortez talking about it and i also see other people talking about it again they may not use the phrase they seem to have heard the idea that there s a way that we can get our spending agenda through without having to raise any taxes anytime soon so how did this emerge yes i think it moved from a couple of heterodox economics departments to the policy sphere in a couple of ways so there s some blogging about it certainly since the fiscal policy changes induced by the great recession and one of the leading phd economists who was a proponent of mmt has long been a democratic political operative stephanie kelton worked for the senate budget committee and then she was chief economist on bernie sanders presidential campaign so she is really an important link between the few academic economists who think that these ideas are important and the policy dialogue and then for some reason it is also very popular on twitter but was this idea sort of out there 10 or 20 years ago and no one paid attention to it and then because of the great recession because there is a huge debt and because there was much questioning of traditional economics their idea was given space to emerge or is there something newer about it no actually the mmters the movement claims much older intellectual origins origins that go back to before the neoclassical the new classical economists and the new keynesian economists so they go back to the 50s and the 60s when people still believed in an unmovable phillips curve those kind of neo keynesian economists are ones they often refer back to so you know at least the lineage they claim goes back pretty far the uptick in popularity is certainly related to the fiscal austerity policies we ve seen since the great recession i think some of the pushback on calls for tighter fiscal policy and certainly tighter monetary policy since the great recession has been justified i just don t think that the jumps they re making are particularly useful obviously there s been pushback from mainstream monetary doves too people who think even now that the federal reserve shouldn t be tightening and there were people in 2010 who thought that european countries and the us should run larger fiscal deficits i mean that s fine that s a position a lot of people held none of that has as much to do with what the mmt people specifically claim as arguments for those policy stances right so you ve sort of had this environment where people were unsatisfied with the answers and policies they were given worry about debt worry that the big deficits are going to cause high inflation so there has been a pushback which has now resulted in a different way of looking at those issues but again what i m trying to get at is is it really just the framing device that s new and this is just another way to justify looser monetary policy or more spending or is there a new kind of economics you were talking about how it really all goes back to the 50s and it s keynesian is that really all it is no so that s the lineage the mmt claims i think there s less to it than that so if you look at the book i mentioned earlier by l randall wray who s at the university of missouri kansas city 80 percent of the book is account balances so it shows how the money goes from the central bank to the treasury there are some assets in the private sector there are some assets abroad it s a lot of moving things around on balance sheets the only really substantive economic point there is again that governments can pay off debt they owe in the currency they create and so it feels like there is a lot of thinking going on but in terms of economic substance it s very little do you think the proponents felt the need to sort of drive that point home since after the great recession you heard a lot of concern that the us was going to go bankrupt that it couldn t borrow that credit markets were going to shut down because of these huge trillion dollar deficits is what we re seeing kind of like an overkill to remind people that hey that s not what economics says and here s why yes i think that would be a generous interpretation but i think that s true i don t know there probably are people who believe that you can t just create money to pay off your domestic currency denominated public debt i don t really understand why you wouldn t believe that and i don t really see a counter argument to that very narrow point but this is sort of basic economics that if you have debt in your own currency you can print money is that a concession you re making i think mmters view that as a concession i think it would be a concession if i said that there were no potential downsides to printing money and there are many potential downsides to that so let s talk about two the first downside which is particularly important for the us context is that if you create enough new money at some point inflation will go up that was a big issue in the 70s and it is precisely why much of modern economics kind of ditched the intellectual predecessors of the mmt movement because we ran into stagflation the second point i would make is that policy makers are aware of the fact that they can just create more money and pay off their domestic currency denominated public debt but in some situations they don t do that precisely because there are downsides to it so there s work by wenxin du at the federal reserve board jesse schreger at columbia where they simply show that if you look even at domestic currency denominated sovereign debt markets price at a default risk and we ve seen situations in the past where countries have chosen to default on their domestic currency denominated public debt for example in russia in 98 mexico in 94 and there are good reasons for that one clear one is that if you created a lot more new domestic currency your exchange rate may depreciate now if there are domestic firms who have a lot of foreign currency denominated debt and their balance sheets are confronted with this depreciating exchange rate then they will not be able to pay to live up to those foreign currency denominated debt obligations and so there are real downsides to just cranking up the printing presses and if you don t acknowledge that then your theory is incomplete do you feel that s not being acknowledged well it s certainly not something they re open about which is remarkable for something that refers to itself as a monetary theory right you d think there would be a theory of the price level which is something that monetary economics is often very concerned with and so what they try to do is avoid talking about how they would deal with problems like that because sometimes they re pushed on it and they will say yeah sure if that happens we ll just raise taxes and that will as they say remove the money from the economy but at the same time they try to be a bit slippery about that and say no actually that s not what we re going to do are they saying something different about inflation at all because it seems to me that they point to the current inflation rate and the fact that we ve had big fiscal deficits and say inflation has remained very low are they saying something different maybe building on this secular stagnation idea does that come into play here well they do say those things that s their first line of defense when you say well look we can t just create as much money as we want and use it for public spending programs the first line of defense is that rather than that inflation is low but that s not different from what other more mainstream monetary doves say right at this point it s not even different from what most former monetary hawks say so i don t think that the theory as such adds any anything new to that where they have and i think this is a reasonable interpretation from the writing of at least a good subset of the mmt proponents a different view on inflation and how to deal with it is when that first line of defense is removed you say sure fine but what if we do get inflation and then they say okay then we use tax policy fiscal policy right which is different from the sort of more mainstream view where the monetary authority is in charge of controlling inflation so it s kind of a world turned upside down approach to macroeconomics right where you have the federal reserve in charge of financing these programs whether it s medicare for all or a job guarantee so they will print the money to finance those programs and then it will be up to congress if somehow inflation isn t forever and always low to drain the system of that money through tax increases that s right the house ways and means committee and senate finance well that seems novel is that novel is this what excites them yeah yeah that s novel i would say this is the core of the substantive novelty right i think that is a very bad idea to make that swap and put elected officials in charge of price stability while putting the monetary authority in charge of financing large public programs but i do think that that s really at the heart of what they re thinking get at the problem is that they re never particularly explicit about this part of the modern monetary theory in part of course because this is not the popular part the popular part is we have a way to get your program to spend a lot of money and we don t have to go through the difficult process of raising taxes that s right the unpopular part is when inflation escalates we re going to raise your taxes and if congress isn t fully functional then we re not going to deal with inflation that seems like a bad institutional design under such a system what do you really need a federal reserve for why don t you just have merge it with the treasury department i think that s what they have in mind the federal reserve would i guess do the equivalent of open market operations but to medicare providers yeah or financing the checks going to the job guarantee people so that is not a central bank as we currently envision it right so there s a weird line of logic that i don t understand at all among mmters much less so than this okay we re going to use taxes to ensure price stability sometimes some of the proponents of modern monetary theory say that actually the job guarantee program the universal job guarantee program is what will keep the price dynamics from spinning out of control it s very unclear how this works but the logic is okay well you give everyone a guaranteed fifteen dollars an hour job and that fifteen dollars an hour that somehow fully determines the price level i don t understand how that works at all but that s the only alternative i ve really seen them spell out the only alternative to the previous two options we ve mentioned one we just don t believe that inflation is going to be an issue and two we ll use tax policy to ensure price stability the only alternative to those two options that i ve heard is this that somehow the job guaranteed program will ensure price stability i don t really understand how that would work you would think that if that works then surely what we have now which is medicare fee for service payments that would also ensure price stability and yet no one believes that so where does the confidence come from that politicians in congress will take this kind of unpopular action that they will do that especially when we ve seen central banks at the behest of politicians make very bad decisions which is why we try to have independent central banks where does the confidence come from that flipping that around is going to work better well so i think this is why they are often hesitant to talk about this backstop is this like an anti technocrat kind of populist thing or intellectual cover for it i m not even sure that s the case i think that they just want the additional social spending and mmt provides i guess the intellectual veneer for doing that i think this is why the proponents become a little evasive when you press them on how to deal with inflation and how they sometimes contradict themselves it s precisely because i don t think they re super confident that having the house ways and means committee in charge of ensuring price stability is a good institutional design well couldn t you create some sort of independent body so you could have an independent fiscal authority instead of an independent monetary authority the concern there has typically been that fiscal policy choices often include many more direct distributional choices than monetary policy does the idea we re going to have a panel of unelected technocrats and they re going to figure out who pays what tax rate and what tax credits maybe get reduced that does seem like the job of congress right yeah those choices are much more inherently political than the monetary policy choices whatever concerns you may have about those but i think if you had to rank order them by what are the more politically sensitive choices i d say tax choices are more politically sensitive than setting the federal funds rate that s what it would come down to so the thing is they don t want to go down this route this far so i ve never seen an explicit institutional design featuring an independent fiscal authority alright do they have a point because i ve seen some more traditional left of center economists and they ll say well listen one thing this does it does kind of reframes the issue a little bit and we ve been too worried about debt i mean we ve seen the debt gdp ratio double over the past decade with no apparent impact on inflation or ability to borrow so to the extent that this trend nudges policy in a direction that seems to worry a bit less about debt it s a good thing so do the mmters have it more right than the people who were pushing for simpson bowles and who were saying we need to dramatically reduce the deficits is their story given what we ve seen the past more right than that story no well i wouldn t say so because again i don t think their story in the parts that are useful adds much to what people have been saying people have pointed to japan and said look they have a massive amount of debt and they re doing just fine you know i don t think the us itself we re running at 3 7 percent unemployment and we re a running 5 percent of gdp fiscal deficits i don t think in that debate that the people who say deficits don t matter and that we can just go ahead and spend need more help i think they re doing fine just by themselves as you look at what the left and the right have been saying about debts and deficits has the fact that folks on the right have their own theory of supply side economics which says debts and deficits don t matter we should cut taxes tax cuts will in many cases pay for themselves and in more extreme versions all tax cuts seem to pay for themselves given space for this idea to percolate well yes i do think in many ways it s the left wing equivalent of the we re always to the right of the peak of the laffer curve thinking which we ve seen on the right in the us over the past couple of decades for example last year when the tax cuts and jobs act passed basically every senior republican elected official said no it ll pay for itself say what you will about the world which derived the laffer curve guys they ve definitely convinced a lot of elected officials i think that s bad i don t think that s good and so i d be disappointed if the mmt guys succeed in doing the same thing to the center left do you think that current federal debt levels are anywhere close to being a problem whether it s the debt or the deficits which are also supposed to rise people always ask me what is the danger zone is it that debt as a share of gdp is it 100 percent is that the danger zone are we anywhere near that danger zone well i think one of the issues is that we don t really know where the danger zone is and i d say lower is better than higher we also have to remember that whatever the danger zone is higher federal debt levels crowd out private sector activity whether or not you re worried about an immediately looming financial crisis think of this past year i think there s pretty broad agreement that without the increased deficits from the tax bill fiscal stimulus and the spending bill fiscal stimulus i don t think we would have seen interest rates rise as much and so we wouldn t have seen that much crowding out of the private sector again is that a theory that s in dispute at all the impact of deficits on the crowding out of private enterprise and do mmters challenge that so it s hard to think of how they think of interest rates because their theoretical framework is balance sheets right so there are no dynamics in the end the interest rate is the relative price of consumption in one period and another and that there are no multiple periods in their economic thinking so i wouldn t be confident saying one way or another whether they are concerned about that just because i ve never really seen them develop a theory of how investment works so this is a in a sense a big difference with sort of other modern macro economic theories right so their models are basically accounting balance sheets whereas all modern mainstream economics starts from optimizing agents and firms who plan ahead who try to invest so as to reap benefits in future periods none of that is in their work i don t really find it easy to think of interest rates in the context of their theories i think some proponents would say that if you look at what the economy has done over the past decade that the performance and particularly what we ve seen with inflation should cause mainstream economists to take pause and think hard about whether they have the story right have you done that does anything whether it s persistently low inflation changed your thinking at all because there have been a variety of theories that have popped up to say that we had it wrong and now we re suffering from secular stagnation and persistent lack of demand and we need to do something different has anything happened in the past 10 years about how you think about these issues well i haven t been particularly worried about inflation over the past ten years and i think that the people who were worried have indeed changed their minds we ve seen that even in practice the european central bank basically made a 180 on its monetary policy stance after they realized and that there was no reason for them to be as concerned about inflation as they were right after the crisis hit so i do think we ve seen people reconsider really how large the inflation threat was in the early recovery from the financial crisis i don t think that has required a fundamental reshaping of their theoretical framework i think they ve just learned more about the way the economy works and i think that s been helpful i don t think that the mmt framework would have helped them much in 2009 because there s nothing even approaching empirical implementability so say it s 2008 and if we were all mmters what does the government do in reaction to an economy that seems to be collapsing i don t know i would imagine it implements a universal jobs program and so then we get to 2012 the federal government now employs an additional maybe 20 million people and those people are going to be employed by the federal government it s really hard to think of that kind of counterfactual especially if you implement it right when lots of people are losing their jobs presumably they will all get hired by the federal government it s not clear what they will do they ll be employed at fifteen dollars an hour it ll take a long time for the private sector to want to rehire them it s tough again there isn t much in terms of quantification in the theoretical framework i don t really know how to think about that but i think that would be the first order impact that the federal government would employ a lot more people than it did otherwise it s a question i get asked a lot i m not sure i give a very good answer but why is inflation still so low it seems unemployment is very low there s all this stimulus in the system and yet inflation seems low too well i think it s about where it is because that s what the federal reserve s inflation target is and so when inflation threatens to rise above 2 percent the federal reserve raises interest rates as it has been doing consistently for a couple years now the fed has not been proven powerless in fact it s been proven effective at keeping inflation down right yes exactly and it took really drastic measures during the great recession i don t really understand why the mmt people aren t giving them credit for it they took extraordinary measures that i don t think anyone could have predicted in 2005 and so in that sense they did what they were supposed to do but again the reason why inflation now is low is because the fed sets an inflation target and they re trying to stick to it right does part of this stem from the fact that this appears to be a novel way of looking at the world and a number of things have happened for example there have been a number of theories proposed over the past decade to explain what we ve seen in the job market and why the recovery has been weaker than what some people might have expected including this secular stagnation theory from larry summers these theories often point to corporations not investing because they re all short term oriented or that the labor market has changed and we now have a gig economy or that there s too much monopoly to explain what many people view as a malfunctioning economy is the right answer or simple answer still that we had a banking crisis housing crisis and financial crisis all rolled up in one 10 years ago and boy it s taking a while to heal yeah i think that s right and so a bunch of the theories a few of the things you mentioned are a little more recent vintage that people were very worried about earlier on during the depth of the great recession have bit by bit been proven not that concerning you don t hear people talk about the work disincentives in the affordable care act as much anymore even though casey mulligan used to argue that that was basically what explained all the job losses during the great recession the idea that uncertainty about obama economic policies was a depressant yeah i think that policy uncertainty is still not very helpful i think we now see on the trade side that that s still an issue but it is certainly not the only thing that explained the depth of the great recession i think recovery just takes a while recovery from financial crises has always been slow and then just as we wrap up mmters again they re not happy with the fed do we need a new and maybe it isn t modern monetary theory that we re getting theory of monetary policy or do the central bankers already have it right what i would like is a more explicitly developed version of modern monetary theory if that is what we re going to engage with then i would like for them to answer questions about the institutional design they have in mind i would like to see them try and quantify some of the mechanisms in their work that kind of stuff that seems like a good way for them to spend some of their intellectual energy i m going to end our chat the same way you end the paper which is a concern that mmt could lead to hyperinflation which doesn t necessarily mean wheelbarrows full of money but it does mean much higher inflation than we ve seen in this country in a long time do you think that s a genuine risk and what do you mean by hyperinflation what i mean is that if you take mmters at their word in the most aggressive sense then what you would see is a massive debt finance expansion of the welfare state with medicare for all with a jobs guarantee and with concerns about inflation being deferred entirely to elected officials who would have to raise taxes to keep it under control i think in a scenario like that we do run a risk of going back to the 1970s pre volker style macroeconomics and i think that would be bad
some three decades after the wars of revolution and counterinsurgency came to an end in central america the region is once again on the brink of implosion the isthmus has been gripped by renewed mass struggle and state repression the cracking of fragile political systems unprecedented corruption drug violence and the displacement and forced migration of millions of workers and peasants the backdrop to this second implosion of central america reflecting the spiraling crisis of global capitalism itself is the exhaustion of a new round of capitalist development in recent years to the same drumbeat as the globalization that took place in the wake of the 1980s upheavals lost in the headlines on central american refugees fleeing to the united states is both the historical context that has sparked the exodus and the structural transformations through capitalist globalization that has brought the region to where it is today the mass revolutionary movements of the 1970s and 1980s did manage to dislodge entrenched military civilian dictatorships and open up political systems to electoral competition but they were unable to achieve any substantial social justice or democratization of the socioeconomic order capitalist globalization in the isthmus in the wake of pacification unleashed a new cycle of modernization and accumulation it transformed the old oligarchic class structures generated new transnationally oriented elites and capitalists and high consumption middle classes even as it displaced millions aggravated poverty inequality and social exclusion and wreaked havoc on the environment triggering waves of outmigration and new rounds of mass mobilization among those who stayed behind hence the very conditions that gave rise to the conflict in the first place were aggravated by capitalist globalization despite the illusion of peace and democracy so touted by the transnational elite in the wake of pacification the roots of the regional conflict have persisted the extreme concentration of wealth and political power in the hands of elite minorities alongside the pauperization and powerlessness of a dispossessed majority with the 2009 coup d état in honduras the massacre of peaceful protesters in nicaragua in 2018 and the return of death squads in guatemala this illusion has been definitively shattered the central american regimes now face mounting crises of legitimacy economic stagnation and the collapse of the social fabric the transnational model of capitalist development as central america became swept up into globalization from the 1990s a new breed of transnationally oriented capitalists and state elites forged a neoliberal hegemony in consort with washington and the international financial institutions ifis principally the u s agency for international development the imf and the world bank they imposed privatization austerity deregulation of labor markets new investment regimes to facilitate transnational corporate access to the region s abundant natural resources and fertile lands and free trade deals including the central american free trade agreement in 2004 the transnational model of accumulation involved the introduction of new economic activities that integrated the region into transnational production and service chains part of the capitalist globalization that has involved a vast expansion of mining operations agribusiness tourism energy extraction and infrastructure mega projects throughout latin america feeding a voracious global economy and swelling transnational corporate coffers like earlier cycles of capitalist development an expansion of exports and a deeper integration into the world economy resulted in a reactivation of growth and investment in the 1990s and on the evolution of central america s political economy closely mirrors that of the global economy as a whole the world economy went through a period of prosperity in the 1960s then crisis and stagnation in the 1970s and 1980s followed by the globalization boom of the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century closely mirroring this evolution the isthmus experienced an average annual growth rate of 5 7 percent from 1960 1970 which declined to 3 9 percent from 1970 1980 and then plummeted to just 0 8 percent in the tumultuous 1980 1990 decade but then in sync with the global economy growth recovered averaging 4 0 percent annually during the globalization boom of 1990 2008 in the wake of the financial collapse of 2008 central american growth rates began to decline again globalization as a qualitatively new phase in the ongoing and open ended evolution of world capitalism has been characterized above all by the rise of a globally integrated production financial and service system in central america the transnational model of accumulation that took hold during the boom has involved a vast expansion of maquiladoras producing garments electronics and other industrial goods agro industrial complexes mining and raw material extraction global banking tourism and the retail revolution or the spread of walmart and other super stores as i ve written in my book export processing zones epzs meanwhile set up since the late 1980s dot the central american urban landscape some 70 epzs now employ some 800 000 workers mostly young women and have inserted the region inextricably into the global factory at the same time the spread of transnational tourist complexes has turned central america into a global playground local indigenous afro descendant and mestizo communities have fought displacement environmental degradation and the commodification of local cultures by tourist mega projects such as the ruta maya throughout the region roatan in honduras san juan del sur in nicaragua costa del sol in el salvador or guanacaste province in costa rica services commerce and finance have also become transnationalized the arrival of the global supermarket has involved the invasion of transnational retail conglomerates such as walmart and fast food chains which have displaced thousands of small traders disrupted local economies and propagated a global consumer culture and ideology globalization also brought with it a major expansion of transnational agribusiness in honduras local and transnational capitalist interests have snatched up vast tracks of rural farmland from peasant afro descendant and indigenous communities and converted them into palm oil plantations in guatemala too palm oil planted by local suppliers of global agro industrial giants adm and cargill is uprooting a growing number of peasant communities and driving them to migrate abroad in nicaragua peasants displaced by transnational agribusiness have pushed into and colonized what remained of the agricultural frontier disrupting indigenous land costa rica is now a major exporter of exotic new products such as figs dates and winter fruits and vegetables produced by transnational agribusiness that has displaced peasant producers and pushed them further into the agricultural frontier most devastating to the ecology and livelihood of local communities is a new round of extractive activity including mining oil and gas along with fishing and forestry not to mention the mega infrastructural projects such as an interoceanic canal in nicaragua and the agua zarca dam in honduras conflict has shaken the indigenous highlands in guatemala anew as local communities fight a veritable invasion by gold silver and other metal mining and fossil fuel interests in some cases even facing off death squads and a renewed colonization of their territory by agribusiness anti mining activists have faced death threats and assassinations in el salvador where 90 percent of surface water is estimated to be polluted by toxic chemicals heavy metals and waste matter as a result of mining these activists won a historic victory in 2017 when the government passed legislation imposing a blanket ban on metal mining environmental and community activists fighting the government s concessions to transnational companies for large scale gold mining projects in nicaragua have faced down riot police as have activists in neighboring costa rica protesting gold mining concessions in the north of the country the façade cracks economic stagnation political upheaval and social collapse the tenuous social order globalization brought about could only be sustained so long as the economy expanded and those displaced managed to migrate north yet the resumption of growth since the 1990s has depended on three factors that are now reaching their limits a sharp rise in the inflow of transnational corporate investment a steady increase in external debt and remittances from central americans living abroad after a decade of capital flight and disinvestment in the 1980s central america again became an attractive investment site for transnational capital in the 1990s transnational corporate investment jumped from an annual average of 165 million in the 1990s to 631 million from 2000 to 2010 and then to 6 5 billion from 2011 to 2017 although costa rica accounted for 45 percent of this surge as surplus capital from north america and asia sought new investment opportunities abroad following the 2008 global financial collapse however disaggregating the latter figure foreign direct investment actually dropped sharply starting in 2016 to just above 1 billion annually along with this inflow of investment capital the central american economy has accrued rising levels of foreign debt jumping from 33 billion in 2005 to 79 billion in 2018 which at nearly half the region s combined gdp is unsustainable but above all the 20 billion in remittances central american migrants have sent back home has provided an economic lifeline to the regional economy while outmigration has acted an escape valve containing political crises eighteen and 19 percent of el salvador and honduras gnp respectively comes from remittances and 10 of guatemala and nicaragua s in fact remittances accounted for half of all growth in the gdp in these four countries in 2017 and 78 percent for el salvador in other words the region s economy would collapse without the money central americans send home yet the benefits of growth since the 1990s never trickled down to the impoverished majority with the exception of an expansion of social programs in nicaragua during the first few years of daniel ortega s return to power in 2007 and a few programs that the fmln government in el salvador was able to introduce now however as the global economy sputters toward recession and investment flows decline there are diminishing opportunities for capitalist expansion in the isthmus from the average annual growth rate of four percent from 1990 2008 the regional gdp growth rate dropped to 3 7 percent in 2012 to 3 5 percent in 2017 and an estimated 2 6 percent in 2018 globalization and neoliberalism have wreaked havoc on the working and popular classes leaving them ill equipped to survive the coming global economic downturn and local stagnation a staggering 72 percent of workers in the region labor in precarious work arrangements often in the informal economy and some seven out of every eight new jobs are precarious the central american population has increased from 25 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2017 but the labor market has been unable to absorb the majority of new entrants which helps explain the surge in migration abroad a number that practically doubled from 2000 to 2017 when it reached 4 3 million the social crisis is now leading to escalating political conflict and an unprecedented spiral of corruption corrupt state elites backed by national private sector associations the transnational capitalist class and ifis have imposed the globalization model these same elites facilitated the conditions for local and transnational capital to appropriate the region s resources and labor in exchange for the opportunity to pillage the state the long list of corruption cases in the region has landed several former presidents in jail and brought charges against dozens of high level government officials in guatemala former president otto pérez molina a retired military officer during a genocide against the country s indigenous majority in the 1980s counterinsurgency was forced to step down in 2015 after mass protests against his government s widespread corruption uncovered by the united nations international commission against impunity in guatemala cicig formed in 2006 to investigate corruption drug trafficking and genocide pérez molina was eventually tried and sentenced to prison current president jimmy morales elected after pérez molina s resignation has dismantled the cicig since it brought fraud and money laundering charges against him his family members and other high level officials the larger backdrop to political instability in guatemala is an upsurge of mass mobilization among the country s poor and largely indigenous majority and the return of widespread repression and human rights violations including the reappearance of death squads that terrorized the population for decades prior to the 1996 peace accord that put an end to the four decade civil war the codeca campesino development committee the campesino committee of the highlands ccda and other indigenous peasant student and worker organizations have organized mass resistance around the country and are calling for a constituent national assembly to re found the republic and develop an alternative to capitalism in honduras several members of the ruling national party and family members of former president porfirio lobo brought to power by the 2009 coup d état and current president juan orlando hernández elected for a second term in 2017 in a contest widely believed to be fraudulent have been implicated in drug trafficking embezzlement and other crimes while the murder of indigenous leader berta cáceres in 2016 grabbed international headlines dozens of leaders from the country s burgeoning social movements of indigenous students workers peasants and afro descendants have been targeted for assassination in el salvador the courts convicted former president antonio saca to 10 years in prison and issued an arrest warrant for former president mauricio funes who took refuge in nicaragua after being charged with embezzlement the attorney general s office is investigating other high level officials for corruption including those from the governing farabundo marti national liberation front fmln which is likely to be voted out of power in elections this february in nicaragua the nepotistic and dictatorial government of president daniel ortega his wife vice president rosario murillo and their inner circle have made pacts with the traditional oligarchy enriched themselves through plunder of state resources and an alliance with transnational capital and deployed the army police and paramilitary forces to violently repress peasants workers students and social movements opposing its policies the crisis of global capitalism and the future of central america global capitalism now faces a deep structural crisis of social polarization and overaccumulation given unprecedented levels of inequality worldwide the global market cannot absorb the rising output of the global economy which is reaching limits to further expansion the transnational capitalist class cannot find outlets to profitably reinvest the trillions of dollars in accumulated profits continued expansion in recent years has been based on unsustainable debt driven consumption wild speculation in the global casino that has inflated one financial bubble after another and state driven militarization as the world enters a global war economy now the global economy is on the brink of a new downturn moreover the system faces a political crisis of hegemony and escalating international tensions in the larger picture this crisis of global capitalism forms the backdrop to the second implosion of central america the crisis has resulted in sharp polarization worldwide between insurgent left and popular forces and an insurgent far right with openly fascist tendencies at its fringes as the regimes in central america lose legitimacy become more corrupt and repressive and threaten to break with the constitutional order as already happened in honduras and nicaragua and may happen in guatemala a new round of mass popular protest unfolds in response the region s governments have also turned to bogus anti terrorism laws to keep a lid on social protest far right and 21st century fascist projects are on the rise in europe the united states brazil israel the philippines turkey and elsewhere in all these cases the most vulnerable communities have been targeted as scapegoats for the crisis especially refugees and immigrants in a strategy to channel mass anxiety over escalating socioeconomic insecurity towards the targeted groups this helps explain the rabidly racist and even fascist response of the trump government to central american refugees neither fascism nor implosion are inevitable that will depend on how the popular forces in central and north america are able to mobilize to preserve the rule of law and push forward a social justice agenda that could ameliorate the effects of crisis otherwise an economic downturn could bring down the central american house of cards william i

jeffrey frankel since its introduction two decades ago the euro has faced serious challenges so far it has survived intact yet on the common currency s 20th anniversary it is worth identifying problems that have been encountered and one hopes to learn from past mistakes a first critical problem was inherent in the application of a common currency to a large and varied set of countries they did not meet the criteria for an optimum currency area as american economists pointed out in particular the members lacked cyclical synchronization it is much harder to go without monetary independence if your economy s needs are not aligned with those of the other countries in the union in 2004 2006 for example ireland needed a tighter monetary policy than the european central bank was prepared to set given a housing bubble and economic overheating but it had ceded the authority to revalue its currency or raise interest rates likewise in 2009 2013 when ireland needed an easier monetary policy than the ecb s given a steep recession it was unable to devalue its currency print money or lower its interest rate a second mistake was that some peripheral eurozone countries maintained large current account deficits during the euro s first decade at the time these countries large net capital inflows were viewed as a sign of efficiency improving financial integration in retrospect the imbalances attributable in part to a rise in the periphery s unit labor costs relative to germany s were less benign many countries most notably greece also maintained large budget deficits and high debt levels they confirmed longstanding fears among wealthier members especially germany that they would end up being forced to bail out their profligate partners for which the expectation of being rescued amounted to a perverse incentive to their credit the architects of europe s monetary union recognized moral hazard as a central vulnerability and tried to address it by requiring that countries cap their budget deficits at 3 percent of gross domestic product and including a no bail out clause in the maastricht treaty but the fiscal rules proved unenforceable virtually all eurozone members including germany soon breached the 3 percent deficit ceiling and though governments repeatedly claimed that fiscal targets would be achieved in the future those expectations were based on overly optimistic growth forecasts it did not help that with the creation of the eurozone highly indebted periphery governments were suddenly able to borrow at virtually the same interest rates as germany even within the united states indebted states like illinois must pay an interest rate premium relative to other states the eurozone s failure to shift more fiscal authority to the supranational level was repeated in the area of banking regulation european economists had warned that paneurozone banking regulation is essential to the common currency s long term sustainability only to be ignored to be fair these problems cannot really be called mistakes by eurozone leaders as any attempt to address them would have faced overwhelming political opposition in other ways however the eurozone s leaders really did shoot themselves in the foot for example the ecb mistakenly raised interest rates in july 2008 and again twice in 2011 despite the global recession moreover when the greek crisis erupted at the beginning of 2010 european leaders did not respond effectively instead they delayed sending greece to the international monetary fund and writing down greek debt even though the debt to gdp ratio was clearly on an unsustainable path even with stringent fiscal austerity in fact the push for austerity after 2009 backfired spectacularly as it caused incomes in periphery countries to fall far more than the european commission the ecb and the imf had anticipated even leaving aside the economic cost of the recession and the political cost of the resulting populist anger fiscal austerity did not achieve its goal of putting countries like greece onto sustainable debt paths on the contrary the fall in gdp was larger than any fall in debt causing debt to gdp ratios to rise even faster the implementation of fiscal austerity during a time of crisis together with the high spending of the eurozone s early years constitutes pro cyclical fiscal policy indeed greek fiscal policy is among the world s most pro cyclical that does not put the eurozone on a strong footing to weather future crises this is not to suggest that the euro has not had its successes for starters the transition from 11 individual currencies to the euro went very smoothly the european currency crises of 1992 and 1993 as well as more recent chaotic demonetizations elsewhere show that a successful transition was far from guaranteed a second early success was that by virtually all measures of international use the euro instantly became the world s second global reserve currency moreover the desire to be admitted to the club led to favorable reforms in many aspiring member countries particularly the central and eastern european countries that later joined the european union more recent entries on the success side of the ledger include the progress of some periphery countries particularly spain reducing their previously uncompetitive unit labor costs ecb president mario draghi deserves top marks for balancing germany s demand for fiscal discipline and the mediterranean need for accommodation his july 2012 declaration that the ecb would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro calmed markets a vital turning point in the crisis perhaps most important public opinion polls indicate that in recent years the euro has achieved strong popular support with 64 percent of citizens supporting the common currency in november 2018 this offers hope that if the eurozone s leaders can learn from past mistakes the monetary union will survive and even thrive

is sustainable development compatible with western civilization sustainable development is one of those terms that seems to have leapt into our vocabulary from nowhere five years ago no one apart from a few green philosophers had ever heard of the term today thanks largely to the publicity it received from the 1993 earth summit in rio it has become common parlance politicians speak passionately about the need for it and the steps we must take to achieve it corporations bend over backwards to show their dedication to it while the media enthusiastically tries to explain what sustainable development means but what exactly does it mean at the last count there were over a hundred different definitions of the term and there has been much debate over their varying merits and relevance but one principle common to most of them is that it we should leave the planet in as good a state as we found it the brundtland report s definition is typical it defines sustainable development as development that meets the need of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs the goal is certainly worthy many argue that it is also an imperative if such principles are not put into practice we could do irreparable damage to the planet s biosystem but amidst all the clamor for sustainable development few stop to ask whether it is possible the consequences of an environmental catastrophe are so frightening the end of civilization as we know it perhaps the end of humanity itself that people seldom question whether our current conceptions of sustainable development are adequate or realistic here i wish to challenge some our deeply held assumptions about sustainability and what it will entail the reason for doing this is not to create a feeling of hopelessness although i shall indeed argue that current approaches do not contain a lot of promise but to bring to light critical aspects of the issue that we might otherwise have overlooked questioning assumptions the questioning of assumptions is a critical part of the creative process faced with a problem most of us are so eager to find a solution and thus end the uncertainty and frustration of not knowing what to do we tend to rush into the first solution that comes to mind only later often when we are in trying to put our solution into practice do we realize that we had not fully thought through our solution and probably had made some invalid assumptions the follwoing problem provides a very simple example of how easily we make assumptions and how they limit our thinking imagine you were asked to cut a cake into eight equal pieces equal meaning of exactly the same shape and size but you have to accomplish this with only three cuts if you have not come across this problem before you will probably discover that it is not easy as it first appears this is because you are making some invalid assumptions about the nature of the problem the most common one is to assume the cake is two dimensional i e that you can only cut it from above this is the way we usually cut cakes but you soon discover that it is impossible to use this approach to cut the cake into equal pieces without some cheating one solution is to include the third dimension and cut the cake horizontally as well most people find the process of challenging their assumptions very difficult it is not just that the assumptions are hard to see we usually do not want to see them we become emotionally attached to our beliefs and to question them can feel very threatening nevertheless uncomfortable as the process may be it nearly always pays dividends it usually leads to a deeper understanding of the nature of the problem and often to better solutions this is true of all types of creative problem solving the cake problem writing an article developing a new corporate strategy making foreign policy decisions and it applies equally to our efforts to respond to the environmental crisis we are facing the most serious crisis in the history of humanity this is not a crisis we have faced before and there are no tried and tested solutions moreover how we respond to this challenge is going to determine the future of the human race and it is vitally important that we do not rush into the first solution that comes to mind to ensure that we choose appropriate and effective paths through this crisis we must step back for moment and uncomfortable as the process may be question some of our deeply held assumptions about the compati bility of sustainable development with our culture is growth sustainable the first assumption we need to question about sustainable development is that it is compatible with growth yet ii is growth population growth along with industrial growth that lies at the heart of our crisis in recent times the more developed nations have been experiencing unprecedented economic growth the average westerner today consumes over 100 times the resources of a person living 200 years ago at the dawn of the industrial revolution over the same period the population has increased by a factor of ten combine these two growths together and the result is a 1000 fold increase in consumption and with it a corresponding increase in waste and pollution both these growths are set to continue the human population is expected to double over the next three decades that not only means twice as many mouths to feed and bodies to house but also twice the industrial production twice the consumption and twice the pollution that would be the case if there were zero per capita industrial growth but that is extremely unlikely third world nations need economic development people there want clean drinking water food sanitation housing medicine and employment their current self interest is raising their standard of living to a bearable level moreover it is in the interest of humanity as a whole that they should raise their standard living third world poverty is a major contributor to over grazing deforestation water contamination and soil erosion meanwhile the more developed nations argue that they too need continued economic growth each new report of a nation s economic growth is celebrated as if some new saviour had arrived monthly industrial output up 0 4 read a recent headline good news according to all the economic pundits paraded on the television but i wonder how many paused to think what that means in the long term five percent per year extrapolated over the next thirty years amounts to a 250 increase in production along with a corresponding increase in consumption and in pollution extrapolated over a hundred years it amounts to a 13000 increase in production corporate rates of growth are planned to be even higher many major us corporations including some of the greener ones have committed themselves to growth rates of between 10 and 15 at that rate companies currently turning over 10 billion will be in the trillion dollar range in thirty years how can that be sustainable in the long term some technologists argue that with more efficient and cleaner technologies increased production does not have to result in as much consumption or pollution during the next century we might see technological efficiency rise by as much as a factor of ten that could help but it would not solve the problem it would merely reduce a 13000 increase in consumption to a 1300 increase moreover that assumes that we would use the increased efficiency to do the same with less past increases in efficiency have usually led to increased production it is also true that a shift from manufacturing to information processing will lessen the rate at which our consumption of grows but slowing the rate of growth does not eliminate the problem it merely moves the crisis point a few years into the future and that is hardly sustainable development by any definition of the term zero growth in his recent book the growth illusion the economist richard douthwaite argues persuasively that the only truly sustainable economy is one with zero material growth he shows how despite all its promises growth has done very little in recent years to raise the quality of life the promise of more jobs has been offset by the unemployment generated by increased efficiency and productivity from new technologies which the drive for growth has produced few people in the more developed countries are more fulfilled than they were thirty years ago a study in 1955 showed that one third of u s population said they were happy with their lives the same study repeated in 1992 found that exactly the same porportion of the people were happy with their lives despite the fact that per capita productivity and consumption have both doubled over this time continued economic growth has made a few people richer and a lot of people poorer in 1980 the average large company ceo earnt 42 times as the average hourly paid worker in 1992 he earnt 157 times as much the same pattern has happened over the world as a whole resulting in a net flow of wealth from the third world to the first world during the 1980s incomes fell in more than 40 developing countries in some cases by as much as 30 percent over the same period third world debt has been increasing at 10 per year that means a doubling every seven years most dangerously continued economic growth has seriously damaged the environment impoverishing the soil polluting the seas fouling the air fueling the global greenhouse depleting the ozone layer and triggering a range of environmental disasters douthwaite concludes that the sooner growth is dropped from our thinking and we revert to setting ourselves specific and finite objectives that lead towards our steady state the better our future will be herman daly of the world bank puts it more bluntly in his essay in the book the sustainable society it is obvious that in a finite world nothing physical can grow forever yet our current policy seems to aim at increasing physical production indefinitely but zero growth is far too uncomfortable for most economists and politicians to accept and quite understandably western capitalism cannot survive without growth national and corporate economies are compelled to expand if they are to avoid collapse herein lies a fundamental conflict we want to ensure the future of humanity and yet we also want to ensure the very system that is contributing to its downfall as willis harman one of the founders of the world business academy points out this is rather like a patient who implores his physician to heal him but subject to the conditions that the doctor not interfere with his drinking smoking eating or stress producing atitudes yet we do something similar when we admit the seriousness of our unsustainable modern way of life and insist that the cure be sought without disturbing our concepts of the neccessity of technological progress and economic growth as a consequence most definitions of sustainable development do little more than make economic growth more equitable and environmentally careful they seldom challenge the assumption that economic growth is beneficial is free enterprise sustainable questioning the sustainability of growth implies questioning the sustainability of our free enterprise capitalist system this can be even more difficult in many people s minds it occupies the status of a religion and to challenge it is virtual heresy yet if we are genuine in our desire to keep the planet inhabitable we must be prepared to challenge our most fundamental and closely held assumptions remember however that the purpose of challenging our assumptions is not to invalidate and discard them assumptions are there for good reason and certainly have value but holding the assumption as an unquestionable article of faith prevents us from seeing beyond it by challenging our core assumptions we may begin to appreciate the issue from a broader perspectives and see some of the pitfalls of our current solutions one of the principle shortcomings of our current system is that it fails to take human psychology into full account the psychotherapist kenneth lux made this very clear in his book adam smith s mistake he shows how smith was concerned with the relative merits of self interest and benevolence and argued that the invisible hand of self interest generally did more for the common good and for the individual good than altruistic self sacrificing benevolence his mistake as lux so clearly points out was to argue in favor of self interest alone discarding benevolence if we were all enlightened human beings this might work but we are not not all of us for example are honest if a merchant can cheat a customer say be using short weights on his scale and get away with it then is it in his self interest to do so self interest does not rule out cheating it only decrees that one should be good enough at it not to get caught the same goes for corruption theft fraud and other deceptive acts societies worldwide are littered with people whose self interest has led them to behave in ways that clearly do not promote the common good and these are just the people unlucky or unskillful enough to get caught corruption not only undermines our society it also undermines our attempts to care for the environment what large development project in africa latin america or asia in the past three decades has gone ahead without a large kickback to politicians developing countries complain about their onerous debt burden brazil for example has to service the interest on more than 100 billion of loans but the flight capital cash that wings its way out of the country into various foreign banks accounts is 50 billion per year enough to pay off most its debt in a couple of years getting away with the minimum the hidden hand of self interest invites people and corporations to get around the law or do the minimum they can get away with not to do the maximum possible the cfc story is a good example cfcs were created more than twenty five years ago as the result of a search for inert non toxic inflammable stable compressible gases gases that would in other words be safe for human beings and for the environment only after their manufacture had begun did some people suspect that they might damage the ozone layer that shields the earth s surface from harmful ultraviolet light today we are realizing that this danger is very real and every new report of thinning ozone is greeted by the media with estimates of the increase in skin cancers and eye cataracts that are likely to result but if the zone hole grows skin cancers and eye cataracts are likely to be the least of our worries what will happen to other creatures who cannot avail themselves of such luxuries we cannot fit bees with sunglasses but blind bees will not be much good as plant pollinators the consequences of that could be catastrophic consider also the direct effect of increased uv light on plants the most vulnerable parts are the growing tips of plants destroy the dna in these cells and the plant will not reach maturity and will not seed with equally catastrophic consequences or consider the effects on the microscopic phytoplankton in the sea which have no skin to protect them and are very vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation destroy these and the planet s food chain will crash if we do severely damage or even destroy the ozone layer life on land will become nigh impossible we will have destroyed half a billion years of evolution and ourselves with it that is how dangerous the situation is is it already late no one knows sixty per cent of the cfcs ever produced are still drifting up towards the ozone layer it takes 10 to 15 years to get there and once there a cfc molecule will continue destroying ozone molecules for fifty years was it too late fifteen years ago when we began to realize the disastrous potentials of cfcs no if we had acted in our long term self interest we would have stopped production then but that was not in the interest of the companies concerned nor we should add of their shareholders so they suppressed the information for another decade now that we finally have the evidence before us most countries have agreed to ban cfcs and other ozone depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and the halons used in fire extinguishers by the end of the century in 1992 after more rapid progress than expected in the development of replacements even more stringent controls were set now production of most of these gases will be banned from 1996 except for methyl bromide a substance used as a fumigant to kill pests in soil and stored crops yet methyl bromide is thought to be responsible for as much ozone depletion as cfcs why is it excluded countries such as israel brazil greece spain and italy whose agricultural industries rely heavily on the chemical blocked any ban on methyl bromide it was not in their self interest the hidden hand of self interest may have promoted the overall well being of the communities of adam smith s time and the free enterprise economy it gave birth to may have been very successful in implementing the industrial revolution it raised the general standard of living and gave us in the west many personal luxuries such as private cars air conditioning and hand held video cameras but we now have to question whether it is still valid in a global community with global problems sustainable development is clearly in the long term interest of humanity individuals and corporations alike the problem is that the steps necessary to bring it about are not in our immediate interest and it is our immediate interest that tends to rule is interest sustainable another way in which our economic system may unintentionally exacerbate our global crisis is the charging of interest this is so deeply entrenched in our society that is almost heresy to question it we shall see however that it is one of the principle motors behind our economic system s need for continual economic growth although we may take the charging of interest for granted it is only relatively recently it has become a widely accepted practice usury as the practice is often called was originally out lawed in judaism the old testament contains several warnings against it the cultures of ancient greece and rome likewise denounced the practice aristotle called it the most unnatural and unjust of all trades for centuries it was outlawed by the church of rome s canon law and it is forbidden by the koran and there are today several islamic countries whose banks are forbidden to charge interest why have spiritual teachings and philosophers repeatedly argued against usury there are several reasons both moral and economic first the accumulation of compound interest is economically unsustainable in the long term a dollar invested at 10 compound interest would be worth 2 59 after ten years 13 780 after a hundred years and around 2 473 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 after a thousand years which is about ten trillion times the value of the earth s weight in gold try collecting the interest due on that investment second it is those who have money who lend it and those without who need to borrow and pay the interest this tends to make the rich richer and the poor poorer third usury is wanting something for nothing the act of lending money involves no input of human labour apart perhaps from the signing of an agreement and entering some data in a computer the borrower may well use the money to do something useful but the lender has done nothing yet he still expects to receive something in return its the time old desire for a free lunch but where does this extra something come from most money lenders are so concerned with their own gains they do not consider this question or turn a blind eye to it in order that the interest on all these loans can be paid the amount of money in circulation has to to increase but this fuels inflation more money chasing the same amount of goods decreases the value of the money so governments strive to compensate as much as possible for the extra money by increasing real wealth the result the need for continued economic growth given the disastrous long term implications of continued economic growth we must question whether the charging of interest is compatible with the goals of sustainable development if not we must seek to create a radically different economic system one that is not based on the desire to make money out money the essence of usury is western democracy sustainable another question we must ask is whether sustainable development is compatible with a democratic system in which leaders must pander to the interests of those who put them in power elected leaders need the popular vote and the popular vote is strongly influenced by what people think politicians will give them in the short term rather than the long term in most cases this is not what is required for sustainable development take for instance george bush s refusal to sign the biodiversity convention at the earth summit in rio he defended his position by arguing that it endangered company patent rights and was not in the interest of american business despite the fact that a number of scientists in the hreatened biotechnology industries lobbied the then president trying to persuade him that his decision was short sighted and that the loss of biodiversity was a far greater threat than the protection of us business interests he stuck to his position was it just a coincidence that bush was up for re election that year and a major part of his political campaign funds came from the corporate world or consider the sluggishness of governments around the world to take realistic steps to curb greenhouse emissions one reason often given for their lack of firm action is that scientists are currently divided on whether or not global warming will occur that is true ninety eight percent think that it will occur two percent think that it will not to argue that we should not therefore act is ridiculous when approaching a blind bend on a narrow country road the precautionary principle would dictate that a person slows down it would be a foolish driver that continued at the same or even greater speed until he had irrefutable evidence that another vehicle was heading straight for him why don t we apply the same precautionary principle to greenhouse emissions the cost to society would be too high it would slow economic growth it would create too much individual inconvenience and discomfort look at what happened to ross perot in the 1992 us presidential election when he suggested a 50 increase in gasoline tax spread one should add over five years a measure that would still leave the u s with some of the cheapest gas in the west his ratings in the polls suffered one of the biggest drops in his whole campaign voters short term materialist interests are one reason why european green parties have not fulfilled their initial promise people began to realize that voting green was not just voting for a healthier environment it was also in the final analysis voting for an end to growth an end to unbridled consumption and end to low taxation and the loss of many personal comforts and conveniences who would vote for that the fact that we may not be here in twenty years time if we do not is too distant a consideration is individual liberty sustainable this brings me to the final assumption that i wish to explore the assumption that people will opt for a program of sustainable development once they realize its necessity perhaps we would if we were all truly liberated human beings but many of us have become so attached to our lifestyles that we would risk oblivion rather than let go of the things that we tell ourselves are so important this leads to all manner of convoluted thinking one reaction is outright denial that there is even a problem i met this while doing a radio show in dallas recently as soon as i mentioned the environmental issue the phones began ringing i was repeatedly told and in no uncertain terms that there was not one shred of evidence for global warming that ozone depletion was part of an environmentalist conspiracy and that if i wanted to know the truth i should go talk to some scientists i was i must admit initially thrown by such hostility it was not something i had encountered before but as i explored their position more deeply the reasons behind it became clear don t tell me they said that i have to change my way of life we are not the problem its in eastern europe and the third world that changes have to be made the truth is we are all responsible almost everyone today is aware that automobiles are a major producer of carbon dioxide but how many of us have stopped driving a car very few indeed and of those of us who argue that they must have a car how many have chosen to drive the most fuel efficient car on the market again very few why not one reason is that most of us do not believe it would actually make any difference why make such personal sacrifices if the vast majority of people continue as before they will make no measurable difference to the planet or the rest of humanity the only difference will be a decrease in personal comfort and convenience and this is not in our self interest the inner equation so where has this questioning of assumptions got us has it merely shown that we should give up any hope of ever achieving a truly sustainable system and resign ourselves to an ever deepening series of ecological catastrophes no there is still hope as i pointed out earlier the purpose of questioning assumptions is not to invalidate the assumptions but to discover aspects of the issue that might otherwise have remained hidden and so to arrive at more appropriate and effective solutions what has emerged from our questionning is a critical psychological aspect one major impediment to sustainability is not out there in the complex global system we are trying to manage it is inside ourselves it is our greed our love of power our love of money our attachment to our comforts our unwillingness to inconvenience ourselves in one way or another human self interest is either creating the problem or preventing us from solving it thus if we are to take sustainable development from a great ideal to a practical reality it is absolutely imperative that we take this inner psychological dynamic into account many commentators have advocated the need to apply systems thinking to the global crisis we can no longer consider problems such as ozone depletion rainforest decimation climatic changes species extinction resource scarcities pollution famine in isolation resource scarcity for example may encourage amazonian indians to cut the rainforest which can result in further species extinctions and accentuate the greenhouse effect contributing perhaps to longer term food scarcities the many different aspects of our global crisis are bound together as part of a larger system a system that includes not only all environmental parameters but also our economic systems political models social tensions what is now becoming clear is that the systems approach needs to be expanded further to include not just all the external material factors but also the various internal psychological factors that affect the way we respond to the crisis in the example of the cake cutting problem we could only arrive at a satisfactory solution by expanding our frame of reference and including the third dimension similarily with the environmental crisis now facing us we need to expand our frame of reference and include the additional dimension of self interest self interest let me make it clear that i do not wish to denigrate self interest it is absolutely essential to our survival self interest ensures that we take care of our biological selves find adequate food water and shelter and avoid life threatening situations this form of self interest is something common to all life in order to ensure that creatures take care of their self interest nature has evolved a very simple internal monitor if a situation is not in our self interest we cease to feel good if i am hungry i feel some discomfort in my stomach similarly if i am cold or thirsty i begin to suffer or if my body is damaged and in need of attention i feel pain such experiences are by their very nature unpleasant and unwelcome and our natural tendency is to find some way to return to a more pleasing state of mind to avoid suffering and return to a state of inner well being is our most fundamental motivation this is our most basic self interest the true bottom line against which we measure all our actions in the words of the dalai lama the hope of all people in the final analysis is simply for peace of mind an erroneous assumption peace of mind may be our primary goal but it is also clear that the vast majority of us are not living in that state sometimes unexpected events interfere with our best laid plans if the car won t start on a wet winter s morning and we arrive for a meeting wet and late we can hardly expect ourselves to feel on top of the world other times we miscalculate what will make us feel better one spoonful of ice cream may stimulate our taste buds sufficiently to make us feel good a whole tub of ice cream on the other hand may not be so welcome by the stomach and we end up feeling worse than before we may find our expectations being challenged if i believe that all people should be honest and of the highest integrity then i may well find myself becoming upset when i am faced with reality or we may worry about whether or not we will feel good in the future will people treat us fairly will it rain will the stockmarket crash again and so long as our minds are taken up with concern and worry they are not at peace in nearly every case the reason we do not find the peace we seek is because we are looking for it in the wrong place we are rather like nasrudhin the wise fool of sufi tales who has lost his key somewhere in his house but he is searching for it out in the street because he says there is more light outside we too look for the key to fulfillment in the world around because that is the world we know best we know how to change this world how to gather possessions how to make people and things behave the way we want the way we think will bring us happiness we know much less about our minds and how to find fulfillment within ourselves there seems to be much less light in there material addictions it is this erroneous belief that our inner well being depends upon how things are in the world around that lies behind much of our short sighted self centered behavior this is why we consume so much more than we need more than we need physically that is most of what we consume we consume in the belief that it will make us happier if only we had enough we tell ourselves we would be happy a person who is feeling depressed or insecure may for example try to make themselves feel better by going out and buying themselves a new jacket and for a while they may indeed feel better but the effect does not last for long a few days or weeks perhaps it soon ends up hanging in the closet with all the other things we have bought in our search for satisfaction we have become addicted to the material world like a person with a chemical addiction we want to feel good inside so we gather for ourselves whatever we believe will make us feel better but because no thing can ever satisfy that inner need the high soon wears off and we go off in search of another fix this addiction to things is one of the prime reasons we resist the very changes that we most need to make if we are to create a sustainable civilization this is why we love money so much money gives us the power to buy the things or experiences or even relationships that we think will make us happy and the more money we have the happier we will be or so we think this is another reason our economic system has become so wedded to growth we believe that material prosperity equates with inner peace this may be true for a person who does not have adequate food shelter or clean drinking water but the majority of people in the more developed countries have these needs fully met but we do not seem to know when to stop we are stuck in the mindset that if only we had more wealth more purchasing power more opportunities and more luxuries we would be even happier this mindset lies behind so much human greed we want to have as many as possible of the things we believe will bring us inner peace it is the reason we want to feel in control of our world we want to know the world of tomorrow is going to fulfil our desires it is why people hang on to power and it is the reason we resist change we don t want to do anything that s going to decrease our financial status our sense of control or feelings of power we fear the very changes that will save us because we fear that we might lose some of the the things or experiences we think are so important a crisis of consciousness the real crisis we are facing is not an environmental crisis a population crisis economic crisis a social crisis or a political crisis it is at its root a crisis of consciousness a crisis is an indication that the old mode of operating is no longer working and a new approach is required this is true of a personal crisis a family crisis or a political crisis in the case of the environmental the old way that is no longer working is our self centred materialistic consciousness it may have worked well in the past when we needed to provide ourselves with the basic commodities necessary for our individual well being but it clearly no longer works today it no longer works for the individual as wendel berry makes clear in his book the unsettling of america an american is probably the most unhappy citizen in the history of the world he suspects that his love life is not as fulfilling as other people s he wishes that he had be been born sooner or later he does not know why his children are the way they are he does not understand what they say he does not care much and does not know why he does not care he does not know what his wife wants or what he wants certain advertisements and pictures in magazines make him suspect that he is basically unattractive he feels that all his possessions are under threat of pillage he does not know what he would do if he lost his job if the economy failed if the utility companies failed if the police went on strike if the truckers went on strike if his wife left him if his children ran away if he should be found to be incurably ill and for these anxieties of course he consults certified experts who in turn consult certified experts about their anxieties it does not work for the developing countries our material greed leads to a net flow of resources and wealth from third world to first indigenous peoples previously living a contented life in balance with their environment find their lands being taken over by multinational ventures and in order to survive are forced to move into cities where lack of possessions tranlates into poverty and homelessness it clearly does not work for the planet as a whole our unrelenting search for external satisfaction leads us to consume resources as if there were no tomorrow our desire for economic efficiency results in our pouring waste products into the oceans atmosphere and soil overloading the biosystem s natural recycling abilities unwilling to put up with some short term discomforts and inconveniences we continue to produce and release into the atmosphere substances that threaten to destroy the ozone layer and with it all life on land and it most certainly will not work in the future if this planet is already finding it difficult to sustain one billion acquisitive money loving status seeking power hungry human beings how can we expect it to sustain five billion people relentlessly seeking fulfilment through what they have or do moreover remembering that population is still growing how can we expect our planet to sustain a population of ten or twelve billion human beings seeking ever greater levels of material satisfaction it s our current mode of consciousness that is unsustainable it leads to short term needs that are intrinsically incompatible with the long term needs of future generations this is the underlying reason why current business practices economies and societies are unsustainable if we are to develop truly sustainable policies we must change not only our behavior but the mode of consciousness that underlies them the real challenge is it possible to relieve ourselves of this outdated mode of consciousness i think so we are not demanding of ourselves anything extraordinary only an acceleration of the normal process of maturation when we think of the elders in a society we think of the wisdom born of many years of experience with this wisdom comes the realization that the things we have or do in the world do not matter as much as before the desire to strive for material fulfillment has given way to an acceptance of how things are the challenge of our times is to find ways to accelerate this natural process of maturation so that we can begin to tap this wisdom when we start our adult life rather than as we approach its end such wisdom has been the goal of all the great spiritual traditions they have each in their own way been trying to help us move beyond our material attachments to find within ourselves the peace of mind that we eternally seek and to nourish the wisdom we each carry in our hearts so that it may shine out through our words and deeds a new apollo project even though many of us may already be striving to release ourselves from our material attachments and find the peace within it is also clear that current approaches to this task either take a very long time or may not work at all over the last two thousand years we have made tremendous strides in our understanding and mastery of the external world but our understanding and mastery of our own minds has hardly progressed at all when it comes to the challenge of developing wisdom we know little more today than did the ancient greeks and ancient indians perhaps we need the psychological equivalent of the apollo project john kennedy set the challenge of getting to the moon in ten years the resources were there the knowledge was being gained the technology had to be developed dedication to the mission brought fruition and nine years later the first human being was standing on the moon the new frontier we now urgently need to master is not outer space but inner space again the resources are there just consider the trillion dollars spent each year defending ourselves against each others greed and jealousy the knowledge is being gained seeds of it are to be found in the great spiritual teachings in many philosophies in various psychotherapies and in the emerging fields of humanistic and transpersonal psychology what is needed is a dedicated research and development effort to explore how we can most easily release our minds from this materialist mindset and move into a more mature mode of functioning nor do i think the task is that difficult the only reason that most of us are still caught in the old mode of consciousness is that we have been so caught up in our materialistic conditioning we have not applied ourselves to the task if we did we could probably achieve our goal very rapidly by the turn of the millennium we could see our society shifting from its current egocentric mode of consciousness to a more mature and sustainable mode the payoffs from such a shift would go far beyond the ability to develop truly sustainable social economic and political systems human beings would at last begin to find the peace of mind they had been seeking all along with that increase in inner well being would come not only a lessening in our material needs and the ability to let go of many things that we now believe are so important but also an improvement in our personal relationships better health and a far more satisfying life healing ourselves in closing let me make one thing clear i am not suggesting that we should concentrate only on our inner development we need to do everything we can to prevent further damage to the ozone layer stop destroying the rainforests curb greenhouse emissions reduce pollution etc but we also need to bear in mind that these are only symptoms of a deeper underlying problem to return to the doctor analogy suppose that your skin had erupted in a rash we were having headaches and feeling tired you might well want a doctor to give you something to reduce the inflammation get rid of the headache and restore your energy but if that was all he did you would not be fully satisfied a good doctor will also want to diagnose and treat the cause of your condition have you caught a virus eaten some contaminated food or been under undue stress the same is true of our global malaise yes we should treat the various symptoms that are threatening us so much but we also need to look deeper and diagnose and treat the root causes of our predicament only then will we stand a real chance of creating a truly sustainable society peter russell

most european banks have stopped producing 500 euro notes 27 january 2019 central banks in 17 of the eurozone s 19 economies stopped issuing 500 570 notes on sunday but cash loving germany and austria are delaying the move until later this year the german bundesbank and the austria s oesterreichische nationalbank said they needed more time to ensure a smooth transition toward a system in which 200 will be the largest denomination note the european central bank stopped producing the large violet colored 500 note in 2016 citing its use in illicit activities such as money laundering tax evasion and terrorism financing bundesbank chief jens weidemann denounced the decision saying it would have little impact in combating crime and instead damage confidence in the euro a columnist in die welt newspaper lamented that the note s abolition would restricts citizens freedom while weekly magazine der spiegel ran the headline the end of the 500 euro note is this the end of cash the head of the center for economic studies ces in munich clemens fuest said the ecb wanted to make it harder for banks to avoid paying negative interest rates by parking their money in cash the abolition of 500 notes undermines confidence in the ecb fuest said it creates the impression that the move s primary goal is bringing interest rates further into negative territory yes the elimination of the 500 note is a move to a cashless society and another move towards loss of freesom here is something about this from fortune back in 2016 the end of the 500 euro note could lead to a cashless economy after months of heavy deliberation the european central bank decided wednesday to phase out the 500 banknote the move may also signify a greater push into a cashless economy in which credit cards digital payments and perhaps one day even bitcoin dominate eliminating the bank note could help temper criminal activity but in reality the implications are much broader analysts from stratfor wrote in a february research note the idea is just the most recent step in an ongoing process moving europe and indeed the world closer to an entirely cashless economy indeed european governments have been making efforts over the past few years to reign in cash and governments also have a reason to create a cashless society digital transactions make it far easier to regulate cash flows in and out of the country and keep track of who is holding on to what after all who digitally transferred money where can be easily tracked cash on the other hand generally does not come with gps that would allow governments to make policies such as negative interest rates and capital controls potentially more effective and according to some experts other high denomination currencies around the world will be next to get the axe peter sands former ceo of standard charter predicted in a february paper that the 1 000 swiss franc 1 045 usd 10 000 yen 94 usd and 100 note should be the next to go meanwhile the scandinavian countries of denmark norway and sweden are already leading the way to the cashless society in part because they can t keep track of cash and suspect large portions of their currency are being used for illegal activities denmark has even made it a goal to become cashless by 2030 so it is becoming increasingly clear to various ones that europe is moving towards a cashless society and the elimination of the 500 euro note is seen as a step in that direction a few years back the austrian designer of the 500 euro note robert kalina was asked his view about its elimination notice how he answered a couple of questions about it the following is a machine translation from german with the original german below it may 5 2016 mr kalina the ecb abolishes the you have designed 500 for allegedly favoring the crime so you are a terrorist aide no that s nonsense of course laughs but look switzerland has since 1907 i believe 1000 francs bills and it would indeed occur to anyone to call the swiss national bank as terrorist aide so you do not believe in the abolition of the 500 euro note no i do not believe that the abolition of the 500ers change anything and i really think the abolition problematic in my opinion this is a personal restriction of freedom cash has always been a symbol of freedom 5 mai 2015 herr kalina die ezb schafft den von ihnen entworfenen 500er ab weil er die kriminalität begünstigen soll sie sind also ein terrorhelfer nein das ist natürlich unsinn lacht aber schauen sie die schweiz hat seit 1907 glaube ich 1000 franken scheine und es würde ja auch niemandem einfallen die schweizer nationalbank als terrorhelfer zu bezeichnen sie halten also nicht viel von der abschaffung des 500 euro scheins nein ich glaube nicht dass die abschaffung des 500ers irgendetwas ändert und ich halte die abschaffung wirklich für problematisch meiner meinung nach ist das eine persönliche einschränkung der freiheit bargeld ist immer ein symbol für freiheit gewesen and he is correct that the elimination of the 500 euro note reduces personal freedom the usa used to have 10 000 notes 1000 notes etc now the 100 bill is its largest and some people want that gone watch eliminate the 100 bill i have heard calls for eliminating the us hundred dollar bill and the 500 euro note supposedly to fight terrorism but i would like to remind everyone that about 4 decades ago the usa imposed reporting requirements on financial transactions of 10 000 or more to supposedly stop drug dealers tax evaders and terrorists but we have more terrorists no less drugs and probably as many tax evaders consider however that the elimination of cash could lead to the fulfillment of the following prophecy 16 he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name 18 here is wisdom let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man his number is 666 revelation 13 16 18 it will be a european power that will fulfill the above prophecy of 666 watch can you prove that the beast to come is european back in may 2016 i wrote it will likely take computers aided with artificial intelligence to aid in the fulfillment of the scriptures in revelation 13 15 18 as well as cyber spying monitoring i do believe that cyber monitoring will be used by the european beast king of the north 666 power this type of financial surveillance could not have happened during the time of the apostle john as there was no real way to monitor many financial transactions then despite the fact that preterists believe this was fulfilled almost 2000 years ago see also the dangerous rise of preterists the same was true for all the centuries that followed until the late 20th and now the 21st century but now not only does the technology exist to monitor most financial transactions the political will is there as well we are nearing the time of great distress and even more massive financial monitoring more and more are publicly calling for it the phasing out of the 500 euro note is a step in that direction can you see this thiel b the end of the 500 euro note could lead to a cashless economy cogwriter may 5 2016 let me add that the european union is also in the process of setting up the first eu wide prosecutor s office in order to prosecute eu financial crimes buying and selling without the mark of the beast etc will be considered a crime in europe in the future watch also eu setting up 666 enforcer we appear to be in the time that jesus referred to as the beginning of sorrows matthew 24 4 8 which will be followed by the great tribulation matthew 24 21 which while not here yet will include a time of monitoring and control of buying and selling revelation 13 16 18 we are getting closer to the end some items of possibly related interest may include sweden going to 666 cashlessness sweden continues to reduce the amount of currency notes and coins in circulation as more and more swedes turn to digital forms of payments even farmers markets take debit and credit cards will this eliminate crime or lead to the rise of the beast and antichrist power could what is happening in sweden be a prelude to the control of buying and selling that revelation 13 16 18 associates with 666 dr thiel addresses these issues from stockholm sweden eu setting up 666 enforcer the european union is in the process of establishing the european public prosecutor s office this is a major first of its kind move with the eu setting up a european wide prosecutor s office that will have power to investigate and charge people for financial crimes committed against the eu it looks like this type of office may end up persecuting those that do not have the mark of the beast when they buy or sell as that will later be considered a financial crime in europe what does 666 mean how has that name be calculated how can we be certain that this is a prophecy for europe and not islam is the appointment of this new office of significant prophetic importance dr thiel addresses these issues and more by pointing to scriptures news items and historical accounts in this video artificial intelligence and prophecy billionaire elon musk declared he was worried that artificial intelligence ai may lead to the rise of an immortal dictator a godlike entity that could take over the world is this accurate or at least close in some ways does bible prophecy foretell of the rise of an immoral leader who considers himself above all gods will this result in great destruction what is ai how might it fit in with various prophecies was the increase in technological knowledge we now have prophesied over 2000 years ago will 666 s control over buying and selling involve any form of ai dr thiel goes over many scriptures including prophetic ones that involve human knowledge which is the basis of ai he also points out that when various prophesies were made there was no technology capable of fulfilling them but that because of computers such ability exists now dr thiel also points out what jesus will do about it in this video blockchain karl guttenberg and 666 american express just announced a deal with ripple related to using its blockchain technology no longer confined to bitcoin blockchain technology is moving towards the mainstream former german economic and later defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has long been an adviser to ripple and has plans for internationally expanding the use of blockchain money jim rickards doug casey and others have expressed concerns that blockchain money will give governments too much control over buying and selling could any of this be related to biblical prophecies in the books of daniel and revelation could any of this help fulfill the prophecies related to buying and selling and 666 in

pointed to changes in the 2020s how much debt does the usa add daily does any of this tie in with biblical prophecies does habakkuk 2 have applicability to the usa is it wise to try to discount debt

opinion columnist get latest news by email subscribe powered by there is no doubt that the unresolved currency issue lies at the heart of zimbabwe s economic meltdown in the past 3 years and the price distortions in the local market the origins of the currency crisis can be traced back to august 2015 when treasury passed the rbz debt assumption bill which involved the government assuming the rbz debt of over 1 4 billion by issuing treasury bills tbs the objective of this debt assumption bill was to clean the rbz balance sheet and allow the apex bank to resume its clearing role through the rtgs system this role had weakened during the gnu era of 2009 2013 when the apex bank operated under a tight cash budgeting policy which meant that government departments expenditure was within what treasury collected through taxes in order to sustain uncontrolled government expenditure in 2015 the rbz started crediting local banks with electronic balances rtgs which were not backed by tax revenues and nostro foreign currency balances as a result broad money supply grew by over 1 billion in less than 12 months domestic demand grew and nostro accounts dwindled due to foreign currency externalization as 5 year treasury bills were being sold at a discount by alert investors who preferred credits in their offshore accounts than future losses cash shortages started to creep in by february 2016 to close the cash shortage gap in the market the apex bank announced that it was going to introduce an export incentive named bond notes before year end but alas the horses had already bolted the bond note was introduced in november 2016 amid immense resistance from business and local consumers who had realized that 2008 was now in replay and savings would be eroded what was not known publicly was that the apex bank had added 2 3 billion into the market by october 2016 through rtgs and tbs had been issued to banks pension funds and the corporate sector to back demands for cash withdrawals as banks were running dry soon after the bond note introduction the parallel market found its feet again by exchanging rtgs bank balances with us dollar and bond notes at premiums of at least 10 15 even though the apex bank capped physical money supply to 500 million the devil was in the billions that were circulating in the economy through the rtgs by the end of 2016 government expenditure had skyrocketed and the budget deficit for 2016 expanded to 1 421 billion from the 393 million recorded in 2015 the value of treasury bills tbs issued by the government surged coincidentally with the introduction of bond notes from 2 1 billion as of october 2016 to 7 6 billion in august 2018 an increase of 5 5 billion in less than 2 years by december 2018 domestic debt stood at over 9 5 billion that figure includes out of statute borrowings of more than 2 3 billion through the rbz overdraft facility back in 2009 the government was forced to dump the zimbabwean dollar due to record hyperinflation and economic decline which had wiped off 50 of the economic value the introduction of the multi currency regime stabilized the market largely because government expenditure was kept in check with actual budget surpluses realized from 2009 to 2012 fdi inflows and industry capacity utilization picked up with the economy growing at an average of 10 from 2009 to 2012 nostro account balances were also stable with import cover of more than 800 million as of august 2012 domestic debt closed 2012 at 276 million with the bulk of the borrowed funds used in local by elections the economy was liberalized so as to manage inflation allow for industry to retool and improve basic goods supply under a strong dollar the negative impact of the multi currency regime during that stable period was mainly felt on the export earnings front as zimbabwe s exports could not compete in the region due to the strong us dollar that was mainly used for trading in the economy currently the zimbabwean government has limited options in terms of currency reforms because foreign debt is over 8 5 billion and international funders including the chinese have stopped advancing any loans to harare so as to back any meaningful currency reforms joining the rand monitory union has been touted as the best remedy to the economy considering that south africa is zimbabwe s major trading partner and accounts for most of the fdi inflows and tourist arrivals into the country in 2017 alone zimbabwe trade with south africa topped 4 2 billion the arguments for joining the rmu therefore carry a lot of weight before other preconditions are considered key among the conditions is curbing zimbabwe s debt levels with public debt now over 18 5 billion having a local currency and stringent rules on monitory policy to control broad money supply faced with the rock and hard place scenario the government has announced that the zimbabwean dollar will be introduced before the end of 2019 questions remain on whether any currency can save the zimbabwean economy without addressing key economic fundamentals the fundamental aspects that need urgent attention include low agricultural and industrial production capacity which leads to a high import bill and low export capacity average trade deficit of 1 8 billion from 2016 to 2018 and insufficient foreign currency earnings high government expenditure average budget deficit of 2 3 billion from 2016 to 2018 lack of confidence in the economy poor domestic and foreign investment high production costs driven by a punitive tax system and high levels of public debt highlighted above other limitations in the economy include massive corruption command policies that crowd out private sector investment foreign currency externalization loopholes porous border posts that promote smuggling weak institutions rule of law respect for property rights and governance culture non performing state enterprises and poor tax compliance due to market informalization it is essential to point that the bond note served in almost the same capacity as the zimbabwean dollar only that it could not be traded on the international money market the economic challenges that bedevil zimbabwe since 2013 have largely remained the same and coalesced around the government s insatiable appetite to spend beyond its tax collections the government has largely chosen to act on symptoms such as multi tier pricing inflation rate cash shortages labour demands commodity shortages especially fuel cooking oil and grain without addressing the real fundamentals that underpin economic growth any currency introduced by the government will not sustain as long as key economic fundamentals that support economic growth are negative even if it was possible to raise billions in united states dollars in offshore accounts to support the introduction of the zimbabwean dollar those too will be exhausted over time leaving the country with massive debts as long as decisive economic reforms are not implemented to arrest the budget deficit trade deficit and confidence deficit sound economic management policy by the treasury from 2009 to 2012 provides the foundation upon which the current government needs to start on so sustain any currency in the economy the only sustainable way to grow foreign earnings is by allowing the economy to flourish raising foreign currency by incurring more debt without addressing economic fundamentals will not eliminate the black market and the market distortions that are destroying the economy a currency is sustained by a healthy economy not external borrowings to shore up the country s nostro accounts or subsidize a flawed exchange rate victor bhoroma is business and economic

opinion columnist the most remarkable economic turnaround story of the 21st century undoubtedly belongs to the people s republic of china as the country marks the 40th anniversary of economic reforms and opening the world looks back at the rise of the new dragon in world economics the country s rapid economic transformation is puzzling as it generates a great deal of skepticism in equal measure how could a nation with 1 386 billion people transform itself so rapidly from a vastly impoverished agricultural economy into a formidable industrial powerhouse when so many tiny nations have been unable to do so despite their more favorable socio economic conditions how could their economic reforms be so effective in such a short space of time to change the scope of a capitalist based global trade order according to the world bank china transformed from a 192 billion economy in 1980 to a 13 trillion economy as of october 2018 with an average gdp growth rate of 10 since 1990 no county can beat china in terms of long term sustained and high growth in its economy it has taken china only 30 odd years to achieve what took other countries several decades or even more than a hundred years this transformation lifted over 800 million people out of poverty and placed the country firmly as the second largest economy in the world after the usa china s economic story paints a picture so clear it requires most developing nation s especially african countries to take notes on economic reforms export led growth investment policies research and development strategies agriculture transformation and import policies in 1980 china s per capita income was only 220 one third of sub saharan africa s per capita income today sub saharan africa per capita income is 1 560 while that of china is 10 047 6 times more china has grown to be the world s largest manufacturing country as it produces nearly 50 of the globe s major industrial goods including crude steel cement coal automobiles and industrial patent applications china is also the world s largest producer of ships high speed trains robots tunnels bridges highways chemical fibers machine tools computers cellphones and other small merchandise mainly consumed in developing countries china is the world s largest trading nation with exports valued over 2 26 trillion and imports of 1 84 trillion thereby generating a trade surplus of 42 billion what makes chinese trade a marvel is that its largest trading partners are the united states european union and japan who account for over 53 of the global economic output china also holds the world largest reserves of foreign currency valued at over 3 062 trillion as of november 2018 china reached all the set millennium development goals mdgs by 2015 and made a major contribution to the achievement of the mdgs globally since it accounts for 20 of the world s population china s growth has reduced poverty with only 3 3 of the population living below the poverty line set at 2 300 yuan 333 it is evident that chinese growth was hinged on industrial exports which account for over 95 of the country s export earnings however there are a lot of economic policies that the chinese nailed in order to rapidly industrialize the country in december 1978 china s free market principles under deng xiaoping signposted a turning point in its economic management and trajectory for this to happen the country s leadership had to accept the painful truth that maoist version of the centrally planned economy had failed to produce efficient economic growth and had caused china to fall far behind not only the industrialized nations of the west but also the new industrial powers of asia such as japan south korea singapore taiwan and hong kong during the years of the centrally planned economy citizens had to grapple with rationed clothing basic shortages inadequate housing high inflation rates and a service sector that was inefficient deng s policies strengthened the authority of institutional managers and economic decision makers at the expense of party officials from the chinese communist party the effect of this policy was to separate economic policy from political interference and ensure efficient allocation of resources to economic development the country also improved its investment policies by allowing investment into high tech industries and exchanging manufactured goods for technology the growth in technology oriented research and development also meant the cost of production for various goods gradually went down the purpose of the reform program was not to abandon communism but to make it work better by substantially increasing the role of market mechanisms in the economy through reducing not eliminating government planning and direct control by 1987 the program had achieved remarkable results in increasing supplies of food fuel and other consumer goods which helped to control inflation a new climate of dynamism entrepreneurship and opportunity in the economy had improved the quality of goods and services in the economy the first years of reforms looked at economic readjustment during which the major goals of the readjustment process were to earn foreign currency by growing exports rapidly through establishing export hubs and overcome key deficiencies in transportation communications coal iron steel building materials and electric power that were the major cost drivers in the economy the government also sought to redress the imbalance between light and heavy industry by increasing the growth rate of light industry which makes bulk of chinese exports and reducing investment in heavy industry during an era of the first industrial revolution agricultural production was stimulated in 1979 by an increase of over 22 in the procurement prices paid for farm products the move was meant to reward key producers of rice wheat potatoes tomato sorghum peanuts tea millet barley cotton oilseed and soybeans this phase featured the sprouting of millions of rural enterprises from 1 5 million to 18 9 million and growth in gdp from agriculture food security was achieved and aggregate wages for farmers increased 12 fold the second industrial revolution featured policies oriented toward mass production of goods for the domestic and international markets it also looked at massive investment into energy transport communication and industrial infrastructure in agriculture driven country sides because of the rapidly and enormously expanding domestic market for intermediate goods machinery and transportation there was a big surge in the consumption and production of coal steel cement chemical fibers machine tools highways bridges tunnels and ships in all 2 6 million miles of public roads were built including more than 70 000 miles of express highways twenty eight provinces out of 30 have high speed trains the result was that cost of production drastically fell and made chinese products attractive on the world market infrastructure investments also opened up markets for various producers in the local market and abroad through export led cities at the country s borders the growth of the chinese economy can be termed as the triumph of marketism free markets impose economic incentives to compete profits impose discipline on management so as to control risk and on technology adoption so as to improve quality and control cost of production it also promotes destructive innovation where inefficient producers monopolies and bureaucratic structures fall foreign investment inflows grew rapidly post 1990 according to the 2018 world investment report published by unctad china was ranked the world s second largest fdi recipient after united states the country s economy was ranked the second most attractive to multinational companies for 2017 2019 fdi inflows continue to increase between 2016 and 2017 from 133 billion to 136 billion this growth is favored by economic liberalization policies the rapid development of the high tech sector and the establishment of free trade zones the absorption of fdi is part of the policy of opening china to the outside world aiming at creating a better business environment structures and distribution of investment across the country the government s efforts to achieve a better geographical spread of investments have allowed central china to see its fdi increase over 35 652 foreign funded companies were set up in china in 2017 thanks to the large base of internal customers china s favorable investment tag is hinged on the importance of foreign currency reserves and effective public debt management by chinese government labour costs remain comparatively low in the region for global brands manufacturers such as nike coca cola kfc apple toyota mitsubishi samsung hyundai lg and kia who operate in the country among others despite fears of massive pollution caused by rapid industrialization overcrowding in shanghai corruption by top government officials and massive debt overhang from funding state owned entities soes china s will surely weather the storms of the negative impact of it s massive economic growth the chinese government s spending on key infrastructure projects and industry shaping state entities have been a significant drivers to modernization efficient management of public funds through state entities has seen the growth of global giants such a huawei sinopec lenovo baic motors yutong zte chint electrical and hisense in a country where 17 out of the 20 largest corporations are state owned the development of a new trade network called the belt and road initiative bri which will link china to asian european and african markets will further expand the chinese

significant items restructuring costs in recent years we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure during 2018 we incurred 386 million of restructuring costs during 2017 we incurred 1 256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium mark to market losses we recognize actuarial gains and losses for our pension and opeb plans as a mark to market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time for 2018 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 495 million primarily due to lower than expected returns on plan assets partially offset by higher interest rates for 2017 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 301 million primarily due to lower interest rates and a change in mortality assumptions partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments based on improved profits in the united states we recognized a non cash benefit of 63 million and 111 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively to reduce the valuation allowance against u s state deferred tax assets during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a non cash charge of 59 million to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for prior years u s tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a 2 371 billion charge due to the enactment of u s tax reform legislation in december 2017 the provisionally estimated charge included a 596 million write down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a 154 million reduction to the estimated charge for the write down in net deferred tax assets this reduction was primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of 1 0 billion to u s pension plans treated as deductible on the 2017 u s tax return during the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a 50 million increase to the estimated charge for the cost of mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings a reconciliation of these items can be

restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure during 2018 we incurred 386 million of restructuring costs during 2017 we incurred 1 256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium mark to market losses we recognize actuarial gains and losses for our pension and opeb plans as a mark to market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time for 2018 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 495 million primarily due to lower than expected returns on plan assets partially offset by higher interest rates for 2017 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 301 million primarily due to lower interest rates and a change in mortality assumptions partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments based on improved profits in the united states we recognized a non cash benefit of 63 million and 111 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively to reduce the valuation allowance against u s state deferred tax assets during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a non cash charge of 59 million to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for prior years u s tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a 2 371 billion charge due to the enactment of u s tax reform legislation in december 2017 the provisionally estimated charge included a 596 million write down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a 154 million reduction to the estimated charge for the write down in net deferred tax assets this reduction was primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of 1 0 billion to u s pension plans treated as deductible on the 2017 u s tax return during the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a 50 million increase to the estimated charge for the cost of mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings a reconciliation of these items can be found in the non gaap financial measures section on page 17 q2 can you discuss the unfavorable

in the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of 417 million compared with a loss of 107 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the unfavorable change was primarily a result of an increase in mark to market

24 percent compared with approximately 28 percent for the full year of 2017 excluding the items discussed below the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate beginning

restructuring costs during 2017 we incurred 1 256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium mark to market losses we recognize actuarial gains and losses for our pension and opeb plans as a mark to market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time for 2018 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 495 million primarily due to lower than expected returns on plan assets partially offset by higher interest rates for 2017 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 301 million primarily due to lower interest rates and a change in mortality assumptions partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments based on improved profits in the united states we recognized a non cash benefit of 63 million and 111 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively to reduce the valuation allowance against u

reform during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a 2 371 billion charge due to the enactment of u s tax reform legislation in december 2017 the provisionally estimated charge included a 596 million write down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a 154 million reduction to the estimated charge for the write down in net deferred tax assets this reduction was primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of 1 0 billion to u s pension plans treated as deductible on the 2017 u s tax return

restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower profit from financial products financial products operating profit was lower primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses which was mostly driven by a 72 million unfavorable impact from an increase in allowance rate and an increase in write offs of 13 million due to continued weakening in the

in the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of 417 million compared with a loss of 107 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the unfavorable change was primarily a result of an increase in mark to market

24 percent compared with approximately 28 percent for the full year of 2017 excluding the items discussed below the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate beginning

realization was mostly offset by unfavorable currency impacts due to a stronger u s dollar in north america the sales increase was driven by higher demand for new equipment with about half due to an increase in dealer inventories the increase in demand was primarily to support oil and gas activities including pipelines and non residential building construction activities favorable price

unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment in europe and latin america financial products segment profit was 29 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 233 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 about half of the decrease was due to an unfavorable impact from equity securities in insurance services which was driven by the absence of investment gains from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an unfavorable impact from mark to market in the fourth quarter of 2018 in addition an increase in the provision for credit losses at cat financial also contributed to lower profit this increase was driven by a higher allowance rate and an increase in write offs due to continued weakening in the cat power finance portfolio at the end of 2018 past dues at cat financial were 3 55 percent compared with 2 78 percent at the end of 2017 write offs net of recoveries were 189 million for 2018 compared with 114 million for 2017 as of december 31 2018 cat financial s allowance for credit losses totaled 511 million or 1 80 percent of finance receivables compared with 365 million or 1 33 percent of finance receivables at december 31 2017 the increase in past dues write offs and allowance for credit losses was primarily due to continued weakening in the cat power finance portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2018 retail new business volume was 3 10 billion a decrease of 313 million or 9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in cat power finance corporate items and eliminations expense for corporate items and eliminations was 321 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 344 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to methodology differences and lower restructuring costs restructuring costs were 101 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 questions and answers q1 can you provide more information on the reconciliation of significant items impacting 2018 and 2017 adjusted profit a in order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items restructuring costs in recent years we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure during 2018 we incurred 386 million of restructuring costs during 2017 we incurred 1 256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium mark to market losses we recognize actuarial gains and losses for our pension and opeb plans as a mark to market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time for 2018 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 495 million primarily due to lower than expected returns on plan assets partially offset by higher interest rates for 2017 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 301 million primarily due to lower interest rates and a change in mortality assumptions partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments based on improved profits in the united states we recognized a non cash benefit of 63 million and 111 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively to reduce the valuation allowance against u s state deferred tax assets during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a non cash charge of 59 million to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for prior years u s tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a 2 371 billion charge due to the enactment of u s tax reform legislation in december 2017 the provisionally estimated charge included a 596 million write down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a 154 million reduction to the estimated charge for the write down in net deferred tax assets this reduction was primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of 1 0 billion to u s pension plans treated as deductible on the 2017 u s tax return during the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a 50 million increase to the estimated charge for the cost of mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings a reconciliation of these items can be found in the non gaap financial measures section on page 17 q2 can you discuss the unfavorable impact from equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2018 a effective january 1 2018 we adopted a

exhibit 99 1 to form 8 k 5 be measured at fair value through earnings previously the fair value adjustments for these securities were reported in equity until the securities were sold or an impairment was recognized we adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach with no change to prior year financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a loss of 44 million related to fair value adjustments during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized gains on sales of securities of 68 million q3 can you discuss changes in dealer inventories during the fourth quarter of 2018 a dealer machine and engine inventories increased about 200 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and remained about flat during the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year of 2018 dealer inventories increased about 2 3 billion compared with an increase of about 100 million during 2017 we believe the increase in dealer inventories is reflective of current end user demand q4 can you discuss changes to your order backlog by segment a at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 the order backlog was 16 5 billion about 800 million lower than the third quarter of 2018 the decrease was in energy transportation and resource industries partially offset by an increase in construction industries the order backlog increased about 700 million from the end of 2017 the increase was in energy transportation and construction industries partially offset by a decrease in resource industries q5 can you comment on expense related to your 2018 short term incentive compensation plans a short term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually fourth quarter 2018 expense was about 310 million compared with fourth quarter 2017 expense of about 350 million full year 2018 expense was about 1 4 billion nearly the same as 2017 q6 do you expect to exclude restructuring costs from adjusted profit per share in 2019 a on september 24 2015 we announced a significant restructuring program through 2018 that is now substantially complete although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing

in the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of 417 million compared with a loss of 107 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the unfavorable change was primarily a result of an increase in mark to market

24 percent compared with approximately 28 percent for the full year of 2017 excluding the items discussed below the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate beginning

quarter of 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in north america and asia pacific these favorable impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment in europe and latin america financial products segment profit was 29 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 233 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 about half of the decrease was due to an unfavorable impact from equity securities in insurance services which was driven by the absence of investment gains from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an unfavorable impact from mark to market in the fourth quarter of 2018 in addition an increase in the provision for credit losses at cat financial also contributed to lower profit this increase was driven by a higher allowance rate and an increase in write offs due to continued weakening in the cat power finance portfolio at the end of 2018 past dues at cat financial were 3 55 percent compared with 2 78 percent at the end of 2017 write offs net of recoveries were 189 million for 2018 compared with 114 million for 2017 as of december 31 2018 cat financial s allowance for credit losses totaled 511 million or 1 80 percent of finance receivables compared with 365 million or 1 33 percent of finance receivables at december 31 2017 the increase in past dues write offs and allowance for credit losses was primarily due to continued weakening in the cat power finance portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2018 retail new business volume was 3 10 billion a decrease of 313 million or 9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in cat power finance corporate items and eliminations expense for corporate items and eliminations was 321 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 344 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to methodology differences and lower restructuring costs restructuring costs were 101 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 questions and answers q1 can you provide more information on the reconciliation of significant items impacting 2018 and 2017 adjusted profit a in order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items restructuring costs in recent years we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure during 2018 we incurred 386 million of restructuring costs during 2017 we incurred 1 256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium mark to market losses we recognize actuarial gains and losses for our pension and opeb plans as a mark to market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time for 2018 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 495 million primarily due to lower than expected returns on plan assets partially offset by higher interest rates for 2017 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 301 million primarily due to lower interest rates and a change in mortality assumptions partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments based on improved profits in the united states we recognized a non cash benefit of 63 million and 111 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively to reduce the valuation allowance against u s state deferred tax assets during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a non cash charge of 59 million to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for prior years u s tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a 2 371 billion charge due to the enactment of u s tax reform legislation in december 2017 the provisionally estimated charge included a 596 million write down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a 154 million reduction to the estimated charge for the write down in net deferred tax assets this reduction was primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of 1 0 billion to u s pension plans treated as deductible on the 2017 u s tax return during the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a 50 million increase to the estimated charge for the cost of mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings a reconciliation of these items can be found in the non gaap financial measures section on page 17 q2 can you discuss the unfavorable impact from equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2018 a effective january 1 2018 we adopted a

exhibit 99 1 to form 8 k 5 be measured at fair value through earnings previously the fair value adjustments for these securities were reported in equity until the securities were sold or an impairment was recognized we adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach with no change to prior year financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a loss of 44 million related to fair value adjustments during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized gains on sales of securities of 68 million q3 can you discuss changes in dealer inventories during the fourth quarter of 2018 a dealer machine and engine inventories increased about 200 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and remained about flat during the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year of 2018 dealer inventories increased about 2 3 billion compared with an increase of about 100 million during 2017 we believe the increase in dealer inventories is reflective of current end user demand q4 can you discuss changes to your order backlog by segment a at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 the order backlog was 16 5 billion about 800 million lower than the third quarter of 2018 the decrease was in energy transportation and resource industries partially offset by an increase in construction industries the order backlog increased about 700 million from the end of 2017 the increase was in energy transportation and construction industries partially offset by a decrease in resource industries q5 can you comment on expense related to your 2018 short term incentive compensation plans a short term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually fourth quarter 2018 expense was about 310 million compared with fourth quarter 2017 expense of about 350 million full year 2018 expense was about 1 4 billion nearly the same as 2017 q6 do you expect to exclude restructuring costs from adjusted profit per share in 2019 a on september 24 2015 we announced a significant restructuring program through 2018 that is now substantially complete although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing

in may 2017 the trump administration began the process of renegotiating the north american free trade agreement nafta the original nafta which came into force in 1994 created one of the largest and most successful trade zones in the world by expanding freer trade among the agreement s three signatories following more than a year of renegotiations the leaders of the united states mexico and canada gathered in buenos aires on november 30 2018 to sign the new agreement called the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the next step for congress and the trump administration is to develop implementing legislation for the usmca this legislation has yet to be introduced once the administration provides the draft bill containing the implementation legislation to congress the house and senate will hold mock mark up sessions heritage foundation analysts will evaluate that aspect of the process at a later date in the meantime the u s international trade commission itc is conducting an economic analysis of the agreement which is due no later than march 15 this year this backgrounder is an analysis of the usmca as published by the office of the united states trade representative ustr after the signing much of the usmca remains consistent with nafta but substantive improvements were made regarding 21st century trade issues such as digital trade intellectual property rights and cross border data flows many of these provisions help to facilitate trade and prepare north america to lead in 21st century trade the usmca also includes an agriculture chapter that helps to increase some dairy market access as well as a side letter on energy that maintains tariff free treatment for raw and refined oil and gas products at the same time there are several critical weaknesses in the usmca that should be addressed the forthcoming implementing legislation and additional side letters between the three countries may be possible tools this backgrounder provides several suggestions for improving key policies associated with the usmca chapters on labor the environment government procurement rules of origin as well as the provision of a review and term extension process the importance of a modernized trade agreement more than two decades of nafta allowed american businesses to develop efficient supply chains especially in the automotive industry that make north america one of the most competitive regions for manufactured goods it is because of nafta that american exports are enjoyed around the world benefitting u s businesses and the millions of american workers they employ families and businesses in the u s also benefit from increased access to imports from canada and mexico ensuring better prices and more options at stores nafta has been successful in the sense that it has generated economic growth while promoting freedom however the agreement is also more than two decades old the heritage foundation published a report in february 2017 outlining three principles for renegotiating nafta 1 modernization 2 expansion and 3 elimination of counterproductive aspects in order to improve upon its success ref the world is vastly different today than it was in 1994 the internet was in its infancy and trade primarily took place through the exchange of physical goods and services or through investment today digital trade of goods and services as well as the need to protect intellectual property has increased dramatically nafta did not have common rules for the u s mexico and canada to address these new modes of trade leaving it up to governments to impose rules restricting these trade flows some sectors were excluded from nafta including mexico s energy sector this was largely because the sector was state owned when the agreement was negotiated since then mexico has made progress toward privatizing and opening previously closed markets to foreign competition energy trade is not the only area where there is room for increased openness subsidies and managed trade schemes in many agricultural sectors still exist such as in canada s dairy market finally the u s mexico and canada signed several side letters or agreements not included in the full text of nafta on issues unrelated to trade specifically there were side letters on labor and environmental standards the north american agreement on labor cooperation naalc and north american agreement on environmental cooperation naaec were agreed to after the initial negotiations for nafta were completed ref both the naalc and the naaec are very broad and primarily contain lofty goals for the three countries to advance principles on labor and environmental issues these agreements however did establish a destructive standard of including non trade issues in trade negotiations analysts at the heritage foundation have long advocated for the elimination of these topics from nafta and the removal of these types of provisions from trade agreements altogether how we analyzed the usmca the appendix to this backgrounder reviews the key aspects of nearly all 34 chapters of the usmca as well as the various side agreements each provision received a rating of positive neutral or negative this backgrounder highlights some of the key issues in each category in order to determine our assessment the backgrounder s contributors analyze the usmca using three simple guidelines does the provision modernize nafta expand tariff free treatment to new sectors or eliminate non germane issues from the agreement does the provision restrict trade based on the preferences of the government or does it allow individuals in the marketplace the freedom to trade with one another does the provision conform to conservative economic policy recommendations regarding the relationship between the government and the free market ref it is critical that any trade agreement support free trade when governments eliminate or lower tariffs and non tariff barriers individuals have greater freedom to make their own choices free trade allows greater competition and innovation more choices and lower prices for individuals and businesses trade freedom is a cornerstone of the heritage foundation s annual index of economic freedom which finds year after year that increased trade freedom strongly correlates with increased wealth prosperity human development education and even environmental protection ref key positive provisions of the usmca the usmca contains several chapters and provisions that received positive ratings the full analysis of the agreement can be found in the appendix the following items are of particular importance for their role in further opening trade among the u s mexico and canada especially in the area of modernization chapter 3 agriculture chapter 3 generally maintains the market access enjoyed through nafta allowing the free flow of most agricultural goods in the region the usmca includes important but modest gains in the area of dairy market access american dairy producers will have access to up to 3 59 percent of the canadian dairy market canada also agreed to eliminate its pricing scheme for some milk types six months after the agreement goes into effect but the practical impact of this change is unclear at this time chapter 7 customs administration and trade facilitation chapter 7 addresses increased modernization in customs procedures through the use of information technology a single window system for customs documentation and data ref and cooperation and enforcement to ensure confidentiality and the accuracy of claims for preferential tariff treatment these improvements to customs should help to ease the process for importers and exporters and reduce wait times chapter 12 sectoral annexes annexes 12 e and 12 f address the regulation and marketing authorization of medical devices and pharmaceuticals respectively by the three countries these annexes are helpful for ensuring that national product regulation of medical devices and pharmaceuticals is not used as cover for creating trade barriers specifically signatories may not condition marketing authorization for a product on the product receiving such authorization from the country in which it is manufactured that means for example that in the case of a drug manufactured in ireland canada may not require the manufacturer to first get approval for sale in ireland before permitting the drug to be sold in canada chapter 19 digital trade chapter 19 is one of the most positive aspects of the usmca as it focuses extensively on the need for modernization in north american trade while there are many positive provisions in this chapter two of the most crucial aspects are article 19 12 and article 19 16 which ban data localizationref and the forced transfer of source code ref respectively chapter 20 intellectual property chapter 20 creates a legal framework of minimum standards for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights among the united states mexico and canada it builds on existing international agreements that address intellectual property such as the world trade organization wto agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips and treaties administered by the world intellectual property organization wipo overall this chapter is positive and provides many protections for intellectual property that will promote innovation in north america and will afford businesses and individuals protective rights that they would receive in the united states canada u s side letter on energy the usmca does not contain an energy chapter but it does maintain that there will be no tariffs on raw and refined oil and gas products this side letter explicitly addresses u s canada energy trade but the tariff schedules of all three countries keep tariffs at zero for these products ref maintaining tariff free trade will keep important energy trade relationships intact and benefit north american energy consumers key neutral provisions some usmca chapters and provisions contained a mixture of positive and negative components chapter 14 investment and chapter 15 cross border trade in services make efforts to increase or maintain the freedom to trade in north america but contain important shortcomings chapter 14 investment chapter 14 retains an investor state dispute settlement isds process but limits isds protections to certain sectors in mexico ref canada is not part of the chapter a neutral and independent isds arbitration process ensures that american investors are guaranteed fair treatment an especially important consideration for investments in developing countries this chapter s omission of canada will to some extent reduce the scope of relief available to american firms that are subject to canadian environmental or other regulations as well as to american firms operating in the non covered sectors in mexico chapter 15 cross border trade in services chapter 15 requires that limitations not be imposed on the number of service suppliers the total value of service transactions the total number of service operations or the total quantity of service output on the total number of persons who may be employed in a particular service sector or by a quota or on the number of people a supplier may employ nor may an economic needs test be required it also prevents delays in transfers and payments of cross border services mexico and canada increased their de minimis thresholds but they are much lower than the threshold of the united states 800 as a result the united states is permitted to decrease its threshold to that of mexico and canada 117 this reciprocity exemption could force u s customers and foreign sellers to fill out lengthy customs forms and possibly pay tariffs and sales taxes for individual purchases that exceed 117 ref additionally express shipping firms and the u s postal service will be burdened by increased handling costs and longer delivery times ref key negative provisions in need of improvement the usmca in its current form falls short in several key areas including the chapters on labor environment government procurement rules of origin and investor state dispute settlement the following sections detail the weaknesses of these aspects of the usmca and recommend that they be addressed the forthcoming implementing legislation and additional side letters between the three countries may be possible tools chapter 4 rules of origin chapter 4 increases the rules of origin requirements from 62 5 percent to 75 0 percent for cars light trucks and parts and from 60 percent to 70 percent for heavy trucks and parts it imposes a new requirement on automakers that 70 percent of steel and aluminum used in production must be sourced from north america the usmca also includes for the first time a minimum wage requirement in the automotive trade a minimum of 40 percent of the production process must occur at 16 per hour rules of origin in general are regulatory barriers dictating certain production processes or supply chains for businesses requiring them to spend time and money tracking compliance with the rules the increase in the origin percentages is incredibly disruptive to businesses and manages their trade flows even more than they are already managed by the government automakers are now facing the question of whether the new rules represent a greater compliance cost versus the cost of paying the current tariff on cars and parts which is 2 5 percent or the current tariff on light trucks which is 25 percent a true free trade agreement would not contain rules of origin provisions at all allowing the free flow of goods within the territory at a minimum the wage and steel and aluminum requirements should be removed from chapter 4 chapter 13 government procurement chapter 13 is problematic because it covers procurement only between the united states and mexico access between the u s and canada will be governed by the wto government procurement agreement gpa procurement access between canada and mexico is covered by the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp ref in practice this means that there will be very different rules within north america and ultimately it is a missed opportunity for the united states mexican contractors will likely have greater access to the canadian procurement market than american contractors leaving canada out of the procurement chapter could also decrease competition in u s contracts allowing access to government procurement or purchases made by federal state and local governments allows greater competition in these purchases and the potential for better prices ultimately taxpayers in the respective countries are paying for government purchases and allowing additional entities to bid on contracts can help taxpayer dollars to be used more efficiently the united states should reach a solution with canada and mexico that allows procurement rules to be the same among the three countries preferably at the level of the new cptpp which allows greater competition in procurement chapter 23 labor it is critical to support workers rights freedoms and equal treatment and those rights must be considered alongside the rights freedoms and equal treatment of workers who are business owners labor policies should have a minimal role in trade agreements seeking to protect basic rights such as freedom from forced labor and freedom of association additionally article 23 9 of this chapter makes inappropriate reference to sexual orientation and gender identity sogi policies ref these controversial definitions needlessly introduce social policy into a trade agreement unlike being female which is an immutable characteristic sexual orientation is at least in part based upon conduct and gender identity is a subjective internal perception the heritage foundation has long opposed the expansion of antidiscrimination laws in this way the addition of sogi would also undermine the agreement s stated goal of supporting the equality of women by compromising women s privacy and safety in the workplace while many of the provisions of this chapter are likely innocuous for the u s trade agreements should not be used to pursue social policy agendas chapter 23 should be limited to articles on freedom from forced labor and freedom of association the definition of sex as including sogi is a subject of intense political debate that is far from settled and a trade agreement is no place for that debate to be hashed out after the usmca signing a footnote was added to this chapter stating that the current federal agency policies of the united states are sufficient to fulfill the obligations this means that the u s is not subject to the jurisdiction of mexico or canada and does not need to take any action including making amendments to title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 to be in compliance with chapter 23 of the usmca ref sogi policies are a subject of intense political debate and should be decided through the legislative process additionally trade agreements should not be used to pursue social policy agendas the references to sogi should be removed from the usmca chapter 24 environment chapter 24 contains broad boilerplate language on the protection of air and water quality the parties agree to promote corporate social responsibility as well as utilize voluntary mechanisms to improve the environment and address invasive species these environmental provisions were expanded from side letter status in nafta to a full chapter in the usmca many of the environmental provisions are problematic because they are not concerned directly with trade and are primarily focused on ensuring that the parties to the agreement develop and enforce their own environmental laws analysts at the heritage foundation have long advocated for the original nafta environmental side letter to be eliminated and the same should be done with chapter 24 chapter 34 article 34 7 review and term extension article 34 7 details a review and termination process requiring the parties to meet to conduct a joint review of the agreement by the sixth year and each party shall confirm in writing through its head of government if it wishes to extend the term of the agreement should the parties confirm extension the usmca term would be extended for an additional 16 years totaling 22 years at this point the review process would have to occur again in six years and the agreement could then be extended for another 16 years and so on should any party during the review process refrain from confirming the extension the parties must meet annually for the remaining 10 years of the term of the agreement during that time the parties may agree to a new 16 year extension per the confirmation process detailed above if a new extension is not made and the term is allowed to expire the agreement will end the usmca already contains mechanisms for the member countries to seek changes to the agreement in article 34 3 ref this was already the case under nafta as chapter 3 of nafta required annual meetings of the committee on trade in goods ref any provision providing a potential sunset is not only unnecessary but could distort trade between the parties one of the primary strengths of any trade agreement is its ability to create market certainty for businesses allowing them to make informed decisions on purchasing prices hiring and future investment any potential disruptions to that certainty could cause complications when businesses are planning for the future the ability to review a trade agreement is important as the world economy changes but an unsuccessful review process should not be cause for termination usmca preserves nafta s essence but certain areas need improvement at its core free trade describes the ability of individuals to buy and sell goods and services with whom they choose anywhere in the world without government intervention the objective of free trade agreements is to reduce government imposed barriers that prevent people from trading as they desire the original nafta was historic because it took a massive step toward this ideal but nafta was not perfect after more than two decades of operating under the agreement it has become clear that nafta is not equipped to maintain this commitment to reduced government barriers to trade the world economy and modes of trade have changed and nafta needs to be updated to address this new economy based on the current text the usmca makes important changes to ensure that north america is equipped to trade freely as the world economy continues to evolve and advance specifically the chapters on digital trade intellectual property rights and customs administration and trade facilitation prioritize the integration and protection of information technology the usmca also maintains much of the original framework of nafta including the tariff free treatment of scores of products and services unfortunately the usmca contains some shortcomings such as expansive labor and environmental chapters divisive provisions on sogi and more restrictive rules of origin for the automotive industry these components of the usmca will likely have a negative economic impact each of the issues identified as in need of improvement in this backgrounder should be addressed the forthcoming implementing legislation and additional side letters between the three countries may be possible tools tori k whiting is the jay van andel trade economist in the thomas a roe institute for economic policy studies of the institute for economic freedom at the heritage foundation gabriella beaumont smith is policy analyst in macroeconomics in the center for data analysis of the institute for economic freedom appendix an analysis of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca chapter 2 national treatment and market access for goods chapter 2 of the usmca which corresponds to chapter 3 of nafta reinforces many of the rules regarding market access for goods as agreed to in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and at the wto ref there are limited changes to this chapter but new sections were added regarding transparency in licensing procedures for imports and exports ref additionally a new annex addresses the treatment of automobiles and parts from mexico should the u s increase its most favored nation rate on these products ref article 2 3 national treatment the principle of national treatment which is that goods from another country must be treated no less favorably than goods from the home country is upheld in the usmca ref this principle is found in article iii of the gatt to which the united states is party ref exceptions to the national treatment principle are also included in chapter 2 of the usmca these exceptions will be described in detail in the analysis of annex 2 a of this chapter article 2 7 temporary admission of goods the usmca maintains many of the provisions on temporary admission of goods found in nafta section 8 of article 2 7 ensures that each party shall allow a vehicle or shipping container or other substantial holder that enters its territory from the territory of another party to exit its territory on any route that is reasonably related to the economic and prompt departure of that vehicle or shipping container or other substantial holder ref article 2 8 goods re entered after repair or alteration this article ensures that goods imported after repair or alteration are not subject to tariffs or additional duties by any party section 4 of article 2 8 adds new clarification to the terms repair and alteration by excluding processes that a good s essential characteristics or create a new or commercially different good transform ref however the annex does allow the u s to impose an import quota on passenger vehicles from mexico of 1 6 million per year ref auto parts from mexico receive similar assurances regarding the current mfn rates but could be subject to a quota of 108 billion per year ref under these circumstances anything imported above these quotas would be subject to the mfn applied rate in effect at the time of importation of the good ref chapter 3 agriculture and related annexes agricultural trade between the united states and canada and mexico is extremely important for both american agricultural producers and consumers in 2017 canada was the top agricultural export market for the united states while mexico was the third largest agricultural export market ref in terms of imports mexico and canada are the top two largest suppliers of agricultural products into the u s ref it is therefore not surprising that agriculture is a significant focus of the usmca in the agreement the agricultural chapterref chapter 3 is packaged together with a mexico u s bilateral annex ref a canada u s bilateral annex ref an alcohol annex ref and a proprietary foods formula annex ref this alone does not capture the usmca provisions that have a direct impact on agriculture for example provisions in the intellectual property ip chapterref chapter 20 address geographical indications which are especially prevalent in agriculture there is also the sanitary and phytosanitary measures chapterref chapter 9 chapter 3 section b agricultural biotechnology nafta does not include provisions dealing with agricultural biotechnology the usmca would specifically address critical biotechnology innovations in agriculture and help ensure that there are clear and timely approval processes for such technologies among the member countries ref unlike tpp ref the usmca does not limit its coverage to recombinant dna technology it also covers gene editing and appears to provide coverage for many future innovations ref the usmca also addresses what are referred to as low level presence llp occurrences these occurrences refer to situations where imports include a low level of an unapproved crop produced with biotechnology ref these situations can lead to significant problems e g delays costs as has occurred when trading with europe ref the usmca would attempt to create some practical steps to address these situations when they arise and expedite their resolution annex 3 a article 3 a 3 dairy pricing and exports canada has a supply management system for dairy that utilizes tariff rate quotas trqs to limit the amount of foreign dairy products entering the country these trqs allow the export of some dairy products into canada without triggering tariffs but once the quotas are exceeded very high tariffs are triggered ref under the usmca canada has agreed to allow more u s dairy products to enter into canada before triggering the high tariffs including products such as fluid milk and cheese ref american dairy producers will have access to up to 3 59 percent of the canadian dairy market ref which is even better than the 3 25 percent included in the trans pacific partnership ref u s dairy producers have been particularly concerned about a canadian milk pricing scheme establishedref in 2017 that sets artificially low prices for canadian class 7 milk and therefore undercuts u s exports ref class 7 milk covers skim milk solids that are used to produce such things as nonfat dry milk and infant formula ref under the usmca canada has agreed to eliminate this class 7 pricing schemeref six months after the agreement goes into effect ref the practical effect of these changes is unclear former u s secretary of agriculture tom vilsack who is the current ceo of the u s dairy export council has recently expressed a need to have a wait and see attitude ref including when it comes to the impact of eliminating class 7 milk ref annex 3 a article 3 a 4 grain currently even if u s wheat is of the same quality as canadian wheat it still is considered to be feed grain in canada thereby receiving lower prices than comparable canadian wheat ref the usmca addresses this problem both the u s and canada have agreed that they will treat each other s wheat in a manner no less favorable than that it accords to like wheat of national origin ref mexico united states side letter on cheeses a side letter between the u s and mexico expressly lists 33 cheeses that u s producers can sell in mexico without restriction based on the names of those cheeses ref it is not clear what happens to the sale of cheeses that did not make this list although their exclusion may not bode well for u s producers selling them in mexico ref chapter 4 rules of origin chapter 4 dictates the amount of north american content required for duty free treatment under the usmca and contains some of the most substantial changes to nafta ref rules of origin in general are regulatory barriers dictating certain production processes or supply chains for businesses requiring them to spend time and money tracking compliance with the rules set forth article 4 b 3 regional value content for passenger vehicles light trucks and parts thereof under nafta the regional content requirement for passenger vehicles and light trucks was 62 5 percent ref article 4 b 3 details a phase in period for the content requirement to increase annually reaching 75 percent for most passenger vehicles and light trucks by 2023 ref a similar phase in period is dictated for parts of passenger vehicles and light trucks reaching between 65 percent and 75 percent by 2023 ref article 4 b 4 regional value content for heavy trucks and parts thereof the content requirement for heavy trucks is currently 60 percent under nafta but article 4 b 4 has that rate increasing to 70 percent by 2027 ref the requirement for heavy truck parts is set to increase to between 60 percent and 70 percent by 2027 ref article 4 b 6 steel and aluminum article 4 b 6 adds another new burden for automotive producers by requiring that 70 percent of steel and aluminum used in the process be sourced from north america there is no phase in for this requirement and a similar section was not part of nafta ref article 4 b 7 labor value content for the first time automotive trade in north america is set to be subject to minimum wage requirements by 2023 a minimum of 40 percent of the production process is required to occur at 16 per hour the use of material costs research and development expenditures and assembly costs are limited when calculating if a business meets this requirement businesses are also prohibited from including benefits and indirect employment such as management and engineering in their wage calculations ref minimum wage laws have caused major trouble around the country and in 2016 congress was considering increasing the federal minimum wage from 7 25 to 15 per hour in 2016 heritage foundation experts found that increasing the federal minimum wage would have had negative impacts on employment and it difficult for less skilled workers to find jobs ref just as federal state and local governments should not be increasing minimum wages these anticompetitive policies should not be in trade agreements section 232 side letters on may 23 2018 president trump instructed the department of commerce to conduct an analysis of the effects of automobile and automobile parts imports under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 ref section 232 allows the president to impose tariffs following an investigation that determines that the imports in question are injuring or threatening to injure u s national security ref the automobile investigation which follows two similar probes into steel and aluminum imports that resulted in additional tariffs being imposed during 2018 is still ongoing u s automotive trade is valued at more than 500 billion per year with much of that trade occurring within north america ref tariffs would increase the cost of doing businesses in the region the side letters to the usmca regarding this topic dictate terms for mexico and canada should the report by the department of commerce conclude that imports of automobiles and parts threaten to impair national security canada agreed to an import quota of 2 6 million passenger vehicles per year no limit on truck imports and an import quota of 32 4 billion in value of automobile parts ref mexico also agreed to an import quota of 2 6 million passenger vehicles no limit on truck imports and a much higher quota of 108 billion in value of automobile parts ref the u s limited the ability of each country to dispute any potential tariffs on these items through nafta and the usmca except with respect to whether the united states has excluded the number of passenger vehicles and light trucks and the value of auto parts as set out ref canada and mexico clarified their rights to retaliate if the u s violates the side letter agreements as well as clarified that either country retains its wto rights to challenge a section 232 measure ref in theory these policies are meant to contain supply chains to the parties of the agreement however they also limit the efficiency that could be achieved by simply seeking out the best processes for production of a particular good the purpose of a free trade agreement fta is to facilitate trade making it easier for americans to buy and sell with the world the rules of origin found in chapter 4 especially in the area of automotive production are the definition of managed trade not facilitated trade they add new requirements for producers that will likely lead to higher prices for consumers chapter 5 origin procedures this chapter details the logistics for verifying preferential tariff treatment under the usmca ref a similar chapter did not exist in nafta however these procedures are meant to replace the tracing process under nafta ref tracing required companies to maintain dozens of different certifications and oftentimes thousands of documents for each individual part as well as retrieve proprietary pricing information from its suppliers the aim of this chapter is to simplify the origin certification process and reduce some of the bureaucracy found in the nafta process while the new process seems to streamline certification the elimination of rules of origin altogether would be a better way to minimize the impact on businesses of certifying the origin of their products to qualify for duty free treatment article 5 2 claims for preferential tariff treatment this article allows an exporter producer or importer to submit a request for origin certification and also allows a party to establish a process for certification section 3 of article 5 2 also dictates that certification need not follow a prescribed format and may be provided on an invoice or any other document there are minimum elements for the certification which will be explained in annex 5 a additionally certification of origin may be completed and submitted electronically and with an electronic or digital signature ref article 5 3 basis of a certification of origin article 5 3 allows for the certifier of the good to be a producer exporter or importer and specifies that a party cannot require one of those three entities to complete the certification this gives companies the flexibility to determine which entity is best equipped to complete the certification this article also allows companies to complete certification on a single shipment of a good or multiple shipments of identical goods within any period specified in the certification of origin but not exceeding 12 months ref article 5 5 exceptions to certification of origin a certification of origin is not required for imports under 1 000 usd and parties are permitted to increase that margin if they so choose ref the existence of rules of origin requirements restricts trade but the ability for some imports to be exempt from these rules is positive article 5 7 errors or discrepancies this article prevents parties from denying a certification due to minor errors or discrepancies in it that do not create doubts concerning the correctness of the import documentation in the case that a certification is found to be inadequate this article allows the importer a minimum of five days to correct the documentation ref article 5 8 record keeping requirements importers producers and exporters are required to keep record of origin certifications for at least five years but may store them in any medium including electronic provided that the records or documentation can be promptly retrieved and printed ref article 5 10 determinations of origin an origin certification can be denied if the good does not qualify for preferential treatment sufficient information is not provided the entity completing the certification fails to respond to a written request or questionnaire for information a verification visit is denied the importer exporter or producer fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter or records are not properly maintained and provided ref article 5 15 review and appeal this article requires parties to treat all importers exporters and producers equally during the review and appeal processes for origin certification ref article 5 16 uniform regulations article 5 16 requires uniform regulations to be adopted by all parties regarding the interpretation application and administration of chapters 4 through 7 of the usmca ref article 5 18 committee on rules of origin and origin procedures a committee on rules of origin and origin procedures is created under this article but only government officials sit on the committee the committee is tasked with ensuring that origin requirements are met by all parties ref however it should also address questions on the effectiveness of these rules there should also be representation of importers exporters and producers on the committee so as to allow them to communicate the impact that these rules have on their businesses and ability to trade under the usmca article 5 19 sub committee on origin verification the subcommittee created under this article also only includes government officials with the purpose of sharing technical advice related to conducting verifications of origin ref the committee should also include importers exporters and producers so as to make origin verification processes more efficient and manageable for these businesses annex 5 a minimum data elements there are nine minimum data elements required in origin certification under the usmca 1 indicate whether certification is done by the importer exporter or producer 2 provide pertinent contact information for the certifier 3 provide pertinent contact information for the exporter 4 provide pertinent contact information for the producer 5 provide pertinent contact information for the importer 6 include a description of the good and the 6 digit harmonized tariff schedule number of the good and indicate if certification is for a single shipment 7 give an explanation of why the good is originating 8 indicate the period of certification and 9 sign and date the certification using language specified in annex 5 a of the usmca ref chapter 6 textile and apparel goods this chapter addresses textile and apparel goods in conjunction with chapters 4 and 5 which address rules of origin and origin procedures respectively this chapter was previously annex 300 b of chapter 3 national treatment and market access for goods in nafta it addresses handmade traditional folkloric and indigenous handicraft goods rules of origin cooperation and verification and sets up a committee on textile and apparel trade matters it also has a two part annex that sets up measurements and a change in tariff classification this chapter has made widespread changes to rules of origin for textile and apparel goods under nafta there were no provisions that took into account the inclusion of non north american fabrics that could be imported and added to finished products without incurring non preferential duties ref the agreement adopts the yarn forward rules of origin meaning fibers may be produced anywhere but each component starting with the yarn used to make the garments must be formed within the free trade area ref the provisions limit the inclusion of finished fabric in the form of sewing thread pocketing fabric narrow elastic bands and coated fabric that originates from regions outside north america ref in order to qualify for the import duty free treatment apparel items such as a pocket bag fabric must use inputs made in the usmca area ref rules of origin often distort the market and manipulate rather than facilitate trade in the case of the usmca textile and apparel goods will be subject to more restrictive tariff preference levels tpl for any fabrics considered non originating if a product is completely originated in the usmca region and has no material or manipulation from outside the free trade area those rules will not apply ref the agreement will cut the tpl level of product categories that have a low tpl utilization rate and expand the tpl level for some product categories that have a high tpl utilization rate ref for example the tpl utilization rate for cotton mmf exported from canada was 4 46 percent in 2017 and will change from 88 326 463 sme under nafta to 40 000 000 sme under usmca ref since the utilization rate is so low the impact will be minimal cotton mmf apparel currently exported by the united states has a 100 percent utilization rate for 9 000 000 sme under nafta and this will be increased to 20 000 000 sme per year under usmca which is a large increase and could have a great impact ref although there have been improvements with de minimis and tpl the stricter requirements on rules of origin are not positive for this agreement rules of origin distort the market and will likely lead to increasing costs and therefore prices or decreasing quality of textile and apparel goods or both article 6 1 rules of origin and related matters if apparel or fabric originates in the united states and contains non usmca materials it must meet the rules of origin for its specific hs designation and limit non originating fibers to not more than 10 percent of the total weight of that component of which the total weight of elastomeric content may not exceed 7 percent ref these de minimis levels are more generous than what was provided in nafta this is also the case for sewing thread and yarn if a textile includes rayon filament or rayon fiber that is not lyocell or acetate that textile or apparel good will still be considered originating the increased de minimis levels and extension to rayon filament and rayon fiber are steps toward liberalization that will reduce the regulatory barriers for businesses article 6 2 handmade traditional folkloric or indigenous handicraft goods provisions are set out that give duty free treatment to any handmade traditional folkloric or indigenous handicraft goods produced in the united states mexico or canada indigenous populations will be granted authority to certify indigenous handicrafts as they pertain to the agreement ref the article also states that parties may disregard the agreement in order to honor previous agreements with indigenous populations in each country article 6 4 review and revision of rules of origin there is room for renegotiation for determining rules of origin for textile and apparel goods without relitigating the entire usmca article 6 4 states that a party is permitted to request a meeting to determine whether particular goods should be subject to different rules of origin to address issues of availability of supply of fibers yarns or fabrics in the free trade area ref the united states is not allowed to apply duties to textiles or apparel that are assembled in mexico from fabrics wholly formed and cut in the united states and exported from and reimported into the united states if after such assembly those goods have been subject to bleaching garment dyeing stonewashing acid washing or perma pressing ref there is also a quota specific to each textile product that will be placed on preferential tariff treatment for any apparel goods that meet all origin specifications but are both cut or knit to shape and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of a party from fabric or yarn produced or obtained outside the free trade area ref article 6 6 verification the goal of the new provisions is to increase the use of made in usa fibers yarns and fabrics by increasing the cost of non usmca materials the agreement increases tpl levels for u s cotton and man made fiber apparel exports to canada which has a utilization rate of 100 percent but these products are not required to use u s made yarn and fabrics this could lead to interesting results for the utilization rate and evaluation of success of increasing made in usa fibers yarns and fabrics ref in order to carry this out the chapter required enforcement regulations and verification protocols mostly covered in chapter 5 origin procedures but it is also addressed in article 6 6 this is intended to make it more difficult to procure preferential duties if the rules of origin requirements are not met the main power in verification will come through the customs administration of the party some verification will allow importing parties to conduct visits and collect records to facilities believed to be involved in skirting origin regulations ref however the party importing does not have to divulge which exporters or producers it may visit under the new usmca rules and for non textile products the rules for visits are ambiguous which likely means that they will be determined by the exporting country ref article 6 8 committee on textile and apparel trade matters this article created a committee on textile and apparel trade matters which will be used to update the textile chapter if the agreement is ratified the committee would be required to meet at least once a year and be made up of representatives from each country the committee is required to review the impact of free trade on the sale of worn apparel in the united states mexico and canada and rule on textile specific verification and customs cooperation provisions ref chapter 7 customs administration and trade facilitation chapter 7 of the usmca addresses the process for trade facilitation and customs administration this was previously covered in chapter 5 of nafta customs procedures the chapter addresses increased modernization through the use of information technology a single window system for customs documentation and data and cooperation and enforcement to ensure confidentiality and the accuracy of claims for preferential tariff treatment chapter 7 section a customs administration and trade facilitation this section focuses on streamlining the trade process so that it is more efficient and transparent there is an emphasis on the use of online publication and information technology which is evidence of the success of modernization the promotion of information sharing with regard to resources such as documentation and data for importation exportation and transit as well as laws regulations procedures duties taxes and other fees will help to minimize costs in trading allowing for greater efficiency and transparency article 7 3 communication with traders this article addresses openness to input for procedural changes so that traders can be actively involved in communicating support or opposition to impending regulation changes governing trade and customs or bringing attention to emerging problems ref to what extent this will be readily used and enforceable is unknown but it is a nice democratic aspect of the agreement article 7 7 release of goods this article states that each country must adopt or maintain simplified customs procedures for the efficient release of goods in order to facilitate trade ref this includes immediate release of goods upon receipt of customs declaration and fulfillment electronic submission and processing of documentation and data the release of goods at point of arrival without temporary transfer to warehouses or other facilities and prior to payment of customs duties taxes fees and charges imposed on or in connection with the importation of the goods provided that they are eligible and any security has been provided ref this is aimed at reducing the amount of time that imports sit at ports or in warehouses allowing for a smoother and faster trading process and the opportunity to use electronic submission and processing that will expedite the customs process upon arrival article 7 8 express shipments article 7 8 puts an expedited customs procedure in place for express shipments this will allow for the submission and processing of information prior to arrival of the goods a single submission to cover all goods contained in the shipment and immediate release after arrival as long as data and documentation are submitted the use of electronic systems streamlines the process making it more efficient for ports and businesses no customs duties or taxes will be assessed at the time or point of importation and formal entry procedures will not be required instead fixed costs will be imposed for express shipments of particular values this is the de minimis threshold that will set the maximum value of goods that can be imported duty free the thresholds were raised from c 20 to c 150 for canada and from us 50 to us 117 for mexico ref however those goods imported to canada valued between c 40 01 and c 150 will be subject to a sales tax and goods imported to mexico valued from us 50 01 to us 117 will be subject to jurisdictional taxes ref this threshold for canada only applies to shipments facilitated by express carriers any shipments carried by canada s federal postal service will be subject to the nafta de minimis threshold of c 20 this means that any good imported to canada valued over c 20 will be subject to duties and taxes ref the de minimis threshold for the united states is us 800 however footnote 3 states otwithstanding the amounts set out under this subparagraph a party may impose a reciprocal amount that is lower for shipments from another party if the amount provided for under that other party s law is lower than that of the party ref this means that the united states can lower their 800 statutory de minimis threshold to the mexican and canadian thresholds of us 117 ref if the united states chooses to do this us customers and foreign sellers will have to fill out lengthy customs forms and possibly pay tariffs and sales taxes for individual purchases that exceed 117 ref additionally express shipping firms and usps will be burdened by increased handling costs and longer delivery times ref the change in the maximum de minimis values decreases burdensome rules that can reduce the ease and speed of trade using only the new de minimis threshold for express shipments to canada may further increase the speed at which goods are exported to canada however it should have been the aim of canada to increase trade facilitation and have the new de minimis threshold apply to all shipments furthermore the united states should be discouraged from using the reciprocity exception in footnote 3 the increased de minimis thresholds increase cross border trade which gives consumers access to a wider variety of goods at different prices if the united states uses the lower de minimis threshold of 117 instead of 800 cross border trade will decrease as business costs will increase and consumers will have to pay more and experience longer wait times for deliveries ref article 7 12 risk management and article 7 13 post clearance audit articles 7 12 and 7 13 aim to further improve the expedition of the release of goods each article aims to ensure risk analysis and compliance with customs and related laws are kept in check and arbitrary or discriminatory assessments are avoided ref these provisions support the goal of increased efficiency and transparency but it is not clear how easy it will be to enforce a reduction of unjustifiable assessments in regard to risk or post clearance auditing therefore the effects of this will be difficult to assess article 7 20 customs brokers customs brokers are not required to file customs declarations or other import or transit documentation on behalf of an importer or any other person deemed appropriate the ability to self file particularly electronically increases the freedom of importers a party may establish requirements for qualifications licensing or registration for customs brokers or to provide customs broker services but they must be transparent and administered uniformly in the country if a customs broker must be licensed then a party cannot impose limits on the number of ports or locations that the broker can operate in ref if a party were to establish customs broker requirements this would reduce the freedom that would exist by allowing self filing however the freedom to operate in multiple ports would alleviate some of the effects of the restrictions assuming that the requirements are not so burdensome that only a few customs brokers exist article 7 22 protection of trade information article 7 24 requires that each party s customs administration take actions to protect the use disclosure retention correction and disposal of information collected from traders ref it is unclear what the confidential information may entail paragraph 2 states this article s necessity is to protect confidential information from use or disclosure that could prejudice the competitive position of the trader to whom the confidential information relates ref enforcing protection of information will reduce opportunities for litigation particularly when switching to an information technology system however parties should be careful about attacks that could result in data breaches to purposefully leak information to harm the competitive position of a trader article 7 24 trade facilitation committee this article facilitates the creation of a committee so that there can be increased sharing of information the committee must be composed of government representatives of each party ref this seems to be a sort of centralization of usmca operatives and it is doubtful that this committee would be productive if businesses particularly smes were given the opportunity to act as representatives on the committee the body may be productive as it would have more local information about the trading environment which would increase the facilitation of trade between the three countries chapter 7 section b cooperation and enforcement this section focuses on the cooperation and enforcement aspect of customs administration each party must cooperate when another party is taking measures concerning customs offenses including ensuring the accuracy of claims for preferential tariff treatment ref it is emphasized that advance notice is given of any administrative changes or modifications to laws or regulations that affect importations exportations or transit procedures specific confidential information may be exchanged between parties if it is relevant to a case of customs offense or an offense that is likely to occur this can be requested and provided electronically or otherwise verification requests may be carried out by one party asking for a verification in the relevant party s territory and a site visit may be permitted ref most of section b has not changed from nafta and is pretty standard with respect to enforcing and cooperating when there is suspicion of wrongdoing it is generally agreed that the parties cooperate and that the rules of the territory in which the offense took place will apply it is unlikely that this section will have a significant impacts on international trade chapter 8 recognition of the mexican state s direct inalienable and imprescriptible ownership of hydrocarbons article 8 1 recognition of the united mexican states direct inalienable and imprescriptible ownership of hydrocarbons another provision specific to mexico the agreement asserts that mexico has direct inalienable and imprescriptible ownership of all hydrocarbons in the subsoil of the national territory including the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone located outside the territorial sea and adjacent thereto in strata or deposits regardless of their physical conditions pursuant to mexico s constitution however mexico s government opened energy exploration to foreign investment and the agreement that mexico at least retain its current level of openness mexico s statement on mineral rights is disappointing though the provision is not surprising mexico s stated federal ownership of its natural resources is a missed opportunity to capitalize on a critical feature of the american energy renaissance private property rights the united states has been the world s largest oil and gas producer for seven years not just because of its abundant reserves much of the growth in production is occurring on private and state owned lands which is far outpacing production on federally owned lands moreover usmca allows u s customs to accept alternate certification that oil and gas coming to the u s originated in mexico or canada accepting alternative documentation for the rules of origin could save canadian oil producers tens of millions of dollars mixing light diluent in with canadian oil sands to help the oil travel through pipelines made it difficult to prove the canadian origin and therefore producers were assessed a per barrel fee ca us side letter on energy the usmca does not contain an energy chapter but does contain several energy provisions in article 3 of a side letter agreement on energy the letter asserts that the parties recognize the importance of enhancing the integration of north american energy markets based on market principles including open trade and investment among the parties if the agreement would maintain those principles throughout the text american energy companies and consumers would be in good shape productively the agreement maintains the nafta provision that there will be no tariffs on raw and refined oil and gas products maintaining no tariffs will keep important energy trade relationships intact and benefit north american energy consumers chapter 9 sanitary and phytosanitary measures sanitary and phytosanitary plant related measures help to ensure a safe food supply and protect the health of animals and plants the challenge in the international trade context is making sure countries apply these measures for legitimate health and safety reasons and not as an excuse to protect domestic industry from foreign competition according to the office of the united states trade representative ustr unfortunately governments often seek to disguise measures that are discriminatory unduly burdensome or not based on scientific evidence as legitimate sps measures these measures create significant barriers to u s agricultural exports and ustr is committed to identifying and removing these barriers ref nafta currently has a chapter on sanitary and phytosanitary measures ref and the usmca appears to include language that will build upon the existing chapter some of the express objectives of the usmca sps chapter are to enhance transparency in and understanding of the application of each party s sanitary and phytosanitary measures encourage the development and adoption of science based international standards guidelines and recommendations and promote their implementation by the parties and advance science based decision making ref there is no real way to ascertain the intent of a country when it develops an sps measure i e there is no way to know whether it really is for health reasons or protectionist reasons by requiring a country to demonstrate that there is a strong scientific basis for the measure it better ensures the rule is not a protectionist scheme and further that the rule is justified to achieve a legitimate health or safety objective chapter 10 trade remedies chapter 10 of the usmca addresses the use of trade remedies including safeguard measures which were previously located in chapter 8 of nafta this chapter also covers the application of antidumping and countervailing duties which were previously addressed in chapter 19 of nafta this chapter of the usmca also includes a new section on preventing duty evasion of antidumping countervailing and safeguard duties ref duty evasion is the alleged practice of diverting or modifying supply chains to avoid tariffs or quotas in one of the party countries ustr identified new procedures to address ad cvd duty evasion including the ability to conduct ad cvd verification visits as a negotiating objective in november 2017 ref this topic was not listed as a priority in the fast track authority given to the executive branch by congress ref sections a and b safeguards and antidumping and countervailing duties sections a and b of this chapter detail the rules for the use of safeguards as well as antidumping and countervailing duties safeguards are permitted under the world trade organization if the home country proves that a domestic industry is experiencing injury due to imports antidumping and countervailing duties are also permitted and address allegations of imports that are sold below cost or imports receiving subsidies respectively the rules and processes for the use of these remedies remained largely unchanged these provisions are particularly relevant today as the trump administration has used trade law to unilaterally impose tariffs on imports including imports from canada and mexico while trade remedies are permitted under the wto they often act as a protectionist measure to favor politically sensitive u s industries under false claims of import injury section c cooperation on preventing duty evasion of trade remedy laws provisions on duty evasion are new to the usmca and vaguely defined by the agreement in a footnote as evasion of antidumping countervailing or safeguard duties ref the section does not specify how this evasion is to be identified but the party countries did agree to share customs information pertaining to imports exports and transit transactions ref section c also allows a party country to request another party to conduct a duty evasion verification and the agreement states the requested party normally shall grant the other party access to its territory to participate in the duty evasion verification ref on its face this section seems to promote cooperation and information sharing but it also provides a new mechanism for the united states to tighten the reins on globally integrated supply chains for example if canada produces a car part that uses steel it imported from japan and that steel has a u s antidumping duty applied sending the final car part to the u s could be considered duty evasion under this section heritage foundation experts have long supported a trade policy that eliminates tariffs on intermediate goods as more than half of all u s imports are used in the production of final goods ref the actions of a private company to establish supply chains should not be influenced by governments except in serious cases of national defense this section of the agreement also sets a precedent for even more prescriptive regulations on the development of supply chains in the future section d review and dispute settlement in antidumping and countervailing duty matters this section remains consistent with nafta and allows for the party countries to dispute the use of trade remedies through a panel within the usmca rather than through the wto the usmca does include new provisions in annex 10 a that reinforce the importance of promoting transparency in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings ref this annex simply emphasizes the transparency commitments made by each country within the wto and encourages the parties to share documents regarding trade remedies chapter 11 technical barriers to trade tariffs are just one of several protectionist tools and so called technical barriers to trade tbt are among the most common such barriers include regulatory standards and compliance regimes that favor domestic products and disadvantage imports chapter 11ref of the usmca addresses various means to achieve greater regulatory alignment between the united states mexico and canada ref article 11 3 incorporation of the tbt agreement the world trade organizationref wto and various trade agreementsref over the years have created committees and commissioned reports for standardizing the countless regulations including licensure and certification that countries craft to protect public health improve the environment and in some cases restrict foreign competition universal standards do exist for some products in sectors such as agriculture electronics and technology but they remain elusive for many others in large part because federal regulatory standards reflect economic political and social values the usmca recognizes the wto s technical barriers to trade committee decision on international standards as the authority in determining whether a regulation is or is not a regulatory standard this provides consistency in identifying existing regulatory standards ref article 11 4 international standards guides and recommendations according to article 11 4 the parties recognize the role of international standards guides and recommendations in regulatory alignment and good regulatory practices ref if a party needs to determine the existence of an international standard guide or recommendation the party should apply the tbt committee decision on international standards ref however the domicile of the standards body its status as non governmental or inter governmental and whether the standards body limits participation to delegations are not relevant for the determination of a standard as an international standard ref no party may give preference to the consideration or use of standards that are inconsistent with the world trade organization s technical barriers to trade committee decision on international standards ref in regard to any agreement or understanding that establishes a customs union or free trade area or that provides trade related technical assistance each party is directed to encourage adoption and use as the basis for standards technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures any relevant standards guides or recommendations developed in accordance with the wto s tbt committee decision on international standards ref article 11 5 paragraph 6 technical regulations this article states that if a party has not used international standards as a basis for a technical regulation a party shall on request from another party explain why it has not used a relevant international standard or has substantially deviated from an international standard ref this article received a negative grade because it could place additional regulatory burdens on businesses that did not exist under nafta article 11 6 paragraph 1 conformity assessment the usmca directs the signatories to accord conformity assessments in the territory of another party no less favorably than what is accorded to those located in its own territory or in the territory of the other party ref conformity assessment bodies that are located in a nation are better equipped to understand the needs of that nation and its citizens article 11 6 paragraphs 2 and 5 7 conformity assessment article 11 6 requires parties to permit subcontractors and non governmental bodies to conduct conformity assessment provided they are approved in the party s territory ref paragraph 7 of this article instructs parties to facilitate and encourage reliance on mutual or multilateral recognition arrangementsref to accredit approve license or otherwise recognize conformity assessmentref bodies where effective and appropriate ref it also states that each party shall consider approving or recognizing accredited conformity assessment bodies for its technical regulations or standards by an accreditation body that is a signatory to a mutual or multilateral recognition arrangement ref these provisions received a positive rating because they promote policies that aim to reduce duplicative testing along with free market principles by allowing competitive conformity assessments article 11 7 paragraphs 1 and 8 transparency paragraph 1 of article 11 7 requires each party to allow persons of another party to participate in the development of technical regulations standards and conformity assessment procedures by its central government on terms no less favorable than those that it accords to its own persons ref paragraph 8 of this article requires regulators developing rules to allow persons of another party to participate on no less favorable terms than its own persons in groups or committees developing standards ref greater transparency should always be the goal however these provisions do not promote that intended goal accountability plays a significant role in transparency and allowing foreign influence in rulemaking undermines that article 11 7 paragraphs 2 and 4 transparency this article requires parties to publish proposed technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures allows parties to submit comments on the development of technical regulations standards and conformity assessment procedures requires parties to accept a request from another party to discuss those comments in the development of the measure ref and requires parties to publish final technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures and explain how substantive issues raised in comments have been addressed ref article 11 9 paragraphs 1 and 2 cooperation and trade facilitation this article requires each party to consider requests by a party to implement mutual recognition of results from conformity assessment bodies in its territory and another party s territory with respect to specific technical regulations ref the parties recognize that to support greater regulatory alignment they should provide technical advice and assistance to improve practices related to the development implementation and review of technical regulations standards conformity assessment procedures ref although such standards marked as negative may facilitate trade by streamlining regulation they are more likely to reflect a greater degree of the political compromises inherent in international negotiations ref moreover international standards are less likely to account for the specific conditions within countries or even continents canada and mexico certainly have a legitimate interest in the drafting and enforcement of u s regulations but that interest should not accord them the very same status as citizens the federal government must answer to americans and put the interests of america first in many cases that means crafting rules that will facilitate rather than inhibit trade but there will likely be circumstances in which trade effects would be a secondary consideration and the usmca should not require the united states to effectively forfeit its sovereignty chapter 12 sectoral annexes annex 12 d energy performance standards the agreement also contains an annex 12 d that includes language about energy performance standards which promotes voluntary energy efficiency measures and states that the parties shall cooperate on enhancing regulatory compatibility voluntary measures could easily become mandatory measures enhancing regulatory compatibility may be beneficial to bigger industries who only have to adhere to one standard but the measures are anti consumer they restrict choice and nudge households and businesses into behaviors preferred by government regulators congress and the administration should eliminate the current standards that exist not encourage their use through trade deals annexes 12 e medical devices and 12 f pharmaceuticals annexes 12 e and 12 f address the regulation and marketing authorization of medical devices and pharmaceuticals respectively by the three countries because of the nature of these products most national governments have special regulatory regimes governing their marketing sale and manufacture those regulatory regimes are intended to ensure that the products are safe and effective relative to the medical conditions they are intended to treat for patients several provisions of these annexes are helpful to ensuring that national product regulation of medical devices and pharmaceuticals is not used as cover for creating trade barriers for instance articles 12 e 5 1 and 12 f 5 1 state that each country shall ensure that in regulating the safety effectiveness or quality of medical devices or pharmaceuticals products imported from a signatory country are not treated less favorably than either products imported from a non signatory country or domestic products ref similarly articles 12 e 6 5 and 12 f 6 8 specify that signatories may not condition marketing authorization for a product on the product receiving such authorization from the country in which it is manufactured ref that means for example that in the case of a drug manufactured in ireland canada could not require the manufacturer to first get approval in ireland before permitting the drug to be sold in canada in addition to avoiding potential trade barriers some of the provisions in these annexes could also reduce regulatory burdens thus making it generally easier and less costly for industry to bring products to market for instance in article 12 e 4 3 the three countries agree to recognize audits of medical device manufacturers quality management systems conducted by authorized auditing organizations in accordance with the medical device single audit program mdsap ref also under articles 12 e 6 6 and 12 f 6 9 party may accept a prior marketing authorization that is issued by another regulatory authority as evidence that a meets its requirements ref it is worth noting that this provision would include product approvals by regulators outside of the three parties such as regulators in european countries chapter 13 government procurement this chapter details the scope of access to government procurement for the party countries which was previously addressed in chapter 10 of nafta ref allowing access to government procurement or purchases made by federal state and local governments allows for greater competition in these purchases and the potential for better prices ultimately taxpayers in the respective country are paying for government purchases and allowing additional entities to bid on contracts can help taxpayer dollars to be used more efficiently chapter 13 is very similar to nafta however many of the updates or new aspects of the chapter are nearly identical to the trans pacific partnership article 13 2 scope paragraph 3 of the article on scope states that this chapter applies only as between mexico and the united states accordingly for the purposes of this chapter party or parties means mexico or the united states singly or collectively ref due to this paragraph canada is not party to the usmca agreements on government procurement procurement access between the u s and canada will be subject to the world trade organization government procurement agreement wto gpa under this change as a result u s firms access to canadian procurement will be slightly reduced and the ability to bid on new services in canada will be limited to the procurement of services that it lists in the wto gpa according to former procurement negotiator jena heilman grier ref procurement access between canada and mexico will be covered by the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp the agreement between 11 trans pacific nations that replaced the trans pacific partnership after the u s pulled out ref this is a missed opportunity for the united states as mexican contractors will likely have greater access to the canadian procurement market than american contractors leaving canada out of the procurement chapter could also have negative consequences for american taxpayers due to the decrease in competition from canadian bids article 13 3 exceptions this article lists four exceptions to the agreements made regarding government procurement access between the parties those exceptions are protection of public morals order or safety human animal or plant life or health intellectual property and goods or services of a person with disabilities of philanthropic or not for profit institutions or of prison labor ref these exceptions are consistent with chapter 10 of nafta but a new paragraph was added to clarify that the second exception includes environmental measures necessary to protect human animal or plant life or health ref environmental issues should not be used as a scapegoat for allowing access to government procurement article 13 4 general principles the principles of national treatment and non discrimination are reinforced in this section this section is very similar to nafta but some modernization occurred through the addition of a paragraph regarding the use of electronic means paragraph seven states the parties shall seek to provide opportunities for covered procurement to be undertaken through electronic means including for the publication of procurement information notices and tender documentation and for the receipt of tenders ref annex 13 a schedules of mexico and the united states section a of each schedule sets the contract thresholds for procurement between the united states and mexico the threshold amounts are set to be adjusted for inflation but there are dollar amount limitations for total contracts in some areas for most agencies of the respective federal government agencies the thresholds are set at 80 317 for goods and services and 10 441 216 for construction services ref these thresholds are consistent with the most recent increases set under nafta for the united states the access in this schedule is equivalent to the parameters of the buy american act and other various federal laws pertaining to limits on government procurement ref other agencies and government organizations are subject to higher thresholds for procurement of 401 584 for goods and services and 12 851 327 for construction services ref these thresholds are also consistent with the most recent increases set under nafta for the u s there are limitations to procurement in many areas including services in research and development some telecommunications ships utilities and dredging ref mexico is also only allowed access to six non federal government entities ref mexico allows access to other agencies and organizations at these higher thresholds including airports roads and bridges electricity water forest and mexico s state owned petróleos mexicanos pemex ref access to pemex procurement however is limited mexico also limits access for procurement in some services including research and development engineering for restoration of historical sites some telecommunications health and social services financial services and utilities ref chapter 14 investment chapter 14 of the usmcaref replaces chapter 11 of nafta ref for the most part chapter 14 of the usmca retains some of the protections for foreign investment that were included in chapter 11 of nafta the major change is that provisions for investor state dispute settlement isds are drastically reduced as the provisions only apply to certain sectors in mexico the usmca eliminates isds protections for foreign investment in canada as simon lester of cato has observed nafta was the first trade agreement to incorporate investor protections ref isds has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in congress the trump administration however has voiced skepticism about isds ref annex 14 d chinese investors excluded from isds article 1 of annex 14 d of the usmca ref excludes claimants that are owned or controlled by a person of a non annex party that on the date of signature of this agreement the other annex party has determined to be a non market economy for purposes of its trade remedy laws and with which no party has a free trade agreement this provision is clearly aimed at excluding chinese owned or controlled firms or persons in the u s or mexico from using the isds process on october 26 2017 the u s department of commerce s international trade administration published a 200 page memorandum that concluded that china is a non market economy nme country because it does not operate sufficiently on market principles to permit the use of chinese prices and costs for purposes of the department s antidumping analysis ref annexes 14 d and 14 e canada excluded from isds to the biggest change to the nafta isds provision is that under chapter 14 of the usmca canada is excluded isds will be available only to u s and mexican investors with regard to their investments in each other s countries also the isds provisions under usmca with regard to mexico are not as all encompassing as they were under nafta isds provisions in usmca are limited to investments in oil and gas power generation telecommunications transportation infrastructure and other listed sectors that have a contract with the central government of mexico annex 14 e 6 b covered sectors locking in the legal framework of isds protection and keeping mexican hydrocarbons open to foreign investment will strengthen american companies commitment in mexico however the isds language should be strengthened midstream and downstream operators such as refining distribution and infrastructure companies as well as renewable energy companies and any other energy company that does not hold contracts explicitly with the central government would not be provided with isds protection by limiting isds to this narrow list of sectors the usmca is determining which types of investment are allowed to succeed in mexico and which are not heritage foundation experts have long advocated for the inclusion of isds protections in trade agreements a neutral and independent isds arbitration process ensures that americans are guaranteed fair treatment an especially important consideration for investments in developing countries unlike canada mexico is still a developing country as such and as the heritage foundation s index of economic freedom reports every year ref robust and transparent rule of law in mexico is still a work in progress in fact mexico has made relatively little progress to strengthen rule of law in the 25 years since transparency international began its annual corruption perceptions index in 1995 ref isds also provides access to binding arbitration for investors from other countries who are dissatisfied with the relief available to them in u s courts ref while the retention of isds provisions with regard to some u s investments in mexico is an important and positive element of the usmca isds protection should be extended to all investments in mexico chapter 14 should also extend isds protection to all investments in canada chapter 15 cross border trade in services chapter 15 of the usmca addresses the processes for trading services between the united states canada and mexico this was previously chapter 12 part 5 of nafta a few areas are the same scope national treatment and mfn treatment the differences lie in modernization expanding market access for labor in the services industry and cultural protections this chapter does not cover the treatment of financial services government procurement and services supplied in the exercise of government authority subsidies or air services article 15 5 market access this article requires that there should be no limitations imposed on the number of service suppliers the total value of service transactions the total number of service operations or the total quantity of service output the total number of natural persons that may be employed in a particular service sector or by a quota for the number of people a supplier may employ or the requirement of an economic needs test parties also cannot restrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which a service supplier must supply a service ref article 15 9 recognition the allowance for the parties to recognize authorization licensing or certification of a service supplier is a positive provision the agreement states that any party may recognize any education or experience obtained requirements met or licenses or certifications granted in the territory of another party or non party ref if a party does recognize the education requirements met or licenses or certifications granted that party may do so autonomously or by agreement or arrangement and does not have to accord the recognition in territory of any other party ref this is expanded upon in annex 15 c professional services the idea of recognition is positive and will make movement of labor and trade facilitation in professional services easier however since the recognition is not a requirement of the agreement it is unclear to what extent it will be utilized therefore its value is ambiguous article 15 12 payments and transfers this article addresses the financial transaction aspect that relates to cross border supply of services each party must permit all transfers and payments that related to the cross border supply of services to be made freely and without delay into and out of its territory ref it is also required that the transfers and payments be made in a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange that prevails at the time of transfer it is unclear what freely usable currency means it could be assumed that payments will be made the same way that trade in goods is and that pesos dollars and canadian dollars are all freely usable currencies it also provides protections for certain legal issues a party may prevent or delay a transfer or payment through the application of its laws that relate to a bankruptcy insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors b issuing trading or dealing in securities or derivatives c financial reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory authorities d criminal or penal offenses or e ensuring compliance with orders or judgments in judicial or administrative proceedings ref this is important for sovereignty which creates certainty about which laws apply in particular legal cases essentially it provides protections for citizens or firms to not have to pay for services if they are not required to under the law of the appropriate party it seems that this will depend on the origination of the payment or transfer annex 15 a delivery services the annex does not apply to maritime internal waterway air rail or road transportation including cabotage and focuses on postal delivery services ref it seems to apply to the national postal services of the parties as it mainly discusses postal monopolies which are defined as the exclusive right accorded to an operator within a party s territory to supply specified delivery services pursuant to a measure of the party ref parties are not permitted to use revenues derived from the supply of postal services to cross subsidize the supply of a delivery service not covered by the postal monopoly there are also provisions that prevent discrimination and require transparency including provisions on abuse of monopoly power with respect to the supply of delivery services outside of the postal monopoly which must comply with article 14 4 of the investment chapter articles 15 3 and 15 5 of this chapter it seems that the purpose of this annex is to ensure that parties cannot require the use of their postal services when trading this is a positive rule as it reduces the potential barriers that could be imposed by a national postal authority which should help foster trade facilitation annex 15 b committee on transportation services the creation of a committee for transportation services is required and lays out the powers and purpose of the committee it is unclear how this committee will facilitate trade it is possible that value could be added as the committee will be specialized and at a somewhat more local level than a party government or an international body however it is also possible that this committee will be unproductive and a waste of resources annex 15 d simultaneous substitution this annex states that canada must rescind its broadcasting regulatory policy crtc 2016 334 and broadcasting order crtc 2016 335 the rule had prohibited canadian cable and satellite companies showing the super bowl from blocking u s television signals transmitting the super bowl ref the aim of removing the rule is cultural protection for canada simultaneous substitution of u s signals was last permitted in 2016 simultaneous substitution requires cable television and direct broadcast satellite and it requires iptv and mmds television distribution companies in canada to distribute the signal of a local or regional over the air station in place of the signal of a foreign or non local television station when the two stations are broadcasting the same programming simultaneously the equivalent u s practice is called syndicate exclusivity rescinding the rule will allow canadians to reach their consumers but canada may not accord the program treatment less favorable than the treatment accorded to other programs originating in the united states retransmitted in canada ref in theory this removal will not be exactly like simultaneous substitution as all programs must be treated equally it could also mean that canada could completely drop simultaneous substitution but not for an individual program ref bell media a canadian mass media subsidiary of bell canada enterprises and the nfl were originally critics of the crtc ruling and appealed against the decision in 2017 crtc argued that although it is the nfl s right as a copyright holder to license its program to bell it is not the nfl s right that the program will be simultaneously substituted this is a benefit conferred by canada s broadcasting regulatory regime ref the rescinding of the ruling in the usmca means that canada can now use simultaneous substitution which will allow the nfl to sell licenses to bell media so that the super bowl can be shown on ctv but american ads will be blocked in favor of local or regional advertisements allowing the super bowl ads to play did not facilitate trade directly but it is possible that it facilitated trade by exposing canadians to more american products which increases their choice rescinding the ruling does not facilitate trade it may create more competition within the canadian market the allowance for the nfl to license to bell media seems to be positive but overall the ruling and the rescinding of the ruling is not supportive of trade the u s and canada should perhaps address rules that make it easier for u s companies to sell advertisements in canada and vice versa in order to facilitate trade so that consumers in both countries can benefit from a greater variety of goods and services however the other provision of annex 15 d states that canada must allow u s teleshopping services to enter the canadian market and be delivered by canadian cable satellite and iptv providers without restriction ref this seems to be positive as it will open up the market in this area between the united states and canada and will expose canadians to a greater variety of goods annex 15 e mexico s cultural exceptions mexico relies on its cultural industries and negotiated for a cultural exceptions annex similar to canada s this annex addresses broadcasting radio and free to air television newspaper publishing cinema services and audiovisual services mexico set out provisions that allow foreign investment up to 49 percent in concessionaire enterprises providing broadcasting services and sole concessions and frequency band concessions may only be granted to mexican nationals and enterprises ref concessions will also be granted for indigenous social use in order to promote develop and preserve languages culture knowledge traditions identity and their internal rules that under principle of gender equality enable the integration of indigenous women in the accomplishment of the purposes for which the concession is granted ref it is also forbidden that a concession facility auxiliary services offices or accessories or property be transferred in any way to any foreign government or state ref similarly to canada mexico requires that local and national programming be given priority over foreign programming and more time covered by mexicans must be shown with regard to newspaper and cinema services foreign ownership is only allowed up to 49 percent for newspaper and for cinema services exhibitors may only reserve 10 percent of the total screen time to the projection of national films ref the limitations on investment do not facilitate trade and create burdensome rules for businesses and investors individuals and businesses should be granted the freedom to invest in what they see as beneficial the attractiveness of a country for investors is a sign of the health of an economy foreign direct investment is a driving factor in increasing standards of living restricting the amount of investment could hurt mexico s economy since it reduces opportunities and creates uncertainty this could harm mexican citizens since investment is important for development mexico will only make limited commitments with respect to the market access obligation for audiovisual services in order to promote and protect the values of the nation the cultural provisions of canada and mexico limit market access which does not facilitate trade it harms businesses and consumers in all three nations chapter 16 temporary entry for business persons the usmcaref appears to make no significant changes to nafta s chapter 16ref on temporary entry for business persons under usmca and nafta temporary entry means entry into the territory of a party by a business person of another party without the intent to establish permanent residence ref there are four categories of business people covered under the chapter business visitors traders and investors intra company transferees and professionals regarding the professional category canadian and mexican citizens not permanent residents will still be able to enter the united states in order to

restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower profit from financial products financial products operating profit was lower primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses which was mostly driven by a 72 million unfavorable impact from an increase in allowance rate and an increase in write offs of 13 million due to continued weakening in the

reconciliation of significant items impacting 2018 and 2017 adjusted profit a in order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items restructuring costs in recent years we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure during 2018 we incurred 386 million of restructuring costs during 2017 we incurred 1 256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium mark to market losses we recognize actuarial gains and losses for our pension and opeb plans as a mark to market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time for 2018 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 495 million primarily due to lower than expected returns on plan assets partially offset by higher interest rates for 2017 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 301 million primarily due to lower interest rates and a change in mortality assumptions partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments based on improved profits in the united states we recognized a non cash benefit of 63 million and 111 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively to reduce the valuation allowance against u s state deferred tax assets during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a non cash charge of 59 million to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for prior years u s tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a 2 371 billion charge due to the enactment of u s tax reform legislation in december 2017 the provisionally estimated charge included a 596 million write down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a 154 million reduction to the estimated charge for the write down in net deferred tax assets this reduction was primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of 1 0 billion to u s pension plans treated as deductible on the 2017 u s tax return during the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a 50 million increase to the estimated charge for the cost of mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings a reconciliation of these items can be

today we present a guest post written by jeffrey frankel harpel professor at harvard s kennedy school of government and formerly a member of the white house council of economic advisers a shorter version appeared in project syndicate on january 26th in europe twenty years ago this month 11 long standing national currencies disappeared and were replaced by the new single currency the euro since then the euro has had its successes and failures let us review the experience of the euro s first two decades where there were failures to what extent were they the result of avoidable technical mistakes of warnings not heeded or were they the inevitable result of a determination to go ahead with monetary union in the absence of a political willingness to support fundamental changes necessary to make it work three early successes three early successes are insufficiently remembered first the transition from individual currencies to the euro in january 1999 went very smoothly it was not obvious ahead of time that this would necessarily be the case recall the european currency crises of 1992 and 1993 or more recent chaotic demonetizations elsewhere second the euro instantly became the world s 2 international currency by virtually all measures of international use third the incentive of being admitted to the club led to favorable reforms in many aspiring member countries particularly countries in central and eastern europe that joined subsequently to 2002 seven failures there have been perhaps more failures than successes consider seven failures first was the problem of asymmetric or unsynchronized shocks many american economists in particular had warned beforehand that european economies lacked cyclical synchronization and the other key criteria for a group of countries to constitute an optimum currency area it is much easier to give up monetary independence if your economy s needs are correlated with those of the countries that will be setting your monetary policy it is also easier if you have alternative means of adjusting to shocks such as if workers can move between regions or if cross union fiscal transfers can cushion local impacts european countries lacked these alternative mechanisms of adjustment compared for example to the 50 us states which share a common currency the warnings proved accurate to take one example the irish in 2004 06 needed a tighter monetary policy than the european central bank was prepared to set because they were experiencing a housing bubble and economic overheating but of course they had given up the ability to revalue their currency or raise their interest rate conversely during 2009 2013 ireland needed an easier monetary policy than the ecb was prepared to set because it was in steep recession but it had given up the ability to devalue print money or lower its interest rate second were the large current account deficits of the periphery countries during the euro s first decade at the time large net capital flows to the periphery were viewed as a sign of efficiency improving financial integration in retrospect the imbalances were less benign attributable in part to a rise in the periphery s unit labor costs relative to germany s the third failure was high budget deficits and debt levels in some countries with greece as the most extreme example the problem of moral hazard in national fiscal policy i e the problem that fiscal discipline is eroded by the belief that the country would be bailed out in the event of a crisis had not featured prominently in academic research the academic emphasis had instead been on the optimum currency area criteria but pushed by german taxpayers who were worried that they would eventually be asked to bail out some profligate mediterranean country the european architects of monetary union correctly identified fiscal moral hazard as a central vulnerability to their credit they tried hard to address the problem they adopted 1 the maastricht fiscal criteria including the requirement that countries must get their budget deficits below 3 of gdp 2 the so called no bail out clause and 3 later the stability and growth pact which made the fiscal requirements permanent the fiscal rules proved un enforceable in practice however virtually all euro members soon violated the 3 deficit rule including even germany governments repeatedly claimed that fiscal targets would be met in the future assertions that could only be maintained via systematically over optimistic growth forecasts officials during the first decade never forecast that they would have a budget deficit in excess of 3 of gdp even though they often ran such deficits in successive years when the deficits did come in over the limit the leaders could than attribute the shortfall to unexpected negative shocks fourth when periphery governments were suddenly able to borrow at miniscule sovereign spreads in 1999 relative to german interest rates it was interpreted as good news that the high debt countries did not have to pay penalty interest rates as indebted us states like illinois have to do should instead have been interpreted as a signal that the moral hazard problem had not been solved after all many have labeled it a fatal failure not to have moved more of the function of fiscal policy to the supra national level a failing that became clear in the euro crisis and is as troublesome in italy today as it was in periphery countries in 2010 the same applies to banking regulation a few european economists flagged correctly the need for pan euro banking regulation if the project were to be successful but that warning was ignored it is perhaps not fair to label these as mistakes since political opposition to federalizing these functions would have been overwhelming in the 1990s as it still is today in some other areas however the leaders really did score own goals the ecb mistakenly raised interest rates in july 2008 and again twice in 2011 despite the global recession when the greek crisis emerged at the beginning of 2010 european leaders did not handle it well they might have been able to contain the forest fire instead it spread mistake 1 was the failure to send greece to the imf promptly brussels and frankfurt thought that the history of em crises was not relevant to a euro member mistake 2 was a refusal to write down greek debt quickly enough despite debt sustainability analysis showing the debt gdp path to be explosive even with stringent fiscal austerity mistake 1 was the failure to send greece to the imf promptly brussels and frankfurt thought that the history of em crises was not relevant to a euro member mistake 2 was a refusal to write down greek debt quickly enough despite debt sustainability analysis showing the debt gdp path to be explosive even with stringent fiscal austerity the post 2009 emphasis on austerity applied especially to greece but to other countries as well was a major mistake more specifically the troika eu commission ecb and imf in 2010 under estimated the fall in income that would follow from fiscal austerity in the periphery countries even leaving aside the economic cost of the recession and the political cost of associated populist anger fiscal austerity did not achieve its financial goal of putting greece and the others onto sustainable debt paths to the contrary the fall in gdp was greater than any fall in debt with the result that debt gdp ratios rose at accelerated rates failures 3 and 7 together add up to a history of pro cyclicality in fiscal policy the combination of high spending in 2001 2007 and austerity in 2010 2018 made greek fiscal policy one of the most highly pro cyclical of countries in the world government spending in other periphery countries too has shown positive cyclical correlations fiscal pro cyclicality of course exacerbates the amplitude of the business cycle three more successes one can conclude more optimistically with three further observations on the success side of the ledger first some periphery countries particularly spain have gradually managed via painful recessions to bring their previously uncompetitive unit labor costs back down second ecb president mario draghi warrants top marks for successfully walking the tightrope between the german need for discipline and the mediterranean need for accommodation most famously for the july 2012 press conference that contained the immortal sentence that the ecb was ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro it worked the euro survived the crisis with all 19 members intact contrary to some predictions in 2010 that greece for one would have to drop out draghi will be hard to replace when his term expires this october third opinion polls in recent years show the euro to have achieved high popularity supported by 64 of the public as of november 2018 so there is hope after all this post written by jeffrey frankel

million for third quarter 2018 the increase in net interest income from the previous year was primarily due to increased average earning assets resulting from organic growth and the acquisition of integrity bancshares as well as overall higher interest rates due to a rising rate environment the increase from the linked quarter is primarily a result of organic loan growth during the fourth quarter 2018 liquid assets were redeployed to loans and total growth was limited as part of plan to maintain assets below 10 billion the average balance of total interest earning assets grew by 1 2 billion and totaled 8 7 billion at december 31 2018 compared to 7 5 billion at december 31 2017 and was unchanged compared to september 30 2018 the increase from the prior year was due primarily to organic growth as well as 718 9 million in earning assets acquired in the integrity transaction the yield on interest earning assets was 5 15 for fourth quarter 2018 compared to 4 61 for fourth quarter 2017 and 4 99 for third quarter 2018 the increase from the prior year and linked quarter was due primarily to higher rates on interest earning assets due to continued increases in the fed funds rate during these periods in addition the increase was due to a shift in the earning asset mix from interest bearing deposits to higher yielding loans and taxable securities the cost of interest bearing liabilities including borrowings was 1 64 for fourth quarter 2018 compared to 0 89 for fourth quarter 2017 and 1 47 for third quarter 2018 the increases from the prior year and linked quarter were primarily due to higher rates offered on our deposits primarily commercial money market accounts and certificates of deposit resulting both from market competition and general increases in interest rates on deposit products tied to fed funds rates in addition rate increases on short term fhlb advances and junior subordinated debt impacted interest expense the net interest margin was 3 98 for fourth quarter 2018 compared to 3 97 for fourth quarter 2017 and 3 94 for third quarter 2018 the adjusted non gaap net interest margin which excludes purchased loan accretion was 3 93 for fourth quarter 2018 compared to 3 84 for fourth quarter 2017 and 3 89 for third quarter 2018 the increase in the net interest margin from the prior year and linked quarter was primarily due to the multiple increases in the fed funds target rate as well as earning assets shifting from cash to loans noninterest income total noninterest income decreased 3 7 million compared to fourth quarter 2017 and decreased 2 9 million compared to third quarter 2018 the decrease from the prior year primarily reflects decreases of 3 0 million in gain on sale of nine colorado branches and 1 0 million in gain on sale of repossessed assets offset by an increase of 445 thousand in other noninterest income primarily an increase in correspondent bank earnings credit of 359 thousand the decrease from the linked quarter primarily reflects decreases of 1 7 million in mortgage banking revenue and 792 thousand in other noninterest income primarily resulting from decreases in merchant income of 184 thousand swap dealer income of 125 thousand and acquired loan recoveries of 121 thousand the bank recorded 1 6 million of income related to the mortgage hedging strategy in third quarter 2018 compared to 394 thousand in fourth quarter 2018 noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased 2 3 million compared to fourth quarter 2017 and decreased 807 thousand compared to third quarter 2018 the increase in expense compared to fourth quarter 2017 is due primarily to increases of 3 5 million in salaries and benefits 811 thousand in occupancy expenses 745 thousand in data processing and 1 7 million in other noninterest expense offset by a decrease of 4 2 million in acquisition expenses the overall increase in salaries and benefits occupancy and data processing from the prior year is reflective of additional headcount branch locations and accounts acquired in the integrity acquisition as well as organic growth during the year the increase in other noninterest expense is primarily due to higher deposit and loan related expenses for the year over year period fourth quarter 2017 acquisition expenses were elevated due to professional fees and contract termination fees conversion expenses and branch restructuring expenses incurred relating to the 2017 carlile acquisition the decrease from the linked quarter is primarily related to decreases of 1 2 million in acquisition expenses and 489 thousand in salaries and benefits offset by an increase of 824 thousand in other noninterest expense acquisition expense was elevated in the linked quarter primarily due to professional fees and conversion related expenses related to the integrity transaction and professional fees related to the pending guaranty transaction salaries and benefits expense was elevated in

for fourth quarter 2017 and an increase of 1 4 million compared to 1 5 million for third quarter 2018 provision expense is primarily reflective of organic loan growth as well as charge offs or

december 31 2017 and compared to 42 2 million or 0 56 of total loans at september 30 2018 the dollar increases from prior periods are primarily due to additional general reserves for organic loan growth in addition the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans from prior year reflects that loans acquired in the integrity transaction were recorded at fair value without an allowance at acquisition date income taxes federal income tax expense of 8 3 million was recorded for the quarter ended december 31 2018 an effective rate of 19 6 compared to tax expense of 18 2

third and fourth quarter 2018 is primarily due to the reduction of the corporate u s statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 as a result of the tcja the higher tax rate in fourth quarter 2017 was primarily due to a 5 5 million charge to remeasure deferred taxes as a result of the enactment of the tcja fourth quarter 2018 balance sheet highlights loans total loans held for investment net of

as may be required by law non gaap financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with gaap this press release contains certain non gaap financial measures these measures and ratios include adjusted net income adjusted earnings tangible book value tangible book value per common share adjusted efficiency ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets adjusted net interest margin return on tangible equity adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average equity and are supplemental measures that are not required by or are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we consider the use of select non gaap financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial operational decision making and useful in evaluating period to period comparisons we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non gaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting analyzing and comparing past present and future periods we believe that these measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with gaap however we acknowledge that our financial measures have a number of limitations relative to gaap financial measures certain non gaap financial measures exclude items of income expenditures expenses assets or liabilities including provisions for loan losses and the effect of goodwill core deposit intangibles and income from accretion on acquired loans arising from purchase accounting adjustments that we believe cause certain aspects of our results of operations or financial condition to be not indicative of our primary operating results all of these items significantly impact our financial statements additionally the items that we exclude in our adjustments are not necessarily consistent with the items that our peers may exclude from their results of operations and key financial measures and therefore may limit the comparability of similarly named financial measures and ratios we compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent gaap measures whenever we present the non gaap financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non gaap financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures is included at the end of the financial statements tables contacts analysts investors michelle hickox executive vice president and chief

million for third quarter 2018 the increase in net interest income from the previous year was primarily due to increased average earning assets resulting from organic growth and the acquisition of integrity bancshares as well as overall higher interest rates due to a rising rate environment the increase from the linked quarter is primarily a result of organic loan growth during the fourth quarter 2018 liquid assets were redeployed to loans and total growth was limited as part of plan to maintain assets below 10 billion the average balance of total interest earning assets grew by 1 2 billion and totaled 8 7 billion at december 31 2018 compared to 7 5 billion at december 31 2017 and was unchanged compared to september 30 2018 the increase from the prior year was due primarily to organic growth as well as 718 9 million in earning assets acquired in the integrity transaction the yield on interest earning assets was 5 15 for fourth quarter 2018 compared to 4 61 for fourth quarter 2017 and 4 99 for third quarter 2018 the increase from the prior year and linked quarter was due primarily to higher rates on interest earning assets due to continued increases in the fed funds rate during these periods in addition the increase was due to a shift in the earning asset mix from interest bearing deposits to higher yielding loans and taxable securities the cost of interest bearing liabilities including borrowings was 1 64 for fourth quarter 2018 compared to 0 89 for fourth quarter 2017 and 1 47 for third quarter 2018 the increases from the prior year and linked quarter were primarily due to higher rates offered on our deposits primarily commercial money market accounts and certificates of deposit resulting both from market competition and general increases in interest rates on deposit products tied to fed funds rates in addition rate increases on short term fhlb advances and junior subordinated debt impacted interest expense the net interest margin was 3 98 for fourth quarter 2018 compared to 3 97 for fourth quarter 2017 and 3 94 for third quarter 2018 the adjusted non gaap net interest margin which excludes purchased loan accretion was 3 93 for fourth quarter 2018 compared to 3 84 for fourth quarter 2017 and 3 89 for third quarter 2018 the increase in the net interest margin from the prior year and linked quarter was primarily due to the multiple increases in the fed funds target rate as well as earning assets shifting from cash to loans noninterest income total noninterest income decreased 3 7 million compared to fourth quarter 2017 and decreased 2 9 million compared to third quarter 2018 the decrease from the prior year primarily reflects decreases of 3 0 million in gain on sale of nine colorado branches and 1 0 million in gain on sale of repossessed assets offset by an increase of 445 thousand in other noninterest income primarily an increase in correspondent bank earnings credit of 359 thousand the decrease from the linked quarter primarily reflects decreases of 1 7 million in mortgage banking revenue and 792 thousand in other noninterest income primarily resulting from decreases in merchant income of 184 thousand swap dealer income of 125 thousand and acquired loan recoveries of 121 thousand the bank recorded 1 6 million of income related to the mortgage hedging strategy in third quarter 2018 compared to 394 thousand in fourth quarter 2018 noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased 2 3 million compared to fourth quarter 2017 and decreased 807 thousand compared to third quarter 2018 the increase in expense compared to fourth quarter 2017 is due primarily to increases of 3 5 million in salaries and benefits 811 thousand in occupancy expenses 745 thousand in data processing and 1 7 million in other noninterest expense offset by a decrease of 4 2 million in acquisition expenses the overall increase in salaries and benefits occupancy and data processing from the prior year is reflective of additional headcount branch locations and accounts acquired in the integrity acquisition as well as organic growth during the year the increase in other noninterest expense is primarily due to higher deposit and loan related expenses for the year over year period fourth quarter 2017 acquisition expenses were elevated due to professional fees and contract termination fees conversion expenses and branch restructuring expenses incurred relating to the 2017 carlile acquisition the decrease from the linked quarter is primarily related to decreases of 1 2 million in acquisition expenses and 489 thousand in salaries and benefits offset by an increase of 824 thousand in other noninterest expense acquisition expense was elevated in the linked quarter primarily due to professional fees and conversion related expenses related to the integrity transaction and professional fees related to the pending guaranty transaction salaries and benefits expense was elevated in

for fourth quarter 2017 and an increase of 1 4 million compared to 1 5 million for third quarter 2018 provision expense is primarily reflective of organic loan growth as well as charge offs or

december 31 2017 and compared to 42 2 million or 0 56 of total loans at september 30 2018 the dollar increases from prior periods are primarily due to additional general reserves for organic loan growth in addition the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans from prior year reflects that loans acquired in the integrity transaction were recorded at fair value without an allowance at acquisition date income taxes federal income tax expense of 8 3 million was recorded for the quarter ended december 31 2018 an effective rate of 19 6 compared to tax expense of 18 2

third and fourth quarter 2018 is primarily due to the reduction of the corporate u s statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 as a result of the tcja the higher tax rate in fourth quarter 2017 was primarily due to a 5 5 million charge to remeasure deferred taxes as a result of the enactment of the tcja fourth quarter 2018 balance sheet highlights loans total loans held for investment net of

were 0 01 annualized in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 0 14 annualized in the linked quarter and 0 02 annualized in the prior year quarter charge offs were elevated in the linked quarter

include adjusted net income adjusted earnings tangible book value tangible book value per common share adjusted efficiency ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets adjusted net interest margin return on tangible equity adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average equity and are supplemental measures that are not required by or are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we consider the use of select non gaap financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial operational decision making and useful in evaluating period to period comparisons we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non gaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting analyzing and comparing past present and future periods we believe that these measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with gaap however we acknowledge that our financial measures have a number of limitations relative to gaap financial measures certain non gaap financial measures exclude items of income expenditures expenses assets or liabilities including provisions for loan losses and the effect of goodwill core deposit intangibles and income from accretion on acquired loans arising from purchase accounting adjustments that we believe cause certain aspects of our results of operations or financial condition to be not indicative of our primary operating results all of these items significantly impact our financial statements additionally the items that we exclude in our adjustments are not necessarily consistent with the items that our peers may exclude from their results of operations and key financial measures and therefore may limit the comparability of similarly named financial measures and ratios we compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent gaap measures whenever we present the non gaap financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non gaap financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures is included at the end of the financial statements tables contacts analysts investors michelle hickox executive vice president and chief

executive summary u s markets outperformed emerging markets with ease in the last five years and investors have lost their confidence in investing in emerging markets in addition to this outperformance of u s markets in the last several years future prospects of emerging markets are not attractive as seen by many investors this has prevented many investors from investing in emerging markets in the recent past and the trend is set to continue s p 500 vs msci emerging market index performance in the last 5 years source â financial times however despite the broad negativity surrounding emerging markets i believe the time is right to invest in these markets not only are these markets trading in significantly undervalued territory emerging markets provide investors with much needed diversification benefits despite the underperformance in the last 05 years emerging markets have outperformed the rest of the world including u s markets since the beginning of this century source â stansberry not only have emerging markets provided investors with superior returns over this 20 year period these returns are acceptable from a riskâ adjusted basis as well source â city a m as a starting point to this analysis the reasons behind the outperformance of u s markets in the last few years will be discussed thereafter the focus would be on identifying whether the macro economic environment is favorably changing toward emerging markets as the last step of the analysis the expected benefits of investing in emerging markets would be discussed why did emerging markets underperform the underperformance of emerging markets can be attributed to a number of reasons and these should be identified and discussed to understand where we stand in the investment cycle source â total wealth management the stage of the market cycle plays a major role in determining how profitable an investment is and the level of risk an investor would be exposed to more often than not the maximum level of financial opportunity exists when things are looking the worst currently things are certainly looking not good for emerging markets on the outset which is why investors need to dig deep to undercover opportunities that might not be visible at first quantitative easing program in the u s the quantitative easing qe program launched by the fed during the financial crisis was a clear driver of u s markets and lasted many years before coming to an end in 2015 the qe program resulted in low interest rates and an improved optimism about future prospects of the u s economy which led market participants to get back to investing in stocks despite massive losses seen during the financial crisis this renewed interest in u s equity markets drove u s markets higher at a faster clip than emerging markets timeline of the qe program source â forbes fed rate hikes in the last 3 years fed rate hikes have not only sparked concerns among the investing community in the u s but have also limited the ability of emerging countries to borrow from dollar denominated markets this has certainly restricted emerging market companiesâ access to readily available capital source â trading economics on the other hand institutional and professional investors have continued to pull capital from emerging markets to invest in safe heaven assets this continued outflow of capital from emerging markets led to massive sell offs and investorsâ trust toward emerging markets continued to deteriorate source â business insider rising u s dollar on the back of monetary policy tightening over the last 3 years the u s dollar has regained some of its lost momentum and has strengthened considerably against emerging market currencies a rising dollar not only limits the ability of emerging countries to assume u s dollar denominated debt it increases the credit risk of most of these countries as the dollar continued to rise emerging markets found it difficult to service their dollar denominated debt which provided another reason for investors to go short emerging market securities below chart of the u s dollar index provides a clue as to how the dollar has appreciated against its peers source â business insider over the last decade major emerging countries have become more sensitive to u s dollar appreciation and this has increased the credit risk of these countries dramatically source â business insider in order to better understand the countries that would be hurt badly by an appreciation of the u s dollar we can take a look at the below chart economies that are seen as highly vulnerable to u s dollar appreciations source â investopedia trade war tensions trade tensions between the two largest economic in the world the u s and china increased incredibly over the last year which resulted in tit for tat implementation of tariffs by both these countries tariffs imposed on china are hurting other neighboring countries as well since china is one of the most important trade partners of these countries a slowdown in chinese economy will adversely impact surrounding east asian countries as well and this will flow through to other emerging countries around the world naturally investor confidence reached new lows with the escalating trade war which resulted in reduced activities in emerging securities markets why emerging markets are looking attractive the dollar is pausing its climb as the fed is becoming dovish as we discussed in the earlier segment fed rate hikes were instrumental to the u s dollar appreciation over the last few years however things are on the brink of change and the fed chair has made clear remarks on a possible slowdown of rate hikes in 2019 below results from a reuters survey confirms that the majority of economists who participated in the survey believe rates would increase at a slower pace than previously believed source â reuters guggenheim on the other hand believes that thereâ s a 50 probability of a rate cut in 2019 which would be a massive boost to not only u s equity markets but also for emerging markets that are already under pressure from a strong dollar as the dollar is expected to become weaker than previously expected in 2019 i believe this brightens the outlook for emerging market performance this year stock markets are considered lead indicators of economic conditions and i expect emerging markets to rally well before the dollar weakens meaningfully a weakening dollar will boost investor confidence which in return will lead to gains in these markets below chart from confluence investment management plots the historical performance of emerging markets against movements of the u s dollar not surprisingly emerging markets have rallied when the dollar was weakening and vice versa source â confluence investment management economic growth in the u s is expected to slow down and corporate earnings are near their peak there has been a lot of talk about a possible recession in the u s which i believe is a distant reality at this point in time but the exceptional growth in the economy might slowdown in 2019 the positive impact that stemmed from the tax reforms in 2017 are starting to fade out and interest rates have risen throughout last year which is expected to tighten the spending of u s corporates the trade war will probably hinder growth prospects in the first quarter of 2019 as well as the two largest economies are continuously failing to find some middle ground regarding future trade activities the federal open market committee is expecting a significant slowdown in the gdp growth rate in 2019 â from 3 in 2018 to 2 3 in 2019 which would prompt investors to look for other regions that are expected to grow at a faster rate source â federal reserve as the u s economy slows down in the coming years u s stock markets will retrieve from rich valuations to settle for lower expected earnings growth at the same time emerging markets will provide better value for money as these countries continue to grow at a much higher clip than the u s does this renewed interest in emerging markets will result in capital inflows to major emerging markets which is expected to drive such markets higher expected gdp growth â the u s vs emerging markets source â lazard emerging markets as a diversification tool emerging markets should not only be considered as an asset class that is expected to provide superior returns over an extended period of time but also as a portfolio diversification tool this thesis can be backed by several facts emerging market valuations are looking attractive historically emerging market returns and s p 500 returns have shown cyclical patterns emerging countries are expected to grow at a faster clip than developed markets and these countries are intrinsically different from developed countries below table provides an insight into the cyclical nature of emerging market returns in comparison with s p 500 returns source â a wealth of common sense trade tensions are set to cool down even though no clear conclusion can be drawn from the recent developments with regard to the trade war between the u s and china officials from both parties have stressed the importance of signing a trade deal at the earliest which would be important to secure long term growth prospects of both the countries the first positive move came in december when both parties agreed to a 90 day tariff ceasefire earlier this month china offered to boost imports from the u s by over 1 trillion during a 6 year period which is another step taken by the chinese government to cease further escalation of the trade war between the two most powerful economies in the world despite the clouds hanging over a successful implementation of a trade deal i believe such a trade deal will soon be finalized as both these parties are well aware of the undesired consequences of a failure to do so while the american presidentâ s protectionist trade policies have cast doubts in investorsâ minds along with his aggressiveness in pursuing economic deals i still believe the trade war will come to an end with a favorable result for both u s and the world economy attractive valuations as with any other market emerging market stocks are expected to follow their respective company earnings and a divergence from this can provide investors with an attractive investment opportunity even though emerging countries have continued to grow their gdps at a stellar rate more recently the equity market performance has diverged from the underlying growth of these economies this divergence is creating opportunities in my opinion especially as the macro economic environment is becoming increasingly favorable for these countries source â axa on the other hand emerging markets are associated with rich valuation multiples partly due to the high growth expectations however tables have turned and emerging markets are trading well below their average price to book ratio which provides investors with an additional layer of safety when investing in emerging markets price to book well below the average source â schroders not only are emerging markets trading below their average price to book multiple these markets are trading at a forward price to earnings multiple of just 11 which is the lowest seen in almost 6 years this is despite the improving outlook for emerging markets and at present both world markets and emerging markets are providing a similar level of return on equity for investors source â yardeni research source â legg mason to summarize emerging markets are trading well below their average price to book multiple return on equity roe is on par with rest of the world and are trading at 6 year low price to earnings multiples which all supports the thesis that these markets are now providing value to investors where to look for bargains in emerging markets earlier segments of this analysis established the fact that emerging markets are likely to outperform u s markets in 2019 however emerging countries have intrinsic characteristics which make them unique from one another and hence not every country will provide the same expected return to investors china still remains one of the emerging countries that is expected to provide attractive returns to investors in the long run and the recent stimulus activities are paving the way for china to gain some lost ground analysts believe that china could pump in close to 300 billion to the economy by way of tax cuts and bond issues these measures will not only help chinese companies but will also boost investor confidence even with such stimulating activities china might not be the region to experience the highest rate of growth in the next few years in fact the 10 fastest growing cities through 2035 are all in india an oxford university study reveals despite lowering its expected growth rate india remains the fastest growing economy as per the international monetary fund imf investors need to factor in these data and assumptions to pick the right investment vehicle that would expose them to emerging countries that are expected to grow the fastest how can an investor play the expected growth in emerging markets there are many exchange traded funds etfs in the u s with a focus on emerging countries and these funds provide investors with the most cost efficient way to participate in the expected growth story of emerging markets for example investors can consider adding below securities to their portfolios to achieve diversification benefits and long term capital gains ishares msci india etf inda ishares msci emerging market index eem vanguard emerging market stock index fund vemax the focus of this analysis is to analyze whether there is potential for growth in emerging markets however when selecting securities for investments investors need to pay special attention to avoid funds with a high expense ratio and funds that concentrate on a select few countries despite being intended to cover a wide range of emerging markets risks of investing in emerging markets emerging markets are especially vulnerable to political uncertainty and these countries are known to have political woes from time to time which might distort return expectations of investors on the other hand currency risk remains one of the biggest risks of investing in emerging markets a depreciation of the local currency could wipe out returns in a matter of months if investors are directly invested in these countries on top of these concerns investing directly in emerging markets could expose investors to liquidity risk as well since emerging markets are by no means as liquid as developed markets however u s listed etfs provide a better investment vehicle for investors and address some but not all concerns related with investing in emerging markets conclusion u s markets have provided investors with superior returns in comparison with emerging markets in recent years but emerging markets have historically provided better returns over the long run even though emerging markets have remained under pressure for some time this should not stop investors from considering emerging markets for investment purposes valuations are looking attractive and the macro economic environment is starting to look brighter for emerging markets it s high time investors focus on emerging markets

as ukraine s march 2019 presidential election nears the kremlin has not masked its interest in the outcome indeed in november nearly five years after kyiv sanctioned russia for the annexation of crimea moscow finally decided to respond with retaliatory restrictions on ukraine s political and business elite weeks later russian coast guard vessels sparked the first ever direct clash between the two countries militaries by firing on a group of ukrainian ships off the coast of crimea as russia s annexation of crimea and the proxy war in the donbas remain the largest political issue among ukrainian voters the timing of moscow s escalations is not a coincidence over the past several years the kremlin has upped its efforts to influence democratic politics abroad backing eurosceptic anti immigrant and isolationist parties moscow has supported candidates of uncertainty the party or individual promising to upturn politics by rejecting the status quo in ukraine s presidential election former prime minister and current frontrunner yulia tymoshenko fits the mold campaigning on a new course for ukraine tymoshenko proffers uncertainty that may well jeopardize ukraine s interests and benefit its hostile neighbor to the east ukraine s obstacles ahead the kremlin s ideal outcome in the ukrainian presidential election is the one that advances its primary interest in the country hindering ukraine s further western integration currently two obstacles stand in the way of ukraine s euro atlantic path economic reforms and the separatist war in the country s east over the next two years ukraine faces 17 billion in debt repayments the country s current lifeline is a 3 9 billion agreement with the international monetary fund imf which in turn unlocks conditional financing from the european union and the world bank to receive imf funds however ukraine must implement reforms to improve macroeconomic stability the imf s terms include tightening contribution requirements for pensioners increasing heavily subsidized consumer gas prices approving a budget with less than a 2 3 percent deficit creating a credible anti corruption court and legalizing the sale of farmland the first three have seen progress while the latter two remain at a standstill although politically unpopular the imf mandated reforms are critical to keeping ukraine solvent indeed ukraine s previous 17 5 billion imf package ran its course with only 8 7 billion disbursed due to sluggish reform progress without cooperation with the imf ukraine would also not have received 3 3 billion euros in financial assistance from the eu the most eu aid ever offered to a non member state and 5 5 billion from the world bank since 2014 the fund s support an implicit guarantee that ukraine will not default on its debts further enabled kyiv to tap global capital markets raising 5 billion in eurobond issuances since 2014 beyond preventing a default reforms would also deepen relations with the eu to join the bloc ukraine must become a functioning market economy with stable macro economic fundamentals a welcoming business environment and strong labor and financial markets the eu will not lend to ukraine absent kyiv s cooperation with the imf let alone seriously consider a path toward accession regarding the war in the east ukraine will struggle to join western military or political economic institutions while a secessionist conflict simmers in the donbas and crimea remains occupied by russia article 5 of the north atlantic treaty organization requires member states come to an ally s aid in the event of an attack it would not be wise for the alliance to accept a new member already at war with one of the world s largest militaries as the experience of georgia promised a path to membership over ten years ago shows russian involvement in a country s frozen conflicts is a non starter for nato accession the eu s concept of the four freedoms free movement of goods capital services and labor within a common market is similarly troubled by disputed borders eu accession is ultimately possible for ukraine if the war in the donbas freezes cyprus accession as a divided island demonstrated such however effectively surrendering crimea and the donbas is not a viable option for kyiv to do so would not only be an act of domestic political suicide but would capitulate long established international norms in the face of aggression reintegrating the territories as part of a federal state is similarly disadvantageous federalism is the kremlin s preferred solution it would allow moscow to end the increasingly unpopular war in the donbas win sanctions relief and ease the financial burden of supporting two self proclaimed republics of course a federal ukraine would also grant the kremlin an avenue to influence its neighbor s politics on a national level there is no doubt that the kremlin would use this influence to advance its primary goal of preventing ukraine s western integration the status quo over the past five years ukraine has steadily bucked the kremlin s interests in these two areas the ukrainian government has been slow to implement economic reforms but it has made enough progress to keep an imf agreement alive and to negotiate a new aid package for 2019 despite fast approaching elections president petro poroshenko and his allies have pushed through several unpopular fiscal policies committing in september to a 23 5 percent increase in household gas prices and controversially voting in december to end the moratorium on agricultural land sales preventing a sovereign default by maintaining relations with the imf has been a key achievement of poroshenko s presidency once the political cycle ends in october 2019 following parliamentary elections the current administration will likely up the pace on the imf s long demanded reforms while ukraine s western backers have their frustrations with the poroshenko administration they know that with patience and stern phone calls from imf chairwoman christine lagarde kyiv will eventually push ahead in the donbas kyiv has given the kremlin little opening since the conclusion of the minsk ii agreements in february 2015 neither ukraine nor russia backed separatists have observed a ceasefire and withdrawn troops a necessary precondition for kyiv to pardon the leaders of the lugansk and donetsk people s republics support local elections and recognize the region s de facto autonomy in the ukrainian constitution while 2018 did see fresh discussion of deploying a un peacekeeping force to the donbas as an avenue to end the stalemate the proposal has led nowhere moscow wants to deploy a mission to the contact line unless kyiv obtains permission from the leaders of the donbas de jure illegitimate republics while kyiv insists that the force extend to the entire region including the ukrainian russian border ukraine s february 2018 integration law makes kyiv s current stance on the war clear russia is an aggressor and the donbas is an illegally occupied territory so long as the status quo continues there will be little room for the kremlin to extract beneficial concessions tymoshenko s platform on both the economic and security fronts tymoshenko offers uncertainty her populist campaign launched in june comprises two pillars a new course for ukraine and a new strategy for peace and security in some areas such as western oriented economic reforms tymoshenko s predisposition for change will likely play into the kremlin s hands in others such as the war in the donbas it remains to be seen either way the uncertainty presented by tymoshenko s anti establishment proposals offers the kremlin an opening to change the unfavorable status quo economically tymoshenko s new course means a departure from ukraine s imf program as currently conceived despite the former prime minister s strong pro eu and pro nato orientation anti imf sentiment has become cornerstone of her campaign she railed against the pension reform passed last october calling it a cynical ruthless deception of ukrainians and arguing that the minimum pension should be 100 euros rather than the current 42 in october she called the government s hike in household gas prices a genocide against the ukrainian people she promises gas prices will be three times lower if she is elected these tirades are popular but they spell trouble without committing to reforms ukraine will lose the support of the imf the organization keeping the country solvent of course tymoshenko s anti reform rhetoric may simply be political opposition candidates criticize the government they make promises to improve socio economic conditions and resist unpopular austerity measures indeed tymoshenko s 400 page economic plan does pay lip service to the need for continued cooperation with the imf however tymoshenko s track record shows a genuine disregard for measures intended to decentralize the ukrainian economy secure energy independence and boost government revenues not only has she consistently voted against the western oriented reform agenda over the past four years ranking 330 out of 423 ukrainian mps for her voting record but her time as prime minister revealed a willingness to flout imf demands to the detriment of the program in 2009 tymoshenko s government promised to hike gas prices by 20 percent to receive a 3 3 billion aid tranche months later she canceled the hike and effectively ended the imf s financial support it is not just tymoshenko s resistance to imf mandated reforms that worries western economic organizations at the heart of her economic plan are populist policies that threaten macroeconomic stability while reducing taxes for ordinary ukrainians by replacing income tax with a profit tax tymoshenko wants to increase public expenditures to develop industry infrastructure agriculture and high tech innovation centers she foresees fiscal stimulus deriving from cheap domestic credit and increased lending from multilateral development banks such as the international bank for reconstruction and development the international finance corporation the european investment bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development analysts have noted that tymoshenko s economic plan is heavily borrowed and contains numerous contradictions it is clear that she does not have a thought out plan for how she will finance the government or implement populist promises while maintaining macroeconomic stability this uncertainty is a detriment to ukraine s relationship with western economic institutions and thus will advance the kremlin s interests regarding the war in the east tymoshenko promises to overhaul the current diplomatic process as an opposition candidate her best argument for election is that poroshenko has failed to deliver on his promise to end the war recognizing that the minsk peace agreements helped limit the scope and intensity of the conflict tymoshenko asserts that it is time for ukraine to discuss new strategies at the center of tymoshenko s new strategy for peace and security is a proposal to revisit the 1994 budapest memorandum in which the united states united kingdom and russia offered ukraine security assurances in exchange for relinquishing the world s third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons the former prime minister proposes to renew discussions on the war within a broadened version of this diplomatic format to also include german french chinese and eu representatives through this arrangement tymoshenko believes she will not only be able to secure a peace deal but also restore relations with russia tymoshenko s peace plan otherwise lacks detail she is adamant that federalism is not an option for ukraine as it will only engender separatism and she insists that she will not accept peace on putin s terms however ukrainians are wary that tymoshenko may be too willing to cut a deal with the kremlin as a member of parliament since 2014 she did not vote to declare russia an aggressor country to demand the de occupation of the donbas or to revoke the 1997 russia ukraine friendship treaty similarly while prime minister in 2008 she refrained from commenting on the russo georgian war as the west uniformly condemned russian aggression tymoshenko is keeping her options open to play the role of an agile dealmaker and an agile dealmaker may be just what ukraine needs the war is becoming a frozen conflict while that is not the kremlin s ideal scenario it is a vastly better outcome for russia than for ukraine however renewing negotiations with moscow has major risks indeed tymoshenko has cut unfavorable deals with the kremlin before most notably the 2009 gas deal that led ukraine to pay more for gas than any other country in europe to end the war in order to get something from moscow kyiv must give something whatever that may be it could jeopardize the future of ukraine s western integration a tymoshenko presidency and the potential benefit to the kremlin is a danger to both ukraine s imf program and the war in the east it is hard to say what tymoshenko will do once elected kyiv has little bargaining power vis à vis the imf or the kremlin fresh ideas are of course essential for ukraine s political and economic modernization but it will be challenging for a tymoshenko administration to negotiate a better settlement on either and if things go poorly the downside risks the loss of western economic support or

technologies co ltd over alleged breaches over iranian sanctions meanwhile chinese representatives met with world trade organisation wto to begin the legal challenge against us imposed tariffs one chinese representative said this is a blatant breach of the united states obligations under the wto agreements and is posing a systemic challenge to the multilateral trading system responding the us official present accused china of damaging the world trading system by way of grossly unfair and trade distorting forced technology transfer policies and practices and through this unfounded dispute adding it is china and certainly not the united states that is threatening the overall viability of the wto system overall the signs don t bode well for amicable developments chief market strategist

president donald trump stated that the agreement was in no way a concession to democrats and speaking to the wall street journal wsj president trump reaffirmed his commitment to seeking border wall funding and hinted that he could even invoke emergency presidential powers to circumvent the democratic majority house of representatives while the news will be welcomed by the 800 000 furloughed federal employees the reopening of the government prompted a significant rebound in risk appetite weakening the greenback into the weekend and sparking the multi week lows against a basket of peers us china trade talks back in focus amid conflicting progress reports with one issue the government shutdown addressed for now at least market participant focus returned to the matters at hand namely the us china trade talks and the upcoming federal open market committee fomc federal funds rate monetary policy statement and press conference with regards to the us china trade dispute the nations have just over a month remaining in the 90 day ceasefire to reach an overarching trade deal should a deal not be reached by march 2nd the us intends to continue with their initial plan to hike tariffs on

rights ipr forced technology transfer and non tariff barriers head of fx strategy at ing chris turner commented unless there is a breakdown in negotiations we suspect the cautiously risk positive environment can continue which should favour higher yielding under valued emerging market currencies against the dollar fed expected to be non event as rates expectations remain muted wednesday s

press conference commenting on recent us dollar price action and investor expectations ahead of the fed heavy week currency strategist sim moh siong of the bank of singapore commented the general direction for the dollar is still down and markets will be taking cues from the fomc this week adding the fed will most likely keep rates steady this year given the state of economic growth outside the u s after four quarter base point hikes throughout 2018 growing concerns over the pace of us economic growth domestically as well as rising worries about the health of the global economy overall prompted a significant paring of federal rate expectations with institutional forecasts rapidly winding down forecasts from a further four 25 bps hikes in 2019 to one or two if any in their latest policy statement and subsequent speeches fomc members reaffirmed that the policy rate was no on a pre set path and going forward would become increasingly data dependent as the fed listen patiently to financial markets from the release fomc members felt they could afford to be patient about further policy firming ing s turner wrote wednesday s fomc meeting should support the view that the fed is gradually shifting away from forward guidance and into a data dependent approach to monetary policy adding the market is already pricing this in no hikes this year and a cut next year and if delivered should maintain the cautiously friendly environment for risk assets which has characterised january so far amid weak inflationary pressures while a significant portion of the greenback s depreciation in the year thus far has been attributed to market participant re pricing of reduced expectations for fed induced dollar support there is a risk markets the usd could be left significantly undervalued

photo john zangas dc media group two things stand out about the us coup in venezuela first it is unusually open typically the us tries to hide its coups second the coup is built on a series of obvious falsehoods yet the bi partisans in washington with a few exceptions keep repeating them first we will correct the falsehoods so readers are all working from the same facts second we will describe how this coup is being defeated it will be another major embarrassment for the trump administration and us foreign policy it is important to understand venezuela has become a geopolitical conflict as russia and china are closely allied with venezuela china and russia coming into the backyard of the united states challenges the antiquated monroe doctrine venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world and the second largest gold reserves as well as diamonds and other minerals such as coltan needed for electronic devices and venezuela is taking over as president of opec and will be in a position to push for oil payments in non dollar currencies or in cryptocurrencies a major threat to the us dollar a protest outside the united states consulate in sydney on january 23 to demand no us intervention in venezuela photo peter boyle correcting the record there are a series of false statements repeated by dc officials and corporate media to justify the coup that are so obvious it is hard to believe they are not intentional in his two paragraph comment on the coup even senator bernie sanders repeated them 1 truth president nicolás maduro is the legitimate president president maduro was re elected on may 20 2018 in response to the opposition demanding an early election the legitimacy of the election of maduro is so evident that it must be assumed those who say he is illegitimate are either intentionally false or ignorant the election was scheduled consistent with the venezuelan constitution and in consultation with opposition parties when it became evident that the opposition could not win the election they decided under pressure from the united states to boycott the election in order to undermine its legitimacy the facts are 9 389 056 people voted 46 of eligible voters sixteen parties participated in the election with six candidates competing for the presidency the electoral process was observed by more than 150 election observers this included 14 electoral commissions from eight countries among them the council of electoral experts of latin america two technical electoral missions and 18 journalists from different parts of the world among others according to the international observers the elections were very transparent and complied with international parameters and national legislation venezuela has one of the best electoral systems in the world voter fraud is not possible as identification and fingerprints are required for each voter voting machines are audited before and immediately after the election venezuela does something no other country in the world does a public citizen s audit of a random sample of 53 of voting machines that is televised all 18 parties signed the audits maduro won by a wide margin obtaining 6 248 864 votes 67 84 followed by henri falcón with 1 927 958 20 93 javier bertucci with 1 015 895 10 82 and reinaldo quijada who obtained 36 246 votes 0 39 of the total this same voting system has been used in elections that maduro s party has lost in governor s and legislative elections venezuela is a real democracy with transparent elections the united states could learn a good deal about real democracy from venezuela 2 truth the economic crisis is caused by outside intervention internal sabotage and the decline in oil prices there is no doubt the economic situation in venezuela is dire the cause is the economic war conducted by the united states the major decline in oil prices and economic sabotage by the opposition in essence the united states and opposition created problems in the venezuelan economy and now say maduro must be replaced because of problems they created oil was discovered in venezuela in the early part of the 20th century and has dominated the economy since then the dutch disease the negative impact of an economy based on one natural resource causes a sharp inflow of foreign currency which raises the value of the country s currency making the country s other products less price competitive it is cheaper to import products rather than create them this makes it more difficult for segments of the economy like agriculture and manufacturing to develop chavez maduro sought to diversify the economy they put in place thousands of communes and hundreds of thousands of people working in cooperatives to build agriculture and manufacturing when the global price of oil was cut by more than half it collapsed venezuela s public finances undermining these efforts the economic war by the us made it difficult for venezuela to borrow and trade with some countries economic sanctions against venezuela began under george w bush in 2004 continued under president obama and the trump administration escalated them with financial sanctions united states sanctions cost venezuela some 6 billion since august according to an october analysis measures against the nation s oil industry have prohibited the venezuelan majority owned company citgo from sending profits back to venezuela a 1 billion loss to the government yearly now the bank of england is refusing to return 1 2 billion in gold reserves after us officials including secretary of state michael pompeo and national security adviser john bolton lobbied them to cut venezuela off from its overseas assets the us economic war and sabotage of the economy by business interests has been exposed as part of the effort to remove maduro by creating social unrest and lack of confidence in the government this has included hoarding of goods storing essentials in warehouses and selling venezuelan goods in colombia in september 2018 venezuela pointed to a false media campaign exaggerating migration from venezuela they highlighted statistics from the united nations high commissioner for refugees to affirm that venezuela has the fewest volunteer migrants in the continent they pointed out 5 6 million colombians have fled violence in their country and live in venezuela venezuela has programs that have helped thousands of venezuelans return home socialism strengthens economies as demonstrated in portugal indeed one criticism of venezuela is that the bolivarian process is moving too slowly to put in place a socialist economy there is a need for more sectors to be nationalized and put under democratic control of the people 3 truth the opposition is violent not the maduro government opposition protesters have been extremely violent one tactic of the opposition was to be violent and then film the government s response to make the government look violent when abby martin was confronted by opposition protesters they told her do not film anything that we do just film what the government does to us she reported on the violence saying the vast majority has been caused by either indirect or direct violence by the opposition martin reports the opposition attacked hospitals burned down the housing ministry assassinated chavistas and attacked citizen communes such as an art commune that gave free dance and music lessons to local children afro venezuelans were burned alive protesters pulled drivers out of buses and torched the buses when photos and videos of opposition violence were put on social media martin and her colleague mike prysner became the target of a false media campaign on social media the opposition did all they could to prevent them from reporting the truth using hundreds of death threats and threats they would be lynched in 2017 venezuela analysis reported that violent opposition protests included an attack on a maternity hospital endangering the lives of more than 50 newborn babies another report described the opposition using snipers to shoot government officials and civilians opposition newspapers urged that blunt objects be used to neutralize pro government protesters resulting in serious injuries and death steve ellner also reported that violence was coming from the opposition he pointed to attacks at grocery stores banks buses and government buildings other commentators described specific incidents of violence by the opposition including killing people maduro ordered the arrest of a retired general who tweeted how to use wire to decapitate people on motorcycles which happened and how to attack armored vehicles with molotov cocktails documents show that violence was the opposition s strategy they sought to create situations of crisis in the streets that will facilitate us intervention as well as nato forces with the support of the colombian government whenever possible the violence should result in deaths or injuries the tales of government violence are rooted in lies the government s response was maduro calling for a peace conference describing it as a national peace conference with all the country s political sectors so we venezuelans can try to neutralize violent groups 4 truth the national assembly acted in violation of the law and is in contempt of court the national assembly is not the only democratic body in venezuela indeed its actions since the opposition won a majority have violated the law and protected the violence of the opposition with an embarrassing amnesty bill on december 6 2015 the opposition won a parliamentary majority in the assembly there were allegations of vote buying in amazonas state that were investigated by the national electoral council another branch of the government the supreme court barred four legislators from amazonas taking office two from the opposition one allied with the opposition and one from the ruling party the national assembly allowed three candidates to take office the assembly has been held in contempt of court since july 2016 and their decisions were nullified before the court ruling the assembly passed an amazing amnesty law which granted amnesty for crimes the opposition has committed since 1999 chavez election the law is an admission of guilt and provides a well organized catalog of crimes including felonies crimes committed at public rallies terrorist acts involving explosives and firearms and undermining the economy they essentially admitted exactly what chavez maduro have claimed crimes to overthrow the government for 17 years venezuela s supreme court ruled the amnesty law was unconstitutional inaccurately the trump administration calls the assembly venezuela s only remaining democratic institution this january a subsidiary of the state oil company asked the assembly to intervene claiming the president cannot make reforms to mixed public private oil businesses without the prior approval of the national assembly on january 16 the court ruled that the assembly was still in contempt of court and could not act this is also when the assembly elected juan guaidó as their president who would later appoint himself president of venezuela as part of the us led coup guaidó s election to head the legislature was illegal and nullified by the court the assembly still exists but remains in a state of contempt of the judiciary it can rectify the situation by removing the lawmakers accused of electoral fraud the assembly refuses to do so because their goal is to remove maduro from office and they need a super majority to do so medea benjamin of codepink disrupts mike pompeo at the oas press tv a timeline of the us coup in venezuela in anti maduro coalition grew from secret talks the associated press explains the coup was only possible because of strong support from the trump administration which led a chorus of mostly conservative latin american governments that immediately recognized guaidó since august 2017 donald trump has been saying that military intervention against venezuela was a distinct possibility ap describes this as a watershed moment in the coup planning they report trump pressuring aides and latin american countries to invade venezuela in september the new york times reported that the trump administration had been meeting with coup plotters since mid 2017 the wall street journal reports trump has long viewed venezuela as one of his top three foreign policy priorities with iran and north korea trump requested a briefing on venezuela on his second day in office talking of the immense potential of venezuela to become a rich nation through its oil reserves ap reports that trump personally sparked this as he brought up regime change in venezuela in every meeting with latin american leaders after maduro was re elected administration plans began taking shape driven in part by key members in the national security council and anti maduro advocates in congress like extreme interventionist senator marco rubio on november 1 john bolton zeroed in on latin america calling cuba nicaragua and venezuela a troika of tyranny on january 2 bolton met with his brazilian and colombian counterparts to collaborate to return venezuela to its democratic heritage on january 10 maduro was sworn in for his second term pompeo spoke with opposition leader guaidó pledging support canada also played a key role ap reports that foreign minister chrystia freeland spoke to guaidó the night before maduro s inauguration offering canada s support this was 13 days before guaidó announced he was president of venezuela on january 12 the state department backed guaidó s move to invoke his authority as president of the assembly saying it is time to begin the orderly transition to a new government on january 15 the national assembly declared maduro as illegitimate the trump administration worked to get allies lined up to support guaidó by january 18 the venezuela foreign minister was describing a us coup in progress the night before guaidó s announcement on january 23 vice president mike pence put out a video message encouraging venezuelans to overthrow their government saying we are with you we stand with you and we will stay with you guaidó also received a phone call from pence the night before he appointed himself president where he pledged that the u s would back guaidó guaidó declared that maduro s government was illegitimate and he was assuming the presidency in a well coordinated charade almost instantly trump recognized guaidó as the country s rightful leader to further demonstrate the preconceived tightly coordinated and efficiently carried out coup us allies among them canada brazil argentina colombia chile and peru quickly recognized the coup president the trump administration is claiming guaidó represents the lawful government and is entitled to all venezuelan revenues the state department notified the federal reserve that guaidó is the agent for access to venezuelan assets in us banks nearly as quickly maduro drew statements of support from russia china turkey mexico cuba bolivia and others the venezuelan supreme court called for an investigation into the national assembly and guaidó regarding the illegal usurpation of executive power the venezuelan military announced it supported maduro and russia warned the us not to intervene militarily on january 25 the organization of american states which is traditionally a us tool rejected a resolution to recognize guaidó medea benjamin of code pink interrupted pompeo at the oas holding a sign that said a coup is not a democratic transition venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza thanked benjamin saying with her protest she revealed the macabre coup plan against venezuela we will always prevail thank you eighteen countries defeated the proposal at the un security council meeting on january 26 russia s un ambassador vassily nebenzia accused the united states of attempting to engineer a coup d etat he demanded to know whether the trump administration is ready to use military force against venezuela european countries gave venezuela eight days to hold an election a suggestion venezuela rejected secretary of state mike pompeo called venezuela an illegitimate mafia state he accused russia and china of trying to prop up maduro both china and russia have told the us not to intervene in venezuela s internal affairs in december russia sent two nuclear capable strategic tu 160 bombers to venezuela along with an an 124 heavy military transport plane and an ii 62 long haul plane as of december russia has one brigade in venezuela and was discussing sending a second military brigade to venezuela even before the coup due to the continued threat of intervention from the united states china has lent over 50 billion to venezuela through oil for loan agreements over the past decade and has become a partner in the venezuelan oil industry in december seven months since signing a financial business venture with china venezuela s oil production has doubled to 130 000 barrels per day the take over of venezuela s oil would also be an attack on china china and venezuela signed 28 bilateral strategic cooperation agreements on september 14 in the areas of oil mining security technology finance and health demonstrating the nature of the coup president the first acts that guaidó took were to seek a loan from the international monetary fund which would put venezuela in debt to western bankers and under their control and to privatize the venezuelan oil industry which would rob venezuela of the funds being used to lift up the poor and working class the appointment by mike pompeo of elliott abrams as the person in charge of overseeing operations to restore democracy in venezuela is an ominous sign it is scandalous and demonstrates the most extreme elements of the us establishment are leading the charge abrams was convicted during the iran contra scandal supported us backed death squads in guatemala and el salvador in the 1980s played a key role in the reagan administration support for the murderous contras in nicaragua and was the person who gave approval for the us backed coup in venezuela in 2002 analyst vijay prashad writes the coup violated the charters of the united nations and of the organisation of american states and describes efforts to call on the military to rise up against the government have failed the trump administration is now threatening a total oil embargo on venezuela and is leaving the military option open the concerted campaign by the us and canada to install juan guaidó as the new self declared interim president of venezuela has been met with initial failure unfortunately the illegal and undemocratic attempts to destabilize the country and overthrow the democratically elected president will continue with harmful consequences the people of venezuela are rising once again to defend their country against hostile foreign intervention it is essential that we support them in this fight many groups are holding solidarity rallies and issuing statements of support find rallies and protests here and here while sanders got all the facts wrong about venezuela he did reach the right conclusion the united states has a long history of inappropriately intervening in latin american countries we must not go down that road again people in the united states have an important role to play in supporting venezuela and defeating the coup

in the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of 417 million compared with a loss of 107 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the unfavorable change was primarily a result of an increase in mark to market

24 percent compared with approximately 28 percent for the full year of 2017 excluding the items discussed below the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate beginning

about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium mark to market losses we recognize actuarial gains and losses for our pension and opeb plans as a mark to market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time for 2018 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 495 million primarily due to lower than expected returns on plan assets partially offset by higher interest rates for 2017 the mark to market adjustment was a net loss of 301 million primarily due to lower interest rates and a change in mortality assumptions partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments based on improved profits in the united states we recognized a non cash benefit of 63 million and 111 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively to reduce the valuation allowance against u s state deferred tax assets during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a non cash charge of 59 million to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for prior years u s tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a 2 371 billion charge due to the enactment of u s tax reform legislation in december 2017 the provisionally estimated charge included a 596 million write down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings during the third quarter of 2018 we recognized a 154 million reduction to the estimated charge for the write down in net deferred tax assets this reduction was primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of 1 0 billion to u s pension plans treated as deductible on the 2017 u s tax return during the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a 50 million increase to the estimated charge for the cost of mandatory deemed repatriation of non u s earnings a reconciliation of these items can be found in the non gaap financial measures section on page 17 q2 can you discuss the unfavorable impact from equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2018 a effective january 1 2018 we adopted a new u s gaap accounting rule that requires our equity securities primarily held by insurance

co written by kevin zeese and margaret flowers two things stand out about the us coup in venezuela first it is unusually open typically the us tries to hide its coups second the coup is built on a series of obvious falsehoods yet the bi partisans in washington with a few exceptions keep repeating them first we will correct the falsehoods so readers are all working from the same facts second we will describe how this coup is being defeated it will be another major embarrassment for the trump administration and us foreign policy it is important to understand venezuela has become a geopolitical conflict as russia and china are closely allied with venezuela china and russia coming into the backyard of the united states challenges the antiquated monroe doctrine venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world and the second largest gold reserves as well as diamonds and other minerals such as coltan needed for electronic devices and venezuela is taking over as president of opec and will be in a position to push for oil payments in non dollar currencies or in cryptocurrencies a major threat to the us dollar correcting the record there are a series of false statements repeated by dc officials and corporate media to justify the coup that are so obvious it is hard to believe they are not intentional in his two paragraph comment on the coup even senator bernie sanders repeated them 1 truth president nicolás maduro is the legitimate president president maduro was re elected on may 20 2018 in response to the opposition demanding an early election the legitimacy of the election of maduro is so evident that it must be assumed those who say he is illegitimate are either intentionally false or ignorant the election was scheduled consistent with the venezuelan constitution and in consultation with opposition parties when it became evident that the opposition could not win the election they decided under pressure from the united states to boycott the election in order to undermine its legitimacy the facts are 9 389 056 people voted 46 of eligible voters sixteen parties participated in the election with six candidates competing for the presidency the electoral process was observed by more than 150 election observers this included 14 electoral commissions from eight countries among them the council of electoral experts of latin america two technical electoral missions and 18 journalists from different parts of the world among others according to the international observers the elections were very transparent and complied with international parameters and national legislation venezuela has one of the best electoral systems in the world voter fraud is not possible as identification and fingerprints are required for each voter voting machines are audited before and immediately after the election venezuela does something no other country in the world does a public citizen s audit of a random sample of 53 of voting machines that is televised all 18 parties signed the audits maduro won by a wide margin obtaining 6 248 864 votes 67 84 followed by henri falcón with 1 927 958 20 93 javier bertucci with 1 015 895 10 82 and reinaldo quijada who obtained 36 246 votes 0 39 of the total this same voting system has been used in elections that maduro s party has lost in governor s and legislative elections venezuela is a real democracy with transparent elections the united states could learn a good deal about real democracy from venezuela 2 truth the economic crisis is caused by outside intervention internal sabotage and the decline in oil prices there is no doubt the economic situation in venezuela is dire the cause is the economic war conducted by the united states the major decline in oil prices and economic sabotage by the opposition in essence the united states and opposition created problems in the venezuelan economy and now say maduro must be replaced because of problems they created oil was discovered in venezuela in the early part of the 20th century and has dominated the economy since then the dutch disease the negative impact of an economy based on one natural resource causes a sharp inflow of foreign currency which raises the value of the country s currency making the country s other products less price competitive it is cheaper to import products rather than create them this makes it more difficult for segments of the economy like agriculture and manufacturing to develop chavez maduro sought to diversify the economy they put in place thousands of communes and hundreds of thousands of people working in cooperatives to build agriculture and manufacturing when the global price of oil was cut by more than half it collapsed venezuela s public finances undermining these efforts the economic war by the us made it difficult for venezuela to borrow and trade with some countries economic sanctions against venezuela began under president obama and the trump administration escalated them with financial sanctions united states sanctions cost venezuela some 6 billion since august according to an october analysis measures against the nation s oil industry have prohibited the venezuelan majority owned company citgo from sending profits back to venezuela a 1 billion loss to the government yearly now the bank of england is refusing to return 1 2 billion in gold reserves after us officials including secretary of state michael pompeo and national security adviser john bolton lobbied them to cut venezuela off from its overseas assets the us economic war and sabotage of the economy by business interests has been exposed as part of the effort to remove maduro by creating social unrest and lack of confidence in the government this has included hoarding of goods storing essentials in warehouses and selling venezuelan goods in colombia in september 2018 venezuela pointed to a false media campaign exaggerating migration from venezuela they highlighted statistics from the united nations high commissioner for refugees to affirm that venezuela has the fewest volunteer migrants in the continent they pointed out 5 6 million colombians have fled violence in their country and live in venezuela venezuela has programs that have helped thousands of venezuelans return home socialism strengthens economies as demonstrated in portugal indeed one criticism of venezuela is that the bolivarian process is moving too slowly to put in place a socialist economy there is a need for more sectors to be nationalized and put under democratic control of the people 3 truth the opposition is violent not the maduro government opposition protesters have been extremely violent one tactic of the opposition was to be violent and then film the government s response to make the government look violent when abby martin was confronted by opposition protesters they told her do not film anything that we do just film what the government does to us she reported on the violence saying the vast majority has been caused by either indirect or direct violence by the opposition martin reports the opposition attacked hospitals burned down the housing ministry assassinated chavistas and attacked citizen communes such as an art commune that gave free dance and music lessons to local children afro venezuelans were burned alive protesters pulled drivers out of buses and torched the buses when photos and videos of opposition violence were put on social media martin and her colleague mike prysner became the target of a false media campaign on social media the opposition did all they could to prevent them from reporting the truth using hundreds of death threats and threats they would be lynched in 2017 venezuela analysis reported that violent opposition protests included an attack on a maternity hospital endangering the lives of more than 50 newborn babies another report described the opposition using snipers to shoot government officials and civilians opposition newspapers urged that blunt objects be used to neutralize pro government protesters resulting in serious injuries and death steve ellner also reported that violence was coming from the opposition he pointed to attacks at grocery stores banks buses and government buildings other commentators described specific incidents of violence by the opposition including killing people maduro ordered the arrest of a retired general who tweeted how to use wire to decapitate people on motorcycles which happened and how to attack armored vehicles with molotov cocktails documents show that violence was the opposition s strategy they sought to create situations of crisis in the streets that will facilitate us intervention as well as nato forces with the support of the colombian government whenever possible the violence should result in deaths or injuries the tales of government violence are rooted in lies the government s response was maduro calling for a peace conference describing it as a national peace conference with all the country s political sectors so we venezuelans can try to neutralize violent groups 4 truth the national assembly acted in violation of the law and is in contempt of court the national assembly is not the only democratic body in venezuela indeed its actions since the opposition won a majority have violated the law and protected the violence of the opposition with an embarrassing amnesty bill on december 6 2015 the opposition won a parliamentary majority in the assembly there were allegations of vote buying in amazonas state that were investigated by the national electoral council another branch of the government the supreme court barred four legislators from amazonas taking office two from the opposition one allied with the opposition and one from the ruling party the national assembly allowed three candidates to take office the assembly has been held in contempt of court since july 2016 and their decisions were nullified before the court ruling the assembly passed an amazing amnesty law which granted amnesty for crimes the opposition has committed since 1999 chavez election the law is an admission of guilt and provides a well organized catalog of crimes including felonies crimes committed at public rallies terrorist acts involving explosives and firearms and undermining the economy they essentially admitted exactly what chavez maduro have claimed crimes to overthrow the government for 17 years venezuela s supreme court ruled the amnesty law was unconstitutional inaccurately the trump administration calls the assembly venezuela s only remaining democratic institution this january a subsidiary of the state oil company asked the assembly to intervene claiming the president cannot make reforms to mixed public private oil businesses without the prior approval of the national assembly on january 16 the court ruled that the assembly was still in contempt of court and could not act this is also when the assembly elected juan guaidó as their president who would later appoint himself president of venezuela as part of the us led coup guaidó s election to head the legislature was illegal and nullified by the court the assembly still exists but remains in a state of contempt of the judiciary it can rectify the situation by removing the lawmakers accused of electoral fraud the assembly refuses to do so because their goal is to remove maduro from office and they need a super majority to do so a timeline of the us coup in venezuela in anti maduro coalition grew from secret talks the associated press explains the coup was only possible because of strong support from the trump administration which led a chorus of mostly conservative latin american governments that immediately recognized guaidó since august 2017 donald trump has been saying that military interventionagainst venezuela was a distinct possibility ap describes this as a watershed moment in the coup planning they report trump pressuring aides and latin american countries to invade venezuela in september the new york times reported that the trump administration had been meeting with coup plotters since mid 2017 the wall street journal reports trump has long viewed venezuela as one of his top three foreign policy priorities with iran and north korea trump requested a briefing on venezuela on his second day in office talking of the immense potential of venezuela to become a rich nation through its oil reserves ap reports that trump personally sparked this as he brought up regime change in venezuela in every meeting with latin american leaders after maduro was re elected administration plans began taking shape driven in part by key members in the national security council and anti maduro advocates in congress like extreme interventionist senator marco rubio on november 1 john bolton zeroed in on latin america calling cuba nicaragua and venezuela a troika of tyranny on january 2 bolton met with his brazilian and colombian counterparts to collaborate to return venezuela to its democratic heritage on january 10 maduro was sworn in for his second term pompeo spoke with opposition leader guaidó pledging support canada also played a key role ap reports that foreign minister chrystia freeland spoke to guaidó the night before maduro s inauguration offering canada s support this was 13 days before guaidó announced he was president of venezuela on january 12 the state department backed guaidó s move to invoke his authority as president of the assembly saying it is time to begin the orderly transition to a new government on january 15 the national assembly declared maduro as illegitimate the trump administration worked to get allies lined up to support guaidó by january 18 the venezuela foreign minister was describing a us coup in progress the night before guaidó s announcement on january 23 vice president mike pence put out a video message encouraging venezuelans to overthrow their government saying we are with you we stand with you and we will stay with you guaidó also received a phone call from pence the night before he appointed himself president where he pledged that the u s would back guaidó guaidó declared that maduro s government was illegitimate and he was assuming the presidency in a well coordinated charade almost instantly trump recognized guaidó as the country s rightful leader to further demonstrate the preconceived tightly coordinated and efficiently carried out the coup us allies among them canada brazil argentina colombia chile and peru quickly recognized the coup president the trump administration is claiming guaidó represents the lawful government and is entitled to all venezuelan revenues the state department notified the federal reserve that guaidó is the agent for access to venezuelan assets in us banks nearly as quickly maduro drew statements of support from russia china turkey mexico cuba bolivia and others the venezuelan supreme court called for an investigation into the national assembly and guaidó regarding the illegal usurpation of executive power the venezuelan military announced it supported maduro and russia warned the us not to intervene militarily on january 25 the organization of american states which is traditionally a us tool rejected a resolution to recognize guaidó medea benjamin of code pink interrupted pompeo at the oas holding a sign that said a coup is not a democratic transition venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza thanked benjamin saying with her protest she revealed the macabre coup plan against venezuela we will always prevail thank you eighteen countries defeated the proposal at the un security council meeting on january 26 russia s un ambassador vassily nebenzia accused the united states of attempting to engineer a coup d etat he demanded to know whether the trump administration is ready to use military force against venezuela european countries gave venezuela eight days to hold an election a suggestion venezuela rejected secretary of state mike pompeo called venezuela an illegitimate mafia state he accused russia and china of trying to prop up maduro both china and russia have told the us not to intervene in venezuela s internal affairs in december russia sent two nuclear capable strategic tu 160 bombers to venezuela along with an an 124 heavy military transport plane and an ii 62 long haul plane as of december russia has one brigade in venezuela and was discussing sending a second military brigade to venezuela even before the coup due to the continued threat of intervention from the united states china has lent over 50 billion to venezuela through oil for loan agreements over the past decade and has become a partner in the venezuelan oil industry in december seven months since signing a financial business venture with china venezuela s oil production has doubled to 130 000 barrels per day the take over of venezuela s oil would also be an attack on china china and venezuela signed 28 bilateral strategic cooperation agreements on september 14 in the areas of oil mining security technology finance and health demonstrating the nature of the coup president the first acts that guaidó took were to seek a loan from the international monetary fund which would put venezuela in debt to western bankers and under their control and to privatize the venezuelan oil industry which would rob venezuela of the funds being used to lift up the poor and working class the appointment by mike pompeo of elliott abrams as the person in charge of overseeing operations to restore democracy in venezuela is an ominous sign it is scandalous and demonstrates the most extreme elements of the us establishment are leading the charge abrams was convicted during the iran contra scandal supported us backed death squads in guatemala and el salvador in the 1980s played a key role in the reagan administration support for the murderous contras in nicaragua and was the person who gave approval for the us backed coup in venezuela in 2002 analyst vijay prashad writes the coup violated the charters of the united nations and of the organisation of american states and describes efforts to call on the military to rise up against the government have failed the trump administration is now threatening a total oil embargo on venezuela and is leaving the military option open the concerted campaign by the us and canada to install juan guaidó as the new self declared interim president of venezuela has been met with initial failure unfortunately the illegal and undemocratic attempts to destabilize the country and overthrow the democratically elected president will continue with harmful consequences the people of venezuela are rising once again to defend their country against hostile foreign intervention it is essential that we support them in this fight many groups are holding solidarity rallies and issuing statements of support find rallies and protests here and here while sanders got all the facts wrong about venezuela he did reach the right conclusion the united states has a long history of inappropriately intervening in latin american countries we must not go down that road again people in the united states have an important role to play in supporting venezuela and defeating the coup kevin zeese and margaret flowers are directors of popular resistance

asean fundamental outlook asean fx gained ground as haven demand for the us dollar declined us china trade talks may overshadow economic data from both nations negotiation deal bets mean risks for idr php myr sgd tilted lower trade all the major global economic data live and interactive at the dailyfx webinars we d love to have you along the highly liquid us dollar aimed sharply lower last friday amidst market optimism which sunk demand for haven assets after a week of conflicting news around progress in us china trade talks investors seem to be making bets on a deal of some sort next week as china s vice premier liu he visits washington this allowed for most asean currencies such as the singapore dollar to appreciate against the greenback the one notable exception was the malaysian ringgit usd myr rose aggressively after local markets were closed monday for thaipusam a public holiday softer domestic inflation data later seemed to have supported bets that the central bank of malaysia could cut rates but bank negara malaysia expects prices to average moderately higher this year when it left rates unchanged at 3 25 on thursday meanwhile the philippine peso was little changed by the end of last week a weaker local gdp report seemed to be overshadowed by pronounced weakness in usd on friday the singapore dollar edged cautiously higher with an upside surprise in domestic cpi data but the bulk of its gains were due to underperformance in usd next week offers more prominent chinese economic statistics last week growth slowed to its weakest pace in 28 years january 31st contains chinese manufacturing pmi data followed by the private sector caixin readings on friday data is still tending to underperform relative to economists expectations more of the same could support fears of slowing growth in the world s second largest economy the focus for asean bloc currencies will be directed towards us china trade talks and how that impacts sentiment however given the conflicting messages from the white house it is unclear what the outcome could be since markets appeared to price in a deal of some sort the risks are arguably tilted to the downside should the us dollar gain amidst disappointment usd idr could rise for example meanwhile the partial us government shutdown ended last week via a temporary stopgap funding bill in the interim this means that previously delayed economic data trade balance retail sales and more should slowly be released on top of that the regular schedule contains the first estimate of q4 gdp employment and pce inflation data let s not forget that the fed also has its first interest rate decision of the year in the middle of the week with that in mind there can be a lot of potential here for us dollar volatility given that the central bank is data dependent what is interesting is that last week we did see an improvement in the implied 2019 fed rate hike path yet the us dollar fell flat on its face this highlights how important the greenback is as a haven asset given its status as the world s reserve currency if us china trade talks lead to a positive outcome and improve market mood further there can be major upside potential for php idr myr and sgd to gain ground but let s also not forget that in the end and perhaps down the road where interest rates are going are generally the most important fundamental driver for fx markets may still underpricing the fed in terms of anticipated rate hikes in 2019 fx trading resources written by daniel dubrovsky junior currency analyst for dailyfx com to contact daniel use the comments section below or ddubrovskyfx on twitter
china is moving quickly to push forward a draft version of its first foreign investment law this week among other things the proposed law bans forced technology transfers guarantees national treatment for foreign investors and steps up intellectual property right protections all key issues in the ongoing trade dispute with washington it also supports a negative list management for foreign investment a list unveiled in june last year cut the number of restricted items down to 48 from 63 and removed access restrictions in several sectors according to state media analysts note however that the way the law is being rushed through and the vague wording of many of its 39 clauses is casting some serious doubts on authorities ability to enforce the legislation after it is passed being rushed through lester ross who chairs the china policy committee of the american chamber of commerce amcham in beijing said he s concerned about the draft s expedited review including a two day legislative session for the draft bill that begins tuesday the meeting comes before the period of solicitation of public comments is set to end in late february china s largely rubber stamp legislature the national people s congress is working to fast track the bill s passage during its annual meeting in march which may serve as an olive branch to ease trade tensions with washington said liu meng chun of the chung hua institution of economic research cier in taipei while acknowledging the draft s consistency with the competitive neutrality principal which encourages fair competition between domestic and foreign businesses ross said the draft has many shortcomings the problem is that there are many provisions in the law which do not address the concerns of foreign investors and in addition the provisions are in some cases so broadly worded that they actually create a basis for mistreatment of foreign businesses he said additional hurdles for example article 20 allows the state to take control of foreign investment in the interest of the public yet what defines public interest isn t clear as is the case when article 33 states the need for safety reviews on foreign businesses which influence or are likely to influence national security that ross said creates an additional hurdle when the law is intended to reduce hurdles as a principal he urges china to keep restrictions on foreign investment to a minimum in accordance with international norms and china s own wto commitments walker wallace partner at the u s international law firm o melveny myers office in shanghai finds the draft s article 39 problematic as it is currently worded the article only gives foreign businesses a five year grace period to reorganize their existing corporate structure mainly joint ventures or wholly foreign owned enterprises a problematic deadline putting the five year term limit basically puts the gun to the heads of the joint venture parties and says you have five years to try and reopen a deal that was closely negotiated before where people made trade offs one way or another and that opens up the possibility for all kinds of mischief wallace says he said china should allow foreign invested enterprises to retain their existing corporate structures till the end of their current contract so that no shareholders for example a chinese land owner and a foreign hotel company with an agreement longer than five years use the opportunity to unfairly renegotiate another issue he adds is the bill fails to spell out the consequences foreign businesses will face if they re unable to complete such reorganization within the time frame wallace also urged china to add provisions to the draft that would allow foreign businesses to be able to freely establish domestic subsidiaries just like their local competitors it remains to be seen whether foreign companies will be governed by china s company law after the bill takes effect if so the company law presents another set of problems said ross for example he added foreign businesses will find it unacceptable to set up a communist party branch within the companies as required by article 19 enforceable assurances compared to the 2015 draft the earlier version of the law the new bill further opens up the chinese market to foreign investment through deregulation and institutional reform but how that will all play out in practice remains to be seen as the law s enforcement will be handled by local governments cier s liu noted china has often embraced protectionist policies at the local level if the open up policy involves sectors that have long been dominated by local government owned enterprises it means these government run companies will now face foreign competition given that their performance is tied to local governments fiscal it remains to be seen if local authorities will fully execute the central government s policies the economist said in other words the removal of hidden hurdles for foreign businesses that contradict to the law upon its adoption will be key he added those hurdles include bureaucratic red tape taxation practices or the level of priorities given to foreign businesses in listing queues all of which have in the past added difficulties to the operation of foreign investment there observers say
philippine peso stability relies on duterteâ s infrastructure success recent concerns about peso s depreciation have been exaggerated in the most dangerous international environment since the postwar era there is no room for complacency however in the past international and domestic critics of the duterte government have complained that the philippine peso has fallen six straight years which is seen as a sign of the failure of duterte agenda in march 2017 bloomberg reported that asia s ugly duckling of 2017 is the peso thanks to duterte at the time peso s weakening was explained oddly enough by investors who had been spooked by allegations of unlawful killings and corruption more recently the peso is said to face an additional threat a mid term election that may compound concerns about its economy this time bloomberg believes that political uncertainties pose an added source of pressure yet recent surveys do not seem to support such speculation still other reports see political risks where such do not necessarily exist while approaching the peso s weakening as if it was fueled by mainly internal forces in reality most currencies in emerging markets have depreciated since first expectations that the u s will start rate normalization and when the actual rate hikes began about six straight years ago well before duterte figure since the fed s signaling of normalization and rate hikes philippine peso has depreciated almost in parallel forces behind peso movements a series of well known forces have fueled recent peso depreciation in the fall inflation reached an intolerable high of 6 7 it was boosted by a price effect associated with tax reforms train rising oil prices and a failure to manage rice prices accordingly philippine peso depreciated until early october yet the pressures that have been associated with overheating are likely to weaken in 2019 as the train related price pressures should ease in the coming months also the slowing international economy has penalized oil crude oil exceeded 75 in early october but is now around 55 a u s sino trade compromise could contribute to rising prices again however in the past the quota system failed to keep rice price in control the new import tariff system should stabilize it moreover high loan growth has made some observers uneasy while it is associated with the infrastructure drive it has to be monitored most importantly perhaps some observers feel uncomfortable with current account deficit cad yet the widening cad is the effect of the infrastructure drive it has been expanding as a result of imports which support infrastructure development furthermore the slowdown of electronic exports which account for more than half of philippine exports is hardly a domestic challenge u s trade wars have undermined the recovery of world trade however there are some possible new shifts in the international horizon last year the tighter dollar boosted by the fed s rate hikes went hand in hand with tighter financial conditions that is no longer the case also last year trump s tax cuts gave a one time high for the u s economy but now u s growth may have peaked accordingly the prospects of slower growth and lower inflation may have made the fed less hawkish risky international environment budget passage nevertheless the international environment including u s trade wars poses more threats than ever since the postwar era if the u s sino trade truce paves way to a compromise by march 1 world demand may improve but if the tensions spread as they did last year world demand is likely to further deteriorate and even if trade compromise can be found tensions are likely to linger in the technology sector moreover the white house may target the asean in its trade wars as it has suggested since mid 2018 in 2018 the philippines expansion amounted to 6 2 although inflation did penalize the government s downwardly revised goal of 6 5 to 6 9 the country is one of the fastest growing economies in asia and relatively well positioned to absorb shocks moreover the bangko sentral ng filipinas bsp hiked policy rates several times in 2018 which makes further tightening less likely in 2019 yet the status quo permits no complacency the inflation induced reduction of the country s economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 which penalized the annual figure should serve as a warning sign for a belated 2019 budget passage even if a re enacted budget were to be passed now the infrastructure programs that are of critical national importance cannot proceed until after the mid year that in turn has potential to harm the current year s economic growth once again time is money consequently a rapid 2019 budget passage is vital the duterte fiscal expansion has potential to continue well into the early 2020s which bodes well for economic growth as long as political impasse does not penalize economic progress dr steinbock is the founder of the difference group and has served as the research

recently talks between the international monetary fund imf and pakistan broke down the real reason behind the breakdown in talks at a stage where pakistan is suffering from a balance of payments crisis was the attempt of imran khan s newly elected government to avoid the unpopular economic decisions that the imf put up as a condition of lending funds to the country while many commentators in the country focused on the economic consequences of an imf bailout a certain perspective was missing from the debate altogether this perspective is philosophical in nature and concerns the question of the collective human right to development human rights are a fundamental part of international law there is however a popular belief that the theoretical basis of human rights found in its international charters and conventions is useless in factually ameliorating the material conditions of the poorest sections of the world underlying the neutral and abstract concept of human rights is a plethora of philosophical and political ideas from all nooks and corners of the world the universal declaration of human rights udhr was a reaction to the dictatorial nazi regime and while the majority of its values such as the protections against torture might find global approval its provisions for economic rights have never been enforced since the power centers in the west do not favor such rights the conception of human rights enforced to date has been built on a disproportionately western perspective in fact under the udhr there are no specific provisions about the economic inequalities between the first and the third world or on how to alleviate such inequalities the udhr also reinforces this economic inequality by not taking into account that some underdeveloped states do not have the capacity to enforce some rights contained in the declaration such as the right to suitable housing malaysia immediately refused economic aid packages from the imf and the world bank owing to its stringent conditions unlike indonesia thailand and the philippines the economies of these other countries were severely affected by the conditions imposed by these financial institutions while malaysia not only recovered its gdp but became the best performing economy in asia going as far as pegging the malaysian ringgit to the american dollar the discourse on human rights law has for far too long ignored third generation rights which consist of the claimed rights of the third world to economic and infrastructural development these human rights do not define the rights and obligations of the economically unequal states and are seen by western governments as demands for charity civil and political rights are seen as enforceable but economic and social rights are seen as too vague to be enforced and are paid only lip service this view has been challenged by certain states malaysia sees the udhr incompatible with its needs of development the malaysian economy was hit significantly by the asian financial crisis and malaysia s gdp shrunk from us 100 8 billion in 1996 to us 72 2 billion in 1998 malaysia immediately refused economic aid packages from the imf and the world bank owing to its stringent conditions unlike indonesia thailand and the philippines the economies of these other countries were severely affected by the conditions imposed by these financial institutions while malaysia not only recovered its gdp but became the best performing economy in asia going as far as pegging the malaysian ringgit to the american dollar under the principle of sovereign equality each state is equal in terms to rights and liabilities with all other states yet financial institutions the imf and the world bank were run by votes based on the economic strength of the states the world bank and the international monetary fund were formed to prevent international economic recession and to promote development the real purpose of the imf was to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade but in attempting to help poor countries with the maladjustments of balance of payments the adequate safeguards that the fund was empowered to impose turned into structural adjustment lending which led to most of the agitation and complaints the imf has received from the third world the policies of the poor states in enforcing fundamental economic and social protections for its poverty ridden masses such as subsidized food medicines and petrol were seen as the biggest challenges to the imf lending these states any sort of funds the responsibility of the wealthiest in the world to help the third world with development has not been recognized even with the udhr charter sharply providing for promotion of economic and social rights the imf opens the states it helps to international private investment and is therefore aligned with the interests of the richest countries in the world which also call the shots at the imf due to their voting powers sine quo non their economic strength this is an unsatisfactory position of the law it is high time that international law develops to recognize the right of the poorest countries in the world to sustainable development pakistan has lost a large part of its economy due to the war on terror which it leads as a vanguard state rather than letting the country sink into a debt trap diplomatically at the hands of countries like china and saudi arabia it is pertinent now that the international financial institutions and states with influence over them act now and assist pakistan with its balance of payments crisis without stripping the poorest sections of the country from the already meagre social and economic protections that they possess it can reasonably be argued that withholding such minimal protections would itself be a violation of international human rights law the writer is a barrister who has an interest in pakistani current affairs published in daily times

last week the dollar fell and equities tread water after central banks globally signaled a more accommodative stance the us put a band aid over the partial government shutdown and the overall theme at davos showed that most leaders or key executives are concerned that political and economic uncertainty will drive down growth momentum in 2019 this week is highlighted by tech earnings votes on key amendments in uk parliament on tuesday super wednesday with an fomc decision and us china trade talks and the non farm payroll report on friday usd the us dollar fell against its major trading partners after the wall street journal s report that they are considering an earlier than expected end to the bond portfolio runoff the fed is currently tightening via interest rate hikes and shrinking the balance sheet so the possible signal that the fed is closer to ending the balance sheet runoff along with expectations the fed will not consider its next hike until september could be bullish for us stocks and high beta currencies the fed was not the only central bank with a dovish message both the ecb and the boj signaled dovishness and concerns for slower growth the boj cut their inflation outlook for the next three years and see gdp remaining around the 1 0 level the ecb also acknowledged the weaker round of data and noted that the economic outlook has moved to the downside a downgrade from the prior stance of broadly balanced the fomc rate decision on wednesday will closely be watched for further details on the fed s take on the balance sheet we ve come along way from the automatic pilot comment and will look to see if they signal a reduction in the 50 billion monthly amount or a target on when they will stop the nonfarm payroll is also due on friday and is expected to show 165 000 new jobs created in january down from the 312 000 seen in december the us labor remains the strongest part of the us economy but we should not be expected if we see a miss with the january report as contract workers were heavily under pressure due to the shutdown shutdown timeout the record long government shutdown ended on friday when president trump signed a short term spending bill to re open the government while democrats appeared to have one this battle the government is only opened until february 15th and this band aid will have trouble leading to a permanent solution as both sides are nowhere near a bending on positions on border wall funding and a path to citizenship for dreamers aud the australian dollar will likely take a queue from the latest round of trade talks between china and us chinese vice premier liu he will have talks in washington dc from january 30th to 31st about 5 weeks away from the deadline where we could see the escalation of tariffs on chinese goods some progress has been made but trade talks could get tougher here and we may see more political posturing until we get closer to the deadline it is unlikely to see key progress this week on the issue of intellectual property theft and force technology transfers and that could weigh on asian markets gbp the sun reported that british prime minister theresa may explained to cabinet ministers that she will not take the uk out of the eu without a deal and that she will not disclose that a no deal scenario is off the table as she would lose bargaining power with the eu last week s rally in cable was primarily driven on expectations the uk will not go through a hard exit the story in the sun pretty confirms what everyone was thinking the focus this week falls on tuesday s house of commons brexit debate and vote on amendments pm may lose flexibility in how she handles the last couple months of brexit votes preventing a no deal brexit could have her lose a big bargaining chip and the amendment from yvette cooper s allowing the commons to pass a bill that would force pm may to seek an article 50 extension if she cannot get her deal passed oil crude prices rallied last week to a 2 month high as political turmoil in venezuela raised expectations we could see even more oil come off the market venezuela is the owner of the biggest oil reserves and some analysts could see production falling by a third in 2019 over the weekend venezuelan dictator nicolas maduro rebuffed international pressure to call elections within eight days the pressure from the us sanctions could deliver deeper economic pain to a very vulnerable venezuela currently most of latin america and the us recognized opposition leader juan guiado as venezuela s interim president maduro appears to have support from russia china and turkey further escalation in sanction action could keep oil prices bid as venezuela production continues to fall tech week tech giants will report this week results are expected from apple amazon microsoft and facebook apple delivered the blow that sent the technology sector crashing on january 2nd after they slashed their revenue forecast for q1 their first cut since 2002 the iphone maker will report earnings on tuesday and many will look for updates on their sales in china and to see if they are successfully growing their services business to compensate for the declining trend in smartphone sales gold gold prices broke out above 1 300 level supported by news that the fed could be ending their balance sheet runoff sooner than they originally expected the precious metal was also supported by downbeat growth concerns from davos and dovish ecb that now sees risks tilted to the downside the battered tech sector is also reporting earnings this week and if technology delivers weaker forecast than what are already priced in we could see safe havens have another leg higher

by idn by jaya ramachandran the convergence of several significant risks is endangering efforts to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the universally adopted plan containing 17 specific goals to promote prosperity and social well being while protecting the environment a new report has warned the risks with the potential to severely disrupt economic activity and inflict significant damage on longer term development prospects include waning support for multilateral approaches the escalation of trade policy disputes financial instabilities linked to elevated levels of debt and rising climate risks as the world experiences an increasing number of extreme weather events alongside various short term risks there is an increasing urgency to deal with much more fundamental problems what we have hitherto viewed as long term challenges such as climate change have become immediate short term risks elliott harris un chief economist and assistant secretary general for economic development said the report titled united nations world economic situation and prospects 2019 underscores that strengthening global cooperation is central to advancing sustainable development though the multilateral approach to global policymaking is facing significant challenges including a trend toward greater unilateral actions pressures have materialized in the areas of international trade international development finance and tackling climate change these threats come at a time when international cooperation and governance are more important than ever many of the challenges laid out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development are global by nature and require collective and cooperative action waning support for multilateralism also raises questions around the capacity for collaborative policy action in the event of a widespread global shock adds the report it warns that after an expansion of 3 1 percent in 2018 the global economy will continue to grow at a steady pace of around 3 percent in 2019 and 2020 however a worrisome combination of development challenges could further undermine growth commenting the report un secretary general antónio guterres said while global economic indicators remain largely favourable they do not tell the whole story the report raises concerns over the sustainability of global economic growth in the face of rising financial social and environmental challenges he added the report launched on january 21 expects growth in the united states to decelerate to 2 5 percent in 2019 and 2 percent in 2020 as the impulse from fiscal stimulus in 2018 wanes steady growth of 2 percent is projected for the european union although risks are tilted to the downside including a potential fallout from brexit growth in china is expected to moderate from 6 6 percent in 2018 to 6 3 percent in 2019 with policy support partly offsetting the negative impact of trade tensions several large commodity exporting countries such as brazil nigeria and the russian federation are projected to see a moderate pickup in growth in 2019 2020 though from a low base however economic growth is uneven and is often failing to reach where it is most needed states the un report it warns that per capita incomes will stagnate or grow only marginally in 2019 in several parts of africa western asia and latin america and the caribbean this is because even where per capita growth is strong often core industrial and urban regions drive economic activity leaving peripheral and rural areas behind eradicating poverty by 2030 will require both double digit growth in africa and steep reductions in income inequality declares the report the report points out that amid the rise in global trade tensions triggered by u s president donald trump global trade growth moderated over the course of 2018 from growth of 5 3 percent in 2017 to 3 8 percent while tensions have materially impacted some specific sectors stimulus measures and direct subsidies have so far offset much of the direct economic impacts on china and the united states but a prolonged escalation of trade tensions could severely disrupt the global economy directly impacted sectors have already witnessed rising input prices and delayed investment decisions these impacts can be expected to spread through global value chains particularly in east asia slower growth in china and the united states could also reduce the demand for commodities affecting commodity exporters from africa and latin america furthermore as global financial conditions tighten an unexpectedly rapid rise in interest rates or a significant strengthening of the u s dollar could exacerbate emerging market fragilities leading to a heightened risk of debt distress this risk can be further aggravated by global trade tensions monetary policy adjustment in developed economies commodity price shocks or domestic political or economic disruptions cautions the report many low income countries have already experienced a substantial rise in interest burdens countries with a substantial amount of dollar denominated debt high current account or fiscal deficits large external financing needs and limited policy buffers are particularly vulnerable to financial stress the report finds that a fundamental shift in the world powers economic growth is imperative economic decision making must fully integrate the negative climate risks associated with emissions says the report adding that this can be achieved through tools such as carbon pricing measures energy efficiency regulations such as minimum performance standards and building codes and reduction of socially inefficient fossil fuel subsidy regimes governments can also promote policies to stimulate new energy saving technologies such as research and development subsidies in countries that remain highly reliant on fossil fuel production economic diversification is vital asserts the report

performance capped a milestone year for first choice bancorp that included listing on the nasdaq stock exchange and completing our merger with pacific commerce bancorp said peter hui chairman of the board of first choice bancorp we believe these accomplishments have created significant value for our franchise going forward we believe that the strong returns generated from our business model will provide us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks while also supporting our continued growth we had a very productive quarter as we continued to generate solid organic loan growth while fully integrating the operations of pacific commerce bank and ensuring a smooth transition for our new clients and employees said robert m franko president and ceo of first choice bancorp with the beneficial impact of pcb s operations we are seeing positive trends across our key performance metrics including lower funding costs an expanding net interest margin and an improved efficiency ratio we also continue to have outstanding asset quality and had no net charge offs in the quarter in 2019 we will remain focused on the disciplined expense management that has been in place since the merger we also expect to capitalize on our larger presence in southern california to continue attracting new customers to the company generating solid

income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 19 5 million an increase of 3 7 million from 15 8 million for the third quarter of 2018 due to higher interest income of 3 9 million partially offset by higher interest expense of 190 thousand interest income increased due to higher average interest earning assets and higher yields on such earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2018 average interest earning assets increased 186 2 million for the fourth quarter due primarily to the full quarter impact of the pcb acquisition the earning asset yield increased 33 basis points during the fourth quarter due in part to higher accelerated accretion from early loan payoffs of 400 thousand and higher federal reserve bank frb and federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb dividends of 200 thousand the fourth quarter of 2018 included frb dividends of 100 thousand and a special fhlb dividend of 100 thousand there were no similar amounts in the third quarter of 2018 first choice bank

of 2018 increased 37 basis points to 5 34 from 4 97 for the third quarter of 2018 the increase was driven by higher market rates on new loan production and loan repricing higher accelerated accretion of discounts due to early loan payoffs the frb and special fhlb dividends and the improved funding mix the loan yield for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 17 basis points to 6 49 from 6 32 for the

42 basis points to the third quarter of 2018 loan yield the fourth and third quarters of 2018 included accelerated discount accretion due to early payoffs of loans of 630 thousand and 230 thousand which expanded the net interest margin 17 basis points and 7 basis points respectively the accretion of net discounts on the acquired pcb loans contributed 882 thousand or 24 basis points to the fourth quarter of 2018 net interest margin compared to 923 thousand or 29 basis points in the third quarter of 2018 the fourth quarter of 2018 also benefited from the addition of the special fhlb

last week the dollar fell and equities tread water after central banks globally signaled a more accommodative stance the us put a band aid over the partial government shutdown and the overall theme at davos showed that most leaders or key executives are concerned that political and economic uncertainty will drive down growth momentum in 2019 this week is highlighted by tech earnings votes on key amendments in uk parliament on tuesday super wednesday with an fomc decision and us china trade talks and the non farm payroll report on friday usd the us dollar fell against its major trading partners after the wall street journal s report that they are considering an earlier than expected end to the bond portfolio runoff the fed is currently tightening via interest rate hikes and shrinking the balance sheet so the possible signal that the fed is closer to ending the balance sheet runoff along with expectations the fed will not consider its next hike until september could be bullish for us stocks and high beta currencies the fed was not the only central bank with a dovish message both the ecb and the boj signaled dovishness and concerns for slower growth the boj cut their inflation outlook for the next three years and see gdp remaining around the 1 0 level the ecb also acknowledged the weaker round of data and noted that the economic outlook has moved to the downside a downgrade from the prior stance of broadly balanced the fomc rate decision on wednesday will closely be watched for further details on the fed s take on the balance sheet we ve come along way from the automatic pilot comment and will look to see if they signal a reduction in the 50 billion monthly amount or a target on when they will stop the nonfarm payroll is also due on friday and is expected to show 165 000 new jobs created in january down from the 312 000 seen in december the us labor remains the strongest part of the us economy but we should not be expected if we see a miss with the january report as contract workers were heavily under pressure due to the shutdown shutdown timeout the record long government shutdown ended on friday when president trump signed a short term spending bill to re open the government while democrats appeared to have one this battle the government is only opened until february 15th and this band aid will have trouble leading to a permanent solution as both sides are nowhere near a bending on positions on border wall funding and a path to citizenship for dreamers aud the australian dollar will likely take a queue from the latest round of trade talks between china and us chinese vice premier liu he will have talks in washington dc from january 30th to 31st about 5 weeks away from the deadline where we could see the escalation of tariffs on chinese goods some progress has been made but trade talks could get tougher here and we may see more political posturing until we get closer to the deadline it is unlikely to see key progress this week on the issue of intellectual property theft and force technology transfers and that could weigh on asian markets gbp the sun reported that british prime minister theresa may explained to cabinet ministers that she will not take the uk out of the eu without a deal and that she will not disclose that a no deal scenario is off the table as she would lose bargaining power with the eu last week s rally in cable was primarily driven on expectations the uk will not go through a hard exit the story in the sun pretty confirms what everyone was thinking the focus this week falls on tuesday s house of commons brexit debate and vote on amendments pm may lose flexibility in how she handles the last couple months of brexit votes preventing a no deal brexit could have her lose a big bargaining chip and the amendment from yvette cooper s allowing the commons to pass a bill that would force pm may to seek an article 50 extension if she cannot get her deal passed oil crude prices rallied last week to a 2 month high as political turmoil in venezuela raised expectations we could see even more oil come off the market venezuela is the owner of the biggest oil reserves and some analysts could see production falling by a third in 2019 over the weekend venezuelan dictator nicolas maduro rebuffed international pressure to call elections within eight days the pressure from the us sanctions could deliver deeper economic pain to a very vulnerable venezuela currently most of latin america and the us recognized opposition leader juan guiado as venezuela s interim president maduro appears to have support from russia china and turkey further escalation in sanction action could keep oil prices bid as venezuela production continues to fall tech week tech giants will report this week results are expected from apple amazon microsoft and facebook apple delivered the blow that sent the technology sector crashing on january 2nd after they slashed their revenue forecast for q1 their first cut since 2002 the iphone maker will report earnings on tuesday and many will look for updates on their sales in china and to see if they are successfully growing their services business to compensate for the declining trend in smartphone sales gold gold prices broke out above 1 300 level supported by news that the fed could be ending their balance sheet runoff sooner than they originally expected the precious metal was also supported by downbeat growth concerns from davos and dovish ecb that now sees risks tilted to the downside the battered tech sector is also reporting earnings this week and if technology delivers weaker forecast than what are already priced in we could see safe havens have another leg higher content is for general information

source imgflip note that due to reader requests i ve decided to break up my weekly portfolio updates into three parts commentary economic update watch lists best stocks to buy now this is to avoid excessively long articles and maximize the utility to my readers this week s commentary outlines the three things all investors need to achieve financial freedom introduction note that i offer these weekly economic updates purely because i believe that investors should always take a holistic big picture view of the world that means knowing the state of the economy and what the short and medium term recession risks likely are however as i ll explain later in this article recession risk section macroeconomic analysis has historically proven to be a terrible tool for stock market timing spy dia qqq which is why i only offer these analyses so that readers will likely be able to see a recession coming about a year or so away that will hopefully allow you the time to prepare yourself emotionally and financially for the downturn it will also hopefully allow you to adjust your portfolio s capital allocation to a more defensive stance such as with defensive sectors or potentially greater allocation to bonds for lower risk tolerant investors fears that the fed and congress be powerless to fight the next recession while a recession is likely still a good ways off at some point one is inevitable and a growing concern many have is that the government s typical response to such downturns won t prove as effective as in the past that s because the traditional response to a recession involves both monetary stimulus 4 to 5 reduction in the fed funds rate and fiscal stimulus higher government spending however with the fed fund rate now at just 2 5 the fed has half the usual amount of dry powder to throw at the next contraction source fomc and while the fed is officially signaling three more rate hikes are coming before the current tightening cycle ends there is good reason to be skeptical that we ll get even one more rate cut source cme group currently the bond futures market where financial institutions invest billions of dollars to lock in future interest rates via options is estimating just a 26 9 of the fed hiking even once more in the next nine meetings in fact the longer term bond futures market is forecasting that the fed will not just hold off on additional rate hikes this year instead of two hikes as planned but even cut in 2020 rather than raise a third and final time but even if the fed were to raise rates to 3 25 as the latest dot plot shows that is still a relatively paltry amount to cut in the face of a contraction what about more quantitative easing bond buying well the trouble with that is that even the fed s own studies one in 2015 and another in 2017 show that while qe 1 was effective at preventing another depression qe 2 through 4 including operation twist didn t significantly boost growth according to st louis fed economist stephen d williamson with respect to qe there are good reasons to be skeptical that it works as advertised and some economists have made a good case that qe is actually detrimental st louis federal reserve what s more using two real world examples japan and canada williamson points out â thus in these two natural experiments there appears to be no evidence that qe works either to increase inflation if we look at the japanese case or to increase real gdp if we compare canada with the u s â canada never tried qe yet has grown roughly as fast as the us since the great recession ended japan famously invented qe with 24 rounds of it and counting and thus the bank of japan s balance sheet is now enormous in fact as of august 2018 the boj owned 40 of all japanese treasuries in existence source oecd while there is nothing preventing the fed from potentially matching the boj s much larger relative balance sheet via 16 trillion worth of bond buying japan s experience shows there would be little benefit to our economy s fundamentals for instance despite pretty much continuous qe since 2013 japan s inflation rate has only once hit the boj s 2 long term target the japanese central bank has pretty much given up on that goal nor has epic amounts of money printing done much for japan s economy which has basically spent the last decade growing at about 1 or about half as fast as america s the reason that qe forever isn t a pathway to prosperity is that economic growth is ultimately a function of two things labor force growth productivity growth japan s labor force has been shrinking for many years a secular trend that is expected to continue for the foreseeable future due to the country s super low fertility rate productivity growth has also been very low as it has in most developed nations for reasons economists are still debating but the point is that qe is not the solution to a us recession unless it s caused by a severe financial crisis not likely due to our much stronger banking sector and lack of dangerous leveraged financial products on their balance sheets and even then qe can only prevent a depression not restore a nation to strong growth not supported by its fundamentals as for fiscal stimulus well the us is now expected to have a 1 trillion deficit in 2019 and that figure is expected to rise over time even without a recession source cbo now there s nothing theoretically preventing the federal government from still spending 1 trillion on something like infrastructure to boost the economy even in the face of such massive debt data by ycharts after all with us treasury yields still so much higher than in other countries 30 year german bonds yield 0 79 and in the uk 1 8 the us treasury would likely be able to find many eager buyers for us treasuries to finance as much stimulus as congress wants the issue with fiscal stimulus is political we just experienced a 35 day partial government shutdown the longest in history over a disagreement over 5 7 billion for 200 miles of border fencing in today s hyper polarized political climate it s not realistic to assume that democrats and republicans in congress will come together during a recession and agree on a large stimulus package heck the 825 billion 2009 american recovery and reinvestment act had a hard time passing and that was during the worst recession since the great depression so with the fed and congress likely to be limited in what they can do does that mean we re doomed to watch in horror as the next recession devastates the economy and the lives of tens of millions of americans fortunately no are greatly overblown first it s important to remember that the next recession is very unlikely to be as severe as the last one that was triggered by a global credit meltdown caused by trillions of dollars of derivatives based on subprime mortgage bonds that were held on the balance sheets of pretty much every major bank in the world with the exception of canada s backing out the great recession the average recession lasts about 12 months and sees gdp decline by 1 7 thus even with absolutely no response from the government we re not likely to see an economic calamity and in reality the fed will still cut rates to zero which will have a mild stimulatory effect that should keep the recession to 15 to 18 months in duration and should the recession prove as bad as the last one well then the fed has a few new tools it could try that would be unprecedented but not leave it completely helpless including negative interest rates and helicopter money in fact former fed chair ben bernanke has even written a three part series about what the fed could do during the next recession while none of these solutions are ideal nor would they be free of unintended consequences they would also not likely be necessary during a typical recession as for federal stimulus we re likely to get some package through even the most gridlocked congress if the recession is bad enough i m not a fan of soaring deficits but as japan has shown government debt gdp ratios can rise to well over 200 without triggering the kind of greece style disaster than many fiscal hawks fear that s as long as a country controls its money supply as we do and is better off economically than its major developed rivals as we are but again it s important to remember that even without a stimulus package a 2 5 cut in short term interest rates would still likely be sufficient to eventually lead our economy out of recession the economic cycle has always existed and recessions didn t last forever even before monetary and fiscal stimulus was invented by our government in the 20th century current economic growth q3 3 4 final estimate q4 about 2 6 to 2 7 full year 2018 2 9 to 3 1 q1 2019 1 7 to 3 2 lower estimate accounts for government shutdown 2019 2 3 to 2 7 source atlanta federal reserve every major gdp model uses slightly different combinations and weightings on leading indicators to estimate the current growth rate of the economy thus the actual weekly figure is far less important than the trend of the estimate the atlanta fed s model is the most volatile one i track yet now effectively matches the consensus estimate as well as that of the new york fed source new york federal reserve the new york fed s gdp model which tends to err on the conservative side is siding with the consensus estimate with a 2 6 growth forecast for q4 2018 the weak growth in q1 should not be alarming since q1 of any given year is typically the weakest quarter for growth source now casting com nowcasting remains the most bullish forecast with 3 2 growth expected this quarter though that s down from earlier estimates as high as 4 at least partially due to the government shutdown that estimate has fallen to as low as 3 in recent weeks but will hopefully recover as the quarter continues i consider this model to be the upper range of possible us growth rates while it s certainly disappointing that us growth is slowing going into 2019 i must remind you that this was entirely expected by nearly all economists and analysts slower growth is not negative growth and does not indicate the risk of a recession is high especially in 2019 recession risk very low the probability that we re in a recession right now 0 8 the probability of a recession starting in the next three months 7 4 the probability of a recession starting in the next nine months 20 i use eight key meta analyses to track the health of the economy that includes those which have historically proven to be good predictors of recessions the 10y 2y yield curve the 10y 3m yield curve most accurate the base line and rate of change or bar economic graph jeff miller s meta analysis of leading economic indicators the st louis fed s smoothed out recession risk indicator and the new york atlanta fed s and now casting com s real time gdp growth trackers source business insider the yield curve has proven the single most accurate predictor of recessions over the past 80 years specifically when the curve inverts or goes below 0 because short term rates rise above long term rates then a recession becomes highly likely it usually begins within 12 18 months yield curve inversion date recession start date months to recession once curve inverts august 1978 january 1980 17 september 1980 july 1981 10 december 1988 july 1990 19 february 2000 march 2001 13 december 2005 december 2007 24 average 16 6 click to enlarge source st louis federal reserve ben carlson according to a march 2018 report from the san francisco fed an inverted yield curve has correctly signaled all nine recessions since 1955 and had only one false positive in the mid 1960s when an inversion was followed by an economic slowdown but not an official recession in other words if the yield curve goes negative there is probably a 90 chance of a recession starting within the next 17 months or so unfortunately investors hoping to use the yield curve to time market tops are out of luck while a yield curve inversion is very accurate at predicting recessions with long lead times its track record on predicting bear markets is far less impressive 10y 2y yield curve inversion vs bear market starts source wealth of common sense the lag time between market tops and yield curve inversions is all over the map ranging from just 2 months in 2000 to nearly 2 years in 2005 and if we go back to 1956 using the 10y 1y yield curve we can also see that yield curve inversions are largely useless for timing bear market starts in fact on three occasions the forward looking market has actually peaked before the curve inverted this means that the yield curve should not be used as a market timing mechanism but rather purely as a good recession risk indicator current 10y 2y yield curve 0 15 down from 0 16 3 weeks ago on december 3rd the 5y 3y warning curve its inversion has heralded the 10y 2y inversion by a few months for 40 years inverted but on december 14th it uninverted currently 0 01 this shows why it s important not to panic about a warning curve inversion because yield curves can go up as well as down but more important than the 10y 2y curve is the 10y 3m curve source san francisco federal reserve according to an august 2018 study by the san fran fed the best summary measure is the spread between the ten year and three month yields â 10y 3m yield curve 0 38 down from 0 47 3 weeks ago according to a dallas fed bank survey banks are closely watching the 10y 3m curve and plan to pull back on lending and thus cause the recession they fear when this curve inverts fortunately that curve the most accurate recession predictor of all has been flattening at a highly predictable rate if that trend continues then it will take 11 6 months for the 10y 3m curve to invert at which point we re likely about a year away from recession that means that my best estimate of the next recession start date is 20 6 to 27 6 months november 2020 to june 2021 most likely february 2021 but it s important to remember that you shouldn t fear a flat yield curve as a sign of poor short to medium term stock performance during the strongest bond market in us history tech boom the yield curve was as low or even lower than it is now of course that was also an epic bubble but the point is that a flat but positive yield curve is not a sign of poor returns ahead average monthly stock market returns by 10y 2y yield curve slope since 1976 source bloomberg in fact over the past 42 years the period when monthly stock returns were at their highest and volatility was at its lowest was when the yield curve was flat but positive this means that we re likely in the sweet spot right now and investors should avoid using fears of yield curve inversion as a reason for market timing that s because even after an inversion occurs stocks tend to continue rising for quite some time and tend to generate strong returns before the next bear market begins that s true of the 10y 3m curve inversions as well which typically see stocks rise by 35 more post inversion source fisher investments basically the yield curve is a totally binary indicator positive very low recession risk carry on with long term investing plans negative 90 chance recession is coming within 6 to 24 months most likely 18 months consider getting more defensive the second economic indicator i watch is david rice s aka economic pi baseline and rate of change or bar economic analysis grid this is another meta analysis incorporating 19 leading indicators that track every aspect of the us economy that includes the yield curve though a different version of it i consider it the best overall indicator of fundamental economic health because it s so granular source economic pi the bar grid has shown to be a reliable indicator predicting the 1980 1990 2001 and 2007 recessions source david rice currently 12 out of 19 economic indicators are pointing to positive economic growth with eight indicating negative growth that number of negative indicators is up from three five weeks ago source david rice note that over the past 36 weeks the number of leading indicators in the decline quadrant has ranged from three to 12 there is a lot of volatility between the number of indicators showing decelerating or accelerating growth this is just statistical noise and only long term trends should be used as recession risk warning signs unfortunately the trend is now distinctly negative and points to a recession potentially beginning in 2020 or 2021 in line with what the yield curve is telling us source david rice to avoid unnecessary concern the best use of bar is to look at the 3 month moc over time this allows you to see the entire big picture view of how our economy is growing source david rice according to mr rice the peaking of the moc usually happens about two years from the start of a recession which backs up what the yield curve and other models are saying next there s jeff miller s excellent economic indicator snapshot a rich source of numerous useful market economic data it also provides an actual percentage probability estimate for how likely a recession is to start in the next few months source jeff miller what i m looking at here is the quantitative estimates of short term recession risks in this case the four month recession risk is about 7 4 while the probability of a recession starting within nine months is down from 24 to 20 in the past month the short term recession risk is highly volatile ranging from 0 24 to 7 44 since i began tracking the economy over that past nine months the sharp spike in the short term recession risk is largely due to the shutdown which has ended and won t return until february 15th at the earliest it would be the 4th shutdown in 13 months thus the more important thing to focus on isn t the absolute figure but the trends in both short term and medium term recession risks both have shown low risks with the 9 month recession risk being highly stable at 24 all year and now falling to 20 the falling inflation expectations are due to lower inflation expectations the high equity risk premium earnings yield minus 10 year yield is good news that indicates that stocks are now attractively priced and we re possibly bottomed from the correction in december for a final look at recession risk i like to use the st louis fed s smoothed out recession risk indicator this looks at the risk of a recession beginning in the current month it s actually delayed two months it uses a four month running average of leading economic indicators source st louis federal reserve since 1967 this smoothed out recession probability estimator has predicted five of the last seven recessions before they have started the key is that as long as the recession risk is at 3 9 or below the economy is very unlikely to be in a recession at 0 80 risk right now up from 0 in july 2018 this indicates that the us economy is likely to keep expanding for the foreseeable future if the short term recession risk surpasses 3 it s time to start being worried but for now there is no cause for concern bottom line no the government won t be powerless to fight the next recession but political realities might make it last longer again i m not a market timer just a macroeconomics nerd my major in college who wants to ensure my readers and i see the big picture any estimates of when recessions and bear markets are likely to begin are purely based on historical averages and the most time tested models we have they are probabilistic and not definition predictions that should be used for market timing purposes basically these weekly economic updates are not meant for market timing purposes but rather to allow you to prepare yourself emotionally and financially for when a recession does inevitably happen it s also meant to give you around a year s warning hopefully longer to adapt your portfolio s capital allocation strategy that might mean stockpiling some cash to take advantage of future bargains during a bear market putting new capital to work in more defensive companies utilities healthcare telecom consumer staples or for the most risk averse investors potentially moving some money into bonds or cash equivalents asset allocation changes personally i m now in recession prep mode which means i m focused on paying off all margin 116 000 worth down from a peak of 139 000 ahead of the next bear market which is still a long way off but it will take me about 14 months to pay off that much margin which is why i m starting now the next likely recession start date around late 2020 to mid 2021 most likely february 2021 the next likely bear market start date around mid 2020 to late 2020 most likely june 2020 i m not actually being defensive since i m still 100 in stocks and have no plans to sell before the next market downturn starts nor do i recommend most investors switch from their current long term investment plans which should already have you in the right asset allocation that best meets your personal needs and risk profile as for the fears that the fed and federal government will be powerless to fight the next recession there s good and bad news while both the fed and congress s monetary fiscal power will likely be more limited due to the political realities of today rate cuts and modest stimulus most likely infrastructure spending will be able to provide some boost to the economy against a severe recession like the last one that would indeed be insufficient but given that the next downturn is likely to be a historical 1 to 2 economic contraction even modest stimulus will be able to end the recession though it might last another quarter or two beyond the usual 12 months
philippine peso stability relies on duterteâ s infrastructure success recent concerns about peso s depreciation have been exaggerated in the most dangerous international environment since the postwar era there is no room for complacency however in the past international and domestic critics of the duterte government have complained that the philippine peso has fallen six straight years which is seen as a sign of the failure of duterte agenda in march 2017 bloomberg reported that asia s ugly duckling of 2017 is the peso thanks to duterte at the time peso s weakening was explained oddly enough by investors who had been spooked by allegations of unlawful killings and corruption more recently the peso is said to face an additional threat a mid term election that may compound concerns about its economy this time bloomberg believes that political uncertainties pose an added source of pressure yet recent surveys do not seem to support such speculation still other reports see political risks where such do not necessarily exist while approaching the peso s weakening as if it was fueled by mainly internal forces in reality most currencies in emerging markets have depreciated since first expectations that the u s will start rate normalization and when the actual rate hikes began about six straight years ago well before duterte figure since the fed s signaling of normalization and rate hikes philippine peso has depreciated almost in parallel forces behind peso movements a series of well known forces have fueled recent peso depreciation in the fall inflation reached an intolerable high of 6 7 it was boosted by a price effect associated with tax reforms train rising oil prices and a failure to manage rice prices accordingly philippine peso depreciated until early october yet the pressures that have been associated with overheating are likely to weaken in 2019 as the train related price pressures should ease in the coming months also the slowing international economy has penalized oil crude oil exceeded 75 in early october but is now around 55 a u s sino trade compromise could contribute to rising prices again however in the past the quota system failed to keep rice price in control the new import tariff system should stabilize it moreover high loan growth has made some observers uneasy while it is associated with the infrastructure drive it has to be monitored most importantly perhaps some observers feel uncomfortable with current account deficit cad yet the widening cad is the effect of the infrastructure drive it has been expanding as a result of imports which support infrastructure development furthermore the slowdown of electronic exports which account for more than half of philippine exports is hardly a domestic challenge u s trade wars have undermined the recovery of world trade however there are some possible new shifts in the international horizon last year the tighter dollar boosted by the fed s rate hikes went hand in hand with tighter financial conditions that is no longer the case also last year trump s tax cuts gave a one time high for the u s economy but now u s growth may have peaked accordingly the prospects of slower growth and lower inflation may have made the fed less hawkish risky international environment budget passage nevertheless the international environment including u s trade wars poses more threats than ever since the postwar era if the u s sino trade truce paves way to a compromise by march 1 world demand may improve but if the tensions spread as they did last year world demand is likely to further deteriorate and even if trade compromise can be found tensions are likely to linger in the technology sector moreover the white house may target the asean in its trade wars as it has suggested since mid 2018 in 2018 the philippines expansion amounted to 6 2 although inflation did penalize the government s downwardly revised goal of 6 5 to 6 9 the country is one of the fastest growing economies in asia and relatively well positioned to absorb shocks moreover the bangko sentral ng filipinas bsp hiked policy rates several times in 2018 which makes further tightening less likely in 2019 yet the status quo permits no complacency the inflation induced reduction of the country s economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 which penalized the annual figure should serve as a warning sign for a belated 2019 budget passage even if a re enacted budget were to be passed now the infrastructure programs that are of critical national importance cannot proceed until after the mid year that in turn has potential to harm the current year s economic growth once again time is money consequently a rapid 2019 budget passage is vital the duterte fiscal expansion has potential to continue well into the early 2020s which bodes well for economic growth as long as political impasse does not penalize economic progress dr steinbock is the founder of the difference group and has served as the research

personal finances the good news is figuring out how to get a handle on financial management doesn t have to be complicated there s just a few must do tasks you need to accomplish to take control over your financial situation once and for all advertisement advertisement to help you get started here are 10 essential tasks you should do if you want to get your personal finances in order 1 figure out who you owe money to and make a debt payoff plan do you know the total amount of debt you have if you re like most americans you probably have student loans credit card debt and maybe a mortgage personal loan or medical loan far too many people have lots of different lenders they owe money to and just make minimum payments on each debt without looking at the big picture if you do that you could be in debt for a very long time instead of just living with your debt take control over it check your credit report to get a complete list of lenders you owe and check with each lender to find out the outstanding loan balance and interest rate then make a plan for how to tackle your debt advertisement advertisement you may not want to pay off mortgages or student loans early because the interest rate on these types of debts is usually lower than the rate of return you can earn from investments but you should focus on paying off higher interest debts such as credit cards you can adopt either the debt snowball or debt avalanche payoff method and should focus on sending extra payments to either your debt with the highest interest rate or the debt with the smallest balance calculate how much extra you can send to your debt each month and see how long it will take you to become debt free if you follow your planned repayment schedule if you get serious about debt repayment and monitor your progress hopefully you can quickly pay off what you owe and stop wasting so much money on interest 2 check your credit report and correct any mistakes according to the federal trade commission around 1 in 5 americans have mistakes on their credit report if your report has errors that hurt your credit score you could be denied for loans or might have to pay more when you borrow you don t want someone else s negative info on your report to cost you money so you should make a point to check your credit regularly advertisement advertisement checking your credit report on a regular basis also helps you spot identity theft and track your debt payoff plan it s something everyone should do if they care about their personal finances especially since checking your credit is free you can just visit annualcreditreport com to obtain one free copy of your credit report each year from each of the three major credit reporting agencies equifax experian and transunion 3 find out your credit score and work to improve it checking your credit report will allow you to monitor what creditors are reporting about you but it won t reveal your credit score advertisement advertisement your credit score is one of your most vital financial numbers you re scored on a scale of 300 to 850 and want a score above 700 to have at least good credit obviously the higher the score the better you can check your credit score for free using services such as mint or from credit card companies such as discover unless your score is well above 700 you have room to improve and should work on improving it you can do this by making on time payments on all debt payment history is actually the most important factor in determining your score so you always want to pay all your bills on time if you have a late payment on your credit report you might also want to contact the creditor by sending a goodwill letter and asking if they might be willing to stop reporting this negative info if you ve generally paid on time and been a responsible borrower they might be willing and this could give your score a big boost paying off your debt the second most important factor in determining your credit score is your credit utilization ratio the ratio is calculated by dividing credit used by credit available to you if you re using 2 000 in credit on a credit card with a 10 000 line of credit you d calculate your ratio by dividing 2 000 by 10 000 you d have a 20 utilization ratio in this case the lower the ratio the better but ratios above 30 can have a big negative impact on your credit limiting new credit you take on while having a mix of different kinds of credit is important to earn the highest credit score opening new credit cards or taking out new loans can also hurt your score opening new accounts reduces your average age of credit while having a longer average age is necessary to earn the highest credit score applying for new credit also results in an inquiry going on your credit report and too many inquiries can cause your score to drop to avoid the undesirable consequences of taking out a bunch of new loans limit the credit you apply for when you work to improve your credit score it will be much easier for you to borrow at an affordable cost when you need to 4 make and live on a budget if you hope to accomplish many essential personal finance goals you need to be in control of your money the only way you can do that is to give your money a job by using a budget when you create a budget you can decide how much money to save can see how much money you have to spend and can make sure your combined spending and saving doesn t exceed your income advertisement advertisement there are different approaches to budgeting if you don t like feeling constrained you could make a 50 30 20 budget this simply involves limiting spending on needs to 50 of income and spending on wants to 30 of income while saving the remaining 20 this works for some people as long as you actually save 20 and don t overspend on the other categories others will need a more detailed budget to make sure their money is going to the right place you could allocate every dollar specifying how much will go to rent transportation eating out savings clothes and other routine expenses if you take this approach the goal will be to have your budgeted funds including spending and saving add up exactly to your monthly income that way you can make sure you know how your cash is being used and make sure it s being used wisely 5 save an emergency fund with three to six months of living expenses if you re living paycheck to paycheck you ll never really have your financial life under control because a single emergency could send you into debt emergencies are inevitable and unexpected expenses crop up all the time for everyone you need to make sure you have money set aside for these surprise costs you ll definitely incur advertisement advertisement ideally you should save enough money to cover three to six months of living expenses this should be kept in an accessible savings account you can access if you need to but that you leave alone if you don t while this can be hard to do you can work up to this amount by saving over time when you have a big emergency fund you ll have the peace of mind of knowing you can cover major car or home repairs keep paying your mortgage after a job loss or cope with serious illness you ll be in much better financial shape and you can avoid borrowing when something goes wrong 6 open a retirement account and start putting money into it you need to save not only for emergencies but also for the long term you cannot live on social security alone as social security is only designed to replace around 40 of pre retirement income while most experts suggest you need around 70 to 80 of the income you had while still working and most people don t have pensions from employers any more so it s up to you to save enough for retirement advertisement advertisement make sure you re putting aside money right now so you don t end up destitute when you cannot work any longer if you have a 401 k at work sign up for automatic contributions if you haven t already if you don t open an ira and set up automatic contributions from your bank account on payday ideally you should aim for saving at least 15 of your income but you may have to work up to this amount a 401 k and ira both provide you with tax breaks for saving since you can invest with pre tax dollars not having to pay taxes on funds you put into your 401 k or ira can make investing cheaper and easier 7 open some savings accounts to save for other big goals finally if you want to get your personal finances in order you ll also need to save for other short term and long term goals advertisement advertisement everyone has things they want that they cannot afford to buy outright this might be a downpayment for a house college for your kids or even just a vacation if you don t save for these goals you ll have to go into debt to achieve them or may not be able to achieve them at all it s a good idea to open a few different savings accounts so you can allocate funds to different objectives you could have a car repair account you put money into for example as well as a vacation fund a down payment fund and a 529 to save for college for your child when you make your budget you can decide how much money you have available to put towards each of these goals and you can and should consider setting up automated contributions to each account so you ll know you ll always hit your savings milestones 8 learn how to build a diversified portfolio of investments when you ve saved an emergency fund or are saving money you ll need within five years the money should be kept in a savings account where it can be easily accessed but if you re saving for the long term you ll need to earn a better return on your investment than a savings account can provide otherwise your money will grow really slowly and it may not even keep pace with inflation which would mean it continually loses value and your buying power drops advertisement advertisement historically the stock market has provided the best returns on investment over time so you should put some of your money into the market but you don t want to do this until you know how to build a diversified portfolio diversification helps to protect you from loss because you spread your money around into different assets that way if some investments perform poorly others will hopefully do well building a diversified portfolio doesn t have to be hard using exchange traded funds is one of the easiest ways to do it exchange traded funds etfs essentially allow you to pool your money with the funds of a whole bunch of other people and gain exposure to lots of different assets there are etfs meant to track the performance of the u s market emerging markets small companies large companies bond investments real estate investments and more if you pick a few different low cost or commission free etfs that give you exposure to different kinds of investments you should easily be able to build a diversified portfolio to minimize your risk while giving your investments a good chance to grow 9 get the insurance coverage you need once you ve started building wealth you have to protect the assets you re acquiring this means you need to insure against risk obviously you need auto insurance to protect you from loss in case of a car accident and because the law requires it you also need health insurance so an illness doesn t bankrupt you and homeowner s or renter s insurance in case your home or possessions are damaged destroyed or stolen and life insurance can protect your family in case of your death while a disability policy ensures you won t lose everything if you get too sick to work you may also decide to buy an umbrella policy which provides additional coverage on top of your auto and home insurance an umbrella policy provides strong protection for your assets because if you re sued for more than your auto or homeowner s policies provide the umbrella policy pays and your personal assets aren t at risk if you aren t sure what kinds of insurance you require an insurance agent can help you you should evaluate the risks you face and consider purchasing insurance to share that risk with insurance companies to protect your own financial life 10 start tracking your net worth your net worth is the most important financial number it tells you how you re doing with your money it s calculated by adding up all you own and subtracting all of the money you owe so if you had a house valued at 300 000 100 000 invested across all your bank and investment accounts 20 000 worth of personal property and a 20 000 car you d own 440 000 worth of property if you owed 250 000 on your house 50 000 on student loans and 15 000 on your car you d owe 315 000 your net worth is calculated by subtracting 315 000 from 440 000 so your net worth would be 125 000 many people start out with a negative net worth because they graduate from college with debt and don t own much of anything but as you take these other steps to get your personal finances in order your assets should grow and your debts should shrink you should move into a positive net worth and hopefully one day will have a very high net worth so you own far more than you owe and can be considered wealthy by monitoring your net worth over time you can see if you re moving in the right direction and will hopefully become more motivated to pay off debt save and acquire valuable assets do these 10 things and your personal finances will be in great shape if you can accomplish the 10 tasks on this to do list you ll be in a great financial position and should feel in total control of your financial life start checking these tasks off your list today you don t have to do them all at once but after you ve accomplished them all you ll be very glad you made the effort the motley fool owns and recommends mastercard and visa and recommends american express we re firm believers in the golden rule if we

looking for jobs desperate for five more years in power india s hindu nationalist government will woo rural and urban middle class voters with farm relief measures and tax cuts said officials privy to plans for the final budget before a general election stung by opposition parties victories in three state polls last month and needing to call a national election by may prime minister narendra modi is facing growing discontent over depressed farm incomes and doubts over whether his policies are creating enough jobs the electoral compulsions mean that major economic reforms such as tax cuts for bigger companies and plans to bring down the budget deficit could be put on hold at least until after the election the sources said piyush goyal india s interim finance minister will present the budget on february 1 in the absence of finance minister arun jaitley who is currently in the united states for medical treatment the higher spending along with a shortfall in tax collections will push the fiscal deficit up to the equivalent of 3 5 per cent of gross domestic product for the year ending in march overshooting a previous 3 3 per cent target according to one of the sources with direct knowledge of budget discussions that would fit with the expectations of a reuters poll of economists the source said there was a chance that the government could take corrective action in march hoping that by that time the election schedule will be settled and the public focus will shift toward campaigning we may resort to spending cuts in march to contain the fiscal deficit the source said the finance ministry had cut capital and other spending amounting to 750 8 billion indian rupees in the last financial year ending in march 2018 but modi s government has been stepping back from such fiscal rectitude in recent months in its desperation to find ways to pay for pre election spending the government has also pressed the central bank to part with more of its reserves causing a rift that culminated in the resignation of the bank s governor last month this is an election budget and most of the economic reforms have been put on hold said another official adding the government could defer any decision on business demands for a cut in corporate tax business leaders said the government still has to meet its three year old promise of cutting the corporate tax rate for larger companies to 25 per cent from 30 per cent although all over the world overall tax has started coming down india is one of the large economies which has corporate taxes on the higher side said rohinton sidhwa partner at deloitte india the budget which is interim and is likely to be followed by a full one in july is expected to project economic growth of around 7 5 per cent for the next financial year while expanding capital spending on railways roads ports by 7 8 per cent and estimating an increase in revenue of about 15 per cent officials said but the main focus will be on the rural sector and the urban middle class the government is ready with relief measures for farmers benefits for unemployed youth higher tax exemptions for the middle class and small businesses the officials said according to two government sources the farm relief package itself could run to at least 14 billion if the government is to have a meaningful impact on which way voters lean in rural areas where two thirds of indians live the pre election giveaways could give the economy short term momentum but result in a hangover after the election credit rating agencies have warned that without bringing down other spending a higher farm subsidy bill will increase future fiscal deficits in the absence of new revenue boosting measures the policies will collectively make it harder for the government to achieve its fiscal consolidation objectives moody s investors service said last week though he has spent big on building roads and railways modi has been fiscally conservative for most of his time in power helping to bring retail inflation to near 2 per cent from double digits during the previous government s time last month s state election upsets have made the modi government shed some of that caution despite expanding by 7 per cent plus annually the fastest pace among major economies the uneven nature of the growth has meant that the economy has failed to create enough jobs for millions of youth entering the workforce each year merchandise exports have shown no signs of growth in last four years and some textile leather and engineering goods producers have shifted production abroad earlier this month the centre for monitoring indian economy cmie a leading independent think tank issued a report showing the country lost as many as 11 million jobs last year making it even harder for new entrants to the labor market last week raghuram rajan former governor of the reserve bank of india said india needed flexible labour and land laws and to fix glitches in the goods and services tax launched as a major tax reform in 2017 we need two percentage points more growth to provide those jobs that are needed said rajan

pressure after ending last week s trading roughly flat a negative reaction to earnings news from caterpillar cat is likely to weigh on the markets with the heavy equipment maker slumping by 5 8 percent in pre market trading the drop by caterpillar comes after the company reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings and forecast full year 2019 earnings below analyst estimates caterpillar chairman and ceo jim umpleby said the outlook assumes a modest sales increase based on the fundamentals of our diverse end markets as well as the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment early trading activity may be somewhat subdued however as traders look ahead to key events later this week including the release of the labor department s closely watched monthly jobs report on friday the federal reserve s monetary policy decision on wednesday is also likely to attract attention although the central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged after last month s rate hike traders are also likely to watch closely for any news regarding a new round of trade talks between u s and chinese officials in washington this week following the volatility seen over the two

lot of progress in trade talks a report from reuters said mnuchin is looking forward to a meeting with chinese vice premier liu he next week which will also include discussions on currency issues the comments from mnuchin conflict with remarks by commerce secretary wilbur ross who told cnbc on thursday the u s is miles and miles from a trade deal with china frankly that shouldn t be too surprising

setting government shutdown trump revealed in a speech from the white house rose garden that lawmakers will vote later today on legislation to fund the shuttered parts of the government until february 15th the bill will not include money for trump s controversial border wall which was the issue that led to the longest government shutdown in u s history trump indicated that the three weeks of funding provided by the legislation would give lawmakers time to negotiate on the contentious issue of border security many disagree but i really feel that working with democrats and republicans we can make a truly great and secure deal happen for everyone trump said with the announcement trump seemed to give in to democratic demands to re open the government before negotiating on border security however if an agreement on border security is not reached by february 15th trump suggested the government could shut down again or he could declare the situation on the border a national

between grievances and state violence o n june 16 2012 female students at the university of khartoum mounted a demonstration that released a wave of protest on campuses and major towns across sudan the young women exited the university gates chanting freedom freedom demanding the liberation of their campus from the grip of the national intelligence and security services niss and the reversal of a 35 percent hike in bus and train fares announced earlier by the government the spirit of defiance spread outward from the capital city and the political agenda broadened until by mid july thousands of sudanese were in the streets echoing the famous slogan from tunisia and egypt the people want the fall of the regime security forces eventually quashed the demonstrations but not before the state was forced to reinstate subsidies on key commodities notably fuel and to delay the implementation of wide ranging neoliberal economic reforms like the arab uprisings of 2011 the summer long surge of dissent in sudan was led by youth men and women in their late teens twenties and thirties some of whom are students and others of whom are jobless or underemployed the grassroots protest organizations girifna we are fed up and sudan change now are composed heavily of middle class young people as in other arab countries the sudanese youths have adeptly used social media and other high tech communications tools to voice their grievances against the regime as well as their criticisms of the older generation of politicians and increasingly marked ethnic and racial divisions in society for years prior to the arab uprisings there was talk of the youth bulge the high proportion of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 as ted swedenburg has noted the concept of youth is more usefully understood as a socially and culturally determined category than as a narrow age range in the arab world people well into their thirties may find themselves in the life stage defined as youth usually meaning that they are unmarried and not by choice marginally employed and in a position of some dependence on parents or other elders scholars seeking to explain the uprisings have often focused on the youth bulge with some positing that the growing frustration of young people with the lack of jobs awakened them into revolt others have argued that the driver of youth mobilization was not long standing grievances but the opportunity afforded by the increasing interconnectedness of the arab world and the outside world made possible by social media and new information technology sudan too has a youth bulge 17 percent of the population was between 15 24 in 2012 but its youth movement is motivated by both grievance and opportunity the grievances on the one hand can be found in the social and political challenges resulting from economic austerity and the absence of democracy the opportunity on the other hand comes from evolving dynamics of state repression and the erosion of the regime s monopoly on the legitimate means of coercion as in other arab countries sudan s youth movement is distinctly averse to the promotion of a particular ideology and includes young people from across the political spectrum but in contrast to many arab countries in sudan there is little indication that the youth are more supportive of political islam and shari a law than their parents generation perhaps because sudanese have lived under an islamist backed regime since 1989 indeed as one youth organizer noted girifna and sudan change now are composed of older activists primarily in their late twenties and thirties who have grown up almost entirely under the islamists these activists have experienced not only shrinking employment but also increasing repression by the state including tightened surveillance extrajudicial detention sexual assault of male and female leaders and torture indeed what the case of sudan demonstrates is that youth activism in the region is crucially shaped by its dynamic and contingent relationship to the state security forces youth leaders interaction with islamists and variations in the capacity of arab youth to coordinate protest it is these factors that determine the youth movements distinct and often variable political trajectories and their prospects for effecting political change student activism and the nif youth activism has long played a key role in sudanese politics students at the university of khartoum helped to topple the military dictatorships of ibrahim abboud in 1964 and ja far al numayri in 1985 in the 1970s and 1980s partly at numayri s behest university campuses became hotbeds of islamist political activity numayri like anwar al sadat in egypt was seeking to smash the campus left and he succeeded but the young muslim brothers organized as the national islamic front nif turned on their patron and became pillars of the coalition that unseated him immediately upon seizing power in 1989 the nif backed army officers led by influential muslim brothers targeted the university system the regime placed islamists in top jobs in the ministry of education and abolished the campus based protocol for electing university administrators president omar al bashir began personally appointing the members of the national council for higher education and scientific research the body that oversees higher education in the country the nif further implemented the arabization and islamization of the university curriculum making arabic the medium of instruction even for students who spoke another native language created a host of private universities and exerted control over the recruitment and training of teaching staff finally the regime forced students to report to the forbidding camps of its popular defense forces militia before taking up their studies this unprecedented restructuring of the educational system was designed to repress student activism as a way of consolidating power nonetheless the moves sparked resistance in 1990 islamist candidates lost elections to the university of khartoum student union a body they had dominated for almost a decade in the succeeding decade there were periodic clashes on campus between students sympathetic to the nif backed by the security forces and a coalition of student organizations opposed to bashir s rule in the 2000s three important trends combined to revitalize and alter the nature of the student and youth movement demographic change economic austerity and intensified state repression sudan s labor market is heavily dependent on the underdeveloped agricultural and informal sectors these facts along with sudan s high birth rate mean that young people of working age have a hard time finding decent paying jobs an entire generation of middle class sudanese cannot find regular employment and thus cannot afford to marry as of 2012 the labor force participation and unemployment rates among the young stood at 32 9 percent and 22 percent respectively compared to 43 percent and 11 percent for adults more significantly the youngest age group 15 24 men and women suffers from the highest unemployment rate at 20 percent consequently as one scholar has noted youth is no longer a transitory phase between childhood and adulthood but an extended generational stage that presents both new opportunities and a different set of challenges and responsibilities to young people and the society at large against this backdrop the bashir regime now under the banner of the national congress party ncp has introduced policies of economic austerity in accordance with what they promote as a form of islamic free market capitalism in measures that hit students particularly hard the regime cut subsidies of food dormitory lodging and public transportation the quality of student life deteriorated dramatically students interviewed at the university of khartoum emphasized that this decline is most evident in dormitory living in previous decades they noted the state run national fund for student aid ran the dormitories but in 1995 the regime sold off this asset to a private investor with close ties to the ncp consequently the previous system of independently administered colleges became centralized since that time students continued the fund has offered no subsidized meals on campus and no bursary for students in financial need meanwhile the number of students on campus expanded from 16 000 in the late 1990s to 25 000 in 2013 resulting in severe overcrowding in classrooms and dormitories where rooms that used to house three students on average now accommodate eight or more taken together these developments have led to malnutrition and the spread of infectious diseases including tuberculosis on campus in 1998 conflict between student activists and the security forces began in earnest the national fund for student aid literally confiscated lights and furniture from the dormitories and sold these materials on the open market in response the student housing committee called for a protest and on september 27 of that year security forces came on campus and beat the protesters ammar bashari a highly respected student leader was killed bashari s death was a spark igniting the student movement first he is considered the students first martyr under ncp rule second and more important he was a well known islamist his death caused the first break between the ncp islamists and their former loyalists on campus and it also for the first time united islamists with leftist and secular students against the security forces indeed by the end of the 1990s the grievances over bashari s death housing and tuition came to a head with students referring to the fund as the looting of students fund sunduq nahb al tullab to depict the excesses of privatization at the largest public university in sudan demography and austerity have brought protest from several opposition political parties and civil society groups what distinguishes the case of students and youth from other centers of dissent in sudanese society is the nature and degree of state violence and repression deployed against the youth movements the generational rift oft noted by scholars is really a byproduct of the tense relationship between youth and the state and its coercive apparatus state violence and islamist militancy the new student movement and its strategic outlook were born of the heightened confrontations between students and the niss regular police and state sponsored militias in late 2010 following another round of protests over rising tuition and poor accommodations students at the university of khartoum confronted campus ncp loyalists who eventually retreated in retaliation the niss and police entered the university grounds and severely beat protesters scores of whom were injured numerous women were assaulted the security forces primary objective was to strengthen the resolve of their islamist recruits on campus in the face of anti government student protests and what many students refer to as the widening recruitment vacuum these pivotal events united the students and opposition parties around a shared agenda in favor of police accountability and against excessive force the attacks on women in particular were regarded as attacks on the dignity of the overall population the student union newly refashioned made common cause with students belonging to the umma party the left of center democratic front and the popular congress party pcp led by hasan al turabi turabi had dominated the sudanese islamist movement since the 1960s and backed the 1989 coup but by the late 1990s he was at loggerheads with bashir in 1998 turabi then speaker of parliament and ncp secretary general attempted to strip bashir of his executive powers and take over the state himself a year later bashir retaliated by declaring a state of emergency dissolving parliament and removing turabi as head of the ncp their subsequent feud split the islamist movement into two camps the rump of the ncp and the pcp according to students at the university of khartoum the student union s alliance with the pcp and other parties was the beginning of a regime crackdown embodied in the promotion of salafis or aggressively puritanical islamists drawn primarily from the private sudanese african university more ominously the ncp began to support individuals who identified themselves as belonging to al qaeda students related that the ncp afforded these men a rukn or speaker s corner on campus to disseminate their message the regime is also accused of providing funds and social services to those who joined the al qaeda affiliates in addition students involved in the protests in the summer of 2012 said that they witnessed al qaeda supporters being transported by the ncp to locations of demonstrations in order to quell them that much is acknowledged as well by al tayyib mustafa editor of the ncp supporting newspaper al intibaha and uncle of president bashir other respondents reported that al qaeda members were being trained as fighters by the regime in the area of dinder the ncp s dalliance with salafis has already come back to bite the bashir regime in february 2012 a salafi coalition called the islamic constitution front pressed the regime to adopt stricter versions of shari a law that september the front s chairman al sadiq abd al majid excoriated bashir for dragging his feet accusing him of pandering to foreign powers and threatening jihad if the front s demands remained unmet the salafi current in islamist politics is a new one at the university and in the city of khartoum it is made up of an older generation of militants and a new generation signed up in government run mosques that are known to preach takfir or the right of one muslim to declare another a non believer a notion previously absent from sudanese society this new more militant organization split in 2007 from the old guard salafi ansar al sunna founded in 1936 both strands promote the concept of al tasfiya wa al tazkiya or the purification and elimination of false hadiths sayings of the prophet but while the parent organization limits its activities to non political proselytization the younger militants have taken decidedly political stances against other parties and more moderate islamist groups and unabashedly embrace takfir salafis remain a minority in sudan even among self described islamists most sudanese adhere to sufi forms of religiosity with a swath of the educated middle class supportive of the islamist modernism of the muslim brothers from whose ranks the nif came nevertheless the salafis whose rank and file albeit not leaders hail from poorer and less educated strata than the muslim brothers appear to be well funded they have established several mosques and islamic centers and promulgated their ideas through cassette recordings in many parts of khartoum abd al hajj yusuf is one salafi cleric who runs a popular islamic center in the sahafa neighborhood and another notable takfiri salafi muhammad abd al karim has a significant following in poorer neighborhoods on the outskirts of the capital the activist takfiri notion of nahy an al munkar forbidding what is evil has resulted in violent conflict in january during the mulid the celebration of the prophet s birthday which salafis abhor as saint worship salafis attacked sufis in omdurman causing serious injuries in their attempts to enforce the niqab or full face veil members of salafi organizations have been known to flog inappropriately dressed women of all ages in public and on the spot many women thus victimized have reported that police who were present simply refused to intervene these new clients of the state s security apparatus ironically enough have managed to extend the influence and alter the very character of the student and youth movement in the early 2000s the student movement was working to unite the student body on decidedly local issues such as tuition dormitory living conditions and the academic curriculum by 2010 however as a result of increasing clashes with security forces formal and informal the student movement had adopted a self consciously national and radical political agenda indeed just as the organization of the movement occurred in stages so did the evolution of its program in 2009 the majority of youth leaders favored a peaceful and gradual transition to democratic rule students and organizations such as girifna used this period to discuss and debate to begin the task of coordinating protests outside of khartoum and vigorously to support the candidacy of yasir arman in the april 2010 presidential election an ex communist arman represented the northern wing of the sudan people s liberation movement splm the party most associated with the recurrent rebellions in the south that culminated in the independence of south sudan in 2011 his eventual withdrawal from the race disillusioned many youth who began to organize independently around girifna and the newly formed sudan change now according to leaders of sudan change now the fraud in the 2010 election was the spark that lit the fuse of radicalization of students and youth even more than the arab uprisings it was clear then in the opinion of youth activists that the bashir regime was not interested in liberalizing the political system or expanding civil and political liberties so as early as mid 2010 the youth began to prepare the call for the ncp s downfall the rise of girifna is rooted in student activism the pro democracy movement was founded in october 2009 by three leftist middle class students from the university of khartoum who met in omdurman it quickly established branches on other campuses in khartoum as well as in central eastern and western sudan both girifna and sudan change now maintain strong links with the university of khartoum though the movement leaders are careful to operate clandestinely on campus to avoid bringing more security pressure on students regime claims about armed revolt to the contrary girifina and sudan change now are committed to a strategy of peaceful civil disobedience to bring about the end of ncp rule and the advent of democracy in the country recruitment vacuum the conflict on campuses parallels the surprising decline of mainstream ncp identified islamists in civil society and politics by november 2011 it was clear that these islamists had lost the base that had brought them to power in 1989 and sustained the regime for almost two decades middle class students at the universities afraid they would lose ncp students violently disrupted the student union elections that month the contests were canceled there were also clashes at the university of sudan after the islamists closed the doors to the polling station and simply ended the voting by fiat these two events quickly led to a wave of protests against islamists at the universities of nilayn imam al hadi jazira dunqula and sinnar the last institution located in the hometown of president bashir these rallies prefigured the 2012 protests in that they were facilitated by what students said was easy communication by cellular phone and facebook which for the first time forged links among campuses throughout northern and central sudan already by the mid 2000s students report regime recruitment of young islamists on campus was based on material inducements rather than ideology the only students conscripted were those who joined the ncp for money while many more defected to turabi s opposition pcp or the militant salafi groups at present the proportion of university students leaving the ncp organization is far greater than those joining another reason for the weakening of the ncp is the war in darfur prior to the war which began in 2003 the ruling party was very successful at recruiting darfurians into the mainstream islamist organization on campus because it was a route to social mobility by 2006 however the regime was resorting to crude and racist discourse to discredit the darfurian rebels denigrating them as zurga blacks and students from darfur took umbrage during the period 2006 2008 the ncp launched an energetic campus enrollment campaign based on appeals to tribal and clan loyalties the regime focused its efforts on the sha iqiyya and ja aliyya tribes and in particular clans from those tribes residing in the towns of hajar al tayr and hajar al asal near shendi on the nile northeast of khartoum this mode of recruitment was based on individual or small group training rather than the camps under the auspices of the popular defense forces the ncp retrenched in this manner because as early as 2006 they were aware that their support was eroding among middle class students and people from outside greater khartoum moreover as the students put it the ncp no longer trusted their own former loyalists and informants on campus which in itself meant that they relied increasingly on harsher forms of violence repression and even torture rather than surveillance not surprisingly the height of the war in darfur in 2006 saw harsh crackdowns on campus protest students were arrested and many were taken in secret to mosques run by the security forces to be tortured islamism in fragments according to student union members at the university of khartoum divisions among islamists on campus corresponded to fissures within the ncp vice president ali uthman taha has been financing his own clients on campus as has his well known antagonist nafi ali nafi a presidential adviser who takes a hard line on the country s internal wars so clear was the rivalry that students loyal to the two would lecture on alternating days at the speaker s corner on campus echoing their patron nafi supporters projected a vision of strength repression and jihad while taha backers spread a message of compromise reform and constitutionalism by most accounts the taha faction long had a far larger following since taha was himself a muslim brother student leader in khartoum by 2011 however it was clear from the level of militant islamist violence that the partisans of nafi had sidelined their adversaries on campus as they have in the regime s inner circles the strong link between taha and islamist students has broken down one clear indication came as early as 2006 when muhammad uthman secretary general of the islamists at the university of khartoum and taha s personal appointee resigned his post and joined the largely leftist and secular student union scores of others soon followed helping to usher in a new trend that came to be known as the sa ihun or wanderers the sa ihun are those islamists disenchanted with the regime whether because of its corruption its departure from proselytization da wa the loss of south sudan or the constant squabbling inside the ncp no united front the sa ihun are composed of three fragments of the islamist movement old turabi supporters who have returned to his fold in the form of the pcp hardline former popular defense forces fighters in the jihadi wars in the south and nuba mountains in the 1990s and a younger generation who view themselves as moderate democratically inclined reformers the last are the newest trend and have the greatest legitimacy in sudanese society they are led by ghazi salih al din an ncp member estranged from the upper echelons of the regime and his former patron taha these self proclaimed reformers have attracted many younger islamists by acknowledging mistakes the movement has made in the past and calling for reinvigorated da wa an end to corruption and a peaceful transition to democracy there is fragmentation as well within the security forces the roots of the disarray can be found in the breach between bashir and salah gosh the architect and former head of the niss it was gosh who in the 1990s extended the reach of the security forces into the social and cultural spheres as well as the political following his demotion by bashir in 2009 and his imprisonment in connection with a coup attempt in november 2012 there has been a climate of mistrust among the ncp leadership according to youth activists who have been detained no one knows how the structure works or where the money comes from no one can afford to trust anyone else the result is the rise of militias answering to individual ncp actors in 2010 for example nafi ali nafi formed a paramilitary group popularly known as amn awlad nafi security boys enlisted to outflank his rival ali uthman taha the militiamen like the new cohort of ncp campus loyalists are chosen from among the ja aliyya tribe from which nafi hails and particularly from the towns of hajar al tayr and hajar al asal they are paid from a separate budget that nafi administers personally trained in small groups often abroad charged with specific tasks and placed in civilian jobs such as at banks they are akin to a reserve army that can be called up at any time other high ranking ncp stalwarts have emulated this dangerous model a notable example is amn awlad awad al jaz a militia recruited funded and held in reserve by the minister of energy youth protesters describe these groups as mafias because they beat up intimidate and detain citizens on the orders of a boss trying to outgun other bosses within the state the regular police who tend to come from poor families have watched their authority diminish next to the clout of militias enjoying the largesse of an ncp patron youth activists note that the niss remains the strongest security institution but following the gosh coup attempt and the increased competition among ncp leaders the niss is also weak in some respects recruitment of niss officers for example increasingly follows tribal lines leading to problems of command and control as one activist detainee put it when interrogate you they do not know who you are they don t have access to intelligence information from other sources and they are clearly not in communication with other departments of their own organization the vision of youth for a new sudan it is this context of economic crisis and confrontation with the coercive state apparatus that underpins the divide between youth activists and the older generation that dominates the leadership of the traditional political parties civil society and even the armed insurgents organized under the sudanese people s liberation movement north splm n in the view of the student and youth activists for example there is nothing new in the new dawn charter signed in july 2012 by the opposition political parties and various rebels fighting to overthrow the khartoum regime girifna and sudan change now initialed the charter too but quickly had a change of heart from the perspective of the youth these groups are all factions pursuing particularistic political interests on the one hand youth leaders maintain that the splm n is using the charter to put pressure on khartoum to sign a separate agreement with them on the other hand they note that the charter which in any case has since dissolved does not reflect a strategic vision for national reconciliation and radical regime transformation as for the traditional parties such as umma the youth feel they have lost support because they are preoccupied with the mechanics of political change and the distribution of power among the elite the leaders of the youth movement do not believe that the splm n is capable of military victory their preference is to force the regime to relinquish power by means of a popular uprising or intifada mindful of the weaknesses of the traditional political parties youth representatives self consciously view themselves as a coordinating mechanism the movement is concentrating on raising political awareness and harnessing shared grievances about state repression and socio economic crisis despite claims to the contrary youth leaders insist that they have support among a wide spectrum of sudanese perhaps more importantly given how ethnic divisions have impeded collective action in sudan youth activists have worked to bridge the gap between arabized tribes and darfurians resident in central sudan in december 2012 students at the university of jazira protested the dean s decision to compel payment of fees even by students from darfur who had previously been exempted due to the war during two days of strikes the niss detained student leaders and killed four students from darfur tossing the corpses into shallow water what followed was a rally of thousands chanting the selfsame freedom freedom and the people want the fall of the regime that forced the police and niss to withdraw from campus the same month larger protests took place on khartoum campuses in solidarity with the darfur student association it was a pointed rejection of the state s incendiary race baiting and hence quite a breakthrough sudanese youth activists have distinguished themselves from the traditional political parties in two important ways by eschewing ideology or sectarian affiliation and by focusing on local grievances before linking these basic demands to calls for regime change and democracy nonetheless student and youth leaders acknowledge that support born out of shared grievances rather than ideology is deeply vulnerable not only to the coercive apparatus but also to deep seated problems of public awareness and coordination youth in the provinces are not as savvy with social media and communications as those in khartoum as the information officer of sudan change now put it what we really need is not money but more mobile phones that we can distribute to our brother and sisters in the provinces and teach them how to use indeed according to youth leaders it is not the ideological islamist secular divide that poses the greatest challenge to the youth movement in sudan but the deep class and regional divides despite its left leaning origins one youth leader noted girifna quickly accommodated youth from most political backgrounds including islamists opposed to the ncp as for sudan change now it is struggling to gain the loyalty of the remote lower classes and from outlying regions such as gedaref that are often suspicious of elites in khartoum of any ideology the study of arab youth movements tends to elide the dynamic relationship between the movements and the political and coercive state institutions that seek to contain and control them the case of sudan demonstrates that it is precisely that interplay that determines the objectives and methods of youth organizations in sudan changes in the coercive apparatus have tracked with the trajectory of the islamist movement as well the youth activists have exploited the breakup of the islamists and carefully elaborated grievances that have begun to chip away at the ideological edifice of the state the youth movement in sudan shows that survey evidence of political islam s pull may be misleading once in power islamists are rarely able to maintain their popularity or ideological sway as youth growing up under their rule emerge as central actors in recasting what islamic politics means endnotes for more on the protests

by manoj kumar and aftab ahmed new delhi reuters desperate for five more years in power the ruling bharatiya janata party led alliance will woo rural and urban middle class voters with farm relief measures and tax cuts said officials privy to plans for the final budget before india s general election stung by opposition parties victories in three state polls last month and needing to call a national election by may prime minister narendra modi is facing growing discontent over depressed farm incomes and doubts over whether his policies are creating enough jobs the electoral compulsions mean that major economic reforms such as tax cuts for bigger companies and plans to bring down the budget deficit could be put on hold at least until after the election the sources said piyush goyal the interim finance minister will present the budget on feb 1 in the absence of finance minister arun jaitley who is currently in the united states for medical treatment the higher spending along with a shortfall in tax collections will push the fiscal deficit up to the equivalent of 3 5 percent of gross domestic product for the year ending in march overshooting a previous 3 3 percent target according to one of the sources with direct knowledge of budget discussions that would fit with the expectations of a reuters poll of economists the source said there was a chance that the government could take corrective action in march hoping that by that time the election schedule will be settled and the public focus will shift towards campaigning we may resort to spending cuts in march to contain the fiscal deficit the source said the finance ministry had cut capital and other spending amounting to 750 8 billion rupees 10 55 billion in the last financial year ending in march 2018 but modi s government has been stepping back from such fiscal rectitude in recent months in its desperation to find ways to pay for pre election spending the government has also pressed the reserve bank of india to part with more of its reserves causing a rift that culminated in the resignation of governor urjit patel last month this is an election budget and most of the economic reforms have been put on hold said another official adding the government could defer any decision on business demands for a cut in corporate tax business leaders said the government still has to meet its three year old promise of cutting the corporate tax rate for larger companies to 25 percent from 30 percent although all over the world overall tax has started coming down india is one of the large economies which has corporate taxes on the higher side said rohinton sidhwa partner at deloitte india the budget which is interim and is likely to be followed by a full one in july is expected to project economic growth of around 7 5 percent for the next financial year while expanding capital spending on railways roads ports by 7 8 percent and estimating an increase in revenue of about 15 percent officials said but the main focus will be on the rural sector and the urban middle class the government is ready with relief measures for farmers benefits for unemployed youth higher tax exemptions for the middle class and small businesses the officials said according to two government sources the farm relief package itself could run to at least one trillion rupees 14 billion if the government is to have a meaningful impact on which way voters lean in rural areas where two thirds of indians live the pre election giveaways could give the economy short term momentum but result in a hangover after the election credit rating agencies have warned that without bringing down other spending a higher farm subsidy bill will increase future fiscal deficits in the absence of new revenue boosting measures the policies will collectively make it harder for the government to achieve its fiscal consolidation objectives moody s investors service said last week looking for jobs though he has spent big on building roads and railways modi has been fiscally conservative for most of his time in power helping to bring retail inflation to near 2 percent from double digits during the previous government s time last month s state election upsets have made the modi government shed some of that caution despite expanding by 7 percent plus annually the fastest pace among major economies the uneven nature of the growth has meant that the economy has failed to create enough jobs for millions of youth entering the workforce each year merchandise exports have shown no signs of growth in last four years and some textile leather and engineering goods producers have shifted production abroad earlier this month the centre for monitoring indian economy cmie a leading independent think tank issued a report showing the country lost as many as 11 million jobs last year making it even harder for new entrants to the labour market last week raghuram rajan former governor of the reserve bank of india said india needed flexible labour and land laws and to fix glitches in the goods and services tax launched as a major tax reform in 2017 we need two percentage points more growth to provide those jobs that are needed said rajan 1 71 1740 indian rupees editing by martin howell simon cameron moore
by ibraheem musa since assuming office governor nasir ahmad el rufai has changed the socio political and economic landscape of kaduna state in more ways than one in the last three and half years the governor has been a trailblazer reformer and revolutionary all rolled into one in summary here is a synopsis of what the sun man of the year has achieved since may 29 2015 in size malam nasir ahmad el rufai the governor of kaduna state is both slightly built and somewhat vertically challenged however beneath his small frame lies big grey matter an uncommon courage and a steely resolve to get things done in school the young el rufai was called giant but his academic feats more than his physique earned him the pet name perhaps no public servant government appointee or head of a ministry department and agency of government has re engineered governance like el rufai in recent times the governor in the last three and half years has taken on professional politicians organised labour and various entrenched interest groups in his effort to make kaduna state great again specifically el rufai has taken tough decisions broken the siege mentality and threaded where his predecessors and fellow governors dreaded in particular he has sacked 21 000 incompetent teachers in spite of threats from the national union of teachers nut and employed 25 000 qualified ones in public primary schools in solidarity the nigerian labour congress nlc led by its national leadership mobilised against the decision and took to the streets however their protests and agitations came to grief as both the nut and nlc ate the humble pie the governor by wielding the big stick has salvaged the education sector and slowly the entire value chain is being overhauled similarly el rufai has sanitised the civil service steadily replacing its aging workforce with young professionals likewise the governor has reformed local government administration and freed up its resources in the last three and half years when el rufai came into office in 2015 several local governments were practically bankrupt in fact eight of them could not pay salaries before now their bloated personnel costs accumulated over the years had plunged them into huge debts monthly the state government had to bail them out especially to pay salaries however in the last two years their fortunes have now turned around for the better as some local governments are even executing projects after paying salaries and meeting various overhead costs all the 23 local government councils are financially buoyant the el rufai government conducted local government elections in may 2018 introducing electronic voting to nigeria that election was a referendum on the performance of the el rufai government unusual for local government polls in nigeria it was free and fair and despite its dominant performance in the elections the apc did not win four local government councils and it respected the result in addition el rufai s reforms have restructured the traditional institution as some districts have been dissolved in summary 4 776 district and village heads lost their positions in that exercise likewise he has taken politics to a new level by dismantling the patronage system and has entrenched a people centred approach to who gets what when and how el rufai by so doing has demystified the so called political class a band of rent seekers which had a sense of entitlement and contributed little to the commonwealth similarly the ethno religious bigots and tribal associations including promoters of divisive politics have little relevance now in kaduna state significantly since assuming office el rufai has been a trailblazer a reformer and a public servant who has been putting the people first in all that he has been doing el rufai the trailblazer first to constitute cabinet no doubt malam el rufai was the first governor to make appointments in 2015 on may 27 2015 he had appointed five principal officers two days before his was sworn in specifically the governor elect had appointed alhaji balarabe lawal abbas a seasoned administrator and a former lecturer at the administrative staff college of nigeria ascon as the secretary to the state government similarly dr salisu suleiman and mr abu sheyin were appointed principal private secretaries to el rufai and his deputy arc barnabas bantex respectively in addition hon bala yunusa was made deputy chief of staff while mr samuel aruwan then kaduna bureau chief of blueprint newspaper became the governor s special assistant on media and publicity significantly about two months later governor el rufai had submitted the names of his proposed commissioners to the state house of assembly on july 30 he had sent the list to the legislature along with their proposed portfolios in nigeria this is unprecedented at both national and sub national levels as nominees are often sent without their proposed offices similarly eight days later the legislative arm of government had approved all the 13 commissioners specifically ministries were pruned down from 19 to 13 in a bid to save cost and ensure efficiency first to introduce tsa on august 6 2015 kaduna state had announced its decision to commence implementation of the treasury single account tsa framework by september 1 2015 a few weeks before the federal government did in this regard the government put all banks on notice directing them to close its accounts and remit the balances to the central bank of nigeria cbn by that directive all the state government accounts in commercial banks were closed and their balances were remitted to the kaduna state government tsa account in cbn in fact the directive opened a can of worms on the opaque accounting system of the previous administration kaduna state el rufai found out had been operating more than 470 bank accounts as against the 324 that was earlier revealed collectively they held government s funds amounting to n24 5 billion joins open governance partnership significantly the open governance partnership ogp which is aimed at enhancing transparency accountability and citizen participation in governance was launched in eight countries including brazil indonesia philippines mexico norway south africa uk and the united states nigeria subscribed to ogp on may 11 2016 making it the 70th country to join ogp however kaduna state was the first sub national in the country to subscribe to and be accepted into the ogp because of its willingness to be open and transparent specifically the state subscribed to seven commitment areas for implementation the areas include citizens participation in budget circle open contracting and adopting a common reporting standard as well as promoting ease of doing business and improving compliance with the freedom of information act in addition the state subscribed to the development of permanent dialogue mechanism on transparency accountability and good governance between citizens and government and has adopted technology based citizen s feedback on government project and programmes el rufai the reformer improves igr in addition the governor changed the way of doing government business in kaduna state in particular el rufai has improved the internally generated revenue igr since he assumed office initially the state s igr hovered around n12 billion yearly but in 2017 it generated n26 53 billion as revenue doubling the igr it inherited similarly kaduna state internal revenue service kadirs generated n30 billion as igr in 2018 in february 2016 governor el rufai signed the tax consolidation and codification bill into law which brought revenue collection under kadirs according to him the law is an investor friendly tax code that consolidates all taxes payable in the state in one law and in one document furthermore the law is aimed at improving the revenue base of kaduna state making payments easy and raising the efficiency of tax collection empowering women el rufai in line with the all progressives congress apc constitution has given women the recognition that they deserve in his government last week hajiya hafsat mohammed baba the commissioner of women affairs and social services said that before the coming of this administration her ministry was reduced to a place to sing dance and mobilise women whenever there is a function but now that has changed positively indeed there are five women commissioners in a 14 member cabinet and simultaneously women head sensitive positions in the el rufai government for example the commissioner of justice and attorney general of kaduna state is a women so are the commissioners of works housing and transport as well as commissioner of commerce industries and tourism and environment and natural resources likewise the kaduna state investment and promotion agency kadipa as well as the kaduna state transport regulatory agency kadstra are headed by women in addition a woman is the head of service and above all dr hadiza abubakar balarabe is the running mate of governor el rufai in the coming election significantly the administration has been empowering women with soft loans especially to boost their businesses last november the state government doled out n200 million to women groups under the kaduna state women empowerment fund kadswef which has a flexible re payment plan so far over 1 262 people have benefited from the fund and they include 123 women cooperative groups 10 women with disability clusters and 1 000 women entrepreneurs putting people first in summary the entire policy thrust of the el rufai administration across all sectors is to improve the life of the common man in the education sector the state had declared a state of emergency and made the first nine years of basic education truly free for girls all the 12 years of primary and secondary education are free in this regard the government began to fully implement and enforce the universal basic education act which places emphasis on tuition free compulsory basic education for every child living in kaduna state in addition the apc led government began investing resources to improve infrastructure in the sector providing the best tools in order to attract the best to the teaching profession teachers can rise to grade level 17 without having to stop being classroom teachers also the government started building and equipping more libraries in schools and community centres with access to online educational and instructional materials throughout the state for effective running of schools funds meant for running schools now go directly to the schools and their management boards giving public health a new lease of life significantly in the last three and half years the el rufai led administration has successfully placed healthcare under one roof and has partnered with dfid and the bill melinda gates foundation the partnership has improved routine immunisation family planning and maternal child services also the partnership with general electric is refitting 255 primary healthcare centres in the last three and half years by december 2018 the government had completed renovating 150 of the 255 target primary health centres similarly the administration has recruited more than 2 500 health workers including doctors nurses and paramedics in addition the government has upgraded barau dikko specialist hospital to a teaching hospital likewise it has instituted the contributory health insurance scheme in kaduna state and at the same time pregnant women children under the age of five and the elderly get free medical service on the whole the el rufai led apc administration has done what no past government whether military or civilian has achieved in the health sector in kaduna state attracting investments creating jobs in the last three and half years several local and international firms have set shop in kaduna for example the 150 million olam integrated feed mill and poultry breeding farm was inaugurated by president muhammadu buhari on september 12 2017 olam a multinational company was founded in 1989 and right now it is one of the largest agricultural companies in the world currently the company is nigeria s largest single foreign direct investment in fact it was designed to produce 1 6 million day old chicks weekly and 360 000 metric tonnes of animal feeds annually a significant milestone for kaduna state and nigeria in the quest to ensure food security and achieve economic diversification through agriculture in addition it has created 2 000 direct jobs and impacted positively on the local economy by creating jobs along the value chain similarly governor el rufai opened a new animal feed mill constructed by sunseed nigerian limited at dakace village outside zaria two weeks after launching olam on september 28 2017 the mill which is a n5 billion investment will produce 100 000 tonnes of animal feeds a year in addition the company built a 15 bed hospital for its host community as part of its corporate social responsibility likewise mahindra tractor assembly plant an investment worth 20 million was inaugurated on april 4 2018 by former tanzanian president jakaya kikwete mahindra a subsidiary of springfield agro is a sister company of kewalram chanrai group of india which has created 200 direct jobs in kaduna state there is also the positive multiplier effect on agriculture in particular and boosting the local economy in general similarly a 10 million renewable energy investment blue camel renewable energy solar power assembly plant has been launched at the kakuri industrial area it is an environment friendly renewable energy company offering a broad portfolio of renewable energy technologies products and solutions to clients the company designs and integrates renewable energy solutions cutting across all levels of demands from small household solar and hybrid systems to mini solar grid systems for rural electrification and industrial power backup systems simultaneously the el rufai led administration has created direct jobs in the public service with the establishment of new agencies and recruitments in the civil service for example 5 550 marshals were recruited into the kaduna state traffic and environmental law enforcement agency kastlea in 2016 also waste collection and management engaged 6 700 youth and women to keep major cities clean in the education sector 2 300 new science english and mathematics teachers were recruited for public schools besides the 25 000 competent teachers who were recruited to replace the 21 000 that failed the competency test in 2017 the process of recruiting 7 600 teachers for public secondary schools has already began also the primary school feeding programme and renovation of public schools created 125 000 direct jobs within the first one year of apc led government in the state giving a breakdown el rufai said the school feeding programme alone had produced 85 000 direct and indirect jobs comprising food vendors their staff and supervisors similarly 11 100 direct jobs were created through the free uniforms scheme where secondary school students were given a pair of uniforms each in addition 18 855 job opportunities were created through rehabilitation of schools which also included construction of toilets and boreholes across the state in the health sector 1 200 health personnel have been recruited just as the primary healthcare development agency has concluded plans to recruit 3 000 health workers for the renovated 255 phcs in all the wards in kaduna state additionally new agencies such as kadipa kaduna geographic information service kadgis kadirs budget and planning commission and kaduna state facilities management agency kadfama have all recruited professionals to enhance their capacities after all said and done malam el rufai has been a trailblazer reformer and people centred leader in the last three years indeed he has achieved so much in so little a time which is under reported conversely it is the news of demolition feuding with political opponents and battling selfish interest groups that have been grabbing the headlines and not how he has left indelible imprints on the socio political and economic landscape of kaduna state ultimately the governor will receive his due recognition in the pantheon of history

turkey at a crossroads the ruling justice and development party akp in turkey originally founded itself as a secular anti establishment party now that its leader recep tayyip erdogan has effectively eliminated institutional controls and silenced opposition akp has become the de facto establishment and amended its narrative and policies to capitalise on the increasingly authoritarian mood as the global availability of cheap credit dwindles will erdogan s government resort to further authoritarian measures there is no difference where aims are concerned between a terrorist with a gun and bomb in his hand and a terrorist who has dollars euros and interest rates recep tayyip erdogan turkey has been an early experimentation field for a number of political trends experienced in the western world since the end of the cold war a long time eu aspirant turkey entered into a customs union with the european union in 1996 subsequent years saw an increased institutionalisation of the state structure and an upsurge of democratic reforms including abolition of the death penalty deterrence against the use of torture by police and penitentiaries and the establishment of independent regulatory authorities turkey has been quick to catch the democratisation wave these reforms were taken to the next level when the justice and development party akp of which president recep tayyip erdogan is the leader won a parliamentary majority in 2002 in the early 2000s turkey exemplified how a muslim majority country could be secular modern and progressive in a departure from this earlier optimism certain populist elements emerged in erdogan s discourse long before mass migration ignited a new generation of populist movements or questions regarding turkey s ambition for democracy arose gradually erdogan s name became a regular add on in the club along with orban putin or kaczynski the excitement first turned to doubt and later to full blown criticism by 2010 when turkey s democracy and human rights scores began to dwindle turkey remains an understudied case in democratisation literature neither the academic community nor practitioners have developed a comprehensive analytical framework to explain this shift from a democratising westernising nation to authoritarian rule certain analytical categories have been borrowed from both the transition paradigm and hybrid regime literature categories such as democracies with adjectives e g delegative majoritarian and illiberal or competitive authoritarianism which is often used to describe the recent turkish situation although frequently cited together no comparative analysis of turkish populism vis à vis hungary poland france germany or united states exists to what extent is erdogan populist today the transition paradigm is under question might the transition not be a linear path from authoritarian to democratic governance can competitive authoritarianism be a final stop rather than a station on the way to full liberal democracy turkey will be one of the most important testing grounds for similar questions in the coming years recep tayyip erdogan is a popular personification of authoritarian populist leadership however most studies neglect to point out which qualities are unique to turkish populism these broader elements are crystallised in erdogan s discourse but their roots stretch back far before his first term in power whether it is of the left or right populism has been alive and well throughout the history of the 96 year old republic if not earlier what makes erdogan different from his predecessors is his ability to translate these typically divisive tendencies into a unified 50 per cent voter bloc through the transformative power of populist discourse despite its wide application populism does not have a conventionally agreed definition and is used to label different political phenomenon in different countries however certain characteristics of populist discourse can be traced from latin america to asia these include but are not limited to a binary conception of the world us vs them positioning on the side of the people vs the elites and an appeal to a nostalgic conflated past glory more recently with regards to political movements in europe the term denotes an array of contrarian positions such as being anti establishment anti globalisation anti islam anti immigration or anti eu finally it is used to define a set of political attempts to actively undermine the rule of law mainstream media and institutions deemed part of the establishment akp was established in 2001 and positioned itself as the representative of the periphery particularly the kurds and conservatives both of which have been deliberately excluded from power positions and the resource distribution mechanism through legal institutional arrangements since the founding of the republic of turkey since then akp effectively adopted an anti establishment narrative and portrayed itself as the actor most capable of correcting this historical injustice however a set of significant changes to the judicial structure was taken to popular vote in 2010 eliminating the impact of traditionally powerful institutions such as the military on civil politics thus akp became the de facto establishment at this point the narrative had to change and it did so in two fundamental ways first the ever present memory of historical injustice morphed into fears of the bad old days turkey might return to should akp lose power secondly erdogan and turkey came to be portrayed as the hope of the oppressed from palestine to xinjiang and other places with significant muslim populations that have felt unfairly pressured by western powers along with this sentiment aimed mainly against the west and the powers that be the turkish government promoted another new discourse claiming that the world is bigger than five a reference to the un security council structure and tacitly positioning turkey as anti establishment this time at a global level no other contrarian position seen in european or american populist movements is significantly visible in turkey in fact the european and turkish populist movements diverge when it comes to immigration and the effects of globalisation the lowest hanging fruits among european populists erdogan is not anti immigration primarily because he from the beginning welcomed the syrians and has spent at least 40 billion dollars since 2011 a position which he cannot easily retract secondly the group lines have been drawn somewhat differently based on identity conceptions syrians are muslim in european populist discourse this translates as not from us whereas in the context of turkey s self designated conservative democratic government it means somehow from us unlike most european populists erdogan does not exploit xenophobic sentiments nearly as much as he stresses another one proven to be equally powerful anti westernism moreover erdogan s voters are not the losers of globalisation in fact per capita purchasing power in turkey incessantly rose from 9 330 us dollars 2002 to 26 504 us dollars 2017 an ordinary turk has been enjoying the benefits of development in the form of renewed roads better transportation infrastructure refurnished government buildings and better public services since 2010 this has been complemented by the excessively cheap credit disproportionately available to turkish consumers translating into new apartments new cars and new businesses this has been possible thanks to a range of monetary decisions made by the us federal reserve bank and the european central bank ecb after the 2008 global crisis that culminated in a flow of easy capital from developed to developing nations turkey along with other brics nations was one of the main beneficiaries longitudinal data provides a strong relationship between prosperity and voter behavior in turkey whenever they feel affluent turks support the actor that they think provides prosperity when the riches are gone they change their voting behavior for example turgut özal the centre right politician who served as the president of turkey between 1989 and 1993 was the erdogan of the day and received similar criticism about authoritarian tendencies he oversaw ten years of economic growth but lost the government in 1991 once the gulf war s effects began to batter the turkish economy and the government subsequently began to engage in easy capital policies that it could not sustain easy capital not only translated into election wins for akp it also meant increased capacity for the government to provide social benefits without harming budget discipline this is another key factor that acts as an external remedy covering for policy mistakes or democratic setbacks that would normally prove fatal for the government of a country which is highly dependent on foreign investment especially of western origin coupled with the increasingly repressive media environment and blatant attacks on freedom of expression erdogan was able to politically capitalise on this free flow of money on top of easy money turkish populism itself demonstrates a distinctive element which has been successfully exploited under erdogan anti west sentiment erdogan deflects any criticism regarding democratic setbacks imprisoned journalists and erosion of the rule of law as nothing but put downs made by western powers disturbed by the rise of turkey as the voice of the oppressed similarly he successfully blamed certain structural policy problems such as the recent economic downturn on deliberate attempts by the west to destabilise turkey this fabricated attack on national security distracts from and postpones the reform process which would eventually cripple the government s ability to single handedly govern the country a testing ground turkey does not possess enough natural resources a cheap labor pool or a highly qualified workforce to keep it a lucrative investment destination in the absence of rule of law democratic standards or easy capital turkey depends on foreign direct investment to finance its 180 us dollars billion external debt and its 50 us dollars billion current account deficit with the federal reserve bank increasing interest rates the american economy booming and the ecb ending its stimulus program international investment is flowing back to advanced economies leaving turkey and similar countries at a crossroads if erdogan takes repressive economic measures such as capital controls fixing the exchange rate or artificially lowering interest rates to stimulate consumption turkey will further lose investor confidence if he returns to the reformist agenda it will come at the price of fostering more pluralist media more criticism and the prospect of eventually losing control the route he chooses to pursue and the popular reactions to it will also be a litmus test on whether the public support erdogan has accrued is a success of populist propaganda or a result of economic prosperity medeni sungur photo private collection medeni sungur is the executive director of freedom research

wind and hail in equal measure i played a miserable round of golf not helped by being battered by the elements and what happens when i get home yes a bout of golf club foliage related hay fever kicked in i spent much of the evening sneezing and rubbing my itchy eyes good job my new house when it s ready in april isn t opposite the entrance to the golf club oh wait it is time for my annual ingesting of daily anti histamines nasal sprays local honey and eye drops this always happens to me at the golf club from january onwards and how time has flied since last year s bout in markets with only 4 days of january left we are fast coming up to the first anniversary of the vol shock we had after a surprisingly high average hourly earnings print in the january 2018 us payroll report as you ll remember the vix traded over 50 at the intra day peak in the first week of february as etf vol products saw a massive unwind one year on this friday will see the latest payroll report with very few people worried about inflation that surprise print a year ago was 2 8 yoy last month we again surprised on the upside at 3 2 so us inflation has still been building up over the last 12 months and if you want a curveball for 2019 it s that inflation continues to edge up and the fed has to choose between controlling it on one hand and appeasing financial markets on the other with the latter making it quite clear that it doesn t want tighter policy indeed hopes of the fed ending its balance sheet wind down early and positive thoughts about china s latest stimulus see zhiwei zheng s note on how

count brexit reaches pivotal week number 25 with the other 24 or so not in the end proving that pivotal the uk parliament votes on the possible next steps on tuesday mps will be further debating the government s brexit plan and have the opportunity to vote on a variety of different amendments which have been proposed by mps from across the political spectrum these could include one that says parliament should be able to hold indicative votes on different brexit outcomes one that requires the prime minister to extend article 50 if the house of commons has not approved a brexit deal by february 26 another simply that the uk should not leave without a deal and another calls for an expiry date on the backstop the speaker of the house of commons will decide which are to be debated by mps the one regarding having an expiry date on the irish backstop seems to be one both the pm and tory party brexiters are gravitating towards at the moment so it will be interesting to watch the support for this however the irish and the eu have both suggested there is no wiggle room on renegotiating the backstop so we will see last night the sun reported that prime minister may has privately told cabinet ministers that she wouldn t leave the eu without a deal with reports suggesting it is being kept on the table as a negotiating tactic sterling rallied on the news trading above 1 3200 for the first time since october as investors priced in the decreasing likelihood of a no deal outcome this continues a trend the pound has gained against the dollar for the last six consecutive weeks of sterling gains and comes after a majority in the house of commons including a number of conservative ministers and backbenchers have made clear their opposition to a no deal outcome the other major

underlying fundamentals driving strong profitability record net income during 2018 of 143 1 million or 157 2 million when excluding merger related costs or when excluding merger related costs 2018 net

operating expenses since august 20 2018 continued strength across key credit quality metrics reflective of strong legacy of credit and risk management successful implementation of stated acquisition strategy to cross the 10 billion asset threshold asset threshold filled in the southern edge of franchise became a top ten financial institution in the state of kentucky 2018 was another successful year for wesbanco as well as a year full of milestones said todd f clossin president and chief executive officer of wesbanco solid execution and strong fundamentals drove record earnings of 143 million or 157 million when excluding merger related costs we strengthened the franchise by expanding into new and diversified markets with strong demographics and ensured top market share across our major markets we remained diligent on expense management while continuing to make technology and staffing investments to support future growth helping to drive our 2018 efficiency ratio to 54 6 in addition we stayed disciplined and balanced on lending decisions as our credit quality ratios have continued to improve to be at or near historic lows mr clossin added we remain well positioned for continued success due to our well defined operational and growth strategies furthermore we are excited about our opportunities for the upcoming year and look forward to providing additional value to our customers and shareholders balance sheet portfolio loans of 7 7 billion as of december 31 2018 increased 20 7 when compared to the prior year period due to the acquisitions of ftsb and ffkt total organic loans were down 1 3 year over year when excluding the consumer loan portfolio de emphasis strategy or down 1 7 in total the year over year decline in total organic loan growth resulted from targeted reductions in the consumer portfolio to reduce its risk profile lower home equity loan balances due to lower demand as a result of higher interest rates and tax changes elevated levels of commercial real estate loans moving to an aggressive secondary financing market and continued deleveraging by commercial customers reflective of the current operating environment and higher cash levels from tax reform total deposits increased 25 4 year over year to 8 8 billion due to the ftsb and ffkt acquisitions continuing to reflect the strength of our legacy footprint total deposits excluding cds increased 2 5 organically driven by 5 8 organic growth in interest bearing and non interest bearing demand deposits credit quality our underlying credit fundamentals continue to be reflective of our strong legacy of credit and risk management during the fourth quarter of 2018 our credit quality ratios remained strong as we balanced disciplined loan origination growth in the current environment with our prudent lending standards our credit quality measures have been at or near historic lows over the last several periods and as such variability from quarter to quarter may occur which is not suggestive of a change in the direction of overall credit quality as of december 31 2018 despite the addition of approximately 1 4 billion of portfolio loans from the acquisitions of ftsb and ffkt non performing loans and non performing assets decreased year over year both on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of the portfolio criticized and classified loan balances decreased as a percentage of total loans year over year further reflecting the continued high quality of the loan portfolio on a year to date basis for 2018 the provision for credit losses decreased 22 3 year over year to 7 8 million and annualized net loan charge offs to average loans decreased 7 basis points year over year to 0 06 net interest margin and income the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 29 basis points year over year to 3 72 the net interest margin benefited from increases in the federal reserve board s target federal funds rate through the past year and a full quarter benefit from the higher margins on the acquired ffkt net assets partially offset by higher funding costs as well as a flattening of the yield curve also impacting the year over year change in the net interest margin was a six basis point reduction related to the lower tax equivalency of the state and local municipal tax exempt securities resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to higher rates for interest bearing public funds higher tier money market accounts and federal home loan bank and other borrowings further reflecting the benefit of our legacy deposit footprint the year to date deposit beta on the four federal funds rate increases since the year ago quarter was 17 or only 12 when including the strong growth in non interest bearing deposits lastly accretion from acquisitions benefited the fourth quarter net interest margin by approximately 23 basis points as compared to 6 basis points in the prior year period and it was 14 basis points for 2018 versus 8 basis points during 2017 net interest income increased 28 6 million or 39 1 during the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the same quarter of 2017 due to a 25 5 increase in average total earning assets primarily driven by the ftsb and ffkt acquisitions and related accretion from purchase accounting as well as an overall higher net interest margin for the year ended december 31 2018 net interest income increased 56 9 million or 19 6 due to higher average total earning assets from the 2 2 billion in earning assets acquired from ftsb and ffkt and a larger investment portfolio and the aforementioned higher net interest margin non interest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 non interest income of 26 6 million increased 3 6 million or 15 8 from the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by the ftsb and ffkt acquisitions the associated larger customer deposit base and higher transaction volumes drove the year over year increases in electronic banking fees and service charges on deposits other income increased 0 8 million primarily due to an increase in payment processing fee income net securities losses of 1 3 million were primarily due to a market adjustment on the deferred compensation plan while an offsetting reduction of 1 1 million is recorded in employee benefits expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 non interest income increased 11 4 million or 12 9 the primary drivers of this year to date increase were increased customer levels and transaction volumes from the two acquisitions higher trust assets from a combination of the ffkt acquisition and organic growth and higher mortgage banking income due to the strength of the residential mortgage lending program partially offset by net securities losses as discussed above non interest expense total operating expenses continued to be well controlled during the fourth quarter of 2018 despite the inclusion of ffkt s operating expenses since august 20th the ffkt cost savings of 35 announced in april 2018 remain on track for 75 of the anticipated savings to be achieved during 2019 and 100 thereafter excluding merger related expenses non interest expense increased 15 2 million or 28 0 compared to the prior year period reflecting the two acquisitions this year over year increase is primarily due to higher salaries and wages employee benefits net occupancy and equipment costs associated with additional staffing and financial center locations from the two acquisitions as mentioned above the overall employee benefits increase was partially mitigated by a 1 1 million reduction in the deferred compensation plan obligation due to market declines these increases were balanced by strong discretionary expense management as demonstrated by the 146 basis point year over year decrease in the efficiency ratio to 53 62 for the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding merger related expenses in both years non interest expense during the twelve months of 2018 increased 27 4 million or 12 5 compared to the prior year period reflecting the acquisition of both ftsb and ffkt partially offset by strong discretionary expense management provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate and associated provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2018 are reflective of the late 2017 passage of the tax cuts and jobs act lowering the statutory federal income tax rate for corporations to 21 during the fourth quarter the effective tax rate was 19 37 as compared to 59 14 last year which included the impact of the deferred tax revaluation adjustment while the provision for income taxes decreased 12 4 million to 10 6 million despite higher year over year pre tax income

underlying fundamentals driving strong profitability record net income during 2018 of 143 1 million or 157 2 million when excluding merger related costs or when excluding merger related costs 2018 net

operating expenses since august 20 2018 continued strength across key credit quality metrics reflective of strong legacy of credit and risk management successful implementation of stated acquisition strategy to cross the 10 billion asset threshold asset threshold filled in the southern edge of franchise became a top ten financial institution in the state of kentucky 2018 was another successful year for wesbanco as well as a year full of milestones said todd f clossin president and chief executive officer of wesbanco solid execution and strong fundamentals drove record earnings of 143 million or 157 million when excluding merger related costs we strengthened the franchise by expanding into new and diversified markets with strong demographics and ensured top market share across our major markets we remained diligent on expense management while continuing to make technology and staffing investments to support future growth helping to drive our 2018 efficiency ratio to 54 6 in addition we stayed disciplined and balanced on lending decisions as our credit quality ratios have continued to improve to be at or near historic lows mr clossin added we remain well positioned for continued success due to our well defined operational and growth strategies furthermore we are excited about our opportunities for the upcoming year and look forward to providing additional value to our customers and shareholders balance sheet portfolio loans of 7 7 billion as of december 31 2018 increased 20 7 when compared to the prior year period due to the acquisitions of ftsb and ffkt total organic loans were down 1 3 year over year when excluding the consumer loan portfolio de emphasis strategy or down 1 7 in total the year over year decline in total organic loan growth resulted from targeted reductions in the consumer portfolio to reduce its risk profile lower home equity loan balances due to lower demand as a result of higher interest rates and tax changes elevated levels of commercial real estate loans moving to an aggressive secondary financing market and continued deleveraging by commercial customers reflective of the current operating environment and higher cash levels from tax reform total deposits increased 25 4 year over year to 8 8 billion due to the ftsb and ffkt acquisitions continuing to reflect the strength of our legacy footprint total deposits excluding cds increased 2 5 organically driven by 5 8 organic growth in interest bearing and non interest bearing demand deposits credit quality our underlying credit fundamentals continue to be reflective of our strong legacy of credit and risk management during the fourth quarter of 2018 our credit quality ratios remained strong as we balanced disciplined loan origination growth in the current environment with our prudent lending standards our credit quality measures have been at or near historic lows over the last several periods and as such variability from quarter to quarter may occur which is not suggestive of a change in the direction of overall credit quality as of december 31 2018 despite the addition of approximately 1 4 billion of portfolio loans from the acquisitions of ftsb and ffkt non performing loans and non performing assets decreased year over year both on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of the portfolio criticized and classified loan balances decreased as a percentage of total loans year over year further reflecting the continued high quality of the loan portfolio on a year to date basis for 2018 the provision for credit losses decreased 22 3 year over year to 7 8 million and annualized net loan charge offs to average loans decreased 7 basis points year over year to 0 06 net interest margin and income the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 29 basis points year over year to 3 72 the net interest margin benefited from increases in the federal reserve board s target federal funds rate through the past year and a full quarter benefit from the higher margins on the acquired ffkt net assets partially offset by higher funding costs as well as a flattening of the yield curve also impacting the year over year change in the net interest margin was a six basis point reduction related to the lower tax equivalency of the state and local municipal tax exempt securities resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to higher rates for interest bearing public funds higher tier money market accounts and federal home loan bank and other borrowings further reflecting the benefit of our legacy deposit footprint the year to date deposit beta on the four federal funds rate increases since the year ago quarter was 17 or only 12 when including the strong growth in non interest bearing deposits lastly accretion from acquisitions benefited the fourth quarter net interest margin by approximately 23 basis points as compared to 6 basis points in the prior year period and it was 14 basis points for 2018 versus 8 basis points during 2017 net interest income increased 28 6 million or 39 1 during the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the same quarter of 2017 due to a 25 5 increase in average total earning assets primarily driven by the ftsb and ffkt acquisitions and related accretion from purchase accounting as well as an overall higher net interest margin for the year ended december 31 2018 net interest income increased 56 9 million or 19 6 due to higher average total earning assets from the 2 2 billion in earning assets acquired from ftsb and ffkt and a larger investment portfolio and the aforementioned higher net interest margin non interest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 non interest income of 26 6 million increased 3 6 million or 15 8 from the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by the ftsb and ffkt acquisitions the associated larger customer deposit base and higher transaction volumes drove the year over year increases in electronic banking fees and service charges on deposits other income increased 0 8 million primarily due to an increase in payment processing fee income net securities losses of 1 3 million were primarily due to a market adjustment on the deferred compensation plan while an offsetting reduction of 1 1 million is recorded in employee benefits expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 non interest income increased 11 4 million or 12 9 the primary drivers of this year to date increase were increased customer levels and transaction volumes from the two acquisitions higher trust assets from a combination of the ffkt acquisition and organic growth and higher mortgage banking income due to the strength of the residential mortgage lending program partially offset by net securities losses as discussed above non interest expense total operating expenses continued to be well controlled during the fourth quarter of 2018 despite the inclusion of ffkt s operating expenses since august 20th the ffkt cost savings of 35 announced in april 2018 remain on track for 75 of the anticipated savings to be achieved during 2019 and 100 thereafter excluding merger related expenses non interest expense increased 15 2 million or 28 0 compared to the prior year period reflecting the two acquisitions this year over year increase is primarily due to higher salaries and wages employee benefits net occupancy and equipment costs associated with additional staffing and financial center locations from the two acquisitions as mentioned above the overall employee benefits increase was partially mitigated by a 1 1 million reduction in the deferred compensation plan obligation due to market declines these increases were balanced by strong discretionary expense management as demonstrated by the 146 basis point year over year decrease in the efficiency ratio to 53 62 for the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding merger related expenses in both years non interest expense during the twelve months of 2018 increased 27 4 million or 12 5 compared to the prior year period reflecting the acquisition of both ftsb and ffkt partially offset by strong discretionary expense management provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate and associated provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2018 are reflective of the late 2017 passage of the tax cuts and jobs act lowering the statutory federal income tax rate for corporations to 21 during the fourth quarter the effective tax rate was 19 37 as compared to 59 14 last year which included the impact of the deferred tax revaluation adjustment while the provision for income taxes decreased 12 4 million to 10 6 million despite higher year over year pre tax income

september 30 2018 approximately 15 0 million of the increase resulted from the transfer of funds from existing repurchase agreements into our new reciprocal deposit product introduced in the fourth quarter the quarter and year to date growth in interest bearing deposits is mainly attributable to our continued focus on relationship banking and growing our commercial relationships net interest income net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled 14 8 million an increase of 0 4 million or 2 9 compared to the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 2 0 million or 15 5 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 included in net interest income for the quarters ended december 31 2018 september 30 2018 and december 31 2017 is 0 3 million 0 6 million and 0 2 million respectively of interest income accretion from the acquisition of loans also included in net interest income for the quarter ended december 31 2018 is an interest recovery of 0 1 million on an acquired loan the increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter last year was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances and the yields earned on those balances partially offset by an increase in interest expense as we funded the increase in interest earning assets with increased deposits and borrowings interest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 2 7 million and 1 3 million due to increases in the volume and yield respectively of interest earning assets these increases were partially offset by increases in interest expense of 0 5 million and 1 5 million due to increases in the volume and cost respectively of interest bearing liabilities compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the company s net interest margin was 3 53 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to 3 56 for the quarter ended september 30 2018 and 3 55 for the quarter ended december 31 2017 the yield on interest earning assets was 4 75 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to 4 65 for the quarter ended september 30 2018 and 4 42 for the quarter ended december 31 2017 the decrease in net interest margin for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to the quarters ended september 30 2018 and december 31 2017 was driven by an increase in the cost of funds required to fund the increase in assets exclusive of the interest income accretion from the acquisition of loans discussed above as well as a 0 1 million interest recovery in the quarter ended december 31 2018 and a 40 000 interest recovery in the quarter ended december 31 2017 net interest margin would have been 3 43 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to 3 42 for the quarter ended september 30 2018 and 3 48 for the quarter ended december 31 2017 while the yield on interest earning assets would have been 4 65 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to 4 51 and 4 35 for the quarters ended september 30 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively the cost of deposits increased 18 basis points to 1 32 for the quarter ended december 31 2018 compared to 1 14 for the quarter ended september 30 2018 and increased 40 basis points compared to 0 92 for the quarter ended december 31 2017 the increase in the cost of deposits compared to the quarters ended september 30 2018 and december 31 2017 reflects the increased rates offered for our interest bearing demand deposits and time deposits to remain competitive in our market in a rising interest rate environment and attract new deposits we also made the strategic decision to get ahead of the rising interest rate curve in future quarters and increased our deposit rates during the third quarter of 2018 we experienced significant deposit growth in both the third and fourth quarters of 2018 at these higher rates which contributed to the increase in the cost of deposits in the fourth quarter the overall costs of funds for the quarter ended december 31 2018 increased 16 and 43 basis points to 1 50 compared to 1 34 and 1 07 for the quarters ended september 30 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively the increase in the cost of funds at december 31 2018 compared to september 30 2018 and december 31 2017 is mainly a result of an increase in the cost of deposits but is also driven by the increased cost of borrowed funds used to finance loan and investment activity noninterest income noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled 0 8 million a decrease of 0 4 million or 31 3 compared to the third quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 0 1 million or 13 1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in noninterest income compared to the quarter ended september 30 2018 is mainly attributable to a 0 3 million decrease in the fair value of equity securities the decrease in noninterest income compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 is primarily a result of a 0 3 million decrease in the fair value of equity securities and a 0 1 million decrease in servicing fees and fee income on serviced loans partially offset by increases in service charges on deposit accounts and other operating income other operating income includes among other things various operations fees and income recognized on certain equity method investments noninterest expense noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled 10 9 million an increase of 0 7 million or 6 4 compared to the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 1 3 million or 13 5 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase in noninterest expense compared to the quarter ended september 30 2018 is mainly attributable to the 0 6 million increase in other operating expenses during the quarter ended december 31 2018 a purchase agreement for a property held in other real estate owned oreo was executed and the property was sold subsequent to the end of the quarter a write down of the property in the amount of 0 6 million was recorded during the quarter ended december 31 2018 to reflect the amount of the purchase agreement less the cost to sell the property noninterest expense also increased due to a 0 3 million increase in acquisition expense recorded in relation to the pending acquisition of mainland bank announced in october 2018 the increases in acquisition expense and other operating expenses were offset by a 0 4 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits primarily a result of 0 3 million of severance expense recognized in the quarter ended september 30 2018 as part of a staffing optimization plan focused on the operations of our recent acquisitions the increase in noninterest expense compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 is primarily attributable to the 0 8 million and 0 9 million increases in salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses respectively partially offset by a 0 5 million decrease in acquisition expense the increase in salaries and employee benefits compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 is mainly attributable to the staffing mix including the addition of our new commercial and industrial division which includes five new lenders and related support staff the increase in other operating expenses is primarily attributable to the 0 6 million write down of an oreo property discussed above taxes the company recorded income tax expense of 0 8 million for the quarter ended december 31 2018 which equates to an effective tax rate of 19 5 an increase from the effective tax rate of 11 3 and a decrease from the effective tax rate of 39 5 for the quarters ended september 30 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate compared to the quarter ended december 31 2017 is primarily a result of the tax cuts and jobs act which lowered the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 from 35 effective january 1 2018 in addition the income tax expense for the quarter ended december 31 2017 includes a one time charge of 0 3 million as a result of the revaluation of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities required following the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the increase in the effective tax rate compared to the quarter ended september 30 2018 is due to a discrete tax benefit of 0 3 million recorded during the third quarter related to return to provision adjustments management expects the company s effective tax rate to approximate 20 in 2019 basic and diluted earnings per common share the company reported basic and diluted earnings per common share of 0 35 and 0 34 respectively for the quarter ended december 31 2018 a decrease of 0 07 compared to basic and

used in aluminum that ends up in products including the beer cans that some workers hold as colleagues set up a crawfish boil related global auto sector likely to feel effects of tariffs factories shut down and move overseas to get cheap labor and don t have to play by the same rules that s what hurts people said david habisreitinger a father of three who s a control room operator at rain cii carbon the fear that his job may be moved elsewhere is constant but hits hard during every negotiation if he and union members push too hard it becomes a real risk sure free trade agreements meant increased investment from abroad and more customers 44 of louisiana s exports in 2016 were made to countries with which the united states has free trade agreements but it also meant global competition for the cheapest prices china and other countries increased shipments of goods to the united states often undercutting local companies that closed or moved production abroad about 4 5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the country since the north american free trade agreement came into force in 1994 for example there s been little change felt here since trump was elected in 2016 tariffs could help a small sliver of industries maybe even theirs but hurt nearly everyone else any nafta renegotiation which could assuage some of these unionists concerns feels further away than before trump said we re gonna win so much we ll be tired of winning habisreitinger said well i m not there far from it with assistance from dave merrill
the canadian dollar eroded by 7 8 per cent during 2018 with most of this deterioration coming in the fourth quarter for cattle producers this isn t necessarily negative recent data shows that year to date feeder cattle exports for the week ending dec 8 2018 were 191 863 head up a whopping 66 per cent over the same period of 2017 the u s calf crop has experienced four years of consecutive increases so that the 2018 output will be similar to 2007 however this hasn t curtailed u s feedlot demand for canadian feeder cattle i thought this would be an opportune time to review the recent canadian dollar price action and provide an idea for the first quarter of 2019 advertisement read also how consumer spending drives fed cattle prices cattle producers are bombarded with charts and data from cattle inventory reports and cattle on feed surveys during the fall advertisement the bank of canada increased its short term lending rate to 1 75 per cent in october the canadian dollar had a brief surge to 78 u s cents but ended 2018 around 73 5 cents until october the bank of canada and the u s federal reserve were increasing rates at a similar pace since october the bank of canada has turned from hawkish to neutral investors don t expect a rate increase in the first quarter of 2019 while the bank of canada was changing its sentiment the u s federal reserve increased the interest rate at the dec 21 meeting by 25 basis points to 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent according to the fed fund futures it now looks like investors are not anticipating an additional interest rate hike from the u s federal reserve in the first quarter of 2019 during the final quarter of 2018 we saw a widening of the interest rate gap between the bank of canada and the u s federal reserve which was negative for the canadian dollar advertisement inflation concerns evaporate there are a couple of main reasons for the change in tone from the bank of canada first inflation concerns have evaporated canadian inflationary data for november showed a month over month decrease of 0 4 per cent which reversed the october monthly gain from september of 0 3 per cent the annualized inflation rate for november came in at 1 7 per cent which is below the bank of canada s target range of two to three per cent december and january inflationary data will also be rather soft given current energy prices secondly canadian fourth quarter gdp will likely finish around one per cent down from the annualized growth rate of two per cent in the third quarter and 2 9 per cent in the second quarter given the lower inflationary data and softer gdp the bank of canada would have had no reason to increase interest rates at its jan 9 meeting advertisement speaking of bond yields there is an important characteristic developing in late december the u s government two year bond yield was 2 660 while the five year bond yield was 2 649 this is the first time the yield curve has been inverted since september of 2007 just prior to the recession almost every time the yield curve has become inverted a recession has followed central banks are closely watching this u s yield curve as well which could hinder further rate increases from october through december the canadian dollar was highly correlated with the crude oil market in addition to the weaker crude oil futures the spread between western canada select and west texas intermediate was historically wide adding to the bearish sentiment to the canadian dollar in early december the alberta government announced mandatory production cuts of 8 7 per cent which came into effect on jan 1 2019 this caused the spread to narrow to about 13 which is the lowest discount in over a year these production cuts are expected to curb growth in the oil sector and stem canadian economic growth but i m viewing this as slightly supportive for the canadian dollar canadian fiscal policy is negative for the canadian dollar the federal government s deficit is expected to come in near 20 billion and there is no plan for a balanced budget in the foreseeable future very simply deficits are future taxes during the first quarter i m looking for the canadian dollar to trade in a range with support at 72 50 u s cents and resistance at 75 u s cents the market is in a situation where it has to absorb the interest rate gap between the u s and canada at the same time north america is heading into a period of slower growth this could amplify the consequences of the canadian deficit because government revenues could be lower than expected the neutral monetary policy and negative fiscal policy will keep the canadian dollar rangebound at the lower levels

dr ernest addison 28 01 2019 listen even though the ghana cedi depreciated by 10percent as at the end of 2018 the governor of bank of ghana bog says development from emerging markets including south africa and zambia suggests that the cedi did relatively well this following fears after the local currency lost its grounds to the american dollar at 5 1 from 4 80 to 4 90 range beginning this year according to dr ernest addison the latest fall leaves some room to smile comparing the cedi performance to other currencies such as the south africa zambia russia argentina and turkey s currencies the important thing is that even though the cedi depreciated by 8 4percent if you compare it with development from other emerging and frontier markets in 2018 the cedi did relatively well take argentina where they recorded over 50percent currency depreciation turkey recorded over 28percent russia 17percent even getting closer to africa zambia recorded 16 2percent south africa 13 7percent so that s the context within which one can conclude that the performance of the cedi in 2018 compared to other markets was relatively well he stated the governor who said this at a press briefing in accra added that the cedi depreciated more moderately against the pound and euro by 3 3 percent and 3 9 percent respectively compared with 12 9 percent and 16 2 percent depreciation in 2017 offsetting foreign reserves to cushion falling cedi financial analysts have also argued for an increase in the supply of dollars to meet the rising demand but dr addison said while this may sound good the central bank do not intend to lose all its reserves all in an attempt to stabilise the local currency as stipulated by its balancing act obviously central bank has made a judgment of how much depreciation relative to reserves accumulation do we want to achieve these are the balancing act that suggests that a little bit of reserves reduction in order to stabilise the currency but you also don t want to lose all your reserves in the process of trying to stabilise your currency it is important not to avoid all the gains that we have achieved over the last two years we spent two years bringing inflation down from over 15percent to 11percent now 9 4percent if we allow the exchange rate to move too fast it will negate the progress that we have made in terms of price stabilisation that s why you have to lose reserves to moderately ease the appreciation of the currency but at the same time you want to have reserves that are adequate to tackle the shortfalls he stressed the bog has reduced the policy rate by 100 basis points from 17 to 16percent according to bog this is necessary because the monetary policy committee noted that immediate risks to the disinflation path are well contained and the current conditions provide scope to translate some of the gains in the macro stability to the economy under the circumstances the committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points to 16 percent

impacting stocks and the financial markets stocks recently featured in the blog include knot offshore partners lp knop ship finance international ltd sfl arcbest corporation arcb and heartland express inc htld here are highlights from friday s analyst blog time to invest in the transportation sector earnings season is a good time to rethink your investments because that s when companies tell you how the current environment affects them how they are adapting whether they see growth slowing or picking up and so forth such guidance is particularly important this earnings season as the u s and china are yet to come to an understanding on trade global trade shrinks partly impacted by the slowdown in china which is the lowest in 28 years even as other international issues like the brexit adds to uncertainties this doesn t make for the most encouraging backdrop for the transportation sector which essentially depends on the volume of trade and travel within the country and outside the sector which can broadly be discussed under the airline rail shipping truck and services industries is therefore tied to macro factors like gdp growth industrial production construction volumes and trade as well as consumer demand airlines the transportation airlines group zacks rank 7 out of 250 or top 3 has underperformed the s p 500 over the past year losing 23 6 compared to the s p s 7 0 decline but results and analyst estimates haven t deteriorated as much of the four companies that have reported quarterly results this quarter all have topped analyst expectations the earnings estimates for the dec 2018 and mar 2019 quarters are up 10 9 and 4 6 in the last 12 months story continues since the volume of business and leisure travel as well as available capacity determine the load factor consumer confidence and disposable income play a big role in revenue generation the u s consumer sentiment for jan 2019 of 90 7 fell from 98 3 in december to 90 7 because of fears regarding the domestic economy compared to market expectation of 97 while down from recent highs it remains positive bofa ceo moynihan says that based on the company s credit card and bank account information consumer spending is increasing at 5 6 now and although it was stronger earlier it is far from negative a big positive is the slump in oil prices which is bringing down operational cost rail the transportation rail group zacks rank 88 out of 250 or top 35 has outperformed the s p 500 over the past year gaining 9 4 results have been less than spectacular so far this quarter with one out of three companies that have reported results beating estimates the good thing is that there also haven t been any misses yet there is almost no change in december and march quarter estimates in the last 12 months since agricultural produce metals construction material and fuel such as coal are all moved within the country and across borders by train the sector is impacted by things like gdp growth manufacturing growth construction spending and agricultural production smooth cross border trade also helps especially since trade volume with the country s closest neighbors is very high so the resolution of conflict between the u s mexico and canada and the renegotiation of nafta under the new united states mexico canada agreement usmca is a big positive gdp growth which is hovering around 3 could fall to zero in the seasonally softer first quarter because of the government shutdown but according to white house economic advisor kevin hassett this would lead to a 4 5 growth number in the following quarter once operations resume so the softness in the growth number isn t related to underlying weakness in the economy in december the federal reserve slightly lowered its gdp growth estimate for 2019 from 2 5 to 2 3 while raising long term expectations from 1 8 to 1 9 what s more unemployment rates are expected to remain low at under 4 through 2021 the ism report for dec 2018 shows slowing growth in pmi new orders production employment and prices at the same time because of caution at customers which are maintaining very low inventory levels supplier deliveries are slowing down and inventories are growing at a slower rate to maintain a steady backlog all this goes to show that there is a lot of caution at both customers and manufacturers despite the still expanding economy a scenario where we ship to consumption is healthy in any situation and enables a quick pullback there are uncertainties in the construction market which has seen decelerating growth for around 2 years following several years of double digit growth this year growth should have been about even but tariffs and trade wars are adding pressure likewise for agricultural production trade war concerns mean that the segment will be worth another look after the march 2 deadline shipping the transportation shipping group zacks rank 106 out of 250 or top 42 has mostly underperformed the s p 500 over the past year losing 20 8 but results are likely to meet or exceed lowered analyst expectations as a fallout of the trade war and fears of shrinking global growth and trade the only company that has reported results this quarter has topped analyst expectations the earnings estimates for the dec 2018 and mar 2019 quarters have both dropped substantially in the last 12 months so let s see what experts have to say about international trade this year the international monetary fund imf lowered its growth outlook slightly for 2019 and 2020 it now expects global growth of 3 5 in 2019 and 3 6 in 2020 previous 3 7 for both years china s slowing growth rate is also a concern its gdp grew 6 6 in 2018 and december quarter growth of 6 4 means that further deceleration is in the cards the world bank also points to slightly slower growth this year that may however be adjusted if trade war concerns alleviate it s current forecast for global growth in 2019 is 2 9 down from 3 in 2018 with advanced economies growing 2 and emerging economies 4 2 it expects u s to grow 2 5 this year down from 2 9 in 2018 china is expected to grow 6 2 this year down from 6 5 in 2018 another factor impacting trade this year is brexit which goes into effect at the end of march as a result the cost of trade between the uk and eu countries could increase and trade volumes could be impacted despite the gloom and doom predicted for the year it s worth nothing that even a slightly slower growth rate is still a growth rate and far from zero besides there s one section of the shipping industry that is focused on crude oil and lng both of which will remain steady especially given currently low oil prices shipbroker banchero costa sees continually increasing rates for lng shipping in particular the prices will be driven by strong demand and relatively limited supply as the complexities of liquefying natural gas before shipping make capacity addition difficult recent capacity additions helped growth rates swell from the 10 year average of around 5 to 7 5 in 2016 9 9 in 2017 and an estimated 10 in 2018 moreover although not among the top suppliers like australia and qatar the u s has

briefing highlights canadians aren t saving enough markets loonie at a glance snc lavalin warns on profit what to expect from the fed what to watch for on brexit apple facebook in spotlight what else to watch for this week blackberry names president coo from today s globe and mail when you lose either way canadians aren t saving enough of their money and as douglas porter points out there s little incentive to do so mr porter bank of montreal s chief economist recently looked at who s winning and who s losing amid low interest rates people borrowing money are obvious winners and canadians just love to borrow money indeed we borrow so much that we oft forget about the folks in the other side of the ledger the savers and they re the ones who are losing mr porter noted how bond yields started moving in reverse three months ago and how for example the yield on 10 year government of canada paper slipped below 2 per cent last week having hit 2 6 per cent in october open this photo in gallery source bank of montreal some retreat is understandable given the broader financial market volatility in late 2018 a more subdued outlook for tightening and the pullback in oil prices over that period he said referring to the newfound patience of the u s and canadian central banks but it is remarkable that the level of long term yields has again careened to sub 2 per cent terrain that s the short term reasoning mr porter s longer term view is that growth in nominal gross domestic product has been slowing mr porter believes that canada s official savings rate is an imperfect measure but it is a measure and he nonetheless cited the fact that it drooped to an average 1 per cent in the first three quarters of last year heading toward what he projected will have been the lowest annual reading in almost six decades of record keeping with almost all yields now again negative in real terms even before taking taxes into account it s readily apparent that there s not much incentive to save he said and canadians are clearly responding to that negative incentive this is not to suggest by the way that borrowers aren t also feeling a pinch interest rates may be low but until its recent pause the bank of canada had been raising its benchmark and will resume tightening at some point interest rates have risen since mid 2017 with the boc hiking 125 basis points and mortgage rates rising 70 basis points said mr porter s colleague bmo senior economist sal gautieri there s no doubt that households have become more sensitive to credit costs due to elevated debt and a near record debt service burden with payments gobbling 14 5 per cent of disposable income in q3 up 0 4 of a percentage point from mid 2017 credit growth has been slowing to be sure as canadians tame their borrowing habits in the face of higher rates and new mortgage qualification rules that came into effect about a year ago designed to head off the pop of a bubble this is going to tame consumer spending mr gautieri and other economists project just as economic growth is slowing add to that the fact that as mr porter said later the economy could overall be a loser from under saving read more markets at a glance read

executive officer neil bruce said in a statement this incident is unacceptable and i intend to take appropriate actions to mitigate the financial impacts for the company snc lavalin said it can t

right libertarian free trade and free markets the exoteric and esoteric version quinn slobodian perfect capitalism imperfect humans race migration and the limits of ludwig von mises s globalism 1 contemporary european history 2018 0 0 1 13 this article does an excellent job of unpacking the statism that is implicit in nominally laissez faire right libertarian models of free trade and free markets by way of background the main current of what is called libertarianism in the united states and liberalism elsewhere treats the gilded age as a satisfactory proxy for the free market see for example jacob hornberger s characterization of that period as a close approximation to laissez faire because well read it for yourself so here you have richard a society where there was no income tax no welfare state to speak of i mean there was land grants to the railroads but there was no social security no medicare no medicaid no education grants i think the only real welfare program was pensions to civil war veterans and so here you had a society where government didn t take care of anybody no the government didn t take care of anybody except the robber barons who got those land grants whose extent was larger than entire european countries and the plutocracy as a whole who inherited the property distribution wage system and other structural legacies of centuries of enclosure imperial conquest and enslavement america itself was sitting on top of a continent stolen from its native population and enormous tracts of that continent were closed off and granted to privileged absentee owners who went on to exact tribute from those who actually put the land to use just read albert nock s account of the scale of land grants and land speculation that prevailed among our founding fathers in our enemy the state slavery may have been formally abolished but industrial capitalists in the election of 1876 handed over a third of the country to former slave owners and allowed them to institute regional apartheid and reduce the nominally free black population to peonage in return for a free hand in plundering the rest of the country of course those former slave owners retained their massive concentrations of land that rightfully belonged to the slaves who had worked it for them so basically all large concentrations of wealth in this ostensibly laissez faire period were the result of past robbery and murder on a scale that boggles the mind and its nod to free markets was simply to say all right no more robbery starting now parrington didn t call this period the great barbecue because of the government s restraint in taking care of people and don t forget that the state intervention wasn t relegated to the past the state actively intervened to stop working people from taking back some of the wealth that was stolen from them the period from the great betrayal of 1877 to the war hysteria and red scares of the wilson administration were a prolonged civil war in which the railroads great banks grain wholesalers and capital in general in alliance with the american state fought ruthlessly to suppress the cooperative farm populist and labor movements besides the rail barons use of differential rates to break the will of the rural farming population and defeat the cooperatives this war extended to the nationwide repression of the labor and socialist movements after haymarket cleveland s use of federal troops to break the pullman strike and endless pitched battles by state militias against striking workers from the copper wars out west to homestead the totalitarian ideology of 100 americanism loyalty old glory and the american legion was created to socialize american workers into the belief that hat tip to george frederick baer the rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected and cared for by the christian men of property to whom god in his infinite wisdom has given the control of the property interests of the country so what it all boils down to is that the gilded age is massively statist to its very core it lives moves and has its being in ongoing pervasive systemic violence with the state at its core it is closely interconnected with all the other legacy institutions from the previous blood soaked centuries in which the peoples of the world were subjugated to capital but for hornberger it s an adequate approximation of laissez faire because the government did nothing to take care of poor people while protecting the propertied classes in continued possession of the enormous mountain of everybody else s stolen loot it sat atop and richard ebeling has the chutzpah to comment in reply with an allusion to bastiat on what is seen and what is not seen which means that irony is officially dead as i commented at the time individualist anarchist benjamin tucker once said of herbert spencer that amid his multitudinous illustrations of the evils of legislation he in every instance cites some law passed ostensibly at least to protect labor alleviate suffering or promote the people s welfare entirely missing from this discussion is the primary upward form of income redistribution from poor to rich through structural intervention to reduce the bargaining power of labor and increase the monopoly returns on accumulated property a redistribution which dwarfs many times over compensatory downward forms of redistribution through the welfare state missing are the fundamental ways the state has been in structural alliance with capital not just some hand waving at crony capitalism and corporatism since the beginning of capitalism five or six hundred years ago returning to slobodian the precedents appealed to by right libertarian advocates of free trade are likewise telling when it comes to all the legacy effects of past robbery and brutalization and all the ongoing forms of embedded coercion that are necessary for maintaining their non coercive system this is true in particular of ludwig von mises s lionization of the trade policies pursued under the british empire following the triumph of the liberal party and repeal of the corn laws mises and hayek unlike many of their most prominent followers today were not anarcho capitalists and were willing to at least obliquely acknowledge the role of the state in maintaining their favored system slobodian writes that the term neoliberal which today is applied variously to the global economic model upheld by the bretton woods institutions and the rest of the postwar order created by fdr and truman and to the washington consensus policies prevailing globally since the advent of reaganism and thatcherism was originally coined at the walter lippmann colloquium in 1938 which counting mises and hayek among its attendees was sort of a dress rehearsal for the mont pèlerin society founded nine years later although the actual origin of the term neoliberalism is contested and its adoption may have been a contested issue among the colloquium attendees themselves the lippmann colloquium and pèlerin society were key sources of the post wwii policy currents currently identified as neoliberal and whether they agreed on the term neoliberal as such they saw their favored agenda as a renovation of liberalism in response to the perceived failure of the original liberal order in the 19th century first through the disintegration of wwi then through the rise of high national tariffs and finally through the corporatist national economic policies adopted in response to the depression and the autarkic models of the ussr the european fascist regimes and the greater east asian co prosperity sphere and the need for a new international order capable of preserving a resurrected liberalism from similar disintegration far from seeing a liberal order as spontaneously emerging as slobodian describes it mises et al envisioned the need for a strong state to take a more proactive role in defending the conditions of competition against the disruptive demands of voting publics organised labour and special interests mises and hayek in particular romanticized the austro hungarian empire as a model in miniature for the kind of international polity required to enforce the neoliberal order viewing nationalism as the enemy of economic liberalism mises conceived instead of multinational forms of governance capable of protecting a world of what he called perfect capitalism with total global mobility of labour capital and commodities mises s position on what is commonly called open borders was however ambivalent although he saw the habsburg empire as the model for a miniature transnational order maintaining the free movement of capital goods and persons without regard to borders he gradually came to restrict this vision of perfect labor mobility to in his view racially homogeneous areas like europe that were culturally capable of sustaining such an order he was more pessimistic regarding the imperfect human nature prevailing outside the west this is the context for slobodian s epigram to this article a quote from mises s 1944 omnipotent government how can we expect that the hindus the worshipers of the cow should grasp the theories of ricardo and of bentham at any rate mises clearly believed in the legitimacy of constitutive state violence in imposing capitalism on societies by force in a work called socialism ironically he wrote in language that could have plausibly come from marx s passages on accumulation that it was a fundamental social law for capitalism to draw the greatest number of human beings into the personal division of labor and the whole earth s surface into the geographical division of labor and lest anyone be deceived by the expression fundamental social law that mises s triumphal vision simply entailed the expansion of the market through voluntary exchange mises spelled out in nation state and economy 1918 that the colonial wars and genocides carried out by the european powers were justified by the benefits of the liberal system that resulted although he acknowledged that one can think only with shudders and anger of the fearful mass murders that prepared the basis for many of the colonial settlements flourishing today nevertheless to justify them one has only to imagine what would have happened if india and china and their hinterland had remained closed to world commerce not only each chinese and each hindu but also each european and each american would be considerably worse off mises saw the british empire as by far the best of the european colonial empires in opening the world to free trade and keeping it open by force in so doing the empire overrode the ruled populations desires for national self determination and self rule and imposed a cosmopolitan transnational order much like that of austria hungary on them against their will as oliver macdonough argued in the anti imperialism of free trade the free trade of the british empire rather than the kind advocated by cobden and bright was far closer to that of palmerston and the later open door imperialism so called by william appleman williams of the united states it relied on gunboat diplomacy to open foreign markets and collect debts and mises was perfectly fine with that so anyone who conflates genuine free trade with the kind practiced by polities from the british empire to neoliberal america or the kind advocated by mises is either naive or disingenuous the british industrialists embraced free trade in the early and mid 19th century because they could afford to they had already subjugated by force of arms market areas comprising millions of square miles and tens of millions of human beings and this imperial policy was not confined as mises euphemistically put it to opening up markets it included forcibly suppressing the textile industry of india the largest in the world at the time it included warren hastings s permanent settlement in bengal which essentially reenacted the open field enclosures of england and robbed the peasantry of their legitimate communal property rights in the land and the imperial free trade regime celebrated by mises saw no inconsistency in repeating this same robbery over and over again for example the seizure of the best arable land in east africa from the peasantry after the partition of that continent at the berlin conference and its settlement by british planters this was a free trade agenda that entailed not only massive abrogation of property rights and forcible imposition of completely different ones in their place but industrial wrecking on a scale that ned ludd could never have imagined british industrial capitalists repealed the corn laws and adopted free trade for the same reason that global capital in the neoliberal age supports the elimination of tariff barriers they have outlived their usefulness for capital at a time when corporations are transnational and most goods consumed in the west are produced under contract in independent factories overseas so called free trade on the washington consensus model is just as statist just as protectionist as smoot hawley ever was but now the centerpiece of the typical free trade agreement is the enforcement of the maximalist intellectual property laws that serve the same protectionist function for global corporations that tariffs served for national ones yet every week we see another puff piece at reason and other right libertarian rags celebrating the glories of free trade and condemning the economic retrogression of politicians who oppose this or that protectionist free trade agreement after wwi according to slobodian mises saw both nationalism and mass democracy as the twin villains that destroyed the transnational order and saw separating the polity or state from the nation as the only way to prevent the similar destruction of a new liberal order under this model a cosmopolitan state would transcend the nationalities of its component populations and enforce a liberal economic order the publicly visible legislative bodies would be mostly symbolic and limited in power while the institutions of economic governance would be largely removed from the public eye nationality on the other hand would be relegated to the sphere of purely private educational charitable and cultural institutions and symbols like postage stamps and flags linguistic groupings would be unmoored from permanent geographical locations with the mobility of population and would resemble the shotgun distribution pattern of the german magyar and slavic populations throughout the habsburg empire at various times he saw this as a model which was the proper alternative to the league of nations and its organization around component nation states either for a united europe or for a liberal global order depending on his degree of optimism at the time at others he was pessimistic as to whether the world as opposed to europe or the west possessed the cultural prerequisites for sustaining such a transnational liberal order in particular he acknowledged the need for europe north america and australia to close their borders to free immigration by non white populations it was an issue he never fully resolved his vision of a supranational political order resembled in many ways the imposition of austerity in recent years by multilateral institutions like the european union world bank and imf despite the latter day aversion of his self described followers in the libertarian movement mises himself was not opposed to supranational intervention per se when austria was forced to accept a loan from the league of nations with punitive conditions attached in 1932 he stressed its pedagogic potential the severe conditions under the loan may open the eyes of the entire population to the fact that the economic policy that has been followed in recent years has brought us to a situation where we really see no other way out than to accept the sort of subjugation which this loan imposes on us in this case the league was the mechanism of an unflinching economic rationality flouted by the policies of socialist governed red vienna with the compulsion of league conditionality the measures of frugality that the economy has required for a long time but which have always been delayed or sabotaged be put into effect as quickly as possible for mises a good version of the league had the capacity to act as an iron glove for the invisible hand of the market no doubt he would have fully approved of kissinger s intention to squeeze the chilean economy till it screams and nixon s instruction that not a fucking sprocket gets through if mises was relatively circumspect at most times about the violence inherent in the system sorin cucerai a scholar associated with the ludwig von mises romania institute is far more honest and enthusiastic about the full extent of the coercive prerequisites both initial and ongoing for what right libertarianism usually frames as a spontaneous social order unlike mainstream austro libertarians who awkwardly juggle the actual historical prerequisites of capitalism with their professed belief in deontological ethics and the non aggression principle cucerai the fear of capitalism and one of its sources idei in dialog may 2009 translated by john medaille openly abandons any pretense that modern capitalism came about by voluntary means in fact he celebrates the fact that the states of the capitalist west from early modern times on had to declare war on human nature itself rob ordinary people of their possessory claims to the land and compel them by force to do what they otherwise would not have done in order to create societies in which the laboring population was divorced from its ownership in the means of production and the whole of life was forcibly incorporated into the cash nexus to be able to live a man needs shelter and food the owner of a source of food and habitation is autonomous in the sense that he is self sufficient he does not depend on others to be able to survive and if he does not depend on others he cannot be constrained to maintain commercial relations to other people in short the fundamental condition for the existence of a capitalist order is the absence of the individual autonomy in the sense of owing the source of your food under the modern states the citizens are obliged to pay taxes only in denominations not by products or labor even if one owns a food source he could not keep his property if he does not engage in commercial relations on a monetarised market in order to get the money necessary to pay the fees and taxes it is very important to understand that the capitalist order is not a natural order people do not search instinctually a source of monetary revenue and yet they search in a natural way to have access to a source of food and shelter in other words in their natural way people try to become autonomous autonomous in the strong sense of the word capitalism is made possible only if this natural process is interrupted by an instrument that makes sure nobody could have access to food and shelter unless a monetary revenue is used as an intermediary in discussing the historical prerequisites and ongoing institutional requirements of capitalism cucerai proclaims openly and proudly general truths that are usually stated plainly only in the work of radical historians while libertarians hem and haw and shuffle their feet about them one could not find the principle that capitalism and the wage system required forcible separation of the producing classes from the means of subsistence stated any more bluntly by marx himself in the grundrisse or the chapter on primitive accumulation in capital vol 1 or by j l and barbara hammond the principle that societies dominated by the cash nexus came about not spontaneously through some smithian mutual coincidence of wants but by state imposition is stated as unambiguously by cucerai as it is in david graeber s debt and unlike the average right libertarian who sees these facts as an embarrassment to be denied or minimized cucerai positively celebrates them much as some theologians celebrate adam s sin as a felix culpa the retrograde populations first of europe and then of the world were forced to be free in relation to mainstream libertarian historiography cucerai plays the same helpful role that rudy giuliani plays in relation to donald trump of course capitalism did all these awful awful things and it s wonderful richard ebeling in the interview i cited above chided the left for their neglect of what is not seen but if anyone has that failing it is self proclaimed anarcho capitalists and voluntaryists who in distinguishing coercive from voluntary interactions resemble a dog who looks at one s fingertip instead of the object pointed at their criteria for identifying coercive or forcible actions do not extend beyond the immediate point of interaction and ignore coercive background and legacy conditions altogether any critic of elon musk or jeff bezos on social media is immediately swarmed with replies from right libertarians indignantly objecting that they earned their 12 figure fortunes by selling things that people freely chose to buy and that their workers can t be exploited because they willingly went to work for them and should look for another job if they don t like it the idea that there are background conditions that constrain the options available to workers and consumers to the benefit of capital background conditions which the state played and continues to play the chief role in creating and enforcing primarily at the behest of the capitalist economic interests that dominate its councils never occurs to them at the risk of sounding like leo strauss right libertarianism seems to have both an exoteric and an esoteric doctrine the former embodied in polemics aimed at a mass audience treats the liberal or free market order as spontaneously emergent from voluntary human interaction and frames the only possible choice in regard to state action as whether to allow natural inequality and the hegemony of the cash nexus or intervene to prevent it this is the level of understanding of rank and file right libertarians who smugly tell others to go study economics while themselves being ignorant of both economics and history beyond whatever pablum is spoon fed to them in walter williams op eds charlie kirk speeches and commentaries at mises org they look at a system whose history is centuries of a boot stamping on a human face whose core logic is violence and see only voluntary interactions but mises himself knew better and at times admitted it and we can thank quinn slobodian for bringing this esoteric teaching strong meat of doctrine unfit for babes to light notes

review our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 we appreciate your continued interest in our company we had a very strong quarter and reported record net income loans deposits and assets for our fourth quarter and for the year ended december 31 2018 our fourth quarter net income attributable to common shareholders was up 257 to 4 1 million and eps was up 177 to 0 36 per fully diluted share compared to the fourth quarter of last year our strong earnings growth was due to the contribution from the community first merger completed at the beginning of the year inaudible growth in loan volume and earning assets higher noninterest income and improved asset quality a major contributor to our earnings growth in 2018 was consistent growth in loans and a shift and mix toward more profitable variable rate lending our loans grew 59 4 from december 2017 to a record 1 2 billion at year end 2018 loan production remained strong in fourth quarter with 104 million in new loans an increase of 23 over the same quarter last year this was our 14th consecutive quarter of loan growth and that growth has been focused on building relationships with customers in middle tennessee and chattanooga we experienced loan growth across our markets including solid contributions from our new offices in murfreesboro and chattanooga we opened our murfreesboro office late in the third quarter and our chattanooga office opened midway through the fourth quarter we re also starting 2019 with a strong and diverse pipeline for new loans and we expect sustained growth in the first quarter as i reported in last quarter we continue to experience strong competition for loans across our markets our loan portfolio is built on solid underwriting and risk management practices and we remain focused on lending to quality home builders real estate developers and small to midsize business customers at the end of the fourth quarter we had branches in seven counties with nashville davidson county at the core inaudible well positioned to capture our share with the robust growth in our markets without reducing our focus on quality credits dan will provide more details about our superior credit metrics that are critical part of building our existing loan portfolio and a significant factor in maintaining our base for future earnings the economy in the greater nashville area remained strong going into the new year we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation and our local market is growing by about a 100 net new persons per day in recent months nashville was named as the new operations center of excellence for amazon that will add about ph 5 000 high paying jobs and another 600 quality jobs are projected to be added by e y in nashville e y will add about 200 technology focused jobs and another 400 tax related positions to their existing nashville office that employs about 300 in january volkswagen ag announced that chattanooga will be home to the company s first electric vehicle manufacturing facility in north america with an estimated investment of 800 million and the creation of 1 000 jobs general motors also announced that their plant in middle tennessee in the spring hill area will manufacture the cadillac xt6 the company s first electric suv adding approximately 200 jobs and 300 million investment gm plant is located in murray county a market we acquired with community first and is a major contributor to williamson county as well we believe this additional growth in high quality high paying jobs in our primary markets will drive increased demand for loans in the commercial and residential sectors as we mentioned last quarter we opened our first branch in rutherford county in city of murfreesboro rutherford county has a deposit base of 4 6 billion and it s home to a strong and diverse economy that includes one of the state s largest universities with about 22 000 students and nissan s automotive assembly plant we are very pleased with the community s positive response to our new branch in murfreesboro and believe it will be a solid contributor to our loan and deposit growth in 2019 our new branch in chattanooga also contributed to our growth since its opening with almost 8 billion in deposits hamilton county presents us with a significant opportunity for growth in core deposits we remain very positive about our future as we enter 2019 we have a robust and diverse loan pipeline the economy across our markets remain strong and growing we re delighted reliant has additional opportunities to grow organically and through potential acquisitions within our footprint our credit quality is sound we have a strong capital position to support our continued growth also during 2018 our board of directors increased our cash dividend in recognition of our growth and record earnings performance i want to thank the entire reliant team for their continued contributions to our results our employees work with our customers everyday to meet their banking needs during the past year they played a very important role in building and cultivating customer relationships that have resulted in our exceptional loan and deposit growth and we have similar expectations going into 2019 i ll now turn the call over to dan dellinger our cfo to review our fourth quarter results in more details james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning everyone and thanks devan one of the key drivers of our solid earnings performance for the quarter and for the year is related to the growth in our loan portfolio as we noted last quarter loan demand ramped up late in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter with the expected seasonal slowing of the loan demand our fourth quarter loan production remained strong at 104 1 million 23 increase than the same quarter 2017 our loans were up 59 4 to 1 2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of last year loans were up 3 1 or 12 4 on an annualized basis since the third quarter as we have noted in the past many of these new loans do not fully fund at the origination date so they represent future growth in interest income as the projects are built out and the loans are funded at december 31st our top 10 inaudible construction loans at 42 million left to fund fourth quarter loan demand for new loans was led by cld at 38 c i 28 consumer and 1 4 family loans at 22 and cre at 12 the majority of our loan growth is driven by commercial construction activity and positive economic trends in middle tennessee and chattanooga our organic loan growth has been in the low double digits over the past year and we expect similar growth over the next level quarters i want to pick up on devan s comments about asset quality and how it shaped our loan growth and our earnings performance in 2018 we experienced a solid improvement in our asset quality throughout this year this was reflected in reliant s nonperforming assets to total assets improving to 0 30 in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from the low of 0 46 in the fourth quarter of last year total nonperforming loans declined 18 7 to 4 2 million at year end 2018 in the fourth quarter we had net charge offs of 82 000 inaudible we had net recoveries of 125 000 additionally total assets declined 19 or 3 2 million in the third quarter with most of the decline coming in no loss to the bank at year end we have one property at 1 million in other real estate owned our allowance for loan losses increased over the past year from 189 of nonperforming loans at year end 2017 to 259 at year end 2018 our credit term remains focused on high quality loans while aggressively pursuing loans that demonstrate earning weaknesses on the deposit front we were successful in expanding our deposit base through organic growth and the acquisition of community first total deposits rose 62 7 for the year to a record 1 4 billion deposits grew 3 from the third quarter or 12 1 on an annualized basis more importantly our cost relationship deposits checking saving and money market accounts grew 4 during the quarter or 16 annualized our continued success in growing deposits during the fourth quarter is partly attributable to starting regional branches in murfreesboro and chattanooga our chattanooga deposits were up 43 since the second quarter of 2018 while our murfreesboro deposits jumped 86 over the same period reliant posted record net income of 14 1 million for 2018 or 94 4 from 7 2 million in 2017 the key drivers for our growth in net income were the completion of community first merger growth in our net interest income and lower provision for loan losses growth in noninterest income and lower income tax expense fourth quarter net income was up almost 257 to 4 1 million compared with 1 2 million in the fourth quarter of last year our excellent performance compared with the fourth quarter last year is due to the same factors plus significantly lower merger related expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 when we were finalizing community first merger we believe our solid performance since last year highlights our organic growth and strong economy that is driving our growth metrics with that overview of our growth in net income loans and deposits i want review in more detail from our few more details on our segments of operations and balance sheet net interest income rose 52 3 to 13 6 million up from 8 9 million in the fourth quarter of last year key drivers were solid growth in interest and fees on loans and high income from our investment portfolio majority of the increase is related to growth in average earning assets of 52 8 or 1 55 million most of this was due to organic loan growth and average loans are up 59 to 1 2 million through 2018 the acceleration on our loan growth was highlighted by average loans growing 20 1 on an annualized basis since the third quarter compared with average earning assets growing to 11 6 on annualized basis for the same period on a linked quarter basis interest income rose 5 1 to 18 5 million and was offset by 19 1 increase in interest expense over the past quarter funding costs increased due to the rising deposit rates competition in our market for deposits and higher federal home buying borrowing costs we also added 11 6 million in subordinated debt as part of the community first merger that contributed to our growth in interest expense compared to the fourth quarter of last year our interest margin improved to 3 82 in the fourth quarter up 5 basis points from 3 77 in the third quarter of this year of last year ph and up 2 basis points for the fourth quarter of last year after removing the effect of purchase accounting adjustments our net interest margin was 3 7 for the fourth quarter of 2018 up 3 basis points from prior quarter down 4 basis points from fourth quarter of 2017 loan yields excluding fees in the fourth quarter of 2018 were up 27 basis points from the third quarter of 2018 and up 72 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 inaudible as we began to see a rift and our fixed rate yields and our variable rate portfolios benefited from the increase in short term rates weighted average yield on loan production in the fourth quarter rose to 5 6 an increase of 33 basis points from the third quarter 2018 loan accretion from the community first merger added 13 basis points to our fourth quarter margin compared to 10 basis points in the third quarter in both the fourth quarter and the third quarter of 2018 we had inaudible state tax credits these credits increased our margin by 22 basis points in the fourth quarter and 10 basis points in third quarter one of these loans was originated in the fourth quarter and higher tax credit was realized in that quarter on go forward basis we expect this credit to influence our margin by approximately 8 basis points going forward ph deposit costs rose 23 basis points to 1 04 ph in the fourth quarter from 1 19 in the third quarter of 2018 they were up 48 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 our deposit betas rose in fourth quarter as deposit rates continue to be pressured by competition as we enter 2019 we believe that the deposit rates is slow as we get closer to normalization of rates in our local markets our margin results have been affected by the increase in borrowing cost from the federal home loan bank the inaudible of subordinated debt from the community first merger and incremental cost of interest rate swaps that were added in the second and third quarter of 2018 total funding cost increased to 1 54 for the fourth quarter of 2018 20 basis points over the third quarter of 2018 57 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2017 the total notional value of the interest rate swaps was 60 million in third quarter of 2018 and 30 million in the second quarter of 2018 the remaining 60 million ph in the fourth quarter of 2018 interest rate swaps reduced our nim by 2 basis points in the fourth quarter and 3 basis points in the third quarter as of december 31 2018 37 of our loan portfolio inaudible adjustable rate interest rates up from 35 inaudible of the third quarter new loan production was more focused on variable rates with 68 of fourth quarter s production came in at adjustable rates competition for high quality commercial fixed rate loans with peers in our market although pricing assuming improvement for over the past quarter construction loans will only float with prime and remain relatively profitable for us in the fourth quarter 31 of our loan production or 31 9 million was construction related the outstanding balance of our book of construction loans was 146 7 million up with 110 8 million remaining to disbursed additional drivers affecting our net interest margin since the fourth quarter of last year are the lower federal income tax rate that reduced the tax equivalent yield in our municipal security portfolio our margin was negatively impacted by a reduction in tax equivalent yield of 11 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 non interest income in our retail banking segment was now 8 2 over the third quarter we experienced 9 8 increase in our service charges from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that reported a gain of inaudible for the year noninterest income from retail banking segment was up 60 8 from 2017 primarily due to higher service charge income and debit card fees we benefited from an increase in service charges on deposits from community first merger noninterest expenses for our retail banking segment excluding merger expenses were up 7 from the third quarter of 2018 the increase was due to largely to higher expenses associated with the opening of new branches in murfreesboro and chattanooga 233 000 increase in incentive compensation and stock option expense of 115 000 in non recurring expenses our tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 111 5 to benefit of 59 000 compared to the expense of 519 000 for the third quarter while our tax expense for the year ended 2018 decreased 29 4 to 1 4 million compared to 1 9 million for the year ended december 17 the main driver of the decreases was the addition of the two loans with distributed significant state tax credits one of which was originated in the fourth quarter of 2018 another item that contributed to the decrease compared to 2017 was the 620 000 revaluation of deferred tax asset that was recorded in december of last year of 2017 lastly the bank formed an investment subsidiary and transferred its investment portfolio to it in the fourth quarter of 2018 this further reduced tax expenses by 88 000 in the fourth quarter in 2019 we expect our effective tax rate to be around 14 for purposes of gaap inaudible mortgage operation s revenue and expenses were combined with the bank and the holding company and then netted out as a non controlling interest of the subsidiary for the fourth quarter of 2018 the mortgage subsidiary generated a net loss of 1 3 million compared with a net loss of 842 000 for the third quarter of 18 and net loss of 185 000 loans for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a reminder our joint venture partner is solely responsible for funding losses in the mortgage operation gains on sale mortgage loans sold was down 74 4 from the third quarter and were down 51 3 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 before turning the call back over to devan i will comment on few additional balance sheet items investment securities available for sale rose 3 3 million or 1 1 from the third quarter our yield in investment securities was up 11 basis points from the third quarter to 3 94 ph reliant s total deposits were up 12 1 on an annualized basis from the third quarter to 1 4 billion compared with the fourth quarter last year total deposits were up 52 8 ph due to organic growth and the acquisition of community first as we ve noted in last call the competition for deposits is intense in the greater nashville market and this has put upward pressure on the rates what we pay to remain competitive as i mentioned earlier our cost of interest bearing deposits was up 20 basis points in the last quarter to 1 41 our cost for wholesale and deposit continues to increase at faster rates than other interest bearing accounts due to fed rate increases we are working hard to increase the percentage of noninterest bearing and low cost deposit with combination of incentive plans treasury management enhancements inaudible branch opening and high growth markets i ll wrap up my review with a few key comments about our strong capital position reliant s total stockholders equity was up 68 3 million to 208 4 million since the fourth quarter of last year our capital ratios continue to remain very strong with our tier 1 leverage ratio of 10 17 and our total risk based ratio at 13 2 i ll now turn the call back over to devan devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer thanks dan before opening the call for questions i want to highlight our strategy for growth our focus on loan quality and our outlook for the first half of 2019 as i noted in our third quarter call our board of directors approved an updated strategic plan in the mid year 2018 that focused on growing reliant bank by developing our existing markets to enhance our organic growth potential our new banking centers in murfreesboro and chattanooga were part of this plan we ve ramped up our call activity expanded our direct marketing programs and added new lenders in key markets we re already benefiting from these activities based on the acceleration of loan and deposit growth that we experienced in the second half of 2018 we re also continuing to pursue the m a opportunities our focus will be on banks in our existing footprint that can provide scale growth core funding and that are a good cultural fit with our company dan highlighted the progress that we made over the past year in improving asset quality we re in a dynamic growth market and our team has the opportunity to land at higher levels however we re not chasing higher loan volume by lowering our credit standards we passed on potential deals that did not meet our underwriting standards and have increased due diligence for many potential credits evaluating not only the credit qualities of deal but the overall market for new projects that are coming on line that might have a future impact on borrowing last quarter i reviewed our loan due diligence process for the community first merger as part of that process we identified about 2 million in non accrual loans net of purchase discounts 461 000 in loans 90 days pass through and 1 7 million in ore over the past year we focused on remediation of those non performing assets since the first quarter of this year we ve experienced a 34 7 decrease in non accrual loans ore is down 39 4 from community first merger date non performing assets to total assets improved by 20 basis points all without experiencing significant losses our credit team led is by alan mims is on the call with us today and will be available to answer your questions another part of our strategic plan relates to the culture of reliant bank and how organizational structure affects our profitability we have embraced the culture within reliant that ties our employees to our great success we believe this program will drive future profits as we work together as a team and serve our customers and to build shareholder value we remain optimistic about the outlook for our company in the coming months all of our primary markets are strong and the addition of new jobs low employment rates and low income taxes in the state are very favorable for future growth based on the current trends we expect continued growth in 2019 operator that concludes my remarks for this morning s call and we ll now open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you sir operator instructions first we ll hear from kevin fitzsimmons with fig partners kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst hey good morning devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning kevin james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst dan it was a little difficult to hear you on some of the details did you say the ongoing sustainable tax rate to assume for 2019 was about 14 james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it is kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst and is that consolidated is that bank segment only james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer that is consolidated kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst can you is it what would you call it on a bank segment only if we re pulling out the mortgage sub james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer it s the same here inaudible the bank the retail segment would be 14 kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst for the retail okay okay james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer inaudible the mortgage fees does contribute to that kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst yes i strip out the mortgage fees all together so i just wanted to be sure on the same basis so looking back to this past quarter can you give a little more detail on you know pulling out one timers and looking at banks the retail bank segment only it looks like the tax rate was less than 1 how should we look at how much benefit was something permanent that we should be factoring in and was there any if this is coming from the state tax credits was there any linkage over in nii so in other words was benefit that would normally be coming from nii flowing to the tax line in fourth quarter james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes let me address it this way so for the calculation of our margin we do include the effect of the state tax credits so that s why i commented that for the quarter it impacted our margin by about 23 basis points however as you just noticed it doesn t flow through the nii in dollars it flows through the taxes only on the income statement so what happened in the fourth quarter we originated another cdfi ph loan for 9 million we had one that was already on there for 13 million the 9 million gives a 5 credit so we took 450 000 tax benefit for that loan in the fourth quarter that 450 000 is added to the net interest income for calculations of margin does that make sense kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst yes devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer so kevin this devan kind of how this works it s not real obvious but what we have today is basically three of these loans that we re receiving tax credits on they total about 45 million dan just mentioned the one that was booked in the fourth quarter all three of those loans carry a note rate of 0 what we get is we get a tax credit annually on the outstanding balance that s equivalent to 5 of the loan amount that s obviously after tax so it basically yields us a loan yield pre tax of little over 6 and so there s no net interest income there s no impact from having these three loans with tax credits on if you impute an interest rate to that it s about 1 250 million in a year so the trade off is no revenue comes through our margin which you ll get an effective yield of about 6 from a tax standpoint you understand that kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst got it i do so now but now looking forward is there any this trade off between taxes and nii is this same sort of thing going to be playing out in coming quarters is it factored into the 14 or is it not is it was a some we just saw this quarter devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer it will play out in coming quarters the tax benefit is an annual number so we will basically get a 5 tax credit in 2019 on the balance of those loans james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer so kevin yes i factored it into the 14 on a go forward basis for taxes as far as the margin is concerned on a reported basis it will represent about 8 basis points per quarter technical difficulty so our nominal margin on a go forward basis should be somewhere around 3 6 kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst got it okay that s very helpful guys thanks and could i just one quick follow up can i ask i know you guys announced a while back the buyback plan and all the bank stocks have been hit since then can you say whether you guys have been out actively buying back or we not at a trigger point yet where you guys would be contemplating that thanks devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer today kevin we re kind of at that trigger point might be a little bit below that we went into a blackout period while the stock was still trading above our trigger points so depending on what happens over the next few days we may be in the market buying shares back we were ready to do it we have everything set up but until the stock dropped to below 22 a share last week we just didn t have an opportunity to do kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst don t you maybe i m wrong devan but wasn t it a 10b 5 plan which you re not subject to the blackout periods or am i wrong on that devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer you re not wrong on it we actually just put the 10b 5 employees kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst got it okay thank you guys operator and next we ll hear from katherine miller with kbw devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning katherine katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst good morning i m going to one more question on the margin conversation so just to be clear the margin this quarter was 3 82 and so you re saying that the impacts from this tax benefit is going from 22 bps this past quarter to about 8 bps next quarter and so all in you kind of outside of other adjustments the margin is basically going from 3 82 to 3 60 just with the impact of the tax rate and i mean tax credit kind of normalizing is that right james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer multiple speakers 3 60 3 61 kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst i m sorry say that again devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer 3 60 to 3 61 inaudible katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay got it so the margin goes from 3 80 to 3 60 and the tax rates goes from sub 1 to 14 and that both kind of nets out devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yes katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay all right great and then what have you thought about the expense growth rate going into this year i feel like we had higher expense growth this year just with murfreesboro and chattanooga what are you thinking about an appropriate expense rate for 2019 devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me try to address that katherine since this is always a little bit confusing with the segment report in our earnings release and just kind of focused on the retail bank segment report part of that since the mortgage company non interest expenses is going to pass around a good bid depending on net of volume that they do with lending and we did have you know the fourth quarter was up in at the bank level anyway and this includes holding company expenses we re talking about 670 000 over the third quarter and about 350 000 of that was was non recurring so inaudible some of it in our earnings release and we had some marketing and promotional and supplies expense related to the new branches we had a true up in some of our comp plans for bonuses and incentive pay that occurred based on the bank s performance and then we had about 115 000 in non recurring expenses that were related to a couple of m a opportunities that we looked at so that gave you about 350 000 in non recurring that was about half of that 670 000 increase in fourth quarter we re modeling about 10 4 million in non interest expense in the first quarter of this year so you ll have kind of a full load of all the expenses occupancy and personnel related to chattanooga and murfreesboro in there and then we ve made some technology investments as we moved into 2019 as well so that s 10 4 million in the first quarter and then it ll be relatively flat from there on out through the rest of the year katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay got it and then maybe one follow up on the margin at the fte adjustment james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer to get back to fte adjustment devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer what was your question katherine katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst i feel like it yes just with fte adjustment i feel like bounces around a lot just curious or inaudible increasing lot these year so how should we think about what that what level of the fte adjustment we should be looking at next year james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer katherine i think that s probably going to range around 10 basis points to 11 basis points just based on our portfolio yields katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay great thank you devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer bye katherine operator operator instructions next we have to joe fenech with hovde group devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning joe joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst good morning guys hey devan i guess on the loan growth outlook some management teams are getting on fourth quarter calls and just cautioning on loan growth for this year but not really based on what they re seeing in the market just on headlines they re reading about the potential slowdown in gdp growth it sounds like you feel like your markets are still very well insulated from the projected trends in the economy more broadly continue to deliver on that growth we ve seen in the past few years any is that a fair assumption any caveat to that or you feel like you can deliver on what you have done the past few years this year devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer i think we can the economy in the middle tennessee area and in chattanooga looks like it is still got a good bit of momentum we had a good year in 2018 and we re kind of looking at somewhere between 12 and 13 growth that s point to point growth look at our average outstandings from the third and the fourth quarter you saw a big we were up about 5 in terms of average outstandings in our loan portfolio i think part of that joe was just was good new production but we ve also seen in the last i d say three to six months kind of a slowdown in some of the payoff activity that we experienced in 2017 and part of 2018 as rates have moved it s just it s less and less attractive to refinance loans so that activity has slowed down as well we hired some new lenders we re getting good traction in chattanooga and murfreesboro we really didn t have last year without having a full service banking center so i think that 12 to 13 increase on point to point basis in 2019 is attainable joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst okay and then how much of that projection devan is that constraints it all devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer i got some static multiple speakers joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst can you hear me devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yes i can hear you joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst is that long growth projection constrained at all by expectations on the funding side in other words like if the funding environment where what it was two to three years ago where do you think you could kind of comfortably grow loans i m just trying to get a sense for where the economy just from a demand standpoint where things stand relative two years ago taking the funding component out of it for a second if that makes sense devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yes it does make sense i think the forecasted growth rates that we have at least for the next 12 months anyway is not constrained by the funding side if you look at our earnings release and look how it broke out the deposit categories one of the more encouraging things to me was that the low cost deposit accounts what i always talked about is relationship accounts we actually grew at a faster pace in the fourth quarter than we grew loans now it s not as cheap as it has been but i think we ve got a i think we ve still got an opportunity to grow deposits we are in markets in 2019 that we just really kind of barely scratched in 2018 i talked about murfreesboro and chattanooga combined they have about 11 billion in deposits in those markets and we ve been pretty aggressive in doing some advertising and direct marketing and doing some deposit specials in those markets and received some good results from that so i don t anticipate funding in 2019 to be a constraint on our ability to meet our loan targets joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst okay so it s not like you d be growing 15 16 17 if because of funding 12 to 13 is what you see is sort of a legitimate growth rate the market is offering you within the credit standards that you have devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yes that s that s correct that s right joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst okay and then i guess lastly for me just on the margin fair to say that for the faster growers like yourself that a pause by the fed could kind of have a disproportionate benefit to you all as the asset side maybe catches up a bit and the funding side slows a bit are you really seeing 2019 as if the fed does take a pause here to as the year over year able to show some decent margin expansion devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think that s a fair assessment we still saw deposit rates going up in the fourth quarter and we re remodeling higher rates in the first quarter this year but when i look at when i look at just a let s say a comparison between december and january so i know it s just one month but we typically through 2018 we saw increases every month in january to december excuse me december to january it s been pretty flat so i d say as in a rate increase i would expect to see deposit increases moderate some on the other hand you know when i look at our loan yields they have been moving up that s a combination of new loan production at higher rates and you know maturing term loans that we have a chance to reprice up we ve got a quite a few of those coming up in 2019 as well but you know we get our loan production in the first quarter of 2018 was at an average weighted average rate of 5 12 and we move that up to 5 60 in fourth quarter so that s a significant increase in production a lot of that fourth quarter production has not actually hit our books yet in terms of funding because it was construction related so i think there s an opportunity if rates stay stable for us to see some expansion in our margin i don t know that i would see it much in the first quarter joe but certainly second quarter maybe going forward joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst yeah i was going to suggest so maybe first quarter looks a bit like the fourth quarter and then if there s a pause in march second third quarter is where you start to see that pick up devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer i think that s right joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst okay all right thank you guys devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and at this time it doesn t appear that we have any further questions from the audience i d like to turn the floor back to management for any additional or closing remarks devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive

387 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase of 496 million was mostly due to higher sales volume favorable price realization and lower restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower profit from financial products financial products operating profit was lower primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses which was mostly driven by a 72 million unfavorable impact from an increase in allowance rate and an increase in write offs of 13 million due to continued weakening in the cat power finance portfolio this was partially offset by higher average earning assets operating profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 13 1 percent compared with 10 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 profit loss by segment millions of fourth

compared with a loss of 107 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the unfavorable change was primarily a result of an increase in mark to market losses related to pension and opeb plans and an unfavorable impact from equity securities the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter reflected an annual effective tax rate of approximately 24 percent compared with approximately 28 percent for the full year of 2017 excluding the items discussed below the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the u s corporate tax rate beginning january 1 2018 along with other changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective the provision for income taxes also included the following non cash benefits of 63 million and 111 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively from reductions in the valuation allowance against u s state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the united states a 50 million increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 related

impacts due to a stronger u s dollar in north america the sales increase was driven by higher demand for new equipment with about half due to an increase in dealer inventories the increase in demand was primarily to support oil and gas activities including pipelines and non residential building construction activities favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement

review our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 we appreciate your continued interest in our company we had a very strong quarter and reported record net income loans deposits and assets for our fourth quarter and for the year ended december 31 2018 our fourth quarter net income attributable to common shareholders was up 257 to 4 1 million and eps was up 177 to 0 36 per fully diluted share compared to the fourth quarter of last year our strong earnings growth was due to the contribution from the community first merger completed at the beginning of the year inaudible growth in loan volume and earning assets higher noninterest income and improved asset quality a major contributor to our earnings growth in 2018 was consistent growth in loans and a shift and mix toward more profitable variable rate lending our loans grew 59 4 from december 2017 to a record 1 2 billion at year end 2018 loan production remained strong in fourth quarter with 104 million in new loans an increase of 23 over the same quarter last year this was our 14th consecutive quarter of loan growth and that growth has been focused on building relationships with customers in middle tennessee and chattanooga we experienced loan growth across our markets including solid contributions from our new offices in murfreesboro and chattanooga we opened our murfreesboro office late in the third quarter and our chattanooga office opened midway through the fourth quarter we re also starting 2019 with a strong and diverse pipeline for new loans and we expect sustained growth in the first quarter as i reported in last quarter we continue to experience strong competition for loans across our markets our loan portfolio is built on solid underwriting and risk management practices and we remain focused on lending to quality home builders real estate developers and small to midsize business customers at the end of the fourth quarter we had branches in seven counties with nashville davidson county at the core inaudible well positioned to capture our share with the robust growth in our markets without reducing our focus on quality credits dan will provide more details about our superior credit metrics that are critical part of building our existing loan portfolio and a significant factor in maintaining our base for future earnings the economy in the greater nashville area remained strong going into the new year we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation and our local market is growing by about a 100 net new persons per day in recent months nashville was named as the new operations center of excellence for amazon that will add about ph 5 000 high paying jobs and another 600 quality jobs are projected to be added by e y in nashville e y will add about 200 technology focused jobs and another 400 tax related positions to their existing nashville office that employs about 300 in january volkswagen ag announced that chattanooga will be home to the company s first electric vehicle manufacturing facility in north america with an estimated investment of 800 million and the creation of 1 000 jobs general motors also announced that their plant in middle tennessee in the spring hill area will manufacture the cadillac xt6 the company s first electric suv adding approximately 200 jobs and 300 million investment gm plant is located in murray county a market we acquired with community first and is a major contributor to williamson county as well we believe this additional growth in high quality high paying jobs in our primary markets will drive increased demand for loans in the commercial and residential sectors as we mentioned last quarter we opened our first branch in rutherford county in city of murfreesboro rutherford county has a deposit base of 4 6 billion and it s home to a strong and diverse economy that includes one of the state s largest universities with about 22 000 students and nissan s automotive assembly plant we are very pleased with the community s positive response to our new branch in murfreesboro and believe it will be a solid contributor to our loan and deposit growth in 2019 our new branch in chattanooga also contributed to our growth since its opening with almost 8 billion in deposits hamilton county presents us with a significant opportunity for growth in core deposits we remain very positive about our future as we enter 2019 we have a robust and diverse loan pipeline the economy across our markets remain strong and growing we re delighted reliant has additional opportunities to grow organically and through potential acquisitions within our footprint our credit quality is sound we have a strong capital position to support our continued growth also during 2018 our board of directors increased our cash dividend in recognition of our growth and record earnings performance i want to thank the entire reliant team for their continued contributions to our results our employees work with our customers everyday to meet their banking needs during the past year they played a very important role in building and cultivating customer relationships that have resulted in our exceptional loan and deposit growth and we have similar expectations going into 2019 i ll now turn the call over to dan dellinger our cfo to review our fourth quarter results in more details james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning everyone and thanks devan one of the key drivers of our solid earnings performance for the quarter and for the year is related to the growth in our loan portfolio as we noted last quarter loan demand ramped up late in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter with the expected seasonal slowing of the loan demand our fourth quarter loan production remained strong at 104 1 million 23 increase than the same quarter 2017 our loans were up 59 4 to 1 2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of last year loans were up 3 1 or 12 4 on an annualized basis since the third quarter as we have noted in the past many of these new loans do not fully fund at the origination date so they represent future growth in interest income as the projects are built out and the loans are funded at december 31st our top 10 inaudible construction loans at 42 million left to fund fourth quarter loan demand for new loans was led by cld at 38 c i 28 consumer and 1 4 family loans at 22 and cre at 12 the majority of our loan growth is driven by commercial construction activity and positive economic trends in middle tennessee and chattanooga our organic loan growth has been in the low double digits over the past year and we expect similar growth over the next level quarters i want to pick up on devan s comments about asset quality and how it shaped our loan growth and our earnings performance in 2018 we experienced a solid improvement in our asset quality throughout this year this was reflected in reliant s nonperforming assets to total assets improving to 0 30 in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from the low of 0 46 in the fourth quarter of last year total nonperforming loans declined 18 7 to 4 2 million at year end 2018 in the fourth quarter we had net charge offs of 82 000 inaudible we had net recoveries of 125 000 additionally total assets declined 19 or 3 2 million in the third quarter with most of the decline coming in no loss to the bank at year end we have one property at 1 million in other real estate owned our allowance for loan losses increased over the past year from 189 of nonperforming loans at year end 2017 to 259 at year end 2018 our credit term remains focused on high quality loans while aggressively pursuing loans that demonstrate earning weaknesses on the deposit front we were successful in expanding our deposit base through organic growth and the acquisition of community first total deposits rose 62 7 for the year to a record 1 4 billion deposits grew 3 from the third quarter or 12 1 on an annualized basis more importantly our cost relationship deposits checking saving and money market accounts grew 4 during the quarter or 16 annualized our continued success in growing deposits during the fourth quarter is partly attributable to starting regional branches in murfreesboro and chattanooga our chattanooga deposits were up 43 since the second quarter of 2018 while our murfreesboro deposits jumped 86 over the same period reliant posted record net income of 14 1 million for 2018 or 94 4 from 7 2 million in 2017 the key drivers for our growth in net income were the completion of community first merger growth in our net interest income and lower provision for loan losses growth in noninterest income and lower income tax expense fourth quarter net income was up almost 257 to 4 1 million compared with 1 2 million in the fourth quarter of last year our excellent performance compared with the fourth quarter last year is due to the same factors plus significantly lower merger related expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 when we were finalizing community first merger we believe our solid performance since last year highlights our organic growth and strong economy that is driving our growth metrics with that overview of our growth in net income loans and deposits i want review in more detail from our few more details on our segments of operations and balance sheet net interest income rose 52 3 to 13 6 million up from 8 9 million in the fourth quarter of last year key drivers were solid growth in interest and fees on loans and high income from our investment portfolio majority of the increase is related to growth in average earning assets of 52 8 or 1 55 million most of this was due to organic loan growth and average loans are up 59 to 1 2 million through 2018 the acceleration on our loan growth was highlighted by average loans growing 20 1 on an annualized basis since the third quarter compared with average earning assets growing to 11 6 on annualized basis for the same period on a linked quarter basis interest income rose 5 1 to 18 5 million and was offset by 19 1 increase in interest expense over the past quarter funding costs increased due to the rising deposit rates competition in our market for deposits and higher federal home buying borrowing costs we also added 11 6 million in subordinated debt as part of the community first merger that contributed to our growth in interest expense compared to the fourth quarter of last year our interest margin improved to 3 82 in the fourth quarter up 5 basis points from 3 77 in the third quarter of this year of last year ph and up 2 basis points for the fourth quarter of last year after removing the effect of purchase accounting adjustments our net interest margin was 3 7 for the fourth quarter of 2018 up 3 basis points from prior quarter down 4 basis points from fourth quarter of 2017 loan yields excluding fees in the fourth quarter of 2018 were up 27 basis points from the third quarter of 2018 and up 72 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 inaudible as we began to see a rift and our fixed rate yields and our variable rate portfolios benefited from the increase in short term rates weighted average yield on loan production in the fourth quarter rose to 5 6 an increase of 33 basis points from the third quarter 2018 loan accretion from the community first merger added 13 basis points to our fourth quarter margin compared to 10 basis points in the third quarter in both the fourth quarter and the third quarter of 2018 we had inaudible state tax credits these credits increased our margin by 22 basis points in the fourth quarter and 10 basis points in third quarter one of these loans was originated in the fourth quarter and higher tax credit was realized in that quarter on go forward basis we expect this credit to influence our margin by approximately 8 basis points going forward ph deposit costs rose 23 basis points to 1 04 ph in the fourth quarter from 1 19 in the third quarter of 2018 they were up 48 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 our deposit betas rose in fourth quarter as deposit rates continue to be pressured by competition as we enter 2019 we believe that the deposit rates is slow as we get closer to normalization of rates in our local markets our margin results have been affected by the increase in borrowing cost from the federal home loan bank the inaudible of subordinated debt from the community first merger and incremental cost of interest rate swaps that were added in the second and third quarter of 2018 total funding cost increased to 1 54 for the fourth quarter of 2018 20 basis points over the third quarter of 2018 57 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2017 the total notional value of the interest rate swaps was 60 million in third quarter of 2018 and 30 million in the second quarter of 2018 the remaining 60 million ph in the fourth quarter of 2018 interest rate swaps reduced our nim by 2 basis points in the fourth quarter and 3 basis points in the third quarter as of december 31 2018 37 of our loan portfolio inaudible adjustable rate interest rates up from 35 inaudible of the third quarter new loan production was more focused on variable rates with 68 of fourth quarter s production came in at adjustable rates competition for high quality commercial fixed rate loans with peers in our market although pricing assuming improvement for over the past quarter construction loans will only float with prime and remain relatively profitable for us in the fourth quarter 31 of our loan production or 31 9 million was construction related the outstanding balance of our book of construction loans was 146 7 million up with 110 8 million remaining to disbursed additional drivers affecting our net interest margin since the fourth quarter of last year are the lower federal income tax rate that reduced the tax equivalent yield in our municipal security portfolio our margin was negatively impacted by a reduction in tax equivalent yield of 11 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 non interest income in our retail banking segment was now 8 2 over the third quarter we experienced 9 8 increase in our service charges from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that reported a gain of inaudible for the year noninterest income from retail banking segment was up 60 8 from 2017 primarily due to higher service charge income and debit card fees we benefited from an increase in service charges on deposits from community first merger noninterest expenses for our retail banking segment excluding merger expenses were up 7 from the third quarter of 2018 the increase was due to largely to higher expenses associated with the opening of new branches in murfreesboro and chattanooga 233 000 increase in incentive compensation and stock option expense of 115 000 in non recurring expenses our tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 111 5 to benefit of 59 000 compared to the expense of 519 000 for the third quarter while our tax expense for the year ended 2018 decreased 29 4 to 1 4 million compared to 1 9 million for the year ended december 17 the main driver of the decreases was the addition of the two loans with distributed significant state tax credits one of which was originated in the fourth quarter of 2018 another item that contributed to the decrease compared to 2017 was the 620 000 revaluation of deferred tax asset that was recorded in december of last year of 2017 lastly the bank formed an investment subsidiary and transferred its investment portfolio to it in the fourth quarter of 2018 this further reduced tax expenses by 88 000 in the fourth quarter in 2019 we expect our effective tax rate to be around 14 for purposes of gaap inaudible mortgage operation s revenue and expenses were combined with the bank and the holding company and then netted out as a non controlling interest of the subsidiary for the fourth quarter of 2018 the mortgage subsidiary generated a net loss of 1 3 million compared with a net loss of 842 000 for the third quarter of 18 and net loss of 185 000 loans for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a reminder our joint venture partner is solely responsible for funding losses in the mortgage operation gains on sale mortgage loans sold was down 74 4 from the third quarter and were down 51 3 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 before turning the call back over to devan i will comment on few additional balance sheet items investment securities available for sale rose 3 3 million or 1 1 from the third quarter our yield in investment securities was up 11 basis points from the third quarter to 3 94 ph reliant s total deposits were up 12 1 on an annualized basis from the third quarter to 1 4 billion compared with the fourth quarter last year total deposits were up 52 8 ph due to organic growth and the acquisition of community first as we ve noted in last call the competition for deposits is intense in the greater nashville market and this has put upward pressure on the rates what we pay to remain competitive as i mentioned earlier our cost of interest bearing deposits was up 20 basis points in the last quarter to 1 41 our cost for wholesale and deposit continues to increase at faster rates than other interest bearing accounts due to fed rate increases we are working hard to increase the percentage of noninterest bearing and low cost deposit with combination of incentive plans treasury management enhancements inaudible branch opening and high growth markets i ll wrap up my review with a few key comments about our strong capital position reliant s total stockholders equity was up 68 3 million to 208 4 million since the fourth quarter of last year our capital ratios continue to remain very strong with our tier 1 leverage ratio of 10 17 and our total risk based ratio at 13 2 i ll now turn the call back over to devan devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer thanks dan before opening the call for questions i want to highlight our strategy for growth our focus on loan quality and our outlook for the first half of 2019 as i noted in our third quarter call our board of directors approved an updated strategic plan in the mid year 2018 that focused on growing reliant bank by developing our existing markets to enhance our organic growth potential our new banking centers in murfreesboro and chattanooga were part of this plan we ve ramped up our call activity expanded our direct marketing programs and added new lenders in key markets we re already benefiting from these activities based on the acceleration of loan and deposit growth that we experienced in the second half of 2018 we re also continuing to pursue the m a opportunities our focus will be on banks in our existing footprint that can provide scale growth core funding and that are a good cultural fit with our company dan highlighted the progress that we made over the past year in improving asset quality we re in a dynamic growth market and our team has the opportunity to land at higher levels however we re not chasing higher loan volume by lowering our credit standards we passed on potential deals that did not meet our underwriting standards and have increased due diligence for many potential credits evaluating not only the credit qualities of deal but the overall market for new projects that are coming on line that might have a future impact on borrowing last quarter i reviewed our loan due diligence process for the community first merger as part of that process we identified about 2 million in non accrual loans net of purchase discounts 461 000 in loans 90 days pass through and 1 7 million in ore over the past year we focused on remediation of those non performing assets since the first quarter of this year we ve experienced a 34 7 decrease in non accrual loans ore is down 39 4 from community first merger date non performing assets to total assets improved by 20 basis points all without experiencing significant losses our credit team led is by alan mims is on the call with us today and will be available to answer your questions another part of our strategic plan relates to the culture of reliant bank and how organizational structure affects our profitability we have embraced the culture within reliant that ties our employees to our great success we believe this program will drive future profits as we work together as a team and serve our customers and to build shareholder value we remain optimistic about the outlook for our company in the coming months all of our primary markets are strong and the addition of new jobs low employment rates and low income taxes in the state are very favorable for future growth based on the current trends we expect continued growth in 2019 operator that concludes my remarks for this morning s call and we ll now open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you sir operator instructions first we ll hear from kevin fitzsimmons with fig partners kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst hey good morning devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning kevin james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst dan it was a little difficult to hear you on some of the details did you say the ongoing sustainable tax rate to assume for 2019 was about 14 james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it is kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst and is that consolidated is that bank segment only james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer that is consolidated kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst can you is it what would you call it on a bank segment only if we re pulling out the mortgage sub james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer it s the same here inaudible the bank the retail segment would be 14 kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst for the retail okay okay james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer inaudible the mortgage fees does contribute to that kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst yes i strip out the mortgage fees all together so i just wanted to be sure on the same basis so looking back to this past quarter can you give a little more detail on you know pulling out one timers and looking at banks the retail bank segment only it looks like the tax rate was less than 1 how should we look at how much benefit was something permanent that we should be factoring in and was there any if this is coming from the state tax credits was there any linkage over in nii so in other words was benefit that would normally be coming from nii flowing to the tax line in fourth quarter james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes let me address it this way so for the calculation of our margin we do include the effect of the state tax credits so that s why i commented that for the quarter it impacted our margin by about 23 basis points however as you just noticed it doesn t flow through the nii in dollars it flows through the taxes only on the income statement so what happened in the fourth quarter we originated another cdfi ph loan for 9 million we had one that was already on there for 13 million the 9 million gives a 5 credit so we took 450 000 tax benefit for that loan in the fourth quarter that 450 000 is added to the net interest income for calculations of margin does that make sense kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst yes devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer so kevin this devan kind of how this works it s not real obvious but what we have today is basically three of these loans that we re receiving tax credits on they total about 45 million dan just mentioned the one that was booked in the fourth quarter all three of those loans carry a note rate of 0 what we get is we get a tax credit annually on the outstanding balance that s equivalent to 5 of the loan amount that s obviously after tax so it basically yields us a loan yield pre tax of little over 6 and so there s no net interest income there s no impact from having these three loans with tax credits on if you impute an interest rate to that it s about 1 250 million in a year so the trade off is no revenue comes through our margin which you ll get an effective yield of about 6 from a tax standpoint you understand that kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst got it i do so now but now looking forward is there any this trade off between taxes and nii is this same sort of thing going to be playing out in coming quarters is it factored into the 14 or is it not is it was a some we just saw this quarter devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer it will play out in coming quarters the tax benefit is an annual number so we will basically get a 5 tax credit in 2019 on the balance of those loans james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer so kevin yes i factored it into the 14 on a go forward basis for taxes as far as the margin is concerned on a reported basis it will represent about 8 basis points per quarter technical difficulty so our nominal margin on a go forward basis should be somewhere around 3 6 kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst got it okay that s very helpful guys thanks and could i just one quick follow up can i ask i know you guys announced a while back the buyback plan and all the bank stocks have been hit since then can you say whether you guys have been out actively buying back or we not at a trigger point yet where you guys would be contemplating that thanks devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer today kevin we re kind of at that trigger point might be a little bit below that we went into a blackout period while the stock was still trading above our trigger points so depending on what happens over the next few days we may be in the market buying shares back we were ready to do it we have everything set up but until the stock dropped to below 22 a share last week we just didn t have an opportunity to do kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst don t you maybe i m wrong devan but wasn t it a 10b 5 plan which you re not subject to the blackout periods or am i wrong on that devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer you re not wrong on it we actually just put the 10b 5 employees kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst got it okay thank you guys operator and next we ll hear from katherine miller with kbw devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning katherine katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst good morning i m going to one more question on the margin conversation so just to be clear the margin this quarter was 3 82 and so you re saying that the impacts from this tax benefit is going from 22 bps this past quarter to about 8 bps next quarter and so all in you kind of outside of other adjustments the margin is basically going from 3 82 to 3 60 just with the impact of the tax rate and i mean tax credit kind of normalizing is that right james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer multiple speakers 3 60 3 61 kevin patrick fitzsimmons fig partners llc analyst i m sorry say that again devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer 3 60 to 3 61 inaudible katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay got it so the margin goes from 3 80 to 3 60 and the tax rates goes from sub 1 to 14 and that both kind of nets out devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yes katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay all right great and then what have you thought about the expense growth rate going into this year i feel like we had higher expense growth this year just with murfreesboro and chattanooga what are you thinking about an appropriate expense rate for 2019 devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me try to address that katherine since this is always a little bit confusing with the segment report in our earnings release and just kind of focused on the retail bank segment report part of that since the mortgage company non interest expenses is going to pass around a good bid depending on net of volume that they do with lending and we did have you know the fourth quarter was up in at the bank level anyway and this includes holding company expenses we re talking about 670 000 over the third quarter and about 350 000 of that was was non recurring so inaudible some of it in our earnings release and we had some marketing and promotional and supplies expense related to the new branches we had a true up in some of our comp plans for bonuses and incentive pay that occurred based on the bank s performance and then we had about 115 000 in non recurring expenses that were related to a couple of m a opportunities that we looked at so that gave you about 350 000 in non recurring that was about half of that 670 000 increase in fourth quarter we re modeling about 10 4 million in non interest expense in the first quarter of this year so you ll have kind of a full load of all the expenses occupancy and personnel related to chattanooga and murfreesboro in there and then we ve made some technology investments as we moved into 2019 as well so that s 10 4 million in the first quarter and then it ll be relatively flat from there on out through the rest of the year katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay got it and then maybe one follow up on the margin at the fte adjustment james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer to get back to fte adjustment devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer what was your question katherine katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst i feel like it yes just with fte adjustment i feel like bounces around a lot just curious or inaudible increasing lot these year so how should we think about what that what level of the fte adjustment we should be looking at next year james daniel dellinger executive vice president and chief financial officer katherine i think that s probably going to range around 10 basis points to 11 basis points just based on our portfolio yields katherine miller keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay great thank you devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer bye katherine operator operator instructions next we have to joe fenech with hovde group devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer good morning joe joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst good morning guys hey devan i guess on the loan growth outlook some management teams are getting on fourth quarter calls and just cautioning on loan growth for this year but not really based on what they re seeing in the market just on headlines they re reading about the potential slowdown in gdp growth it sounds like you feel like your markets are still very well insulated from the projected trends in the economy more broadly continue to deliver on that growth we ve seen in the past few years any is that a fair assumption any caveat to that or you feel like you can deliver on what you have done the past few years this year devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer i think we can the economy in the middle tennessee area and in chattanooga looks like it is still got a good bit of momentum we had a good year in 2018 and we re kind of looking at somewhere between 12 and 13 growth that s point to point growth look at our average outstandings from the third and the fourth quarter you saw a big we were up about 5 in terms of average outstandings in our loan portfolio i think part of that joe was just was good new production but we ve also seen in the last i d say three to six months kind of a slowdown in some of the payoff activity that we experienced in 2017 and part of 2018 as rates have moved it s just it s less and less attractive to refinance loans so that activity has slowed down as well we hired some new lenders we re getting good traction in chattanooga and murfreesboro we really didn t have last year without having a full service banking center so i think that 12 to 13 increase on point to point basis in 2019 is attainable joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst okay and then how much of that projection devan is that constraints it all devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer i got some static multiple speakers joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst can you hear me devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yes i can hear you joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst is that long growth projection constrained at all by expectations on the funding side in other words like if the funding environment where what it was two to three years ago where do you think you could kind of comfortably grow loans i m just trying to get a sense for where the economy just from a demand standpoint where things stand relative two years ago taking the funding component out of it for a second if that makes sense devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yes it does make sense i think the forecasted growth rates that we have at least for the next 12 months anyway is not constrained by the funding side if you look at our earnings release and look how it broke out the deposit categories one of the more encouraging things to me was that the low cost deposit accounts what i always talked about is relationship accounts we actually grew at a faster pace in the fourth quarter than we grew loans now it s not as cheap as it has been but i think we ve got a i think we ve still got an opportunity to grow deposits we are in markets in 2019 that we just really kind of barely scratched in 2018 i talked about murfreesboro and chattanooga combined they have about 11 billion in deposits in those markets and we ve been pretty aggressive in doing some advertising and direct marketing and doing some deposit specials in those markets and received some good results from that so i don t anticipate funding in 2019 to be a constraint on our ability to meet our loan targets joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst okay so it s not like you d be growing 15 16 17 if because of funding 12 to 13 is what you see is sort of a legitimate growth rate the market is offering you within the credit standards that you have devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yes that s that s correct that s right joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst okay and then i guess lastly for me just on the margin fair to say that for the faster growers like yourself that a pause by the fed could kind of have a disproportionate benefit to you all as the asset side maybe catches up a bit and the funding side slows a bit are you really seeing 2019 as if the fed does take a pause here to as the year over year able to show some decent margin expansion devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think that s a fair assessment we still saw deposit rates going up in the fourth quarter and we re remodeling higher rates in the first quarter this year but when i look at when i look at just a let s say a comparison between december and january so i know it s just one month but we typically through 2018 we saw increases every month in january to december excuse me december to january it s been pretty flat so i d say as in a rate increase i would expect to see deposit increases moderate some on the other hand you know when i look at our loan yields they have been moving up that s a combination of new loan production at higher rates and you know maturing term loans that we have a chance to reprice up we ve got a quite a few of those coming up in 2019 as well but you know we get our loan production in the first quarter of 2018 was at an average weighted average rate of 5 12 and we move that up to 5 60 in fourth quarter so that s a significant increase in production a lot of that fourth quarter production has not actually hit our books yet in terms of funding because it was construction related so i think there s an opportunity if rates stay stable for us to see some expansion in our margin i don t know that i would see it much in the first quarter joe but certainly second quarter maybe going forward joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst yeah i was going to suggest so maybe first quarter looks a bit like the fourth quarter and then if there s a pause in march second third quarter is where you start to see that pick up devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer i think that s right joseph anthony fenech hovde group llc analyst okay all right thank you guys devan d ard jr chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and at this time it

january 28 2019 turkey s economic turmoil fueled by a currency crisis amid unprecedented tensions with the united states last summer has become the no 1 concern of turkish voters ahead of local elections on march 31 two recent opinion polls suggest economic woes will sway the outcome of the elections with the state of the economy and unemployment topping the list of what people see as the country s primary problems in parallel the surveys point to a decline in popular support for president recep tayyip erdogan s justice and development party akp in power since 2002 the akp is contesting the local elections in partnership with the nationalist movement party mhp which was its electoral ally also in last year s presidential and parliamentary polls the question now is whether the akp could change the popular focus on the economy or make up for the loss of votes with mhp support
most people think that financial stability is good actually stability is bad for financial markets long periods of stability tend to provoke wild swings when market participant wake up from their lethargy we might be heading to one of those moments picture credit the white house academics argue that after an exogenous shock the economy will take its time to come back to balance and then it will hang in there until the next exogenous shock practitioners have a different view after a bust there is a period of adjustment following that new regulations are written weak segments of the economic tissue are discarded and more attractive ones are poised to rise after the recovery phase the economy enters a goldilocks phase nor too cold nor too hot however that has nothing to do with balance actually according to minsky the goldilocks phase is a guarantee of future instability the rationale is pretty simple during the goldilocks phase optimism becomes ingrained everything seems to be in the right place and people feel confident when the cracks begin to appear in the form of some bubbles policymakers face the dilemma of whether to tight or not if they do tight the monetary policy the economy might fall into a recession if they don t the economy might become too hot leading to bubbles formation there s also another problem policymakers struggle to identify bubbles and usually they only spot them when it is too late the goldilocks is over we had solid economic growth low inflation and calm rising markets at the beginning of 2018 several analysts told us that the economy would remain stable however cracks started to appear the monetary normalization policy kicked in and liquidity was taken from the market additionally interest rate hikes didn t help either almost immediately we saw debt ridden economies struggling with a strong dollar as the 10 year yield rose and the liquidity was moped the equities started to falter market participants were incredulous in front of the violent swings supposedly happening during the goldilocks phase since enlightened market participants are conscious that violent downturns in asset prices may provoke recessions thus began an outcry for a pause in interest rates hike the minsky moment the realization that the fed was determined in keeping its normalization route was directly related to the severe drops in 2018 in last december there was a lot of people asking for a pause but the fed didn t budge and another bloodbath followed suit however the weeks after the decision saw a different attitude from powell and the other members they spread out in interviews and keynotes emphasizing that the fed is data dependent and they are sensitive to economic developments that dovish attitude calmed the markets the following weeks will define the course of the economy if the fed chooses to get back to its hawkish tone asset prices will follow considering that the drop in asset prices that took place last year plus the trade war will have a negative impact on the economic data to be released in the following weeks quarters a hike will only make things worse maybe even pushing us to a brief recession if the fed chooses to pause asset price will likely roar maybe even to out of proportion levels that might help the economic data but will ultimately result in the fed feeling betrayed and resume its rate hikes course that process will go on as long as it takes to someone making a mistake the main problem is that postponing the recession by using a dovish stance will result in agents downplaying the market risk thus encouraging higher risk taking and more leveraged risk basically we have reached a point where a hike too soon or too late will determine the end of the bull market investment takeaways either way you can be pretty confident that the low volatility vixy regime of 2017 won t be repeated soon there will be wide swings either way the s p 500 spy might enjoy another leg up if the dovishness prevails after years of stability there are several imbalances and lots of malinvestment in the economy without entering into too much detail you can find a deeper analysis here below are two graphs that reveal both excess and complacency total credit to non financial corporations is now near all time highs source fred high yield corporate debt is on the rise while defaults are near lows source moody s the graphs show credit expansion significant among corporations and low default rates that is the recipe for dangerous complacency analysts that still hold positive outlooks justify them with profit coverage ratios that still seem pretty good and default rates are low however we all know what happens when a recession hits and profits vanish suddenly everyone is in dire straits that said in the current environment the federal reserve will dominate the conversation their decisions will determine a bust now or postponing the bust and having another leg up and possibly a sizable bubble very active investors at this juncture should start thinking about removing beta from their portfolios one simple way is to sift through the cyclical sectors of the s p 500 you can short homebuilders xhb retail xrt or financials xlf as a way to remove beta from a diversified long portfolio more diligent investors might even look into these sectors and pick stocks to go short the problem however and here is the point where investment becomes an art lies on the fact that the outcomes are too symmetric removing beta from the portfolio by shorting cyclical stocks will hurt your performance if another leg up materializes not removing it exposes you to a recession blue pill or red pill disclaimer shorting stocks is a high risk strategy each investor should evaluate the risks involved and decide in conformity
