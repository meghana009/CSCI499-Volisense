forex market is in effect the world s biggest and most liquid asset market this guide will educate you on the basics pros and cons about forex trading as well as enlighten you on trading as a newbie the forex market is often referred to as the most unpredictable yet profitable one in the financial industry the market requires adequate training before delving into it without sufficient knowledge about how the market works a trader might have a tough time achieving success the problem usually encountered by many new traders is that they approach it with unrealistic expectations which usually end with setbacks and regrets what is forex trading before one can embark on a journey to another country it is advisable to exchange your local currency with that of your intended destination the process of carrying this task out is called foreign exchange forex forex can also mean a marketplace where people speculate on currency changes and correlations with the goal of making significant profits paired currencies are the focus of every trade and each currency s value is dependent on its pair for example as a currency pair the eur usd has been set against each other this means that their market behavior will determine their profitability when the price of the first currency euro in this case surges the price of the other usd will decrease and vice versa so the ability of traders to predict their price movements accurately will determine who profits or losses in the forex market essential forex terms leverage leverage is simply help provided to a forex trader in the form of capital by a broker in order for the trader to access high volume trades for instance the effect of leverage of 1 10 on a trader s capital of 1 000 will translate to 10 000 with the bigger capital the trader can trade a currency pair worth 10 000 the success of such trade will mean a profit multiplied by 10 and if it is unsuccessful the loss is also multiplied by the leverage chosen therefore proper care must be employed in the usage of leverage pip every currency pair has a base unit which is known as a pip a pip is 0 0001 of the price quoted so using the eur usd pair as a case study when its bid price goes from 1 16667 to 1 16677 it means a pip change of one spread this is what differentiates the bid price of a currency pair from its ask price most of the time popular currency pairs have low spread and in some cases it is even lower than a pip on the other hand pairs that don t receive as much attention from traders tend to have a much higher spread the profitability of a forex trade is dependent on the ability of a currency pair s value to cross the spread margin margin is used to refer to the money in the account of a trader often the average forex trader cannot trade a high volume due to insufficient margin which is a requirement for such trades thereby they lose the opportunity to make a good profit but today a lot of forex brokers provide their clients with leverage to meet up with the right margin for high volume trades which pairs can you trade forex currency pairs are classified under different names such as majors minors and exotics those in the major category are mostly currencies that are frequently traded like the us dollar british pound new zealand dollar swiss franc canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar euro to be classified as a major currency pair the criteria is for the currency to be paired against the us dollar minor pairs also have the above listed major currencies the only difference from the major pairs is that the us dollar is not included for example eur chf or eur gbp exotic currencies include the following the thai baht thb the norwegian krone nok the hong kong dollar hkd and the south african rand zar those classified as exotic pairs are made up of one exotic currency and one major currency the major currency pairs have become the only choice for most traders especially beginners because of their tight spreads and daily volatility however one should also give attention to exotic pairs because they promise numerous opportunities as well how to select trading pairs the process of selecting trading pairs should not be started without adequate market analysis and information at the fingertips of the trader the purpose of this precaution is to have an educated guess on the possible behavior of the currency pair within a specific period a trader must know the conditions responsible for price changes volatility and also the way a currency can be detrimental to another as a result of all this some traders are avoiding major currency pairs and no longer consider them as the best option in their replacement they go for pairs that are familiar to them because they understand the factors that can influence them as well as have deeper knowledge about their value one important principle traders must adhere to is to never get involved with currency pairs with high spreads instead they should go for those with 0 3 pips this is because the more a trader goes high the more risky and expensive it gets the average trader may not afford the consequences of anything above six pips how liquid are different forex pairs some forex pairs are more liquid than others those with a greater level of liquidity are more popular because everyone wants to trade with them their level of demand and supply is second to none on the forex market this is because most stakeholders attach much more importance to such pairs when compared to others thereby driving up their value pairs that make up this category are referred to as major currency pairs like the eur usd currency pair forex traders tend to gravitate more towards the major currency pairs than any other pair simply because they can be easily liquidated also they abound in opportunities especially in the aspect of short term trading a trait that is too irresistible for traders nonetheless this doesn t mean other currency pair categories are without use because they do a lot of opportunities are inherent in exotic and minor currency pairs which traders will find useful the only requirement with these other categories is a sound knowledge about various world currencies and economies if one must profit from them pros of forex trading in the aspect of liquidity the forex market is second to none as its daily trading volume is ranked largest in the globe consequentially forex traders can easily enter a position in any of the available major currencies and exit it all within seconds for a small spread without being fazed by most market constraints and conditions the forex market is always busy and is operational 24 hours every day five days a week every day trading begins in australia and closes in new york across the world the major centers for forex trading are in new york frankfurt sydney london singapore hong kong paris and tokyo cons of forex trading a lot of traders have become impoverished by ill advised usage of leverage traders are provided with leverage by brokers dealers and banks to enter large positions with their little capital the use of leverage comes with a lot of risks and it is important that a trader is aware of them before utilizing leverage currency trading cannot be done without some basic tools like indicators and an understanding of basic economic principles for a trader to be able to tell currency movements and what drives the values of currencies he needs to have a good knowledge of the economies of different countries and how they affect each other conclusion forex is a profitable business for those who are willing to let go of the wrong perception of the market and are ready to put in the required work both the traders with little funds and those with lots of it have good opportunities to make money in the forex market but they must understand what works best for the resources they have traders with little capital are advised to adopt day trading in little amounts while those with more capital can go for long term fundamentals based trading new forex traders should invest in the knowledge of macroeconomic fundamentals which influences currency values as well as in technical analysis in order to make the most of the forex market
in october of last year the international monetary fund imf released its flagship world economic outlook in that report the imf said that the global growth rate would stumble at 3 in 2019 a month ago the imf s main economists returned to this theme global growth they wrote recorded its weakest pace since the global financial crisis a decade ago the analysis of why there was such a low growth rate rested on the trade war between the united states and china and on associated weaknesses the imf promises a fuller discussion about the crisis in its world economic outlook update which it will release on 20 january strikingly the imf economists note that as a result of global turbulence firms turned cautious on long range spending and global purchases of machinery and equipment declined what this means is that firms are not investing in their expansion or in new technologies instead firms are beginning to rely more and more on outsourced production precarious employment and a permanent regime of low wage work in other words firms are cannibalising society putting immense pressure on fragile networks of family and community deepening the conservative impulses in society and decreasing society s health and well being to prevent a major collapse central banks around the world have lowered interest rates permanently and have provided cheap money to the business world these firms which have not invested in the productive sector are borrowing trillions of dollars which they then put into the world of what karl marx called fictitious capital the value of global stock markets is now nearly 90 trillion according to deutsche bank putting it ahead of global gdp if you add in the total value of global financial stock including bank deposits government and private debt securities and equities the figure in 2004 was 118 trillion it was over 200 trillion in 2010 over 200 of global gdp this expansion of fictitious capital has come more and more within borders and not through global cross border capital flows these flows which include foreign direct investment has shrunk by 65 since 2007 from 12 4 trillion to 4 3 trillion for almost five decades these two processes have confronted human society a slowdown in productive investment from capitalist firms and an increase in the volume and importance of financial capital profit rates have declined overall and debt rates have increased no real attempt has been made to solve this problem largely because there is no easy solution from within the confines of the capitalist system three main avenues opened up to lessen the severity of the crisis on the capitalist system but not to solve the cascading crisis 1 the policy slate of neoliberalism not only freed the capitalist class from the chains of taxation it also deregulated finance and foreign direct investment privatised state services and commodified social wealth the entire drive of neoliberalism weakened the capacity of states to formulate national economic policies since formulating economy policy did not strengthen a democratic order states delivered the advantage to multinational firms including international banks 2 the collapse of the third world project and the weakening of the socialist bloc delivered hundreds of millions of workers into the global working class and thereby allowed firms to bid down wages through subcontracting at the same time as state regulations collapsed through labour market reforms pushed by the imf 3 a massive expansion of debt through lowered interest rates and easy access to credit the institute of international finance shows that global debt is now at 250 trillion and counting it is now 230 of the global gdp government debt accounts for nearly 70 trillion half of the global debt is in the hands of the non financial private sector a new report from the world bank called global waves of debt shows that debt in emerging and developing countries alone continues to break its own records rising to over 55 trillion in 2018 marking an eight year surge that has been the largest fastest and most broad based in nearly five decades this debt in the emerging and developing countries is now 170 of the global gdp but it is this debt that has fuelled what growth can be measured and it is this mountain of debt that perches perilously over the fate of the world we at tricontinental institute for social research have been closely following these developments and offering our analysis of what appears to be a long term structural crisis for capitalism in our dossier no 24 january 2020 we offer a thumbnail assessment of this long term crisis and of the continued policy of austerity then we pivot to an analysis of the emergence of the rivalry between the united states and china we are of the view that the trade war between the united states and china is not an irrational phenomenon but that it is precisely the outgrowth of both the long term economic crisis and of the policies of austerity this assessment allows us to provide a brief analysis of the approach towards these matters that is being developed by the institute for international relations at tsinghua university beijing the key finding of the tsinghua approach is that we are entering a bipolar world order in which there will eventually be two major powers in the world the united states and china either these two powers will come to some understanding over the international organisations such as the imf and the world bank or more regional organisations will appear with different standards and a more heterogenous understanding of trade and development whether these fissiparous tendencies will make an impact on the world financial system is not part of any of these discussions which seems to indicate that it will remain intact for countries in the global south the implication of continuities of financial power means that no major change at a global level will be possible in this bipolar dispensation what alternatives there will be for austerity regimes are unclear the slow attrition of us power and the emergence of the bipolar order can be glimpsed in the ongoing crises in west asia the us assassination of an iranian general who was carrying a diplomatic passport and was on a diplomatic mission in iraq and the widening of the gates of hell as missiles fly across the iran and iraq border growing pressure from china and russia with regard to this crucial part of eurasia and the attempt by the us to encircle eurasia all of this suggest just these shifts anti austerity protests intersect with protests against social toxicity a general strike in india on 8 january combined the demands of the working class and the peasantry with a social compact that does not disadvantage minorities much the same kind of dynamic is visible in latin america where popular fronts have emerged against regimes of authoritarian austerity beneath the storm and stress of the shifts in the balance of power lie myriad struggles this is why our dossier is called the world oscillates between crises and protests the general attitude in these protests is that what passes for reality is not worth respecting the establishment leaders and their callousness is to be disregarded us president donald trump threatens to destroy iran s cultural sites a threat that is in the nature of a war crime australian prime minister scott morrison watches his country burn and reacts with muffled unscientific and crude noises indian prime minister narendra modi says nothing when the police and hooligans of his political orientation enter its universities and beat and arrest students social media explodes with anger against these men and their inhumanity young faces have their chins up their fists in the air they are not afraid it is true that these are protests of the youth but it would be inaccurate to believe that youth can be reduced to age there are many young people who have surrendered to reality who cannot see beyond the horizon of the present there are many older people who are youthful in their desire for full scale transformation the point is not age but attitude the sensibility that the world we have need not be the world for eternity bliss was it in that dawn to be alive wordsworth wrote of the time of the french revolution but to be young was very heaven to be young means to imagine heaven another dispensation the place wordsworth sang where in the end we find happiness or not at all it is with great pleasure that we at tricontinental institute for social research welcome professor aijaz ahmad to our team as a senior fellow professor ahmad a leading marxist philosopher and cultural theorist is the author of the classic book in theory classes nations literature 1992 and of iraq afghanistan and the imperialism of our time 2004

middle east tensions could impact markets after strong end to 2019 a screen displays industrials average after the close on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse in new york city kuwait financial markets enjoyed a strong end to 2019 with the us s p equity index up 3 percent m m and 10 year treasury yields edging back above 1 9 percent as optimism grew over the outlook for global growth amid mildly encouraging economic data and the agreement of a phase one trade deal between the us and china some of this optimism was punctured in january however with the escalation in military tensions between the us and iran that if sustained could jeopardize conditions in the broader middle east region these developments saw the price of brent crude oil spike to nearly 70 bbl having already finished 2019 on a strong note thanks to the better global demand outlook and fresh opec supply cuts announced in december trade deal helps lift optimism pessimism over the us growth climate has mostly ebbed over the past month amid decent economic data especially on jobs housing and service sector activity and also the boost to sentiment from the partial us china trade deal which could ease pressure on the still weak us manufacturing sector estimates of fourth quarter gdp growth have been rising and the atlanta fed nowcast suggests growth could even have reached an annualized 2 3 percent in 4q19 from 2 1 percent in q3 this would leave growth at a decent 2 4 percent for 2019 overall though still down from 2 9 percent a year earlier and versus a consensus forecast of 1 6 percent for 2020 a reasonably solid economic picture a strong stock market contained inflation and reduced risks from overseas trade point to little urgency from the federal reserve to change interest rates from current levels a view supported by minutes from the bank s december meeting that showed a growing consensus among officials for keeping policy on hold through 2020 there was at last some positive news on trade with the us and china agreeing a phase one deal that effectively calls a provisional truce on their now 18 month dispute and is scheduled to go into force from january 15th the deal sees china purchase 40 billion more us agricultural goods per year take steps to end forced technology transfer and also avoid currency devaluation to gain competitive advantage the us on the other hand will halve the 15 percent duties on imports from china introduced in september and shelved further tariff hikes that were scheduled for december while the agreement represents a first step in deescalating the quarrel which has dented confidence trade and manufacturing worldwide and should ensure no further duty hikes it leaves tariffs on around 250 billion in us imports from china imposed before september in place and difficult issues such as chinese state subsidies and cyber intrusions unresolved prospects for a substantive phase two deal could be influenced by political factors ahead of the november presidential election and to the extent that the deal discourages the federal reserve from further policy loosening the net boost to the us economy could be positive but modest in the eurozone the december composite pmi edged up to 50 9 from 50 6 in november but points to overall growth remaining at negligible levels based upon previous trends this could be consistent with gdp growth of just 0 1 percent q q in 4q19 well below trend and even lower than the 0 2 percent growth recorded in q2 and q3 other sentiment surveys suggest that the worst of the downturn in activity may be over but any pick up is likely to be gradual given the still fragile external climate signs of a cooling job market and the continued reluctance of the german government to provide significant fiscal stimulus the european central bank having cut interest rates to 0 5 percent in september and restarted quantitative easing in november may look to loosen policy a bit further over coming months given that core inflation at 1 3 percent y y in december remains well below the ecb s close to but below 2 percent target but the extent could be limited by concerns over the impact on financial stability of negative interest rates the recent departure of the dovish but influential mario draghi as president and as the bank assesses the consequences of ultra loose policy as part of its broader strategic review of monetary policy this year in the uk the conservative party won a resounding victory at the december 12 general election leaving pm boris johnson with a large 80 seat majority in the 650 seat house of commons for the next five years the following week parliament easily approved johnson s renegotiated brexit deal clearing the way for the uk to leave the eu at the end of january 2020 the uk will enter into an 11 month transition period from february during which the two sides will look to negotiate an agreement to govern their future trading relationship with the eu likely to insist on considerable regulatory alignment from the uk in exchange for better access to eu markets johnson prefers a looser arrangement and has ruled out extending the transition period beyond 2020 which could see the uk default to trading on wto terms if no agreement is reached by then worries about no deal saw the pound give up its immediate post election gains though somewhat reduced political uncertainty and the prospect of an expansionary budget in march should help keep economic growth above 1 percent in 2020 and interest rates on hold japanese growth in q3 upgraded japan s third quarter growth was revised up to an annualized 1 8 percent well above the initial estimate of 0 2 percent mainly thanks to an increase in investment and household spending however the pick up in household spending was likely driven by consumers looking to beat the sales tax hike in october and is therefore unlikely to be sustained in q4 as one indicator of this the decline in import growth moderated to 4 8 percent y y in 3q19 but had returned to a much steeper 15 percent fall by november reflecting underlying weakness in domestic demand meanwhile exports continue to struggle having fallen for a year and were down 7 9 percent in november nonetheless during its monetary policy meeting in december the bank of japan maintained a largely positive stance on the economy and refrained from policy easing measures as uncertainty over the global economy waned not least because of the us china trade agreement outlook for chinese economy more promising china s economy will be offered some reprieve as a phase one trade deal with the us comes into effect from january 15th this should give its external sector a much needed boost after exports were down 1 2 percent y y for the fourth straight month in november meanwhile additional monetary and fiscal easing measures are expected to further support the economy the central bank announced a 50bps cut in the reserve ratio effective january 6th that will inject rmb800 billion 115 billion of liquidity into the banking system allowing banks to reduce lending costs to the private sector smes in particular it is also likely to give cash demand a boost ahead of the chinese new year holiday growth in india slows in q3 gdp growth slowed to a more than six year low of 4 5 percent in 3q19 from 5 0 percent in q2 marking the sixth consecutive quarterly decline in growth and affected by the slowest pace of investment since 2014 1 percent investment has been hit by tighter credit conditions after the collapse of a major non bank lender in 2018 exports meanwhile contracted by 0 4 percent likely affected by softer world demand growth in private consumption while still relatively soft rose to 5 percent from a five year low of 3 1 percent in q2 however more recent data suggest some grounds for optimism pmi activity indices have gradually risen with the manufacturing and services measures at 52 7 and 53 3 respectively in december lifted by new orders and higher employment the outlook has been helped by interest rate cuts of a combined 135 bps in 2019 and a reduction in corporate tax from 35 percent to 25 percent and 17 percent for manufacturing in september but given that the scope for further fiscal and monetary stimulus may be limited by rising twin deficits and inflation and the banking sector remains burdened with bad debt the consensus view is that any pick up in growth will be modest over coming quarters oil prices up as us iran tensions spike the new year started with geopolitical risk back on the oil market s agenda the price of brent crude oil jumped more than 3 percent to 69 bbl after a us drone attacked killed iranian general qassem soleimani while in iraq with regional tensions spiking and iran later retaliating with a strike on a us military base in iraq oil prices look set to benefit only for a short period from elevated geopolitical risk premia in the near term as well as more constructive demand supply dynamics that emerged towards the end of 2019 the latter helped brent finish the year with annual gains of 23 percent its best performance since 2016 these included the us china trade agreement and the opec decision to cut oil production by an additional 500 kb d from current levels taking total cuts to 2 1 mb d until at least march markets expect the new deal to help reduce the supply overhang and minimize stock increases meanwhile on 1 january tighter regulations on sulfur emissions in shipping bunker fuels by the international maritime organization imo went into

a pedestrian looks at an electric quotation board displaying the numbers on the nikkei 225 index on the tokyo stock exchange and various markets around the world in tokyo kazuhiro nogi afp getty images eased trade tensions between the united states and china and signs of a strengthening global economy could be good news for international equities and european stocks in particular according to market strategists some analysts and strategists have been urging clients to move more of their portfolio into international stocks that advice follows a strong run for the u s market that widened the gap between domestic and foreign equities and capped a dominant decade for u s stocks since 2010 the s p 500 rose more than 188 an annualized rate of about 11 2 the msci world ex us index saw much more modest gains climbing 50 5 overall or roughly 4 2 per year if your asset allocation has significant domestic exposure and little to no international equity exposure we think now is an excellent time to make a shift bespoke investment group said in a note to clients last month last year was strong for stocks around the world but the u s still took the lead the international index rose 18 1 but the s p 500 jumped more than 28 the global stock market got a negative shock in the first trading days of 2020 equities slipped following the u s airstrike that killed a top iranian military leader however oil prices have moderated and stocks have avoided a multi day selloff global rebound much of the optimism about international markets comes from global economic data where both hard and soft indicators suggest that the global slowdown may have bottomed out measures of manufacturing and global trade have ticked up in recent months we have reasons to believe that this improvement in manufacturing and trade can be sustained morgan stanley chief economist chetan ahya said in a note to clients the eurozone is one area where investors should increase their exposure according to mark luschini chief investment strategist at janney montgomery scott in part due to positive signs about the chinese economy the european stock market is more sensitive to the global economy than the u s market luschini said similar to equities in emerging markets because chinese growth has such a large impact on the world s economy even a slight improvement could spill into international markets luschini said if china merely stabilizes its growth from the deceleration that it s had the last couple years that ll go a long way to putting a positive impulse into these equity markets luschini said europe was home to a few countries where stocks saw better years than the united states in 2019 including russia and greece italy was one of the best performing g 7 countries last year with the ftse mib roughly matching with the s p 500 last year with a 28 3 gain measured in euros the stoxx 600 a major european index gained 24 last year investors can gain exposure to all of europe through total market exchange traded funds for the region such as vanguard s ftse europe etf or individual countries through a more targeted funds like ishares msci germany etf foreign exchange another opportunity for return from international markets comes from the relative strength of the dollar if investors buy international stocks and the dollar weakens against that foreign currency the total return could be more than the stock return once the currency is converted back to dollars the dollar index is currently about 2 off its 52 week highs but is roughly 9 above its recent lows in early 2018 the so called real broad dollar surged in 2015 and 2016 with another decent rally in 2018 but not much change in 2019 bespoke said as a result the dollar looks relatively strong but not dramatically by any means the strength of the dollar is determined in part by the purchasing power of other countries so global growth could mean that other currencies strengthen against the dollar if you do see emerging growth abroad that should lead to a relatively weaker dollar which would feed into the returns for u s based investors that are earned in overseas markets luschini said central banks iran remain risks
what a start to 2020 it s been a rather eventful first week of the year for financial markets and while next week may not be quite so action packed when it comes to the current climate who knows what s around the corner as far as the coming week goes politics will continue to dominate but there are some interesting central bank meetings as well as a few interesting economic releases that will certainly draw attention the signing of the us china phase one trade deal will naturally be all over the front pages next week let s face it it s about time but it s this week s events in iraq and iran that people may be more interested in at this stage both sides may have shown a willingness to de escalate but when it comes to these two countries who knows country uk it s been rather quiet by uk standards boris johnson s strong majority in parliament has enabled a more peaceful and straightforward process when it comes to getting his brexit withdrawal agreement through parliament now it s over to the lords but unlike on previous occasions this is unlikely to pose any problems focus now shifts to phase two trade negotiations ursula von der leyen president of the european commission was in london this week and while much of the talk was very cordial it s clear she believes the end of year deadline is tight and a lot has to be achieved in that time we may not see the same kind of volatility in the pound in the near term though of course should we get closer to the end of the year if no deal looks possible the panic will once again set in us the focus next week will shift back to the us china trade war beijing has given the all clear that for vice premier liu he to sign the phase one deal in washington dc on january 15th markets are anxiously awaiting the release of the details of the phase one trade deal which could start to leak a couple days before signing ceremony the week ahead will see a plethora of data that should highlight the us economy remains resilient inflation data should confirm the fed s decision to be on hold and the first couple regional surveys in january should so pointedly strong rebounds much of the focus will fall on retail sales which should paint a picture of very strong holiday season despite poor reports from macy s kohl s and jc penney earnings season also begins with the big banks reporting first all signs point for the financials to indicate the us consumer remains strong key quarterly updates will be followed by fastenal alcoa taiwan semiconductor and trucking giant jb hunt with trade tensions simmering wall street will look to see if corporate america will have improved guidance for 2020 us politics democrats are slowly abandoning trump s impeachment saga as they turn their focus back towards the presidential election the iowa caucuses are on february 3rd and we will see if joe biden can hold off the other candidates iowa will be key for mayor pete buttigieg and if we see the two progressives candidates show they can continue their movement despite almost bringing the us into a war with iran president trump still has a strong economy and had the general consensus believing he will get re elected in november mexico as trade tensions ease and the us iran conflict simmers down emerging markets could see the mexican peso become the favored carry trade mexico s banxico has their key rate at 7 25 extremely high when compared to the g10 currencies inflation decelerated and still remains near the midpoint of the central bank s target range and with that in mind we could still see mexico have one of the best interest rates out there with usmca slowly getting finalized we could continue to see the peso have a supportive macro economic environment taiwan taiwan elections this weekend

trading back around 65 and is looking pretty stable at this point barring any further escalation in the middle east we could see oil prices stabilize around these levels in the near term with global growth prospects having improved the us and china preparing to sign a trade deal and opec committed to re balancing gold safe haven gold has found some stability towards the back end of the week around 1 550 not far from the levels we were trading at around at the start of the year gold will remain susceptible to safe haven dashes although the tragic airliner accident may force people to reconsider their actions and encourage a sustained de escalation the dollar has rebounded over the course of this week which may keep the downward pressure on the yellow metal although it s worth remembering that prior to the events of the last week the dollar was coming under a little pressure and supporting gold it will be interesting to see whether that continues going forward bitcoin like a slow puncture the bitcoin rally is slowly deflating but there s clearly some resilience there the cryptocurrency faces a test around 7 500 which provided strong resistance throughout the latter part

the third year of donald trump s presidency seems likely to be remembered more for his impeachment than for anything else but a look at economic data shows that the united states economy expanded in 2019 in fact many economic numbers appear to confirm much of trump s claims about the economy there are worries about the future but the main economic measures rose overcoming the effects of the trade war with china however a tax cut and large increase in the national debt guarantee that interest payments will take up an increasing share of the federal budget at the same time if there is any sign of weakness in the u s economy the u s central bank the federal reserve could find it does not have the tools to influence events jobs jobs jobs trump promised to create more jobs when he campaigned for the presidency in 2016 the u s bureau of labor statistics reports the country has added about 6 8 million of them since then growth during trump s first two years in office economic growth rose sharply between 2011 and 2016 the gross domestic product gdp increased by about 2 percent each year in trump s first two years that average increased to 2 9 percent in 2019 however gdp appeared likely to end the year at a 2 1 percent rate of growth economists suggest the slowdown is partly the result of american policies in international trade trade in 2019 trump escalated a trade war with china he placed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports so china ordered tariffs on imports from the united states as a result americans have paid tens of billions of dollars more for chinese products than they would have without the tariffs and u s exporters have suffered business losses the money that comes to the u s government from the higher tariffs has gone to farmers whose products have been affected by the chinese tariffs trump announced in early december that he would order tariffs on steel from brazil and argentina he also promised to put a 100 percent tariff on some imports from france clearly the president is not backing away from his decision markets economists and other experts will warn that the stock market is not the economy and they are correct but stock prices do show that investors believe the economy will continue growing because they have continued to rise in early 2019 the financial markets were coming off a period of unrest but worries about their future growth left as the year continued major markets show year to date returns of between 20 percent and 25 percent through early december interest rates interest rates have been part of economic concerns since before trump took office with the economy growing and unemployment decreasing most americans expected wages would rise that would drive up prices and lead to higher inflation but that did not happen while the economy was adding millions of jobs wages did not grow and inflation has been below 2 percent deficit during a long period of economic growth the federal government usually sets aside a lot of money or pays off its debt but under trump that has not happened instead the u s federal debt has increased every year and is now more the 22 trillion the increased debt worries people because of the share of the federal budget that must be used to pay interest experts warn that amount will only grow if the united states enters a recession i m susan shand the associated press reported this story susan shand adapted it for voa learning english george grow was the editor write to us in the comments section or on our facebook page _______________________________________________________________ words in this story impeachment n to charge a public official with a crime done while in office statistics n a number that represents a piece of information gross domestic product gdp n the total value of the goods and services produced by the people of a nation during a year tariff n a tax on goods coming into or leaving a country escalate v to make something worse
u s review well that de escalated quickly the week began amid rising tensions carrying over from the u s killing of iranian general qasem soleimani last friday iran responded with non lethal airstrikes on u s facilities but president trump has said the u s has no plans to escalate further and the iranians appear to have concluded their response for now compared to just prior to the drone strike u s stocks are higher as is the dollar and the price for a barrel of oil after spiking briefly is now about 2 00 lower he job market continued to expand adding another 145k jobs although wages rose the least since mid 2018 tale of two cities manufacturing vs service sector the first major economic indicator to hit the wire in 2020 was the ism manufacturing report last week which showed the fastest pace of contraction since the height of the 2008 recession so when the ism non manufacturing report was published earlier this week financial markets were relieved to see that barometer of the service sector rise to 55 0 that is the fastest pace of expansion in four months the shortened holiday shopping season due to a late thanksgiving this year was referred to a number of times in the report that gels with our thinking around holiday sales we have been saying that despite a weaker than expected retail sales report in november we still expect a year over year holiday sales increase of 5 0 as december will effectively get a boost even cyber monday the monday after thanksgiving got pushed into december a slowing in labor market growth the employment component of the services ism remained in expansion but slipped a bit from the prior month heralding the slightly lower than expected employment report on friday which showed the u s economy added another 145k jobs with the unemployment rate staying put at 3 5 it has been a remarkably good run for the labor market but this latest report offered some indications of softening even amidst the lowest jobless rate in a half century average hourly earnings edged up just 0 1 in december after rising 0 3 in each of the prior two months on a year over year basis average hourly earnings rose by the smallest amount since july 2018 still for the year as a whole the u s economy added 2 1 million jobs with an average monthly gain of 176k jobs those are solid numbers but short of the 223k monthly average in 2018 for the fed the message from the jobs report is that the labor market remains tight but still not tight enough to put upward pressure on earnings so not much of a threat for inflation in other words there was nothing in this report to nudge policymakers from a course of holding rates steady service sector resilience in what is probably the most consequential development for gdp growth this week the trade deficit narrowed to 43 1 billion in november which barring an unexpected widening in december means that trade will be a big boost to fourth quarter gdp the boost is welcome but if as we expect the recent decline in imports is due to importers pulling forward demand to get ahead of consumer focused tariffs it may be set to reverse and be a drag on gdp in coming quarters those consumer focused tariffs were taken off the table with the phase i trade deal set to be finalized at a formal signing next week in washington an interesting development is that u s petroleum exports exceeded imports in november for the third straight month another reason perhaps why financial markets have for now at least shrugged off the crisis in iran u s outlook nfib tuesday small business optimism may get a boost from the phase i trade deal with china which was formally announced by the office of the u s trade representative on december 13 equity markets sure celebrated the deal although small companies generally have less exposure to foreign economies and international trade on the other hand small businesses owners lean disproportionately republican so the impeachment of president trump which was approved in the house on december 18 but was building for weeks prior may be giving them some pause optimism skyrocketed upon his election regardless optimism remains extremely high on a historical basis supporting our view that main street and the consumer remain healthy underneath the headline we are closely watching small business hiring intentions and selling prices as these often lead overall nonfarm payrolls and inflation when the economy turns it typically does so at small firms first previous 104 7 consensus 104 8 retail sales thursday december retail sales could surprise to the upside sales in november came in low rising just 0 2 yet there were some notable calendar and data quirks we are monitoring for one thanksgiving was the latest possible day in november this year meaning that the period between thanksgiving and christmas was the shortest possible with many holding off purchases until black friday we suspect this could have pushed more of the usual spending deluge into december second black friday is not as important as it used to be and cyber monday fell on december 2 moreover the seasonal adjustments may be having some difficulty accounting for the paradigm shift towards online shopping in other words do not be surprised by a surprise december aside we have an optimistic view of the consumer spending growth is moderating to be clear but it should remain healthy enough to sustain the expansion previous 0 2 wells fargo 0 3 consensus 0 3 month over month industrial production december the industrial production ip figures have been especially volatile of late due to the strike at gm and boeing s ongoing 737 max issues gm s assembly lines came back on line in november resulting in a double digit surge in autos production which flattered the overall 1 1 ip increase this will not repeat in december which is also when the ism manufacturing index fell to a ten year low of 47 2 the stage is therefore set for a weak manufacturing print to end 2019 and the outlook does not improve with the calendar turn as boeing suspended 737 max production on january 1 looking further out the drop in the ism may be overstating the weakness in the factory sector and we would not be surprised to see a gradual rebound after the phase i trade deal and improvements in global pmis tensions with iran may impact mining output in coming months but

the eurozone the eurozone s headline inflation rose at the fastest pace since april 2019 rising 1 3 year over year in december from 1 0 the previous month the figure was mostly driven by a jump in oil prices in december as the energy sector rebounded rising 0 2 year over year the core inflation rate which strips out volatile components such as energy held steady at 1 3 and the three month average of core eurozone inflation edged higher to 1 2 the strongest pace since 2015 separately retail sales rose more than expected in november up 1 over the month and october s figure was revised higher the stronger retail sales data appears to be driven in part by germany as its retail sales figure also jumped more than anticipated in november the recent solid data provides an encouraging sign ahead of

able to exit the technical recession in q3 2019 gdp rose only a modest 0 01 quarter over quarter with core inflation falling for the sixth consecutive month and growth expectations still subdued we expect the central bank to continue its easing cycle into the new year the mexican peso has been relatively strong over the past several months which also supports the case for more monetary policy

central bank s 2 target towards the end of the forecast period next week s inflation figures could be slightly restrained by the spike in the pound over the month however the large run up in oil

performance reinforces our view of a lack of central bank independence in turkey in addition president erdogan announced that the monetary policy committee will meet 12 times this year versus eight times in 2019 and suggested interest rates will reach single digits in 2020 indicating that political pressure on the central bank has not yet eased cpi inflation pushed higher to 11 84 year over year in december the second straight monthly increase the latest increase narrowed the real interest rate to 16 bps chart to the right currently market participants anticipate a 50 bps cut to 11 50 at the policy meeting next week previous 12 00 consensus 11 50 point of view interest rate watch repo rates tranquil at year end heading into the end of 2019 there were fears that u s treasury repo rates could be in for a tumultuous ride repo rates often rise at quarter year end and the previous year was no exception the secured overnight financing rate sofr spiked more than 50 bps on december 31 2018 and then 15 more on january 2 2019 furthermore repo rates skyrocketed even more dramatically in september 2019 top chart and although they had mostly been tame since it remained unknown whether the fed s actions taken over the ensuing months would be enough to keep repo rates from spiking at year end in the end money market rates were incredibly tame over year end sofr set at 1 55 on december 31 perfectly in line with the interest rate paid on excess reserves ioer and the effective fed funds rate thus it appears the federal reserve s multi pronged approach to keeping a lid on repo rates was largely successful what were the tools that the fed utilized since october the fed has been purchasing treasury bills in order to increase bank reserves in the financial system and as a result excess reserves have risen by about 200 billion from their september lows middle chart in addition the fed has become a large and active lender in the repo market at the turn of the year the fed had about 242 billion of repurchase agreements on its balance sheet bottom chart persistent downward tweaks to the rate paid on ioer and reverse repurchase operations also likely helped although the recent tranquility in repo markets is a clear success for the fed questions remain now that year end is past the fed will likely begin to reduce some of the support it has offered repo markets how fast it pulls back and in what ways remain open questions furthermore the tools the fed has used such as the ad hoc repo operations it has conducted are likely more operationally intense and inherently uncertain than the central bank would prefer thus a longer term solution such as a standing repo facility or some regulatory changes remain very much in the mix going forward credit market insights revolving credit growth rolling over consumer credit grew slower than expected in november as the outstanding level of consumer debt excluding home loans increased 12 5 billion the deceleration from last month s 19 0 billion gain comes entirely from a slowdown in revolving credit which is comprised primarily of credit card debt and accounts for less than a third of overall consumer credit though it picked up briefly last summer revolving credit growth has remained fairly subdued this cycle the more recent moderation can be attributed partially to tougher lending standards the fed s senior loan officer opinion survey showed that banks were less likely to approve credit card applications in q3 2019 than they were a year prior particularly for borrowers at the lower end of the credit spectrum while consumers have been relying less on their credit cards non revolving credit has continued to increase at a steady clip rising 5 8 over the month and 5 0 over the year this form of credit is comprised mostly of auto and student loans and continues to take up an increasing share of household debt the bulk of household debt however is still made up of home loans though mortgage debt may feel less burdensome in 2020 given that many were able to refinance at a lower rate in 2019 the mortgage bankers association s refinancing index is currently up 113 over the year after hitting a three year high in august this refi boom also helped americans cash out roughly 54 billion in home equity according to freddie mac topic of the week potential implications of iranian crisis the week began amid rising tensions carrying over from the killing of iranian general soleimani last friday iran responded this week with non lethal airstrikes on u s facilities but president trump has said the u s has no plans to escalate further and the iranians appear to have concluded their response for now financial markets have more or less settled back to where they were prior to the start of recent hostilities a week ago oil prices spiked on the initial news but quickly settled down and as of this writing the price for crude oil is actually lower than it was prior to the u s drone strike that killed the iranian general however if tensions flare again investors instinctively turn to oil prices as a risk barometer raising questions about potential knock on effect for the economy as shown in the top chart consumer purchases of gasoline and other energy goods accounted for roughly 4 of total personal consumption expenditures pce at the time of the oil price shocks in the 1970s today those goods account for only 2 of pce so oil prices would need to shoot much higher from their current levels to have a meaningful effect on consumer purchases of other goods and services oil prices more than doubled after the opec oil embargo in late 1973 and again following the iranian revolution in early 1979 additionally the lower chart shows how american production of crude oil has increased over the past decade this week we also learned that november marked the third consecutive month that u s petroleum exports exceeded imports suggesting less reliance on foreign sources higher oil prices would actually encourage more investment in the energy sector and what s more other industries are not as dependent on oil as an energy source as they were in the 1970s so the direct effects of the iranian crisis on the u s economy appear to be rather small however the uncertainty that the crisis imparts could potentially be more meaningful consumer spending could potentially take a more meaningful hit if a marked cycle of violence were to take hold
one of the most interesting sessions i attended at last week s american economic association meeting was a panel titled making global markets work for american workers the discussion featuring economists dani rodrik kimberly clausing and josh bivens laid out the problems with free trade the shortcomings of us trade policy during the past few decades and some suggestions for improvement but although the economists did a great job of critiquing the old free trade consensus there was no clear idea of what to replace it with economists still tend to strongly back trade liberalisation but the cosy consensus in favour of removing trade barriers is eroding the experience of the china shock in which a sudden wave of import competition devastated the lives of many american manufacturing workers was a wake up call the bipartisan backlash against trade agreements which threatened to leave economists in the political wilderness was another economists such as rodrik and bivens who have criticised the free trade consensus for a long time are getting heard more while free trade defenders such as clausing are forging more nuanced arguments economists are starting to agree that free trade has two big weaknesses unfairness and politics ever since the time of david ricardo the 18th century economist who developed the idea of comparative advantage it has been well known that not everyone benefits when trade barriers fall if the us is relatively good at making shoes and japan is relatively good at making blue jeans american jeans makers and japanese shoe companies have good reason to fear a trade agreement between the two countries this becomes especially dangerous when one country specialises in cheap labour bivens like many others suspects that this is what happened with china the addition of a billion workers to the global labour force was a bonanza for the rich who could buy cheaper consumer goods and a disaster for the middle class in developed nations as bivens noted the us has gradually shifted toward trading with poorer and poorer countries good for global development but perilous for many american workers in the old days economists tended to address this problem by arguing that the winners from trade should compensate the losers but it s very hard to identify who won and who lost was a factory worker put out of a job by china by automation by bad corporate decisions by the decline of unions or the inevitable market shifts it s possible to simply increase redistributive taxation and clausing calls for this but government checks probably aren t a satisfying compensation for a steelworker who suddenly finds his career gone and his skills unwanted the second problem is that actual trade agreements tend to bear only a passing resemblance to the idealised notion of free trade in an economics textbook thanks to lobbying by business interests real trade agreements are tangles of rules and regulations that can restrain competition one well publicised example of this is the investor state dispute settlement isds system designed to shield intellectual property in international markets which has been roundly criticised as a way to protect corporate profits over the interests of local populations at the very least trade policy can be improved by increasing redistributive taxation and by removing corporate carve outs from trade agreements but there are a number of other problems with textbook free trade that those policies leave unaddressed for example bivens noted that trade agreements might weaken environmental and labour standards at the national level making it harder for producers in countries with tougher regulations to compete the advantages from trade might also be ephemeral a country that chooses to export natural resources and forsake manufacturing might have a gain in wealth in the short term but in the long term it could miss out on technological improvement and productivity gains economists are beginning to recognise these dangers but so far there are few credible suggestions for how to deal with them without forsaking the very real gains from international trade imposing unrealistic rich country labour standards on poor countries could hurt their development and trap them in poverty and industrial policy although spectacularly successful in some cases is very tricky to get right one thing that economists almost all agree on however is that tariffs are a bad response to the drawbacks of free trade serving mainly as a tax on domestic consumers they also invite retaliation causing more carnage
the ohio valley s economy could see slower growth in 2020 amid continued anxiety about trade and possible downturns in both energy and manufacturing according to analyses and forecasts by regional economists michael hicks directs the center for business and economic research at ball state university in indiana where he forecasts the health of the manufacturing sector hicks expects manufacturing to slow down and he blames the tariffs levied under president donald trump s administration hicks said the costs imposed by the trade war are playing out in markets across the region and he predicts the ohio valley s economic growth to slow dramatically in 2020 you will see layoffs certainly lower hours less generous bonuses both this year and next year less demand for power which is going to be important particularly in kentucky and west virginia as manufacturing firms both use less metallurgical coal and less coal for electrical power hicks said one tweet away a report hicks co authored shows the impact of manufacturing employment on the overall health of the united states economy has diminished production is still a large share of the economy but he said the economies of kentucky ohio and west virginia are heavily dependent on exports which is why the trade war has and will continue to have a large impact the trump administration has made some recent moves to improve trade relations the united states mexico canada agreement or usmca would replace the north american free trade agreement or nafta usmca has passed the house and is still pending in the senate but hicks said that trade deal doesn t offer much assurance the usmca passage is essentially for your typical manufacturing firm it improves the confidence that we re not going to have a trade war with our big partners in canada and mexico hicks said but to just speak candidly we re always one tweet away from a new adversary in the trade war he said if european firms are less interested in buying higher priced american products it s enough to cause a significant decline in the demand for goods produced in the u s hicks said that could have a bigger effect in the region than in the country as a whole which is enough to push kentucky and west virginia ohio indiana illinois into a localized recession he said it s not enough for a national recession but it s enough to give us the feel and taste of what a recession would be like of the three states ohio s larger economy is also more diverse and follows national trends more closely zach schiller is an economist with policy matters ohio an economic research institute ohio is not an island you know our economy is closely integrated into the national and international economies schiller said schiller said the largest employers in ohio are either national or international companies and he expects any change in the state s economy to be similar to what happens nationally still recovering in kentucky manufacturing plays a significant role in the state s economy jason bailey director the left leaning kentucky center for economic policy he said manufacturing has grown in large part because of the auto industry but carmakers are seeing a slowdown we ve lost a lot of manufacturing over the last couple decades across the state and industries like apparel or furniture manufacturing or computer parts manufacturing that has often been to cheaper locations like china and in latin america bailey said bailey said kentucky still hasn t fully recovered from the last recession and it s facing a tough year ahead with state budget cuts likely west virginia is in a similar position with even fewer signs of economic recovery west virginia university s college of business and economics is predicting the economy will expand by about point two percent annually for the next five years the executive director of the left leaning west virginia center on budget and policy ted boettner said that s the lowest growth rate wvu has predicted for the state in the past seven years you know since our last economic recession that began in 2007 west virginia has seen less than a 1 percent increase in job growth over that time boettner said larry dowling west virginia public broadcasting pipeline stacked in morgantown wv boettner said the state s economy has always been on a roller coaster ride based on energy markets the downturn in coal has hit hard of course but that was somewhat offset recently by a boost from natural gas and pipeline construction work now however one major pipeline project is complete and some others have been halted by legal challenges boettner said that focus on natural resource extraction can hamper other kinds of growth a lot of other industries especially ones based in the knowledge based economy don t really want to be around extractive industries boettner said they don t want to be around a lot of pollution and things like that so you really are choosing one over the other in some sense boettner said the state has never had big urban centers to build a diversified economy around but he thinks investment in education could help with that i mean unfortunately it s gotten to the point where i think the only way that west virginia is going to really thrive potentially thrive over the coming decades will be unless there s massive federal investment in the state he said deficits despite growth the u s is in the longest period of economic recovery in modern history hicks said normally that would mean the country would be running a budget surplus and could start paying off debt or taking on big projects we would have made some long term investments in infrastructure highways roads particularly with transfers to local governments that are you know facing a lot of aging infrastructure hicks said instead hicks said the federal budget has a deficit of more than a trillion dollars after tax cuts and what he calls unsustainable federal spending including the trade bailouts for farmers and he said those economic policies are not having the degree of stimulus they should largely because of the negative effects of the trade war a report from ball state notes the trump administration s 2018 tax cuts and jobs act was meant to spur private non residential investment but whatever effect could have been expected was muted by a similarly large tax increase due to tariffs associated with the trade war we are running a budget deficit of 1 1 trillion which is considerably more than the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 hicks said that was obama s large stimulus package passed in february 2009 that was only 856 billion as economists across the region watch for signs of the next recession they also look to infrastructure investment as an area for potential growth the ohio valley has massive funding needs for its roads broadband internet access and aging water systems
business finance 11 01 2020 listen following its weakest performance since the global financial crisis the world economy is poised for a modest rebound this year if everything goes just right according to 2019 world bank report two other trends that raise questions about the course of economic growth according to the world bank are the unprecedented runup in debt worldwide and the prolonged deceleration of productivity growth which needs to pick up to bolster standards of living and poverty eradication global growth is set to rise by 2 5 this year a small uptick from 2 4 in 2019 as trade and investment gradually recover the world bank s semi annual global economic prospects forecasts advanced economies are expected to slow as a group to 1 4 from 1 6 mainly reflecting lingering weakness in manufacturing the report added emerging market and developing economies are also expected to see growth accelerate to 4 1 from 3 5 last year however the pickup is anticipated to come largely from a small number of large emerging economies shaking off economic doldrums or stabilizing after recession or turbulence for many other economies growth is on track to decelerate as exports and investments remain weak a worrying aspect of the sluggish growth trend is that even if the recovery in emerging and developing economy growth takes place as expected per capita growth will remain below long term averages and will advance at a pace too slow to meet poverty eradication goals income growth would in fact be slowest in sub saharan africa the region where 56 percent of the world s poor live and even this modest rally could be disrupted by any number of threats trade disputes could re escalate a sharper than expected growth slowdown in major economies such as china the united states or the euro area would similarly reverberate widely a resurgence of financial stress in large emerging markets as was experienced in argentina and turkey in 2018 an escalation of geopolitical tensions or a series of extreme weather events could all have adverse effects on economic activity around the world productivity the report also revealed that among the emerging and developing economies which have a history of productivity growth surges and setbacks the slowdown from 6 6 in 2007 to a trough of 3 2 in 2015 has been the steepest longest and broadest on record the slowdown is due to weaker investment and efficiency gains dwindling gains from the reallocation of resources to more productive sectors and slowing improvements in the key drivers of productivity such as education and institutional quality the outlook for productivity remains challenging therefore efforts are needed to stimulate private and public investment upgrade workforce skills to boost firm productivity help resources find the most productive sectors reinvigorate technology adoption and innovation and promote a growth friendly macroeconomic and institutional environment the report added two other issues merit consideration in this edition of the outlook adverse consequences of price controls and inflation prospects in lics while price controls are sometimes considered a useful tool to smooth price fluctuations for good and services such as energy and food they can also dampen investment and growth worsen poverty outcomes and lead to heavier fiscal burdens however replacing them with expanded and targeted social safety nets alongside the encouragement of competition and an effective regulatory environment can be beneficial both to poverty eradication and to growth in addition while inflation has declined sharply among low income countries over the last 25 years keeping it low and stable cannot be taken for granted low inflation is associated with more stable output and employment higher investment and falling poverty rates however rising debt levels and fiscal pressures could put some economies at risk of disruptions that could send prices sharply higher strengthening central bank independence making the monetary authority s objectives clear and cementing central bank credibility are essential to keep prices anchored while the global economic outlook for 2020 envisions a fragile upward path that could be upended there is high degree of uncertainty around the forecast given unpredictability around trade and other policies if policy makers manage to mitigate tensions and clarify unsettled issues in a number of areas they could prove the forecast wrong by sending growth higher than anticipated the report suggested
if policy makers manage to mitigate tensions and settle issues in a number of areas they could prove the forecast wrong by sending growth higher than anticipated the world bank wb expects global economic growth to rise in 2020 by 2 5 percent poised for a modest rebound this year after its weakest performance since the global financial crisis according to the wb s semi annual global economic prospects report the projected rise is a small uptick from 2 4 percent in 2019 thanks to a gradual recovery in trade and investment the report anticipates advanced economies to slow down in growth as a group to 1 4 percent down from 1 6 percent reflecting a lingering weakness in manufacturing for emerging markets and developing economies the report forecast their growth to accelerate to 4 1 percent up from 3 5 percent in 2019 adding that the pickup is anticipated to come largely from a small number of large emerging economies shaking off economic doldrums or stabilising after recession or turbulence for many other economies growth is on track to decelerate as exports and investment remain weak the report stated nevertheless it pointed out that if the recovery in emerging and developing economies growth takes place as expected per capita growth will remain below long term averages and will move slowely disabling them from meeting poverty eradication goals while income growth would be slowest in sub saharan africa where 56 percent of the world s poor reside and even this modest rally could be disrupted by any number of threats trade disputes could re escalate a sharper than expected growth slowdown in major economies such as china the united states or the euro area would similarly reverberate widely a resurgence of financial stress in large emerging markets as was experienced in argentina and turkey in 2018 an escalation of geopolitical tensions or a series of extreme weather events could all have adverse effects on economic activity around the world the report said the emerging markets and developing economies as well witnessed the largest and most broad based debt accumulation over the past 50 years as the total debt among these economies jumped to around 170 percent of gdp in 2018 up from 115 percent of gdp in 2010 debt has also surged among low income countries after a sharp drop over 2000 2010 the report touched upon the productivity growth which witnessed a slowdown over the past 10 years the growth in productivity which means output per worker is a key factor for raising living standards and achieving development goals the report found that the average output per worker in emerging and developing economies is less than one fifth that of a worker in an advanced economy and in low income economies that figure drops to two percent which illustrates how the productivity slowdown has affected emerging and developing economies price control and inflation prospects in low income economies have affected these economies according to the report while price control is sometimes a useful way to smooth price fluctuations of goods and services such as energy and food it can also harm investment and growth worsen poverty outcomes and lead to heavier fiscal burdens in this regard the report proposed to replace such procedures with expanded and targeted social safety nets alongside catalysing competition and setting an effective regulatory environment which can be beneficial to poverty eradication and growth enhancement on inflation the report said that while it has declined sharply in low income countries over the last 25 years keeping it low and stable cannot be taken for granted low inflation is associated with more stable output and employment higher investment and falling poverty rates however rising debt levels and fiscal pressures could put some economies at risk of disruptions that could send prices sharply higher strengthening central bank independence making the monetary authority s objectives clear and cementing central bank credibility are essential to keep prices anchored the report stated while the global economic outlook for 2020 envisions a fragile upward path that could be upended there is a high degree of uncertainty around the forecast given unpredictability around trade and other policies if policy makers manage to mitigate tensions and settle issues in a number of areas they could prove the forecast wrong by sending growth higher than anticipated search keywords short link
the trade war with china is over long live the trade war that is the message from donald trump as the us president promotes a pact with beijing that has both settled the frayed nerves of traders across the world s financial markets and put those same traders on notice that the battle will continue for years to come this week the white house is expected to publish details of a first phase deal that cuts the import tariffs from 15 to 7 5 on more than 100bn of chinese imports as soon as the agreement is implemented the deal is expected to be signed on wednesday although trump said on friday it might be shortly thereafter meanwhile china has agreed to spend at least 200bn a year on us produce which cheered american farmers who have been effectively locked out of china s vast food market for more than 18 months and since 1 january china has paved the way for an agreement that will cut tariffs on more than 850 products from frozen pork to semiconductors calculations by bloomberg showed that the tariff cuts will affect almost 400bn 309bn of foreign goods sold to china annually out of its total import bill of 2tn in addition tariffs that trump and trade representative robert lighthizer threatened to impose on mobile phones laptops and other hi tech products made in china will no longer apply as a truce it works to calm an increasingly volatile situation ahead of what is expected to be a bruising election year but it leaves much of the new high tariff infrastructure in place for instance a 25 levy by the us on 250bn of chinese goods mostly parts for goods assembled in us factories remains in effect across the spectrum of imported goods the average tariff on chinese goods will fall to 19 3 which is more than six times what it stood at before the trade war began in 2018 and still seven percentage points higher than a year ago according to the washington based peterson institute for international economics david dollar a china expert at the brookings institution thinktank in washington says the main benefit of the first stage deal is that it puts an end to the almost monthly escalation of tariffs seen last year there s been a lot of disruption and pain and there hasn t been a lot of progress on the most important issues scott paul alliance for american manufacturing he says the momentum for at least a temporary cessation of hostilities was huge after trump realised his campaign was costing us businesses billions of dollars the trade war with china has been a sobering experience for the white house he says trump s staff believed tariffs would be a win win and there would be a boost for domestic firms as well as a hit to china but the first thing just didn t happen for the past year us manufacturing has been in recession and shedding jobs despite the president s tweets to the contrary caterpillar the world s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment has seen profits squeezed both directly and indirectly by the trade war for more than a year the company s us made diggers were slapped with a 40 tariff by beijing and at the same time the firm was coping with a 25 tariff on parts made in china and destined for us assembly plants the china tariff has fallen back to 15 since last summer boosting caterpillar s share price but the firm s international business considered a bellwether for the global economy has yet to recover its 2017 value general motors ford electric car maker tesla and tech companies apple and microsoft which were caught by tariffs on semiconductors have also been hit during the past year and only recently began with the prospect of a truce to recover sales view image in fullscreen electric carmaker tesla was among us firms hit by tariffs this year photograph aly song reuters it s incredibly disappointing the last three years has built up to this agreement and there s no clear path forward after this scott paul president of the alliance for american manufacturing said last month there s been a lot of disruption and pain and there hasn t been a lot of progress on the most important issues a deal that forces beijing to buy us soya beans is expected to benefit farmers who have struggled to find alternative markets for their produce following an effective blockade by the chinese against us exports london based firm llewellyn consulting says the cumulative effect of tariff increases by both countries has probably knocked a full percentage point off us gdp growth and the same amount off china s stuttering economy quoting data from the american action forum which monitors the effects of tariffs worldwide john llewellyn who heads the consultancy and is a former chief economist of the organisation for economic co operation and development believes the increased tariffs combined with trump s use of import restrictions and his attacks on the world trade organization which seeks to reduce tariffs could be having an even bigger effect trump s systematic attack on the post second world war international order which is more than ordinary protectionism may be having greater effects than history based calculations would suggest he says i d be surprised if there is much progress on a second stage deal ahead of november s presidential election and i don t expect the us to start a fresh trade war with europe with so many potential unintended consequences in an election year james knightley global chief economist at ing bank was one of the first to argue last week that a deal with china may allow trump to turn his gaze towards brussels tariffs the president has already imposed on europe have according to credit analysts euler hermes affected uk businesses more than firms in any other eu country except germany view image in fullscreen william wemyss of edinburgh distiller wemyss malts says us tariffs have hit his business photograph callum bennetts maverick scotch whisky was one of the hardest hit products after the us president targeted single malt whisky for a 25 tariff william wemyss boss of independent edinburgh distiller wemyss malts says you have to have the us in your sights because it is the single largest consumer of scotch whisky by a long way after producing blended whiskies for a decade wemyss released the first cases of a new single malt last year but has delayed sending any to the us following the october tariff rise in the short term it is easy to mitigate the problem by sending cases to alternative markets and letting the dust settle he adds but if the situation persists it is going to be bad news for the whole industry mary lovely a trade expert at the peterson institute says small and medium sized firms there are the hardest hit especially by a 25 tariff on intermediate goods such as power cables and components many bigger companies have kept a low profile in the debate over tariffs after saving themselves tens of millions of dollars by exploiting arcane waiver rules there are exemptions lovely says but it is only the largest companies that can afford expensive lawyers to get the necessary certificates trump will boast that his deal also includes concessions from china over intellectual property disputes and some other running sores related to the way beijing treats foreign firms one example is an agreement for cases to be escalated to a national court taking power away from regional administrators who tended to side with local firms there is very little in the agreement that could not be achieved by partnering with allies that were also concerned about the same issues says lovely what happens now what will this week s deal achieve donald trump has spent the last 30 years arguing that china has used protectionist tariffs quotas and biased rules to hobble foreign competition he is expected to say that china has made concessions in a first stage deal that will end some of these unfair practices the world bank says global trade growth will improve modestly in 2020 as a result to 1 9 up from 2019 when the rate of expansion slowed to 1 4 the lowest since the 2008 09 financial crisis what tariffs will remain in place washington is maintaining tariffs on 370bn of the 550bn worth of products it imports from china each year thus approximately two thirds of us imports from china will remain covered by the administration s tariffs what will the next phase of the peace deal look like trump s trade advisers peter navarro and robert lighthizer want to press on and force china to end the state subsidies that allow it to remain a provider of ultra cheap manufactured goods but experts believe they will make little progress this year towards a second or third stage deal while trump is focused on his re election

global financial conditions have improved across the world although rising debt levels pose a future threat an uneasy cessation of trade hostilities between china and the united states provided some relief the bright spot in the global economy continues to be consumer spending global growth weakened considerably in 2019 as trade wars and weakening growth in china negatively impacted growth in many parts of the world the manufacturing sectors were either in recession or close to recession territory in response many central banks began to loosen monetary policy rather than tighten as had been expected a year ago with some countries notably china and the united states providing additional stimulus as well however the past month has seen some relief in the unrelentingly downbeat news on the global economy an uneasy cessation of trade hostilities between china and the united states the diminished risk of a no deal brexit and an ease in financial conditions as stimulus provided by central banks is beginning to filter through meanwhile as global exporters adjusted to the new world of higher tariffs the impacts of the trade war on real gdp growth turned out to be smaller than expected by the end of the year many of the ihs markit purchasing managers indexes especially in manufacturing began to stabilize and show small gains moreover while any major progress on the trade war will likely have to wait until after the 2020 us elections an escalation in hostilities significant enough to do major damage also seems unlikely the bright spot in the global economy continues to be consumer spending which is benefitting from decent income growth along with low oil prices inflation and interest rates in addition global financial conditions have improved across the world although rising debt levels pose a future threat all told ihs markit expects global growth to stabilize at 2 5 in 2020 before edging up in 2021 and 2022 the us economy will grow at trend around 2 ihs markit analysts assess the trend or potential growth in the us economy to be around 2 real gdp growth was above trend from 2017 to 2019 thanks to fiscal stimulus however with the effects of this stimulus wearing off growth is returning to trend some special factors will boost gdp growth over the first half of next year the phase one trade deal with china will also help a little consumer spending roughly 70 of the economy will increase about 2 7 in 2020 putting a floor on growth in the broader economy on a calendar year basis we look for real gdp to expand 2 1 next year china s growth rate will fall below 6 while it is tempting to blame much of the recent slowdown on the us china trade war the decade long deceleration is the result of both structural and cyclical factors an ageing population and a sharp drop off in productivity growth mean that potential growth in china is lower now than a decade ago and is set to fall further since the global financial crisis 10 years ago china s debt as a percentage of gdp has surged to about 260 mostly due to a corporate borrowing binge and more recently an increase in household mortgage borrowing tying the hands of policymakers attempts to deleverage the economy by curbing the role of shadow banks have only been partially successful and have come at the expense of growth policymakers are currently engaged in a balancing act they would like to cut the debt ratio or at least keep it from rising while providing enough stimulus to keep growth from falling too fast ihs markit predicts that china s growth rate will slide even further to 5 7 in 2020 europe s economy will stabilize then recover slightly the slump in eurozone growth in 2019 was alarming nevertheless there are some signs that the worst may be over while the hard data are giving mixed signals weakness in the business sectors versus sustained growth in consumer spending the soft data are showing early signs of an inflection point in particular the ihs markit manufacturing pmis for the eurozone have picked up a little although service sector pmis have weakened ihs markit expects eurozone growth to stabilize at around 0 9 in 2020 before picking up a little in 2021 meanwhile the results of the uk election suggest that while the worst of the brexit uncertainty may be over there is still a hard slog ahead with growth dropping to 0 5 in 2020 before recovering slightly in 2021 japan s faltering growth will be cushioned by more stimulus japan s real gdp growth rate accelerated to an estimated 1 1 in 2019 however fourth quarter growth is expected to turn negative as a result of the increased sales tax at the beginning of october in response to the weakness driven by the sales tax hike along with the drag from trade and super typhoon hagibis the abe government announced a larger than expected 120 billion 15 month fiscal package the first since 2016 and the largest since 2012 the money intended to upgrade infrastructure invest in new technologies and repair typhoon damage will neutralize much of the negative effects of the sales tax hike consequently after falling to 0 3 in 2020 japanese real gdp growth is projected to recover in 2021 emerging markets will continue to tread water as debt reaches new peaks the past decade has not been kind to the emerging world as growth has fallen from an average 7 3 in 2010 to 4 2 in 2019 while the long slide in china s growth rate has been a key factor emerging markets also faced two other stiff headwinds lackluster expansions in the developed world and falling commodity prices recoveries in the developed world are predicted to remain fragile in the next few years while commodity prices are expected to slide at least in the near term these along with the simmering trade war and the continued decline in china s rate of expansion mean that there is very little scope for growth in the emerging world to rise much if at all from current low rates more local concerns such as riots in latin america and faltering growth in india are also worrisome

by salvatore j bruno chief investment officer and managing director for indexiq after what had been a tumultuous 2019 the end of the year is bringing significant progress on a number of fronts that have had investors on edge for months as the year came to a close we saw bipartisan agreement on the u s mexico canada trade agreement commonly referred to as usmca phase one of a u s china trade deal strong jobs report numbers greater clarity on the fed s outlook passage of a 738 billion military spending bill and a landslide uk election that makes a 2020 brexit all but certain all of this has us generally positive on what s in store for investors next year in fact if gross domestic product growth gdp bottoms out at 1 and starts to reaccelerate we will look back on the start of 2020 with 20 20 hindsight as being the soft landing many have been looking for over the past several years instead of being late in the current cycle we may very well have just kicked off a brand new one still risks remain and even amidst all these bright spots we think it s very likely 2020 will see a dramatic uptick in volatility driven largely by what will be a rancorous u s presidential election with that in mind we ve put together three strategies to help investors navigate the coming year 2020 etf strategy 1 follow the smart money to liquid alternatives though the long term trend lines might look calm the day to day is going to get bumpy next year numerous institutional investors are already using liquid alternatives for their volatility dampening properties to smooth out market gyrations in fact according to a recent study from greenwich assocaites commissioned by indexiq read the full study here institutional allocations to liquid alternative etfs will rise from 47 billion to 114 billion over the course of the next 12 months there s wisdom in this crowd and investors may want to consider the potential diversification benefits of liquid alternatives for their own portofolios indexiq solutions to consider 2020 strategy 2 get active in fixed income interest rates are at painfully low levels and unlikely to budge anytime soon if they haven t already 2020 will be the time for etf investors to get active with their fixed income exposures or at the very least to move beyond traditional market cap weighted approaches that will continue to eke out paltry yields there has been an explosion of unique factor based bond etf approaches to come to market recently as well as a growing contingent of best in class active managers who have started to make their strategies available to investors in an etf wrapper there s really no need to settle for returns that mimic the agg when so many compelling options are now available indexiq solutions to consider 2020 strategy 3 dust off your passport and go international investors have had compelling reasons to stay close to home the past few years but now with greater clarity emerging around brexit and movement on a china u s trade deal it s time for investors to broaden their horizons and consider upping their international equity exposure however though some risks may have lessened currency risk never really goes away so even as investors are taking a fresh look outside the u s they should do so with an eye on effective strategies to hedge currency risk from their international equity exposures indexiq solution to consider we look forward to speaking with all of our clients colleagues and friends as the new year unfolds about risk there are risks involved with investing in any such products including the possible loss of principal investors in the funds should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility and the possibility of significant losses click on the fund name for the most current fund page which

investment performance of the underlying etfs in which it invests there is no guarantee that the fund itself or any of the etfs in the fund s portfolio will perform exactly as its underlying index the fund s underlying etfs invest in foreign securities which are subject to interest rate currency exchange rate economic and political risks these risks may be greater for emerging markets fixed income securities also carry inflation risk liquidity risk call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longer term securities leverage including borrowing will cause some of the fund s underlying etfs to be more volatile than if the underlying etfs had not been leveraged the fund may experience a portfolio turnover rate of over 100 that will increase transaction costs and may generate short term capital gains which are taxable mna certain of the proposed takeover transactions in which the fund invests may be renegotiated terminated or involve a longer time frame than originally contemplated which may negatively impact the fund s returns the fund s investment strategy may result in high portfolio turnover which in turn may result in increased transaction costs to the fund and lower total returns foreign securities are subject to interest rate currency exchange rate economic and political risks these risks may be greater for emerging markets diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses stock prices of mid and small capitalization companies generally are more volatile than those of larger companies and also more vulnerable than those of larger capitalization companies to adverse economic developments the fund is non diversified and is susceptible to greater losses if a single portfolio investment declines than would a diversified fund the

of nonpayment of interest or principal than higher rated bonds securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as junk bonds in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longer term securities bonds are also subject to credit risk which is the possibility that the bond issuer may fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner the underlying index seeks to provide exposure to u s dollar denominated high yield corporate bonds that are measured to have less credit risk based on their marginal contribution to risk as with any measure of a bond s credit risk marginal contribution to risk may fail to accurately reflect the credit risk of an individual bond in addition marginal contribution to risk is not predictive of the price performance of fixed income securities there is no guarantee that the construction methodology of the underlying index will accurately provide exposure to u s dollar denominated high yield corporate bonds with lower credit risk to the extent that the underlying index is

the us china trade war has impacted taiwan s merchandise exports to all major trade partners except the united states taiwan s exports to china and asean countries have seen a respective decline by 5 per cent and 7 6 per cent in 2019 january to november yet exports to the united states have experienced significant growth of 17 6 per cent the export of ict information and communication technology products to the united states has seen the most noticeable growth waning exports are especially clear for chemical products plastic products and metals in comparison the exports of ict audio and visual products grew by 21 4 per cent in 2019 january to november the taiwan government responded to the us china trade war by encouraging china based taiwanese firms to invest in their homeland apart from this policy us companies have requested taiwanese subcontractors in the ict industry shift their export platform from china to taiwan despite higher production costs in taiwan us companies have concerns about the uncertain result of us china trade negotiations and technology leakages to china as of december 2019 taiwan recorded nt 840billion us 28 billion in domestic investment most of the investment is made by taiwanese firms operating within the ict sector with business operations in china taiwan s domestic investment has made great contributions to the economy evidenced by the robust growth in capital formation the semiconductor industry s large investment in advanced manufacturing processing is another contributing factor to taiwan s growth in capital formation unlike the growing investment at home taiwanese firms investment in china is declining taiwan s investment in china dropped by 53 per cent to us 3 7 billion in 2019 between january and november china s importance in taiwan s total outbound direct investment odi fell to 37 per cent in 2019 between january and november from 70 per cent 10 years ago but taiwan s inward foreign direct investment fdi has increased to us 10 billion in 2019 from january to november the highest since 2008 the strengthening production relation with the netherland s asml the largest semiconductor equipment supplier in the world contributed to taiwan s surge of fdi in recent years overall taiwan s economy in 2019 has benefitted from investment repatriation the export diversion effect of the us china trade war is clearly observable in the ict industry the mounting investment in taiwan is likely to continue to underpin the economy amid ongoing us china trade tensions in the near term but given the still relatively strong cross strait industrial linkages in ict taiwan s export oriented economy may suffer if the united states includes ict goods in its new round of tariff retaliation nearly 40 per cent of taiwan s exports still go to china and hong kong today about half of the exports to china and hong kong are electronic components for assembling final ict products almost 90 per cent of taiwan s ict products ordered by overseas clients were made in china in 2017 taiwan s economic outlook is overshadowed if china engages in intimidation tactics against taiwan by ending the cross strait economic cooperation framework ecfa in effect since 2011 china may continue to exclude taiwan from any multilateral and bilateral free trade agreements which is disadvantageous for taiwan s economic development due to a lack of free trade agreements taiwan can only rely on the world trade organization for developing external trade but the trump administration has tried to undermine the wto as a mechanism for settling international trade disputes taiwan s long term economic prospects are also challenged by an ageing population according to united nations estimates taiwan is set to become a super aged society in 2025 with more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 and above even though policy measures can effectively boost taiwan s total fertility rate tfr it would take at least two decades to see an increase in the working population to cope with labour shortage problems in the future taiwan may have to further relax its foreign labour policy and immigrant policy to attract talent taiwan will also have to raise wages to an internationally competitive level low wages will not only drive skilled workers to other countries but also hamper taiwan s ability to develop innovative high value added and knowledge based industries taiwan s economy in 2019 is threatened by the us china trade war but the economy as a whole has held up relatively well due to taiwanese firms substantial investments at home mounting investment will most likely continue to underpin the economy amid the ongoing us china trade tensions in the long run with its growing ageing population taiwan s economic growth prospects may take a beating as savings consumption and investment are expected to decline min hua chiang is a research fellow at the east asian institute the national university of singapore

tory newmyer the washington post investors set aside their jitters over the middle east tinderbox to send stocks to new highs last week but economists taking a long view see fundamental threats to growth both at home and abroad looming on the horizon the world bank in its latest forecast cut expectations for global growth this year by 2 to 2 5 citing fragile conditions brought on by ongoing trade uncertainty and a slowdown in investment that would amount to a tiny improvement over 2019 which saw the worldwide economy expand by 2 4 the slowest pace since the 2008 financial crisis the development bank left room for rosier outcomes but warned that downside risks predominate including the possibility of a re escalation of global trade tensions sharp downturns in major economies and disruptions in the developing world the outlook closer to home is gloomier the world bank sees u s growth stumbling from the unspectacular 2 3 growth it notched in 2019 to 1 8 this year on its way down to 1 7 in both 2021 and 2022 that would amount to a significant underperformance measured against president donald trump s promise to deliver at least 3 growth and the world bank s forecasters aren t alone economists gathered at the american economic association s annual meeting recently shared a dark mood according to the new york times they warned one another about trade war about government budget deficits and repeatedly about the inability of central banks to fully combat another recession should one sweep the globe anytime soon they write underlying their sense of foreboding was a widespread sentiment that the current expansion is built on a potentially shaky combination of high deficits and low interest rates and when it ends as it is bound to do eventually it could do so painfully janet yellen the former federal reserve chair and organizer of the conference as the aea s new president designed its program to focus on the threats posed by persistently low interest rates the trade war and other hurdles policymakers are erecting i organized the program and i think it s not an accident you re seeing it i think it s very important she told tankersley and smialek the most bullish point on which most forecasters are able to agree is that recession risks both globally and in the u s have tempered over the last several months at home a strong november jobs report stalwart consumer spending and the de tente between the trump administration and beijing on trade have made the possibility of an outright economic contraction more remote oxford economics now pegs the threat at 25 for example though it still sees the economy losing steam this year projecting growth of 1 7 the team at high frequency economics pegs 2020 growth at a similar level 1 8 the macroeconomic forecasters point to good news in the form of a robust labor market rising wages and housing sector strength but the firm does note that tariffs have wreaked havoc on the manufacturing sector and sapped business confidence taking a bite out of investment plus fiscal stimulus from big federal spending packages and the 2017 tax cuts are tailing off with little indication lawmakers will move to keep that tap flowing though they themselves could feel the hangover effects as rubeela farooqi the shop s chief u s economist notes the slowdown in gdp in an election year will not be favorable for incumbents
global economic growth is likely to be only slightly faster this year than the weak performance seen in 2019 according to a world bank forecast the world economy is likely to expand by 2 5 per cent in 2020 up from 2 4 per cent last year the bank s economists predict that reflects an expected recovery in some emerging and developing countries that had a difficult 2019 but it will be offset by slower growth in the united states and some other developing nations growth in 2019 was the slowest since the financial crisis and the moderate forecast for this year is beset with uncertainty the report said it depends on a substantial improvement in some large emerging and developing economies india is predicted to rebound after a marked slowdown in growth last year brazil should grow somewhat more strongly after a period of weakness mexico and turkey should see growth after recording none for 2019 as a whole argentina s economy will continue to contract but more slowly than in the last two years the forecast suggested that economic activity in iran would stop declining this year with growth returning in 2021 but even then it won t if the bank s forecasts are borne out be a strong recovery and the political tensions and violence that have erupted in the last few days could easily undermine that the bank warned of risks to this outlook iran is a reminder that conflict in the middle east is an ever present danger that can have economic consequences the report was written before those events took place even so the report said the disruption in saudi oil production in mid september highlights the potential for renewed tensions in the middle east franziska ohnsorge a world bank economist and one of the authors of the report said these problems could feed through to emerging and developing economies through higher oil prices there have been occasions in the past when problems in the middle east have led to higher oil prices and even contributed to a global recessions that said ms ohnsorge noted two factors that could help moderate how oil prices respond the fact that the oil producers group opec has been restricting production and could reverse that action in addition the us shale oil industry which is a relatively new factor in the global market can increase production much more rapidly than traditional ways of getting oil trade tensions are another potential trouble spot for global growth they could re escalate as the report puts it there have been signs of movement in the us china dispute the two sides have made what president trump calls a phase one deal but it is far from fully resolved the bank seems to be acutely aware that progress could be easily reversed and other trade tensions could arise there is also a concern about a rapid build up of debt in emerging economies the bank said a wave of debt accumulation began after the global financial crisis
source xinhua 2020 01 11 07 08 20 editor zd video player close rome jan 10 xinhua the latest round of economic indicators are showing positive signs for italy s slow growing economy but just barely italy s national statistics institute istat on friday released new data on domestic industrial output for november and the overall economic situation improved in december a day earlier the institute reported that the overall employment rate improved to its lowest level since 1977 however none of the aforementioned figures improved by significant amounts the institute said that industrial production in november increased 0 1 percent compared to the previous month reversing a trend that saw small decreases in production the previous three months it also said the overall economic situation was leaning toward the worldwide trend for moderate economic growth the unemployment figure released thursday told a similar tale the number of italians with a job climbed 0 1 percent in november compared to the previous month though the overall figure is the best in more than 40 years the indicator had been hovering around that level for the last several months and economists said the number may have been inflated by some workers dropping out of the workforce the latest economic news has mostly been good but it s not overwhelming javier noriega chief economist with hildebrandt and ferrar in milan told xinhua i look at the latest data as what could be the start of a fragile economic recovery still the recent figures are positive news for an economy dogged by slow economic growth high unemployment levels for young workers and a lack of investment in research and innovation tariffs on european goods entering the united states and the trade war between some countries are also weighing on the prospects of economic recovery analysts said it s too early to tell if this is the start of something abs securities analyst oliviero fiorini said in an interview it s obviously better than the contrary which would be a slightly negative trend in the indicators but there s no reason to think the underlying situation in italy has changed the economy still needs major structural reforms and worries about political instability still cast a shadow over everything we won t know what these newest indicators mean until we can look back in a few months according to noriega the economy is benefiting from some external factors like a relatively weak euro that is helping exports and low yields on government debt that help save the government money but until there is a government with a solid majority and a desire to push through the right kind of reforms i worry these small steps are the best the economy can hope for he said the consensus estimates are that when the final data for 2019 is tallied that the italian economy will have grown around 0 1 percent for the year as a whole but official data from istat said it expects the economic growth rate to increase to around 0 6 percent for 2020

mike silagadze has big plans to upend the global textbook market his 11 year old toronto software firm tophatmonocle corp top hat has been growing by 50 per cent a year signing up professors to offer interactive electronic textbooks tests and assignments on its platform while traditional giants of the us 35 billion industry such as pearson plc have struggled with 400 employees and annual revenue approaching us 50 million top hat which has raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital to date is getting to the size where we can go public on the tsx said mr silagadze the chief executive and co founder his plan is to be prepared for that option by spring 2021 that doesn t mean an initial public offering will happen it s not even his first choice the company has had little problem attracting private capital investors from canada and the united states and if we can get a liquidity event without going public we ll do that mr silagadze said if you can find an anchor private equity fund that can give you all the liquidity you need and allow you to raise capital with the same frictionless process that you would in an ipo it s better in every way mr silagadze is far from alone his reluctance to take his company public is part of a much bigger trend unfolding in the senior ranks of canada s flourishing technology sector many other promising companies are big enough and growing fast enough to become reasonable candidates for an ipo on a senior stock exchange within two years in conversations with investors ceos and financiers the globe and mail has identified 15 to 25 companies that fit that description some are fast closing in on 100 million in annual revenue considered the threshold for an ipo on a major exchange or such as health care software giant pointclickcare technologies inc and online auto financier canada drives ltd have surpassed it but a lot of those ceos just aren t interested as with mr silagadze it is well down their list of potential financing choices call it canada s lost tech ipo boom those companies are increasingly avoiding going public because they have so much access to private capital hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into u s and canadian private equity in recent years much of it owing to chronically low interest rates that have driven savvy investors to seek returns from non conventional asset classes but for tech starved canadian stock markets the lack of new entrants is an opportunity lost canada has seen just three tech ipos in the past four years as software continues to conquer the world canadian retail investors and the investment dealers that cater to them are missing out on a vital source of wealth creation the trend line in canada is don t take them public unless you absolutely have to said matt roberts a partner with toronto s scaleup ventures nobody wants to deal with the public markets anymore companies have so much capital lined up they don t really need to go public open this photo in gallery mike wessinger seen here on dec 19 2019 is happy he didn t take pointclickcare public in 2015 tijana martin the globe and mail the flood of venture capital venture debt and private equity into tech continues to swell pouring in from wealthy individuals sovereign wealth and pension funds university endowments and other institutions last year private equity funds globally raised 810 billion and invested 600 billion up more than 200 per cent and 85 per cent respectively from 2014 according to preliminary data from analytics provider refinitiv in canada its data say venture capital firms invested 6 9 billion in 2019 more than ever before and up about 50 per cent from 2018 taking inflation into account 2019 was second only to the peak dot com bubble year of 2000 that flood is enabling fast growing companies to stay private much longer raising as much as they could by going public but without the hassle cost disclosure requirements and scrutiny if you told me there was a 500 million deal to do in canada of a software company that lots of people can understand i bet you could talk to 30 interested parties said david greenberg general partner of baltimore based jmi equity one of the most active u s growth equity capital investors in canadian technology there is a depth of capital ready to do deals of all sizes the rise of private capital means less investment is flowing into public markets in the mid to late 2000s canadian technology companies would typically raise 40 million apiece in public offerings on the toronto stock exchange last year a dozen canadian companies each raised more than twice that much but from private investors the total number of public companies in has declined by 35 per cent in canada since 2008 in the u s the total is down by 50 per cent over the past two decades the squeeze in canada s tech sector has been particularly dramatic since 2009 there have been just 11 tech ipos that raised 50 million plus on the tsx 12 if you count minneapolis based ceridian hcm holding inc which is managed out of toronto the sector was already thin information technology accounts for less than 6 per cent of the tsx composite index compared with 22 per cent on the s p 500 in the u s it also exceeds 10 per cent on the benchmark stock indices in germany france and hong kong last year just two canadian it companies lightspeed pos inc and docebo inc went public on the tsx legal software firm dye durham corp which delayed its planned 2018 ipo will probably go public in 2020 along with maybe online deals website consolidator emerge commerce inc beyond that bay street tech underwriters don t expect much this year will be more of the same bmo capital markets managing director david wismer said if things were the same as 10 years ago there would have been 20 other ipos the drought is not due to lack of investor interest the lightspeed and docebo offerings were both heavily oversubscribed shares of ottawa based shopify inc have surged since its 2015 ipo in the u s by contrast the parade of tech ipos continues despite the poor performance of many of the 42 new tech issues last year other prominent names such as airbnb inc and doordash inc are set to go this year following the lead of casper sleep inc which filed a registration statement friday to list on the new york stock exchange it s more of a supply than a demand issue in canada said mr wismer private investors are pumping so money into tech that some analysts worry they ve created pre ipo bubbles uber technologies inc lyft inc and slack technologies raised billions privately only to see shares of their money losing companies tumble after their ipos last year still a significant share of the gains for public investors in the u s over the past 25 years has come from the technology sector a slew of internet giants including amazon com alphabet inc apple inc facebook inc and alibaba group holding ltd have created trillions of dollars of wealth canadian retail investors have been dramatically underexposed to technology said peter misek a former analyst who now co leads framework venture partners in toronto do you think there will be more or less technology in every industry if you think there will be more we ve basically been missing out on the largest secular trend the world has ever seen the reallocation of capital to private markets from public really sucks for the average retail investor because now the only people that are getting access to these hyper growth businesses are basically rich dudes mr silagadze said with technology so underrepresented on canada s benchmark stock index one could argue that makes less relevant bmo s mr wismer said our future standard of living depends on the innovation economy if

wessinger the ceo and co founder of pointclickcare a mississauga based provider of cloud based health care records software to nursing homes and retirement facilities is happy he didn t take his company public in 2015 the company filed a prospectus with u s and canadian regulators for an ipo but it delayed and then pulled the offering instead pointclickcare raised private equity led by san francisco s dragoneer investment group pointclickcare has continued to flourish under the control of dragoneer jmi and management the company s revenue has increased by 140 per cent since 2015 to more than us 300 million if it were public pointclickcare would likely be worth more than u 2 billion and one of the tsx s 10 largest tech companies that won t happen any time soon private is the new public mr wessinger said i would expect to see this company for the foreseeable future continue to grow and be a large stand alone company he offers many reasons for preferring the private life pointclickcare has avoided costs and the burdens of public reporting and the steady barrage of questions from investors and analysts on topics like u s health care politics a random tweet by u s president donald trump about the affordable care act could send stocks in the sector reeling as a public company ceo mr wessinger would also likely be more focused on short term investor concerns and fluctuations in the stock you try to pretend that you wouldn t pay attention to the markets and just build for the long term but if you wake up one morning and 30 per cent of the company s value has hemorrhaged because of the way investors think about your company you ll behave the markets think differently then there are the shareholder activists who often dog public companies i don t have that distraction mr wessinger said away from public scrutiny pointclickcare has spent four years and us 100 million developing new products expected to drive future growth the pressure as a public company would be just stop doing that your core business is so incredibly profitable and we would have optimized for the short term mr wessinger said a decade long global boom in private capital cad milllions

time we need to raise capital they have been more than willing to help paying only a slight discount to public market values private equity has gotten very attractive and there s so much of it i could take a call every day from another private equity investor who would love to bain co estimates private equity firms raised invested and returned more money to investors during the 2014 18 period than

executives and be stuck with weakened equity for acquisitions i ve lived through that he said it creates a whole host of issues doing deals as a private company allows him to issue shares based on

investors argue there are broader benefits to canadian companies staying private longer they re scaling up and delivering on longer term plans that public investors may not appreciate to be able to do this with a private investment partner and not have to show immediate impact is a benefit for the companies said justin sadrian managing director with global private equity firm warburg pincus which has invested close to us 500 million in canadian tech companies since 2015 it s not that they are choosing to never go public instead he said they are getting to the point where they are much more mature businesses that are more seasoned in many cases derisked and better prepared for quarterly reporting michael sabia the outgoing ceo of the caisse de dépôt et placement du québec agrees the last message i would read into fewer ipos is a lament he said i actually think you could interpret this as the opposite fifteen years ago an ipo was the indicator of success and most companies sought to do it as early as possible there is a growing recognition that public markets may be an inhospitable environment in which to grow a business even raising say 40 million in an ipo in the early 2000s often left a company underfunded under covered by analysts and too small for many fund managers beset by weak trading volumes and anemic share prices public canadian tech companies such as internet of things pioneer ruggedcom inc were also vulnerable to hostile bids that offered huge premiums to stockholders ruggedcom sold out to white knight siemens ag in 2012 for 440 million a move ceo marzio pozzuoli called bittersweet at the time because it left him short of his goal of building a billion dollar company by contrast ottawa software firms kinaxis and shopify raised considerably more in the mid 2010s ipos both drew on heavy institutional interest and subsequently ranked among the most expensive cloud software stocks in their classes the choice is do entrepreneurs want to have large institutional partnership focused money that will be available to help them grow mr sabia said public market capital is not by its nature partnership capital that s the proposition we make we represent a pool of patient constructive capital offer an attractive alternative path these businesses will become an important part of the canadian economy and eventually many go public but they ll probably go public later open this photo in gallery louis tetu sold taleo corp in 2012 to oracle for us 1 9 billion renaud philippe the globe and mail but will they statistics show that private capital backed companies overwhelmingly sell to corporations looking for strategic acquisitions or increasingly to other private equity firms ipos typically account for 10 per cent or less of exit transactions we foster the idea of being public ready jmi s mr greenberg said but doing that makes the companies more attractive to and in most cases the company comes to its own decision that you can have a better more lucrative outcome than trying to public selling out to another buyer is also a more attractive option for private equity firms because it lets them cash in immediately ipos often become drawn own exits with mandated periods for holding publicly traded shares and the associated market risks i m not sure it s an ipo boom delayed said neil selfe ceo of investment banking advisory firm infor financial group ultimately many private equity sponsored companies will be bought because they will always pay more than the public markets there may be good news for public investors however despite expectations of a slow 2020 canadian underwriters expect a pickup in tech ipos in 2021 and beyond i think will happen in 12 to 24 months said aly gillani rbc capital markets managing director overseeing tech financings at a certain point cycle catches up we ll be back to a place where there should be more tech ipos on a regular basis half a dozen or more a year bmo s mr wismer

more than a decade out from the start of the 2008 recession michigan is still facing a challenging environment for economic growth nonetheless the state s economy is expected to pick up over time even if it is slower than michiganders would like this is according to top economists from the university of michigan and state fiscal analysts who presented their economic findings and projections as part of the state s annual consensus revenue estimating conference crec that determines how much money the state has general economic trends trends show that michigan s economic state of affairs has improved since the last recession but has still have yet to fully recover although job growth will increase over the next two years it is a very modest increase and is considered well below a good recession recovery pace in other words it will still take more time before michigan fully gets back on track to pre recession levels in 2018 the state s real gross domestic product gdp grew by 2 5 which was just under the 2 9 real gdp growth experienced by the united states however due to a slowdown in the local labor market and the uaw strike at gm this fall gdp growth slowed to about 4 in 2019 the last time michigan encountered real gdp growth that low was more than a decade ago in 2007 and 2008 although growth numbers then plummeted into the negatives u of m s research seminar in quantitative economics rsqe models forecast that number to rise in 2020 although the growth will still not reach 2018 levels the growth will taper down slightly after that wage and salary employment growth also took a hit from the uaw labor strike dipping below 0 5 at the time of the strike however now that the strike is over economists are predicting a more favorable outlook for the sector in coming years jobs and unemployment rsqe has not yet received the final job numbers for 2019 but for now is projecting about 24 100 job gains in michigan last year this is a marked decline from 2018 when job growth numbers were around 50 000 ehrlich cites tax cuts extra spending from washington and other factors as reason for the 2018 boost which he says has evidently faded since then it is estimated that job gains will pick up to 31 300 over the coming year before decreasing slightly to 30 000 in 2021 then falling again to 24 300 in 2022 labor shortages are going to increasingly put a speed limit on job growth here in the state of michigan said gabriel ehrlich director of rsqe in fact since mid 2017 the number of job openings in michigan has actually outpaced the number of unemployed persons this trend is unique in michigan s recorded history and is expected to continue into 2022 unemployment rates alone which are also continuing on a historic trend are predicted to continue on the downward trend they have been on since mid 2009 unemployment will likely hang around 3 8 in 2020 decrease slightly to in 2021 to 3 6 and decrease again to 3 5 in 2022 if these predictions are accurate unemployment levels in 2021 and 2022 would be all time lows for michigan s unemployment rate since the current statistical series began in 1976 ehrlich said auto industry in 2019 michigan s manufacturing sector felt the effects from automotive layoffs at gm and ford the uaw strike the international trade war and more ehrlich said that the uaw strike ultimately affected 31 500 jobs in october and will end up costing the state 36 million a dollar amount that he says is actually relatively low considering the breadth of the situation vehicle sales from detroit s biggest automakers have also declined slowly over the last few years and are predicted to keep on that downward trend it is a decline it s not a cause for panic ehrlich said of the dip in auto related indicators flattened auto sales have also contributed to michigan s sluggish revenue growth in the united states as a whole a slight downturn in auto sales is also expected in 2019 about 17 million

prakken of london based ihs markit spoke about the slowing u s gdp before quelling fears of a national recession we don t see any predictions that say that recession is imminent in the next 12 months prakken said the probability of a recession has slipped from around 25 to 35 last year to very very low in 2020 prakken said a model that has accurately predicted the last six recessions now shows the odds of an imminent recession at almost zero prakken also seemed to warn against the potential effects of implementing a wealth tax referring to a policy that has been proposed by progressive democratic presidential candidates u s sens elizabeth warren d mass and bernie sanders i vt in an attempt to curb extreme wealth inequality prakken referred to warren s wealth tax rate of 6 which would only apply to people with wealth of over 1 billion as confiscation and said there is no question that this would rattle financial markets if adopted but warren and sanders both argue that such a tax is necessary to address the stark and growing wealth divide between the top 1 of americans and the other 99 for warren s part her ultra millionaire tax seeks to raise 3 75 trillion in revenue over a 10 year period by placing a small annual tax 2 on households with a net worth above 50 million and a slightly higher tax 6 on households with assets above 1 billion sanders plan is more aggressive starting with a 1 tax on wealth over 32 million and gradually increasing to an 8 tax on households with 10 billion and above his tax on extreme wealth would reportedly raise 4 35 trillion over a 10 year period warren says this added revenue would pay for her plan to quadruple federal funding for public education and rebuild the middle class sanders wants to use the money to pay for medicare for all universal child care and affordable housing polls show that the majority of americans republicans included are supportive of a 2 tax on wealth over 50 million

emerging markets have a secular stagnation problem says the institute of international finance iif gdp growth across 34 economies apart from china and india has failed to meaningfully outperform that in developed markets since 2013 according to a note from the washington based organisation china and india have been able to sustain growth due to their large populations and economic size otherwise growth has slowed and on average is in line with developed markets growth across emerging markets has slowed sharply in recent years driven by weak investment the iif said year on year growth in the third quarter of 2019 was below the developed market average in brazil uruguay turkey south africa ecuador mexico saudi arabia and argentina figures from the iif and haver analytics show this has important implications for markets because the underlying value proposition of em is predicated on higher growth which in turn should translate into higher returns on foreign investment the iif said global economic growth is expected to increase slightly to 2 5 per cent this year from 2 4 per cent in 2019 but downside risks such as us china trade tensions persist the world bank said in a report on thursday growth in emerging market and developing economies is expected to accelerate this year to 4 1 per cent from 3 5 per cent last year the world bank said however about a third of these economies are projected to decelerate due to weaker than expected exports and investment the iif note said possible threats to potential growth for emerging markets in the coming decades include increased automation climate change and deglobalisation there have been two polar opposite responses to slow growth among emerging markets one response taken by turkey and argentina is greater policy activism unfortunately this approach has failed to avert the trend slowing in growth and merely resulted in a series of boom bust cycles the iif said the other response taken by mexico and south africa is for central banks to pursue highly orthodox monetary policies by building a risk premium into interest rates in these cases the result has been growth that has slowed to nearly zero a separate paper published by london based research consultancy capital economics on friday said that while growth in emerging economies will continue to outpace that in the developed world this will not be to the extent seen in the past two decades the process of reform and market liberalisation has stalled in many large ems and some of the previous gains from opening up to international trade could be lost as the current wave of globalisation ends it said in its long term economic outlook there are no major emerging markets left to integrate into the global economy meanwhile smaller ones such as those in africa lack the institutions and desire to make the necessary reforms capital economics said as globalisation has peaked international trade of goods and services has flattened off as a share of gdp the economies of emerging asia are likely to be hit the hardest india is the exception with 6 7 per cent growth in 2016 2020 and 6 9 per cent growth forecast in 2021 2025 the gcc may struggle with diversification beyond oil though the uae is better placed to cope with lower real oil prices the report said the emirates experienced 1 9 per cent economic expansion in 2016 2020 but 2 5 per cent growth is forecast for 2021 2025 looking far ahead at the world in 2050 capital economics said emerging markets will account for almost 60 per cent of the world economy compared to 44 per cent now india s share of global gdp will increase to 10 per cent in 2050 compared to 3 per cent last year but china s share will remain below that of the us capital economics predicts by 2050 the us will have a 22 per cent share of global gdp and china will have 18 per cent compared to 24 per cent and 16 per cent in 2018 respectively
lifesaving cash in a 90 billion plus budget it s easy for a few million dollars to be viewed as inconsequential but for some caseworkers at the department of juvenile justice it s everything the average contracted caseworker at djj makes about 20 000 a year it s a rough job and the low pay has led to high turnover rates to keep some veteran workers on the job lawmakers set aside 2 million for contract worker bonuses in the 2018 19 budget which equated to a couple of thousand dollars in extra pay for those working on the front lines with at risk youth for tabitha shannon the money was a lifesaver literally the bonus check arrived just as doctors told her husband that his heart was failing without bypass surgery he wouldn t live much longer standing between him and the operating room was an unpaid medical debt i said to myself as i looked up to the sky god we need a miracle shannon recalled fortunately the miracle came and the surgery was scheduled today shannon s husband is doing amazing it was given at the right time and in the right moment we never know what a person is going through in their personal life especially when they still come to work with a smile on their face she said lawmakers also set aside about 750 000 for bonuses in the current budget those checks went out just a few weeks ago so data isn t in on how they ve impacted staff turnover rates but the bonuses sent out in 2018 appear to have made an impact shannon is still a direct care worker contracted with djj and according to a djj report nearly three quarters of the 989 workers who received a bonus at the end of 2018 are still on the job many including christian minor of the florida juvenile justice association are hoping lawmakers include more money for bonuses when they hash out the 2020 21 budget this spring staff turnover and retainment is an issue both the department of juvenile justice and its contracted partners have grappled with for a long time direct care staff plays a critical role in a child s development and rehabilitation it s a difficult job in which starting pay is around 20 500 a year a dangerously low number for the cumbersome nature of the work minor said led by chairmen rob bradley jeff brandes travis cummings and clay yarborough this report reflects positively on the legislature s efforts to invest in direct care staff working on the front lines with our at risk youth through a significant reduction in turnover rates this reduction in turnover saves taxpayer dollars promotes public safety and ensures we retain staff who are invested in and committed to our children and their futures the governor and first lady casey desantis as well as secretary simone marstiller should be applauded for their continued commitment to working with the legislature on these issues facing florida s at risk youth and those that serve them ___ coming up the usual assortment of tidbits leftovers and not ready for prime time moments by peter schorsch drew

democratic leader kionne mcghee is looking to raise teacher salaries throughout the state via new legislation the push comes after gov ron desantis put forward a 603 million package to bump up salaries for new teachers starting teacher salaries at a minimum of 47 500 but mcghee s bill addresses a problem that veteran educators have with the plan it doesn t help longtime educators under the democrat s proposal teacher salaries would be raised to 47 500 or bumped up by 5 whichever number is higher in 2021 those salaries would see another 4 bump or be increased to 49 400 and so on motorola

our special education school professionals provide caring and safe learning environments for students with disabilities we have unfortunately seen serious abuses committed as well this bill will ensure students with disabilities are not placed into dangerous situations including seclusion and restraint while in florida classrooms the legislation states that a student may only be restrained when there is an imminent risk of serious injury and shall be discontinued as soon as the threat posed by the dangerous behavior has dissipated the measures also limit the types of restraints that could be used and increase training for staff on how to deal with students with disabilities children with disabilities are among the most vulnerable members of our society dubose said this bill will assure parents that their child will not experience the unnecessary trauma of being restrained secluded or put in another harmful situation by school personnel school should be a safe environment

flavored liquid nicotine to any person a violation could lead to a fine of up to 500 per offense the bill would also bar the advertisement marketing promotion or any other activity the person knows or should know is likely to cause or lead to the unlawful use of nicotine dispensing devices or nicotine products flores would also require retailers to strengthen age verification to ensure those

formalize a friendship between puerto rico and the state of florida he notes the jurisdictions share several interests and significant history florida was discovered by juan ponce de león who served as the first governor of puerto rico at the time and following the western expansion of european explorers and conquistadors both territories were initially under spanish rule but the relationship has demonstrated itself in modern times as well the governments of puerto rico and florida have a strong friendship as demonstrated in 2017 when florida helped puerto rico rebuild after hurricane maria and again in 2018 when puerto rico reciprocated by sending aid to florida after hurricane michael the back to back natural disasters were the strongest storms on record to ever strike puerto rico and

memorial hm 1093 calling for federal law to exempt small businesses from making cigars the text of the bill shows a reverence for the activity aimed at winning congress over hand rolling cigars is an old tradition and it takes countless years for a person to become proficient in the art reads sabatini s bill although most premium hand rolled cigars are made in central america and cuba such cigars are still handmade in tampa and miami florida and union city new jersey using 100 tobacco leaves he said that while tobacco sales have dropped dramatically in the u s there remain neighborhoods in

the crisis triggered by donald trump s assassination of general qassem suleimani has crystallised iran s official thinking around a single overriding demand that american military forces should pack up their weapons close their bases and leave the middle east for ever the odd thing is trump seems to agree referring to last week s retaliatory strikes on us targets ayatollah ali khamenei iran s leader declared military action like this is not sufficient what is important is ending the corrupting presence of america hassan rouhani the country s president said the only answer was to kick all us forces out of the region this long held iranian position does not differ greatly from trump s views at least in theory the us president has repeatedly argued in favour of reducing the american troop presence around the middle east in northern syria last autumn he got his way with chaotic results that dismayed allies and delighted turkey russia and the syrian regime trump has never proposed an across the board retreat in israel s case he has sought closer political and security ties he has cosied up to the wealthy saudi royals yet judging by his speeches and tweets trump is unconvinced by traditional arguments that stress the region s vital strategic importance to the us his attitude is part ideological part gut when trump vowed in 2016 to end america s forever wars in his presidential campaign he was specifically referring to the bush obama legacy in iraq and afghanistan trump has dismissed both occupations as misconceived and a waste of lives and tax dollars for him liberal tony blair type ideas about the international community as a collective the imperative of humanitarian intervention and nation building are an anathema trump is interested in markets not morality he holds no vision of the greater good has no sense of a us global mission other than putting america first speaking last week about a hypothetical rapprochement with iran his businessman s focus was on its untapped economic potential and natural resources there are other reasons on the american side for asking how long the us will continue to maintain a military presence that includes extensive bases and facilities in iraq saudi arabia bahrain kuwait qatar uae oman and afghanistan one reason mentioned by trump last week is that the present day us is much less reliant on imported oil the so called carter doctrine announced by president jimmy carter after the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1979 declared the region and its oil to be a de facto us protectorate an attempt by any outside force to gain control of the persian gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the us and will be repelled by any means necessary including military force carter declared in effect carter was completing america s post 1945 post suez takeover from britain as the middle east s leading external power and as time passed its footprint grew but now times are changing again thanks to the shale oil boom the us has become the world s leading producer of crude oil middle east supply lines no longer matter so much geopolitical priorities are shifting too the us is more focused nowadays on china as an economic and military rival and on defending its interests across the asia pacific region than on curbing russian influence or fixing the middle east trump believes his allies in the region like nato s european members should be more self reliant and is happy to sell them expensive us weaponry to that end the us certainly worries about iran s behaviour and jihadist terrorism trump craves the kudos of brokering a peace deal in palestine but beijing s military expansionism its belt and road debt diplomacy open trade lanes in the south china sea and democracy in taiwan and hong kong are washington s bigger long term concerns on the iranian side the demand that the americans leave does not arise simply from old grievances dating back to the 1953 coup against the democratically elected prime minister mohammad mosaddeq although they play a part nor does iran merely want the us out of the way so it can gain a free hand although it is unlikely to abandon its ambitions as a regional power broker there is a firm belief in tehran common to other post colonial theatres that the middle east as a whole would fare better if it were no longer a venue for great power rivalries foreign armies and imperial fantasies most educated iranians are instinctively pro western not pro arab but the post 1979 us vendetta blocks normalisation view image in fullscreen saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman the prosperity of the modern day country has been backed by us security guarantees photograph saudi royal court reuters there is also reason to believe antagonistic regional states might more readily resolve their differences if they no longer had the us to fall back on or to blame when they get into disputes as trump s commitment to regional security appeared to wane last year for example saudi arabia and qatar took steps to patch up their differences shared security concerns have led to ongoing informal contacts between arab states and israel notwithstanding or possibly because of trump s bias against palestine if the us is no longer seen as a reliable defender of its friends and if it no longer needs or wants to be in the middle east then surely it is time to leave yet if the americans did pull out what would happen 1 iraq and syria recent events in iraq and syria do not encourage confidence in a post american future after the syrian civil war erupted in 2011 the us and its gulf allies backed disparate rebel forces but some of these groups harboured jihadists and extremists which bolstered bashar al assad s claims to be fighting terrorists and divided the resistance the us withdrew its support for the rebels it also declined to intervene directly when barack obama s red line on chemical weapons use was crossed trump has since hastened american disengagement notably by abandoning syrian kurd allies russia filled the vacuum and is now winning the war for assad with a merciless bombardment of idlib following the invasion of iraq in 2003 us forces officially left in 2011 but in fact several thousand remain primarily tasked with fighting isis following the suleimani killing iraq s parliament demanded all us troops leave but there are signs of second thoughts amid doubts over the ability of iraq s politicians and security forces to hold a divided country together while containing isis syria is a chilling reminder of what can happen when the us turns its back and walks away 2 israel a wholesale us military pull back would be a traumatic experience for israel and one it would try to avoid the jewish state has been surrounded by enemies since its conception although proudly self reliant in defence a symbolic weakening of america s protective shield would be a blow that could encourage the country s foes for these and other reasons any us regional troop drawdown would almost certainly be accompanied by additional american security guarantees for israel possibly including a mutual defence treaty as recently proposed by prime minister benjamin netanyahu israel s supporters in congress would ensure the country was not abandoned at the same time such a shift could force a much needed reset for israel s political stalemate undermining the trump backed nationalist hard right typified by netanyahu and opening the way for a centrist coalition more prepared for example to cut an equitable two state deal with the palestinians 3 afghanistan the seemingly endless conflict in afghanistan which began with the us invasion after the al qaida attacks in september 2001 has been a particular bugbear of trump s he says not without reason that billions of dollars have been wasted on a chaotic and often corrupt nation building exercise that has failed to bring security or effective democratic government and caused record levels of civilian casualties trump began in 2017 by sending additional troops like obama before him when that did not work he resorted to secret negotiations with the taliban that led to an aborted peace summit at camp david the basic problem was familiar the taliban insisted us troops must agree to leave before they would accept a ceasefire or talk to the afghan government since the taliban are unlikely to relent trump or his successor will probably be forced eventually to order a withdrawal even if it leads to a fundamentalist takeover the problem in such a case is that many of the gains made by afghans will be lost and their sacrifices over nearly 20 years worth nought 4 saudi arabia and the gulf states the shock of large scale us downsizing would be felt most keenly here the modern day prosperity and influence of saudi arabia the uae qatar and kuwait have been underwritten by american security guarantees exemplified by the 1990 91 us led intervention to expel saddam hussein s invasion forces from kuwait without the americans to hold their hands and watch their backs the saudi royals behaviour could improve significantly no more kidnappings of lebanese prime ministers for example or murders of high profile journalists military adventurism of the type that produced the humanitarian disaster in yemen would be less likely the saudis and the smaller gulf states although better armed than iran might also be incentivised by american disengagement to take a more conciliatory line towards tehran something that has reportedly already been happening in recent months on the other hand they might look around for new protectors in the shape of russia or china a big gulf oil customer no us president could easily countenance such a loss of influence nor the loss of lucrative arab world investments and weapons sales getting out is not as simple as trump might think view image in fullscreen a protest against the us killing of iranian general qassem suleimani in the philippines photograph mark r cristino epa 5 terrorism and anti americanism a reduction in the us regional profile could be expected over time to bring reductions in anti americanism and the targeting of american and allied interests by terrorists who regard the us presence as an affront to the entire islamic world a key source of tension with the west might be removed on the other hand any loss of us leadership in fighting isis and successors would be serious nato might step into the breach as trump last week suggested it should regional organisations such as the gulf cooperation council and the eu could invest more in security shared defence and intelligence capabilities which might be no bad thing a lowered profile might also reduce tensions with turkey which although nominally an ally has grown impatient with an arrogant america and it could force dictatorships such as egypt s underwritten by washington to change their ways to the undoubted benefit of all the peoples of the middle east quite how this imagined loss of control this demotion from hegemon to the status of ordinary country this ending of the era of american exceptionalism might affect the us itself is an intriguing question coming down in the world is a hard thing to stomach seventy years on britain has still not recovered from its loss of empire could america s self image cope with such a relegation could trump

this article was written by brandon smith and originally published at birch gold group gold has seen an impressive price spike in the past 18 months and if you are wondering what the cause is you ll find almost everyone has a different theory that said certain factors in historic gold rallies tend to be ignored for example the mainstream financial media often hyper focuses on stimulus measures by the federal reserve as the cause but i would remind people that the most recent upward trend in gold started while the fed was tightening liquidity and raising interest rates not stimulating also many analysts suggest that precious metals absorb investment cash flows when equities are sliding yet for now stocks have been rallying for the past year as gold prices also trend upward so what is the mainstream missing here first and foremost it s important to understand that gold is not necessarily just an inflation hedge it is also a crisis hedge as economic and geopolitical uncertainty grows gold prices skyrocket the past decade has seen uncertainty and instability that the world has not seen for almost a century the problem is the average american is oblivious to this state of affairs they have no idea how bad the situation can get as they assume there are checks and balances to counter any potential disaster in the financial structure they assume that the government or the banks will step in stack silver get gold hunter riley iii best price 13 44 buy new 1 99 as of 10 56 utc details however there are signals that tell us that this will not be the case in fact it appears that central banks around the world are preparing for an event that they either cannot quantify yet or simply refuse to warn the public about this is evident in the acceleration in gold stockpiling by banking institutions in 2018 foreign central banks bought levels of gold not seen since 2010 the past year of 2019 according to 3rd quarter figures shows that banks bought even more 12 more than in 2018 last year central banks purchased at least 550 tons of the barbaric relic and it looks like they don t plan to stop anytime soon leading buyers have included russia china and turkey with the former two being the leading buyers for several years now but central banks aren t just buying gold they are also demanding their gold storage be transferred away from offshore holdings and back to their own vaults germany repatriated 31 billion 583 tons in gold from paris and new york vaults turkey repatriated 220 tons from the federal reserve the netherlands repatriated 122 tons poland repatriated 100 tons of gold from vaults in england both hungary and romania have announced plans to get their gold holdings back and nationalists in italy have demanded that italy s gold reserves be released by banks and returned to public control the bottom line is there is a gold rush going on by central banks as well as governments and the public is being left utterly out of the loop as to why i would suggest that it s clear what is going on they know that a global crisis is about to happen and so they prepare as any smart investor would by buying the one commodity that always goes up when the manure hits the fan and most other assets go down but what is the nature of the crisis they are preparing for most likely a geopolitical conflagration followed by a monetary crisis with the u s dollar at the epicenter economic disasters do not generally happen in a vacuum there are always geopolitical threats that trigger the collapse of financial bubbles or the threats are engineered to coincide with the bubble collapse in order to obscure the true culprits behind it one way or another it would appear that central banks are privy to a looming calamity that will result in a threat to the current monetary order i suspect that this event will be preceded by a geopolitical conflict a smokescreen or scapegoat that will take the blame for the disaster while the central banks that created the mess in the first place escape scrutiny the growing rift between the u s and other major trading partners along with the increased danger of regional war with nations like iran are setting the stage for what i predict will end in the loss of the dollar s world reserve status some people might see this as a good thing but such a reset would leave the american economy in shambles for decades to come as our economy acclimates to losing the single thread that was holding our system together rebuilding the system without dependency on reserve status or centralization would be nice but that can only happen if the central bankers are removed from the equation and true free markets and price discovery are allowed to flourish as long as the banking elites remain in charge our economy will never be healthy and will never recover from a major crash or monetary crisis frankly they don t want us to recover anyway if central banks intended to save the current system then they would tell the public why they have been stockpiling gold and what the specific threat is that they are preparing for they would be encouraging the public to buy gold and silver as well and find some financial independence and security i am often asked why globalists and international banks would seek to deliberately hide or instigate a global economic crash wouldn t this threaten their base of power the golden goose that they use to exploit vast amounts of capital and entire political systems my answer is simple but historically correct the banking elites need crisis to consolidate power they don t lose power or financial influence during a fiscal panic they gain power and influence with each passing financial demolition the public loses more and more hard assets these assets are gobbled up and devoured by financial institutions not because they have much use for all that private property but because they don t want you to have private property that is to say the banks are machines designed to slowly or sometimes quickly siphon private property away from the public until private property is a memory once private property is gone public survival depends on the charity of the state and its corporate partners without property dependency metastasizes like a cancer gold rush 2020 why th phil taylor guck best price 14 57 buy new 12 99 as of 09 53 utc details property is protected by hedging capital into defensive commodities as well as by organized defiance of theft during any major crisis there is always a window of time in which precious metals can be used to secure hard necessities while countering the loss of buying power common during inflation or stagflation the longer you can remain solvent during crisis the more influence you will have over the course of events the more dependent or desperate you are during a crisis the less use you will be to anyone the levels of central bank gold buying have increased so rapidly in the past two years this suggests to me that whatever they are preparing for is about to occur very soon with consumer and corporate debt at all time highs the recent liquidity crisis and repo market loan response from the fed along with the highly volatile tensions between the u s and iran i seriously doubt we will make through 2020 without a shock to the system certain central banks have been positioned to benefit others like the fed are decidedly unprepared as there is not much concrete proof that our own gold reserves exist looking at the bigger picture the shift in gold holdings around the world shows us where the global elites plan to stash their cash while the u s takes a nosedive these will be the regions most immune to a monetary wildfire while price fluctuations are always rampant in times like this as i noted in july of last year the overall trend for precious metals will be up from here on and unless you suddenly see central banks start dumping their gold reserves instead of buying hand over fist then i suggest readers copy their strategy and get a stack of physical gold as well reprinted with permission from alt market com the best of brandon smith
while it s fitting for the president of the nation s largest union federation to denounce a right wing coup against a leftist foreign leader which was endorsed by the state department and cia it also represents an important break from precedent for the afl cio though rarely discussed the federation has a long record of supporting the us government in disrupting leftist movements around the world including through coups d état in latin america two days after bolivia s socialist president evo morales was forced from office in a right wing military coup last november afl cio president richard trumka condemned the coup on twitter and praised morales for reducing poverty and championing indigenous rights in doing so trumka joined bernie sanders ilhan omar alexandria ocasio cortez and other prominent figures of the left in countering the us political and media establishments dominant narrative that morales s violent ouster was a win for democracy throughout the cold war the afl cio s executive council and international affairs department were run by zealous anticommunists determined to undercut the rise of left wing trade unions overseas like their counterparts in the us government george meany afl cio president from 1955 1979 and lane kirkland his successor who served until 1995 understood that if allowed to thrive class conscious labor movements would pose a serious threat to global capital meany kirkland and other afl cio officials subscribed to a philosophy of business unionism meaning they had no desire to topple capitalism but instead promoted the idea that class collaboration and limited workplace bargaining over bread and butter issues would bring workers all the prosperity they needed they championed economic nationalism over transnational labor solidarity reasoning that us workers would see higher wages and lower unemployment as long as us corporations had easy access to foreign markets to sell products made in the united states a version of the kind of nationalist ideology that has fueled racism and xenophobia among segments of the us working class and aided trump s rise to power from aiding us backed military coups in brazil and chile to cheerleading ruthless counterinsurgency wars in vietnam and el salvador the afl cio s foreign policy during the cold war was fundamentally geared toward the interests of us empire by the 1970s just as capital launched a renewed decades long attack on workers rights around the globe the us labor federation had lost whatever credibility it might have had as a vehicle for international working class liberation derided by anti imperialists at home and abroad as the afl cia as we enter a new decade the prospects for a rejuvenated us labor movement are strong a new generation of exploited workers are eager to unionize the number of workers on strike just hit a thirty year high the rapidly growing democratic socialists of america is aiming to pull unions leftward through the rank and file strategy longtime labor ally bernie sanders has plans to double union membership if elected president and militant labor leaders like sara nelson who could be the afl cio s next president are rising in prominence it s a good time then for both labor activists and left labor leaders to reckon with the history of us labor imperialism a history largely unknown to younger labor activists and leftists who came of age in the early twenty first century wrestling with that history can help ensure that a resurgent us labor movement plays a positive and effective role in building global worker solidarity rather than one that props up an imperialist order that hurts the working class both within the united states and around the world why labor imperialism though decades of corporate propaganda have tried to tell us otherwise there is power in a union not only the power to raise wages or win paid time off but the power to overthrow governments and bring national economies to a screeching halt during the cold war the us government understood this very well to us officials determined to preserve and expand international capitalism in the face of an increasingly influential global left trade unions around the world posed a serious threat unions abroad therefore became a crucial target of us imperial intervention rather than allow them to mount an effective challenge to capital by radicalizing workers and fueling leftist political movements unions would need to be turned into instruments for containing the revolutionary potential of the working class in the process organized labor s most powerful weapon the strike would be co opted and used to pursue reactionary goals namely to undermine leftist governments to subvert overseas unions for their own imperial ends the state department and cia found an enthusiastic ally in the afl cio the cold war largely coincided with the period when the us labor movement was at its strongest more us workers were unionized in the 1950s and 1960s than at any other time in history giving labor leaders like meany considerable political clout as anticommunists afl cio officials chose to use this power to assist the us government in undermining leftist influence in foreign trade unions in practice this meant interfering in the internal processes of other countries trade unions stoking internecine rivalries creating and financially propping up splinter labor organizations grooming cadres of conservative business unionists and using the power of the strike to sabotage progressive governments after decades of such imperial interventions organized labor across the world was left divided and weakened making it easier for transnational capital to exploit workers in the era of neoliberalism the afl s early cold war thanks to the left s steadfast resistance to fascism the communist parties of western europe won widespread popular support during world war ii especially among the working class by the end of the war labor federations like france s confédération générale du travail cgt and italy s confederazione generale italiana del lavoro cgil were led or heavily influenced by communists in 1945 the labor movements of the allied nations including britain the soviet union and the united states formed the world federation of trade unions wftu a sort of united nations for labor at this time the afl and the cio were still separate competing entities established in 1886 the politically conservative afl included unions of skilled craft workers while the cio founded in 1935 as a breakaway organization from the afl represented workers in mass industries like auto and steel the newer and more progressive cio which owed its growth to the work of communist and other leftist organizers readily joined the wftu but the larger and staunchly anticommunist afl refused to have anything to do with the new global organization because it included unions from the ussr afl leaders like meany argued that leftists particularly communists were inherently totalitarians and that any unions they led were illegitimate as representatives of workers he and the afl s other anticommunist internationalists contended that only democratic or free trade unions that is pro capitalist business unions had any claim to legitimacy the irony of free trade unionists was that they frequently trampled on union democracy and autonomy while claiming to champion these very principles whenever communists or other leftists attained leadership positions in foreign unions through democratic methods and with rank and file support outsiders from the afl would jump in to make sure their own handpicked anticommunist unionists would have the resources to mount a robust disruptive opposition in 1944 before the cold war battle lines had even been drawn the afl established the free trade union committee ftuc with the goal of undermining communist led unions in western europe tapped to run the ftuc was jay lovestone who had once been a leader of the communist party usa but was expelled in 1929 because stalin believed he was too close to his politburo rival nikolai bukharin lovestone made his way into the labor movement in the 1930s through the international ladies garment workers union eager for revenge against his ex comrades he then went to work for the uaw s anticommunist president homer martin using his intimate knowledge of the party to help martin red bait and oust his intra union opponents this experience made him the perfect choice to run the ftuc as ftuc director lovestone sent his associate irving brown to be his point man in europe from an office in paris brown set about dividing the international labor movement by loudly accusing the wftu of being a soviet dominated organization he particularly worked to split the french cgt by backing its internal noncommunist faction force ouvrière while force ouvrière started as a small cgt caucus willing to coexist with communists brown helped transform it into a separate anticommunist labor organization in direct competition with the cgt propped up more by us funds than popular support by 1947 48 the us government caught up with the afl on the cold war creating the cia and launching the marshall plan to ensure the containment of communism by reconstructing western europe s war shattered economy within a capitalist framework recognizing the labor movement as a crucial cold war battleground the cia was drawn to lovestone s ftuc in 1949 the agency agreed to finance the ftuc s efforts to subvert communist unions abroad in exchange for intelligence on foreign labor organizations afl leaders meany david dubinsky and matthew woll were in on the new partnership as were lovestone and brown but other afl officials and rank and file us unionists were kept in the dark and knew little of what the ftuc was up to that us union leaders forged a secret alliance with the cia to undemocratically divide unions overseas may justifiably be difficult to understand but afl leaders and the cia shared the belief that left oriented unions were literally capable of bringing about proletarian revolution to prevent this from happening the cia needed the expertise of the afl since the afl s pro capitalist anticommunist officials were already working to undermine leftist labor movements before the cia was even established they didn t need any convincing now flush with cia money in the early 1950s brown was reputed to carry around suitcases full of cash buying the loyalty of union officials in france italy west germany and elsewhere wherever communist unions were strong anticommunist splinter unions were created and financially backed by the ftuc cia the afl similarly partnered with the state department which developed a corps of labor attachés and stationed them at us embassies abroad often plucked from the ranks of afl unions and vetted by lovestone the state department s labor attachés used their diplomatic leverage to isolate and discredit europe s communist led unions lovestone also dispatched ftuc operatives to asia after the 1949 communist revolution in china ftuc representative willard etter set up shop in formosa taiwan with resources provided by the cia etter supported the free china labor league which served as a front for espionage and sabotage activities teams of anticommunist chinese agents secretly traveled from formosa to mainland china where they not only reported intelligence back to etter via radio transmitters but also blew up fuel supplies causing substantial civilian casualties and attempted to stir up worker unrest in state owned factories through the ftuc s china operation then the afl became complicit in cia sponsored terrorist activities straying far from its basic purpose of empowering workers most of etter s agents were captured and executed by the chinese government after the cia lost interest and abandoned them once the korean war started the relationship between the afl and cia was fraught lovestone chafed at the agency s bureaucracy and oversight continuously demanding greater independence for his ftuc for their part some in the cia s top ranks typically ivy league educated wasps looked scornfully at their afl contacts who were mostly jews and irish catholics with immigrant and working class upbringings the feeling was mutual with lovestone frequently ridiculing his cia partners as fizz kids in letters to brown such acrimony though was a trivial byproduct of the unsavory partnership between the nominal voice of the us working class and the us imperial state despite the interpersonal tensions the ftuc cia alliance in western europe achieved its main goal of splitting the wftu in 1949 increasingly pressured by cold war geopolitics the cio and british trades union congress disaffiliated from the wftu early that year the break came down to disagreements over the marshall plan which the communist led unions opposed on grounds that it constituted an attempt to undermine their influence and reconsolidate the international capitalist system with the united states at its center 1949 was also the year that the us labor movement fell victim to the same divisions the afl had been sowing abroad wanting to stay in the government s good graces cio leaders took a decidedly rightward turn that year purging communist organizers from their ranks and chasing out their left led affiliate unions the result was devastating the cio which had previously been at the center of a multiracial working class movement for social and economic justice was rendered a shell of its former self without its dedicated leftist organizers facing obsolescence the cio was absorbed into the larger more conservative afl in 1955 and the us labor movement began its decades long decline in december 1949 the cio and british trades union congress joined the afl and other anticommunist national labor centers to found the international confederation of free trade unions icftu which presented itself as the free world s alternative to the wftu thanks to the machinations of the afl cia and state department the international labor movement was now divided into two hostile camps with us labor leaders more fixated on fighting the left than fighting capital targeting the third world following the reconstruction of western europe us labor leaders and their allies in the us government increasingly turned their attention to the developing countries of the global south or what was then called the third world in the western hemisphere lovestone had a minimal presence instead the afl s inter american representative was italian émigré and former socialist serafino romualdi forced to flee italy for opposing mussolini romualdi settled in new york like lovestone he found his way into the labor movement through david dubinsky s international ladies garment workers union in the 1930s working for the union s news service during world war ii romualdi toured latin america on behalf of nelson rockefeller s office of the coordinator of inter american affairs before briefly returning to italy as an operative with the office of strategic services the precursor to the cia where he attempted to sideline communist influence in the cgil in 1946 romualdi became the afl s chief representative in latin america and the caribbean much as irving brown worked to divide the wftu romualdi s mission was to weaken the left led confederación de trabajadores de américa latina ctal which had been founded by mexican labor leader vicente lombardo toledano in 1938 to unite latin america s class conscious trade unions the ctal served as an authentic voice for pan american labor led by latin american unionists and free from us imperial dominance like the wftu with which it was affiliated it brought communists and noncommunists together around the common purpose of improving the lot of workers romualdi and the afl sought to undermine the ctal and replace it with a us led inter american labor confederation ensuring the latin american working class would not become a strong independent force capable of challenging north american control with the support of latin america s social democratic parties and the state department s labor attachés romualdi succeeded in convincing many latin american worker organizations to break from the ctal bringing the region s anticommunist unions together in 1948 with the establishment of the confederación interamericana de trabajadores three years later it was reconstituted as the organización regional inter americana de trabajadores orit to serve as the icftu s regional arm in the western hemisphere under romualdi s influence orit would battle leftist peronist and catholic trade unions across the region throughout the 1950s with the result that the latin american working class remained fractured in the aftermath of the 1959 cuban revolution meany like his allies in the us foreign policy establishment quickly made latin america his new priority for containment unfortunately for him the ftuc had recently been shuttered at the insistence of uaw president walter reuther after reuther s cio merged with the afl though an anticommunist in his own right reuther believed there could be peaceful coexistence between east and west and didn t wish to escalate tensions with the soviet union despising lovestone for his divisive tactics in the uaw years earlier reuther wanted the afl cio to conduct its foreign policy through the multilateral icftu and not lovestone s ftuc although the icftu was formed at the urging of the afl during the 1950s meany had become disenchanted with the european unionists who ran it believing they were not belligerent enough in their anticommunism hoping to refocus labor s cold war in latin america after the cuban revolution but not willing to rely on the icftu meany wanted a new unilateral organization in the mold of the now defunct ftuc he would get it with the creation of the american institute for free labor development aifld usually pronounced a field aifld would become the afl cio s most significant instrument for waging the global cold war the idea for aifld was first proposed by communications workers of america president joseph beirne who held a seat on the afl cio executive council in 1959 beirne brought sixteen orit affiliated union officials from latin america to virginia for a training course on how to be an effective business unionist beirne sought to scale up this program and turn it into a permanent organization persuading meany to get behind the plan meany then convinced the incoming kennedy administration that the proposed organization aifld would serve as the perfect labor auxiliary to the alliance for progress a marshall plan type initiative to provide generous us aid to anticommunist latin american governments to prevent the outbreak of another cuba style revolution as it had in postwar europe us labor would once again willingly assist the us government in carrying out its cold war objectives in 1962 aifld went into operation almost exclusively funded by the us agency for international development usaid to the tune of several million dollars per year the institute quickly extended its presence into nearly every country in latin america coordinating its activities with the us foreign policy apparatus aifld s main activity was labor education particularly training participants on how to combat left wing influence in their respective unions trainees who were considered to have exceptional potential would be brought to a facility at front royal virginia for a three month residential course a kind of school of the americas for trade unionists before being sent back to their home countries with nine month stipends to fund their anti leftist organizing efforts the institute also used its usaid funds to carry out development projects across latin america including the construction of affordable worker housing for members of orit affiliated unions signaling to workers the benefits of joining the us sponsored free trade union movement though the aifld often overpromised on how quickly it would complete its housing developments and how many units would be available prospective residents were required to fill out long detailed questionnaires about their unions information possibly supplied to the cia to showcase the afl cio s commitment to class collaboration aifld invited us businessmen with interests in latin america to serve on its board of trustees including the heads of the anaconda company pan american airways and w r grace co among others these companies were no strangers to union busting which made the afl cio s eagerness to partner with them especially disturbing that they agreed to be part of aifld demonstrates how us capitalists saw no threat only opportunity in the kind of unionism the institute was encouraging romualdi directed the institute for its first three years until his retirement when he was replaced by william doherty jr doherty whose father had been both president of the national association of letter carriers and us ambassador to jamaica was an alleged friend to the cia and would serve as aifld s director for the next thirty years in the early 1960s aifld helped undermine the democratically elected leftist government of cheddi jagan in the tiny south american nation of guyana which was then a colony called british guiana the colony was on the path to a planned transition to independence and jagan hoped to reorganize the economy along socialist lines but the kennedy administration fearing jagan would be another fidel castro pressured the uk to stall the transition until he could be driven out of power in the summer of 1962 eight guyanese union officials from a labor federation tied to jagan s political opposition participated in aifld s training course in the united states returning home with stipends provided by the institute the following spring they helped lead a general strike to protest jagan s government the three month strike crippled the colony s economy and escalated into a race riot pitting the afro guyanese opposition against jagan s indo guyanese base representatives from two afl cio affiliated unions afscme and the retail clerks went to british guiana to aid the strikers by coordinating food relief and replenishing the strike fund using cia money secretly channeled through private foundations what turned out to be one of the longest general strikes in history was sustained by the us imperial state with help from us union officials in order to weaken a democratic progressive government elections were held a year later with british guiana still reeling from the strike again using secret cia funds a representative from the afl cio affiliated american newspaper guild traveled to the colony to saturate the electorate with anti jagan propaganda after the bitter divisions sowed by aifld the afl cio and cia jagan s people s progressive party was unable to win a majority of parliamentary seats losing the election the british then allowed the transition to independence to move forward the new leader forbes burnham soon revealed himself to be a corrupt autocrat remaining in power until his death twenty years later aifld also played an important role in the us backed military coup against brazil s left wing president joão goulart like their fellow travelers in the us government afl cio leaders believed goulart was too close to the brazilian communist party and needed to be replaced in 1963 aifld s training program hosted an all brazilian class of thirty three unionists their course included fifty hours worth of instruction on how to fight communist influence in their unions taught by lovestone and romualdi when the coup against goulart was executed on april 1 1964 the aifld graduates helped ensure it went smoothly while leftist unionists called for a general strike to disrupt the coup the institute trained union officials convinced their fellow workers to ignore these calls and allow the military takeover to proceed unobstructed the new military regime put allegedly communist led unions into trusteeships sending intervenors some of them aifld graduates to purge these unions of leftists and goulart sympathizers three months later doherty boasted in a radio interview that aifld s brazilian trainees became intimately involved in some of the clandestine operations of the coup many of the trade union leaders some of whom were actually trained in our institute were involved in the overthrow of the goulart regime he said doherty also defended a wage freeze that was imposed by the new government arguing the brazilian poor would need to suffer no less than the rich in the pursuit of national economic growth the coup regime turned into a nineteen year dictatorship imprisoning torturing and murdering untold numbers of trade unionists the state department and usaid were so pleased with aifld s work that they gladly accepted the afl cio s proposal to create similar institutes for africa and asia in late 1964 to early 1965 the african american labor center was established and in 1968 the asian american free labor institute was launched like aifld both of these nonprofits were almost entirely funded by usaid to carry out training and development programs in order to prop up anticommunist anti left unions in 1977 a fourth nonprofit the free trade union institute was created to focus on europe internal dissent at the 1965 afl cio convention in san francisco meany presented a resolution written by lovestone pledging the labor federation s unstinting support of president lyndon johnson s policy of escalating the vietnam war when the resolution was about to be voted on without discussion or debate a group of college students observing the proceedings from the balcony stood up and chanted get out of vietnam and debate meany responded by having them thrown out of the convention hall dismissing them as kookies the pro war resolution was then adopted unanimously a handful of independent unions union locals and mid ranking labor officials had already expressed skepticism about the war if not outright opposition after witnessing meany s hostility toward the anti war movement and his unwillingness to allow debate more union leaders particularly from the uaw began to openly voice their disagreements with the afl cio s foreign policy reuther president of the uaw tepidly opposed military escalation in vietnam wanting to see the war end through peaceful negotiations further he disliked meany s aggressive go it alone approach to international issues preferring to work through the icftu reuther also did not trust lovestone who by now was the director of the afl cio s international affairs department still he was reluctant to make his disagreements public not wanting to create a rift between the uaw and afl cio instead victor reuther walter s younger brother in charge of the uaw s foreign relations decided to speak up telling reporters in 1966 that lovestone and the afl cio were involved with the cia and criticizing aifld s role in the brazilian coup the following year a series of journalistic exposés helped substantiate victor s claim by revealing the cia s ties to the labor federation and its affiliates going back to the ftuc of course meany and the afl cio s other internationalists vigorously denied any relationship with the cia along with meany s hawkish stance on vietnam which included attempts to bolster south vietnam s anticommunist confédération vietnamienne du travail the cia revelations badly damaged the afl cio s credibility among liberals and members of the new left disagreements over foreign policy as well as several domestic issues finally led the uaw to disaffiliate from the federation in 1968 the union would return to the afl cio in 1981 despite these controversies meany lovestone and aifld did not alter course when the socialist salvador allende was elected president of chile in 1970 they decided to assist the nixon administration in destabilizing his government while the chilean working class was overwhelmingly behind allende aifld supported gremios associations of right wing middle class professionals along with the country s conservative union of maritime workers in 1972 at least twenty nine chileans attended the institute s training course in virginia far more than had ever attended in previous years with the help of aifld in 1972 and 1973 truck owners and merchants across chile staged a series of strikes aimed at creating economic chaos and subverting allende s government as in british guiana nine years earlier the strikers were supported with funds from the cia us efforts to undermine allende culminated in the violent military coup on september 11 1973 the new military dictatorship aifld helped bring to power by using traditional working class tactics like the strike would ironically and tragically trample workers rights jailing and murdering thousands of chilean labor activists after researchers like ruth needleman and fred hirsch helped expose the institute s role in the chilean coup by obtaining documents conducting interviews and circulating their findings rank and file union members across the united states began demanding more transparency around aifld in the mid 1970s several union locals and local labor councils called on the afl cio to fund its foreign programs independently instead of relying on usaid while these demands went ignored lovestone finally retired in 1974 with meany following suit five years later upon meany s retirement his longtime lieutenant lane kirkland became president of the afl cio like his predecessor kirkland was a hardline anticommunist groomed to be a diplomat at georgetown s school of foreign service he was a close personal friend of henry kissinger spending every thanksgiving with him under kirkland the afl cio applauded the reagan administration s aggressive foreign policy aimed at reigniting the cold war even as reagan ushered in a new era of union busting by firing 11 000 air traffic controllers in 1981 at the afl cio s urging reagan oversaw the creation of the national endowment for democracy ned in 1983 a government funded grant making foundation to disburse monies to the same kinds of overseas anticommunist organizations previously funded covertly by the cia with kirkland serving on ned s board of directors aifld and the afl cio s other foreign institutes became core grant recipients kirkland backed reagan s central america policy of arming repressive state security forces in el salvador and terroristic counterrevolutionaries in nicaragua aifld was especially active in el salvador in the 1980s playing a critical role in the development and implementation of an agrarian reform program meant to undercut rural support for the leftist revolutionary movement el salvador s counterinsurgency government entirely propped up by generous us military aid combined the agrarian reform with a state of siege that saw thousands of campesinos brutally murdered in a wave of massacres alarmed by kirkland s support for reagan s foreign policy rank and file us union members became active in the central american peace and solidarity movement demanding the afl cio change direction in one of the most significant developments for us labor internationalism since the start of the cold war the presidents of several national unions affiliated with the afl cio came together to form the national labor committee in support of democracy and human rights in el salvador nlc the nlc openly opposed kirkland and the executive council lobbying congress to cut off us military aid to the salvadoran government the nlc also sent delegations of us union members to el salvador and nicaragua to witness first hand how us assistance was helping rightists murder and intimidate central american workers the nlc would later evolve into an anti sweatshop organization helping expose the complicity of major clothing brands in worker rights abuses in central america the caribbean and asia while facing internal opposition to its central america program the afl cio gave financial and political support to solidarność the polish trade union led by lech wałęsa that eventually helped bring down poland s communist government opposed by foreign policy officials who feared stirring up hostilities with the soviet union the afl cio s foray into poland has since been touted by interventionists as a case study in the heroics of democracy promotion though kirkland claimed a victory for free trade unionism in poland by the 1990s the labor leaders associated with the nlc were convinced the federation badly needed to improve its overseas image what s more several union presidents on the afl cio s executive council believed the federation had become lethargic in the face of years of declining union density following the afl cio s failure to stop the passage of nafta a group of labor officials led by seiu president john sweeney gathered enough support to force kirkland to retire and take control of the federation in 1995 calling themselves the new voice slate sweeney and his allies aimed to revitalize the afl cio by organizing new workers and abandoning outdated anticommunist priorities under sweeney in 1997 aifld and the other foreign institutes were shut down and reorganized into a new ngo called the american center for international labor solidarity or solidarity center which continues to be the afl cio s operational arm in the global south centering solidarity active in over sixty countries the solidarity center does good work helping to improve safety standards in the bangladeshi garment industry amplifying workers voices at the international labor organization and bringing workers from the united state and the global south together to share stories and strategies but like its predecessor organizations the solidarity center is primarily bankrolled by the us government particularly usaid the state department and ned it is one of only four ned core grantees ned is known for meddling in the democratic processes of other countries and promoting regime change to maintain us global dominance including in venezuela haiti ukraine and multiple central american nations given the history of the ftuc and aifld the solidarity center s dependence on government funding and association with ned should be a cause for concern in the labor movement and merits closer inspection but there is virtually no discussion about it within the afl cio this is not especially surprising considering the federation has yet to formally acknowledge or apologize for the significant role it played during the cold war in dividing labor movements abroad undermining foreign democracies and endorsing militarism all of which only served to strengthen transnational capital and weaken the power of workers in 2004 the california labor federation passed the build unity and trust among workers worldwide resolution which called on the afl cio to clear the air by fully accounting for its record of hostile foreign interventions and renouncing its cia ties the resolution then headed to the national afl cio convention in chicago the following year where it was effectively killed in committee since then there has been no coordinated sustained attempt to confront the federation s imperialist history in 2006 the icftu merged with the traditionally more progressive world confederation of labour to form the brussels based international trade union confederation ituc of which the afl cio is an affiliate meanwhile the wftu now headquartered in greece continues to be led by communists as it has been since the 1949 split today s wftu routinely accuses the much larger ituc of being class collaborationist and pro imperialist while the ituc is far from being an explicitly radical organization it frequently levels strong criticisms of the world bank and imf has repeatedly condemned israel s occupation of palestine and wasted no time in denouncing not only the recent coup in bolivia but also juan guaidó s attempted coup in venezuela and the us assasination of qassem soleimani that the afl cio is a prominent member of such an organization is a positive sign given the history described here whether the trade unions of the world can ever be truly united remains to be seen but perhaps hope for transnational labor unity lies less in the politics of large bureaucracies like the ituc and wftu and more in the ability of workers to put class solidarity before national allegiance and to take action with our fellow workers whoever and wherever they may be for our collective liberation and in the context of a planetary ecological crisis our collective survival discovering the extent to which the afl cio is willing to use its resources and influence to encourage this kind of solidarity driven consciousness which would necessitate a thorough reckoning with its own ugly history of assisting us imperialism will be crucial in determining whether the federation serves any real purpose for the working class
by david eggert associated press lansing michigan gov gretchen whitmer and lawmakers received a generally positive economic and revenue forecast friday but tempered it by warning of budget pressures due to tax cuts a road funding deal and other factors economists adopted a consensus agreement that projects jobs to grow by 0 6 or 26 000 in 2020 a lower unemployment rate and personal income to rise by 3 7 1 8 after adjusting for inflation michigan s two main accounts the general fund and the school aid fund will grow 1 1 this fiscal year and 2 3 next fiscal year a combined 733 million more over the two years than was estimated in may we re seeing the economy continue to grow albeit at a modest pace it s still growing the revenues are looking pretty flat said state treasurer rachael eubanks it was not immediately clear how the new numbers may affect the potential for the democratic governor and republican controlled legislature to negotiate another mid year budget bill they agreed last month to 574 million in supplemental spending which included the restoration of some of the nearly 1 billion whitmer had vetoed as part of an impasse over the current 59 billion budget some bigger ticket programs such as the pure michigan tourism ads and the going pro campaign to help businesses recruit students into the trades and other high demand fields remain unfunded the good news is that there s a modest increase going forward but on the other hand we know that we have huge pressures on the general fund and increases to baseline service cost as well said budget director chris kolb he pointed to past business and personal tax cuts higher medicaid costs the ongoing phased in shift of general funds to road construction indigent defense spending michigan also must pick up more of the cost of the federal state children s health insurance program he said whitmer last year unsuccessfully called for a 45 cents a gallon fuel tax increase to help fix the roads and halt the eventual diversion of 600 million a year in general funds to the transportation budget freeing up money for education she will propose the 2020 21 budget in february senate appropriations committee chairman jim stamas a midland republican called friday s forecast great news because the economy is continuing to grow following the state s lengthy downturn more than a decade ago our current budget surplus is not a jackpot for new spending we expect to face new budget pressures in the coming fiscal year stamas said adding that legislators continue to talk with whitmer about the political budget vetoes she made more than three months ago this economic and fiscal forecast illustrates that we must remain diligent in how we use taxpayer dollars to meet our challenges and continue to build a brighter future for all michigan families he said rep jon hoadley the top democrat on the house appropriations committee took note that state tax revenue is projected to be 12 5 billion or 26 below a constitutional limit it is a rising gap that economists attribute partly to tax cuts but also to michigan not taxing services as the service economy has grown there s a wide swath of economic activity that is not being appropriately accounted for and taxed so there s some folks that we ve seen over the last decade who have really benefited from changes in the tax code while the rest of us working people have picked up the bill he said alluding to gop enacted business tax reductions now we see that exacerbated moving forward that s potentially then lost opportunity to tackle the big challenges that folks across michigan are asking us to fix

washington us job growth slowed more than expected in december but the pace of hiring likely remains sufficient to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track despite a deepening downturn in a manufacturing sector stung by trade disputes the labour department s closely watched monthly employment report on friday also showed the jobless rate holding near a 50 year low of 3 5 per cent a broader measure of unemployment dropped to a record low last month but wage gains ebbed the mixed report will probably not change the federal reserve s assessment that both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place there is nothing here that changes the picture of an economy that is continuing to expand at a pace that exceeds its potential growth rate said conrad dequadros senior economic advisor at brean capital in new york the fed should be very comfortable with this report non farm payrolls increased by 145 000 jobs last month with manufacturing shedding jobs after being boosted in november by the return to work of about 46 000 production workers at general motors after a strike the government s survey of establishments showed that was the smallest gain since may but milder than normal temperatures in december boosted hiring at construction sites and employment at retailers surged last month some of the slowdown in overall job growth in december is likely due to seasonal volatility associated with a later than normal thanksgiving day economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 164 000 jobs in december roughly 100 000 jobs per month are needed to keep up with growth in the working age population data for october and november was revised to show 14 000 fewer jobs added than previously reported the economy created 2 1 million jobs in 2019 down from 2 7 million in 2018 reports on housing trade and consumer spending have suggested that the economic expansion now in its 11th year is not in immediate danger of being derailed by a recession worries that a downturn might be triggered by the trump administration s trade war with china spurred the fed to cut interest rates three times in 2019 indeed economic growth did slow last year throttling back to 2 1pc in the third quarter from 2018 s brisk pace of nearly 3pc now though with a phase 1 deal with china set to be signed next week policymakers are more confident in the outlook and last month signalled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through this year economists are pegging growth at the end of last year around a 2 3pc rate tight labour market the labour market has continued to churn out jobs at a healthy clip despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages which economists had feared would significantly restrain hiring there are however concerns the labour department s bureau of labour statistics bls which compiles the employment data may not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of president donald trump s 18 month long trade war with china which has pushed manufacturing into recession and led to company closures the government last august estimated that the economy created 501 000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through march 2019 than previously reported the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade that suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170 000 per month instead of 210 000 the revised payrolls data will be published next month the projected massive revision has attracted the attention of some fed officials minutes of the us central bank s dec 10 11 policy meeting published last week showed a couple of officials viewed the anticipated downgrade as an indication that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year economists say downward revisions of that magnitude suggest that the model the government uses to calculate the net number of jobs from new business and closings is faulty some expect payrolls growth beyond last march could also be revised down for now the labour market is on solid footing with the unemployment rate declining by five tenths of a percentage point in 2019 there was little impact on the jobless rate from annual revisions to the seasonally adjusted household survey data going back five years which were incorporated in december s employment report a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell to 6 7pc in december the lowest since the series started in 1994 from 6 9pc the prior month the labour force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one was steady at 63 2pc last month the tight labour market however has struggled to generate strong wage inflation average hourly earnings rose three cents or 0 1pc last month after increasing 0 3pc in november that lowered the annual increase in wages to 2 9pc in december from 3 1pc in november manufacturing employment dropped by 12 000 jobs in december after jumping 58 000 in november as the gm strike ended the institute for supply management s measure of national factory activity dropped in december to its lowest level since june 2009 manufacturing added only 46 000 job in 2019 compared to 264 000 in 2018 hiring at construction sites increased by 20 000 jobs in december there were increases in leisure and hospitality professional and business services financial activities education and healthcare retail and wholesale trade employment last month but the transportation and warehousing industry lost 10 400 jobs and mining and logging shed 9 000 positions government employment rose by 6 000 jobs it is expected to accelerate in the coming months

cambridge responding to pressures from within and without the economics profession is gradually changing for the better not surprisingly the populist backlash sweeping advanced democracies in recent years has produced some soul searching in the discipline after all the austerity free trade deals financial liberalisation and labour market deregulation that caused it rested on the ideas of economists but the transformation extends beyond economic policy tenets within the discipline there is finally a reckoning with the hierarchical practices and aggressive seminar culture that have produced an inhospitable environment for women and minorities a 2019 survey carried out by the american economic association aea revealed that nearly half of female economists felt discriminated against or treated unfairly on account of their gender nearly a third of non white economists felt treated unfairly based on their racial or ethnic identity these failings may be related a profession that is less diverse and less open to different identities is more likely to exhibit groupthink and hubris if it is to generate ideas to help society achieve inclusive prosperity it will have to start by becoming more inclusive itself the new face of the discipline was on display when the aea convened for its annual meetings in san diego in early january there were plenty of panels of the usual type on topics such as monetary policy regulation and economic growth but there was an unmistakably different flavour to the proceedings this year the sessions that put their mark on the proceedings and attracted the greatest attention were those that pushed the profession in new directions there were more than a dozen sessions focusing on gender and diversity including the headline richard t ely lecture delivered by the university of chicago s marianne bertrand the aea meetings took place against the backdrop of the publication of anne case and angus deaton s remarkable and poignant book deaths of despair which was presented during a special panel case and deaton s research shows how a particular set of economic ideas privileging the free market along with an obsession with material indicators such as aggregate productivity and gdp have fuelled an epidemic of suicide drug overdose and alcoholism among america s working class capitalism is no longer delivering and economics is at the very least complicit a panel called economics for inclusive prosperity efip organised by a network of the same name which i co direct discussed several strands of new thinking taking over the discipline one is the need to expand economists focus from average levels of prosperity to distributive aspects and to non economic dimensions that are equally fundamental to wellbeing such as dignity autonomy health and political rights how economists talk about say trade agreements or deregulation may well change when they take such additional considerations seriously this will require new economic indicators one proposal that goes part of the way is for government agencies to produce distributional national income accounts as samuel bowles and wendy carlin argued in a paper presented in the same session every policy paradigm embeds a set of ethical values about what the good life entails along with a view of how the economy works neoliberalism presumes individualistic amoral individuals and a free market that delivers efficiency thanks to complete contracts and a relative paucity of market failures what we need according to bowles and carlin is a new paradigm that integrates egalitarian democratic and sustainability norms with a model of the economy as it really operates today this paradigm would place community alongside the state market dichotomy and would include policies such as wealth taxes broader access to insurance to reduce risk exposure workplace rights and voice corporate governance reform and substantial weakening of intellectual property rights speaking in the same session luigi zingales faulted economists for foisting their own preferences on the body politic this happens because economists tend to place greater value on certain outcomes such as efficiency than others such as income distribution and because they fall prey to groupthink and fetishise particular economic models over others part of the solution is to value diversity and exhibit greater modesty another part according to zingales is to pay more attention to research in other social sciences including history sociology and political science the implication of all these perspectives is that economics must be open to institutional alternatives and to institutional experimentation fostering such thinking is one of the major aims of the efip network the institutional basis of a market economy is largely indeterminate we can stick with institutional arrangements that sustain privilege and restrict opportunity or we can devise institutions that in the words of bowles and carlin are consistent with the pursuit of not only shared affluence but also an expanded concept of freedom empirical methods especially of causal inference will help and they have become much more central to the profession in recent decades this is a very good thing insofar as real world evidence with all of its necessary messiness displaces ideology but the focus on evidence also risks creating its own blind spots evidence about what does and does not work can be obtained only from actual experience we necessarily lack data on alternative institutional arrangements that are distant from our current reality the challenge for economists is to remain true to their empiricism without crowding out the imagination needed to envisage the inclusive and freedom enhancing institutions of the future dani rodrik professor of international political economy at harvard university s john f kennedy school of government is the author of straight talk on trade ideas for a sane

washington ap u s employers added 145 000 jobs in december and the unemployment rate held steady at 3 5 signaling that the job market remains strong at the start of 2020 even if hiring and wage gains have slowed somewhat more than a decade into an economic expansion friday s snapshot from the labor department showed hiring slipped from robust gains of 256 000 in november which were given a boost by the end of a strike at general motors for the year employers added an average of roughly 175 000 jobs per month compared with about 223 250 per month in 2018 annual wage growth fell in december to 2 9 down from an annualized average of 3 3 a year earlier a possible sign that some slack remains in the labor market and that unemployment could fall even further from its current half century low the picture of a slowly but steadily improving economy plus low inflation likely gives the federal reserve comfort in keeping interest rates low which has been a boon to stock markets the dow jones industrial average was largely unchanged in friday morning trading but it briefly reached the record level of 29 000 we re starting 2020 in very good shape said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial services we should see continued economic expansion throughout 2020 driven by consumers the state of the job market has become a pivotal division between president donald trump and his democratic challengers trump can campaign on the low unemployment rate and job growth as he seeks a second term democrats seeking to oust him will point to wages that have not taken off in a meaningful for many americans coping with highs costs for medical care and higher education this is the last jobs report before the iowa caucus in february that will serve as a first step for choosing the democratic presidential nominee the prospect of a stable job market a pick up in global growth supportive central banks an easing of trade tensions and u s economic growth of around 2 should be a positive for this year we really have the wind at our backs going into 2020 said julia pollak a labor economist at the employment marketplace ziprecruiter yet job growth has failed so far to translate into substantially better hourly pay the pace of annual average wage growth slowed in december to 2 9 from 3 3 a year ago a possible sign that there is still room for additional job gains despite the decade plus expansion that has reduced the number of unemployed americans there is also the potential that wages jumped in january as many states adjusted their minimum wages some businesses in competitive industries are already taking steps to prepare for wage competition this year the big blue swim school based in chicago vies with day cares learning centers and gyms for its instructors the chain has five sites employing on average 30 people and plans to open five more schools this year and 17 in 2021 but it had to dramatically boost wages in order to attract staff for that expansion we gave all of our front line employees a 10 or 11 raise because of the fear we have about the wage pressures in the economy said ceo chris kenny we can t meet our business goal without great staff the u s economy added 2 1 million jobs last year down from gains of nearly 2 7 million in 2018 hiring may have slowed because the number of unemployed people seeking work has fallen by 540 000 people over the past year to 5 75 million with fewer unemployed people hunting for jobs there is a potential limit on job gains the steady hiring growth during the expansion has contributed to gains in consumer spending retail sales during the crucial holiday shopping improved 3 4 compared to the prior year according to mastercard spendingpulse this likely contributed to a surge of hiring in retail as that sector added 41 200 jobs in december the leisure and hospitality sector which includes restaurants and hotels added another 40 000 jobs health care and social assistance accounted 33 900 new jobs still the report suggests a lingering weakness in manufacturing factories shed 12 000 jobs in december after the end of the gm strike produced gains of 58 000 in november manufacturing companies added just 46 000 jobs in all of 2019 manufacturing struggled last year because of trade tensions between the united states and china coupled with slower global economic growth safety problems at boeing have also hurt orders for aircraft and parts

cost yet one place where the dollar is not accepted is in the tiny czech town of jachymov which is ironic because it was here tucked deep into the wooded folds of bohemia s krušné hory mountains where the dollar originated 500 years ago in january 1520 but as i pulled a george washington one dollar bill from my wallet in jáchymov s 16th century royal mint house museum the very spot where the dollar s earliest ancestors were coined docent jan francovič smiled and stopped me i haven t seen one of these in a long time he said calling over two colleagues in jáchymov we only accept koruna euros or sometimes russian rubles you re the first american to come here in more than three years welcome to jáchymov a sleepy 2 700 person town near the czech german border that s both the home of the dollar and the home of no dollars chances are you ve never heard of the place you probably didn t know that it was just named one of unesco s newest world heritage sites and you likely never realised that the currency that powers the free world originated in this one road town still reeling from the collapse of communism that has more brothels than banks in fact you could spend a day walking up and down jáchymov s main drag past its abandoned gothic and renaissance buildings that tumble down the hill around its opulent cluster of day spas at the base of the valley and up to its 16th century castle and never realise it was the birthplace of the dollar how could you there are no signs advertising it anywhere most people living here don t even know said michal urban director of the non profit development mountain region krušné hory erzgebirge and one of the authors of the region s unesco nomination as he led me down a dark staircase and into the mint s vaulted basement where the coins were assayed no other mining town in the world has had such a big influence as jáchymov but we ve forgotten our history long before jáchymov existed the rolling mountains separating modern day bohemia and saxony were ruled by wolves and bears who roamed its virgin forests when vast quantities of silver were discovered in 1516 enterprising local nobleman count hieronymus schlick christened the area joachimsthal joachim s valley after jesus grandfather the local patron saint of miners at the time europe was a continent of city states with local rulers vying for power explained local historian jaroslav ochec with no standard monetary unit among them one of the most effective ways rulers could assert their control was to mint their own currency and that s what schlick did the governing bohemian diet officially granted schlick permission to mint his silver coins on 9 january 1520 the count stamped an image of joachim on the front the bohemian lion on the back and named his new currency joachimsthalers which soon became shortened to thalers in an age when the metal content of coins was the sole determinant of value schlick did two smart things to ensure the thalers spread and survival first he made the thaler the same weight and diameter as the 29 2g guldengroschen coin used throughout much of central europe which made it easier for neighbouring kingdoms to accept it more importantly he minted more coins than the world had ever seen in just 10 years joachimsthal transformed from a 1 050 person hamlet to the largest mining centre in europe a bustling 18 000 person hub with 1 000 silver mines employing 8 000 miners by 1533 joachimsthal was the second largest city in bohemia after prague and by the mid 16th century urban estimated that some 12 million thalers minted from these mountains had spread across europe far more than any other currency on the continent joachimsthal s silver deposits soon ran dry but by 1566 the thaler was so well known across europe that when the holy roman empire sought to establish a standard size and silver content for the many local currencies in its kingdom it chose the thaler calling all acceptable silver coins reichsthalers thalers of the empire for the next 300 years many countries around the world modelled their money after the thaler urban said staring across jáchymov s rusted metal roofs towards the hulking white shaft of europe s oldest continuously operated mine and the schlick castle which both still loom over the town soon the thaler started to live a life of its own far from here as rulers across europe began remodelling their coins after the thaler they also renamed them in their own languages in denmark norway and sweden the thaler became known as the daler in iceland it was the dalur italy had the tallero not to be confused with the talar poland the tàliro greece or the tallér hungary in france it was jocandale and before long there were some 1 500 imitations circulating among the tiny tightly packed statelets of the holy roman empire writes jason goodwin in his book greenback the almighty dollar and the invention of america the thaler soon spread to africa where it was used in ethiopia kenya mozambique and tanzania as late as the 1940s and across much of the arab peninsula and into india where it was still in circulation through the 20th century the official currency of slovenia was the tolar until 2007 the money in samoa is still called tālā and the currencies in romania leu bulgaria lev and moldovia leu today all take their names from the lion stamped on the first thaler 500 years ago but it was the dutch leeuwendaler lion dollar or daler for short pronounced nearly identically to the english dollar that gave the us currency its name after first arriving in new amsterdam in the 17th century with dutch colonists the dalers quickly spread throughout the thirteen colonies and english speaking settlers began calling them and all similarly weighted silver coins including the widely used spanish real de a ocho piece of eight coin dollars the dollar became the us official currency in 1792 and ever since the thaler inspired dollar has continued its march across the globe to places like australia namibia singapore and fiji yet as urban and ochec led me out of the mint and past a barbed wire fence holding a military lookout tower on a nearby hillside i learned that the mines of jáchymov also have a much darker claim to fame when the town s shiny silver deposits dwindled miners began to encounter a mysterious pitch black substance that led to an alarmingly high incidence of fatal lung diseases they called the uraninite mineral pechblende pech means bad luck in german while sifting through the town s mines in 1898 a physicist named marie curie identified that the same ore that had produced the first dollars contained two new radioactive elements radium and polonium the discovery disfigured curie s hands eventually killed her and led her to become the first woman to win a nobel prize but it also set the stage for the town s unlikely second act the same mines that coined the world s currency would now power the nuclear arms race for the next several decades the town s reopened silver mines became the world s foremost source of radium the nazis experimented with a nuclear reactor here the father of the atomic bomb j robert oppenheimer wrote his thesis on joachimsthal s uranium rich shafts and after czechoslovakia reclaimed joachimsthal from germany after world war ii renaming it jáchymov and expelling the german speaking population that had lived here for centuries with czech settlers the government signed a secret treaty with stalin that turned the town into a russian gulag this began a very doomed period of our history said urban crunching through the woods along the newly opened 8 5km jáchymov hell trail that traces the valley s development from silver mining hub to soviet concentration camp before the war the people who lived here were very proud of creating the dollar but when the population changed this memory was lost and the mines became exploited to help russia create the a bomb after oppenheimer s atomic bomb effectively ended world war two some 50 000 soviet political prisoners were sent to jáchymov between 1949 and 1964 to dig crush and load uranium to fuel the ussr s atomic arsenal in fact arguably the two most potent symbols of power in the modern world the dollar and nuclear weapons come from this quaint mining town in the bohemian hills today jáchymov is still grappling with its tumultuous past the vast slagheaps that once scarred the valley are starting to be swallowed by evergreen trees the rows of boarded up 19th century homes built with toxic levels of uranium residue are slowly being gutted and restored to their former glory and jáchymov s last operational mine svornost which supplied silver for the very first dollars now pumps radioactive water to a trio of eerie lavish resorts advertising radon water therapy there are still no signs anywhere in jáchymov stating its rightful claim as the birthplace of the dollar but if you head inside the town

why doesn t the u s respect the decision made by the iraqi parliament and move out of iraqi territory the short answer is because the us doesn t respect anybody s any country s decision or sovereignty as long as it doesn t meet their objectives now the us is steadfast and will not leave the region already president assad has requested that the us leave syrian territory they didn t the stakes are too immense for the us it has all to do with their move towards world hegemony by territory and by finance meaning by the us dollar the conflict with iran is not over by any means we are just experiencing a respite for regrouping and subsequently continuing and escalating the conflict us bases in iraq and military presence at present more than 5 000 troops are the most convenient means of force against iran other than controlling the rich and highly strategic territory of the middle east as an important step towards world hegemony the us continuous presence in the region also has to do with profits for the war industry and with the price and control of hydrocarbons especially gas we have seen soon after the cowardly murder of general qassem suleimani the share values of the war industry jump up of course in anticipation of a hot war and huge weapons sales the war industry profits insanely from killing wars and conflicts are increasingly what drives the western economies already in the us the war industry and related industries and services make up for about half of the country s gdp the us economy without war is unthinkable therefore the middle east is a perfect eternal battle ground a sine qua non for the west war is addictive the western economy is already addicted to it but most people haven t realized that yet revolving and renewed conflicts and wars is a must imagine if the us were to leave the middle east peace might break out this is not admissible soon your job may depend on war if you live in the west then there is the iranian gas daily 20 to 25 of all the energy consumed to drive the world s economy including wars transits through the golf of hormuz which is controlled by iran immediately after the heinous murder on general suleimani the oil and gas prices spiked by about 4 later declining again this in anticipation of a major conflict which could have iran reduce her gas production or block the passage of hormuz in either case a collapse of the world economy could not be excluded as a parenthesis it is so absolutely necessary that the world frees itself from this nefarious source of energy hydrocarbons and converts to other cheaper cleaner and freer sources of power to drive our industries and activities like solar energy of which mother earth receives every day more than 10 000 times what it needs for all her industrial and creative activities on every continent the us with a flailing multi trillion fracking industry which just failed the european market due russian gas via nord stream2 and just inaugurated turkstream would like to control the price of hydrocarbon so as to revive the highly indebted fracking industry what better way than to control iran and her enormous reserves of gas shared with qatar then there is the close alliance between iran and china china being iran s largest customer of gas china is perceived by washington as a deadly competitor and barring her from the energy that makes china s economy thrive is one of those devilish objectives of the united states they are unable to compete on an even playing field cheating lying and manipulating has become part of their and the western life style it is deeply ingrained in western history and culture of course there are other ways of supplying china with the hydrocarbons she needs russia with the world s largest gas reserves could easily increase her supplies in brief the us is unlikely to leave the middle east although some generals and even some high ranking pentagon brass believe this would be the smartest thing to do they see the light and the light is not war but peace what could iraq do to get the us out of iraq and eventually out of the region after all the iraqi parliament has taken a majority decision to regain iraq s sovereignty and autonomy without foreign troops most countries with troops stationed in iraq respect that decision denmark australia poland and germany are preparing to move their troops out of iraq only the uk with her 800 military men and women decided for now to stay alongside the us iraq may want to strengthened her alliance with russia and china hereby increasing the pressure on the us to honor iraq s sovereign request for the us to leave how much that would take to materialize if at all is a difficult question to answer maybe never except if the us dollar hegemony over western economies can be broken and at the moment a strong down turn of the dollar s role in the world economy is showing as the western world is increasingly seeking ways to de dollarize her economy and to associate with the east led by china and russia where de dollarization is advancing rapidly when that happens chances are that the us of a s dictates over the nations of the world will be mute will not be listened to anymore and that washington will have to rethink its future and very likely a us presence in the middle east will be history
spread this news by hoitsimolimo mutlokwa 2020 marks 19 years of the zimbabwean government declaring that it is under sanctions and subsequent political and economic isolation whilst at the same time the government also argues that these conditions should be removed by the us and the eu the main sources of the sanctions there are two main narratives about sanctions in zimbabwe the first narrative comes from the zimbabwean government that sanctions come about as a result of frustrated correctional land redistribution the second narrative comes from the west that there are no sanctions on zimbabwe but targeted travel restrictions on specific individuals and companies who impede on democracy human rights and the rule of law this article does not aim to take any particular side within these narratives but will demonstrate that a rational approach is imperative in dealing with sanctions with use of political reforms the unpleasant journey of sanctions in zimbabwe in 1999 the zimbabwean government through a constitutional referendum attempted to introduce a new constitution which would technically mean expropriating certain commercial farming land without giving any compensation to the aggrieved former holders the proposed new constitution was rejected by the majority of zimbabweans who took part in the referendum bowing down to the pressure of angry ex freedom fighter veterans the then president mugabe gave the go ahead for commercial farming land to be invaded by land hungry peasants instigated by these ex freedom fighter veterans in what was known as the fast track land reform program ftlrp subsequently a spark of bad relations was ignited between zimbabwe the eu and the usa the farm invasions resulted in human rights abuses and beatings and to some extent the murder of white farmers as well as political intimidation murder and disappearances of opposition political supporters on 21 december 2001 us president george w bush signed the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act of 2001 zidera into law imposing economic sanctions on zimbabwe it would also mean that zimbabwe would not be able take part in programmes such as the international monetary fund program imf zidera imposed a travel ban on a list of individuals considered to be high profile and linked to the ruling parties human rights atrocities subsequently in the following year on 18 february 2002 the eu followed suit through passing the common council position 2002 145 cfsp as well as other subsequent directives concerning restrictive measures against individual zimbabweans predominantly from the political ruling elite because of violence and intimidation of political opponents and harassment of the independent media by government and the ruling party as a result in terms of articles 3 and 4 of common council position 2002 145 cfsp restrictive travel measures were put on top government officials and ruling party elite in zimbabwe by barring them on entering any eu territory in the eight years into the land reform exercise zimbabwe went on a downward spiral recording one of the highest inflation rates in the world and becoming a leading recipient of humanitarian aid with minimal farming activities taking place to secure the nation s food security reduced production in expropriated commercial farming land was mainly as a result of a lack of financial support given to the ftlrp beneficiaries to purchase inputs and machinery most farms got vandalized and some run down furthermore zimbabwe had no option but to abandon its zimbabwean dollar currency in the 2008 elections the opposition party withdrew its candidature in the election re run they were citing political violence and intimidation of opposition supporters in most of the rural villages and smaller towns the main political parties agreed to a government of national unity and this saw zimbabwe getting a new constitution of 2013 act 20 in zimbabwe amongst other provisions explicitly made clear that civil liberties and socio economic rights are part and parcel of the bill rights for instance as seen in sections 14 2 the state must at all times ensure that appropriate employment opportunities are in place for all zimbabweans especially the youth 15 b which states that the state must secure the proper establishment of food the government of national unity ended in 2013 and new elections had to occur which the ruling party zanu pf got a majority of votes relations with the international community went to a further downward spiral more expropriation of commercial farms continued and the government now targeted the foreign owned companies through indigenisation economic and empowerment act 14 33 of 2007 ieee this resulted in compulsory ceding of 51 per cent ownership to local zimbabwean citizens of all foreign owned companies despite repeated calls from experts that this would bring massive company closures and thus more job losses and less revenue in taxes for the government although ieee was repealed when economic damage was already done just after the november 2017 coup certain mining activities such as gold diamonds and platinum are still under a compulsory 51 per cent indigenous ownership in 2016 in the case of johannes tomana and others v council of the european union and european commission the government of zimbabwe through its attorney general lost an application in the european court of justice challenging the travel ban into any eu territory of 109 zimbabwean high profile individuals composed of high ranking civil servants top police commissioners and top army generals as well as 11 companies in zimbabwe the government of zimbabwe was challenging articles 3 and 4 of common council position 2002 145 cfsp restrictive travel measures this directive had been adopted in terms of article 15 of the eu now article 29 of the teu because of serious concerns raised on freedom of opinion freedom of association and freedom of peaceful assembly of zimbabwean citizens further common council position 2002 145 cfsp was amended with common council position 2004 161 cfsp of 19 february 2004 which renewed restrictive measures against zimbabwe s list of government and ruling party elites barred from travelling into eu territory council regulation ec no 314 2004 of 19 february 2004 was adopted and implemented the restrictive measure of common council position 2004 161 cfsp this directive was subsequently amended by council decision 2011 101 cfsp of 15 february 2011 which meant that in terms of article 5 1 all funds or resources found on eu territory of the listed individuals would be frozen the ecj appeal court dismissed this appeal and found that the general court of the eu was correct in paragraph 48 that natural persons whose activities seriously undermine democracy respect for human rights and the rule of law in zimbabwe and the legal persons entities or bodies belonging to those natural persons referred to in articles 4 and 5 of decision 2011 101 should not be regarded as other than persons associated with the members of the government of zimbabwe and the legal persons entities or bodies belonging to such associates but constitute in fact a particular category of those associates the november 2017 coup which was disguised as something other than a coup was welcomed with euphoria and confidence amongst the citizens that the government would introduce political reforms 31 july 2018 proved that zimbabwe still had a long way towards introducing political reforms just after the announcement of the election results on 01 august 2018 people took the streets in the capital city of harare protesting as to what they believed was yet another rigging of ballot results by the main ruling party quickly thereafter the military unleashed gunfire at defenceless demonstrators resulting in 6 deaths and many injuries to this day the perpetrators have not been brought to justice on the other side the opposition brought an urgent court application alleging that the ruling party rigged the election to the contrary the constitutional court gave a judgement that they were no irregularities on 03 august 2018 in the case of chamisa v mnangagwa 24 others this was on the basis that the applicant had failed to place before the court any clear sufficient direct and credible evidence on these irregularities coincidentally on 8 august 2018 the us imposed stiffer sanctions on zimbabwe when president donald trump signed the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery amendment act of 2018 zidera 2018 zidera 2018 states that zimbabwe must restore the rule of law remove military interference by handing over to a civilian government and holding of free elections zidera 2018 further states that there has to be an adherence to the sadc tribunal award of the case of sadc tribunal case of mike campbell and 79 other commercial farmers 2008 where the tribunal held amongst other reasons that amendment 17 of the zimbabwean constitution to expropriate land without compensation amounted to racial discrimination although the expropriation conducted to address the issue of racial imbalances it was however marred by the awarding of land to predominantly ruling party loyalists the situation in 2019 many zimbabwean citizens would perhaps wish to forget 2019 the country s citizens faced unprecedented inflation on essential commodities high unemployment lack basic amenities such as electricity and clean running tap water inadequate health care services and children requiring adequate daily balanced meals this paper has so far demonstrated a nexus connection between political reforms i e amending media and security laws and improving on socio economic rights as a means of ensuring the thoughts of blaming sanctions for bringing untold suffering twisted into many contexts can be immediately exterminated for the sake of the wellbeing of innocent ordinary zimbabwean citizens for instance one does not need to go very far in digging into the nexus connection of political reforms and socio economic rights let us take a look at statements from authoritative sources that speak about a need for political and socio economic changes in zimbabwe made in 2019 on 27 september 2019 the united nations rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association stated that although the government had taken steps to amend the security law known as the public order and security act posa with maintenance of peace and order bill mopo however while i acknowledge that there is a need to enact a new law in accordance with international human rights norms and standards the mopo bill has worrying similarities to the posa revealing a common scope in which the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly is not fully guaranteed instead the mopo bill continues to give law enforcement agencies broad regulatory discretion and powers the mopo bill does not propose significant substantive amendments targeted to address the main problems prevailing in the posa the engagement relations with the eu after the military coup of november 2017 has taken another nose dive on 21 november 2019 the eu issued a memo stating that arrests and abductions of political activists in zimbabwe have reinforced the impression that the democratic space is being curtained again furthermore touching on the issue of socio economic rights the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food declared in a report on 28 november 2019 that man made starvation is slowly making its way into zimbabwe and most households in the country are unable to obtain enough food to meet their basic needs without any doubt these statements show that political and socio economic reforms are needed in zimbabwe so citizens can move away from more human made suffering a humanitarian catastrophe might explode thus culminating into an uprising against the government if the situation goes unabated in 2020 and 2021 attempts for zimbabwe s road to recovery while the government of zimbabwe has made attempts to restore the rule of law an inference can be drawn that there is still a long road to recovery if political reforms are not immediately taken into consideration by the government in desperate attempts to rescue zimbabwe from economic isolation the president has since 2018 made numerous travel escapades to different countries for instance bilateral treaties have been renewed or signed for the first time with nations such as russia azerbaijan kazakhstan belarus and all time weather friend china under the objective of securing investments also popularly known as mega deals such mega deals seen as a rhetoric by many are meant to benefit citizens by through creation of employment opportunities still no tangible results have been seen as the citizens continue to languish in hardships of struggling to make ends meet many civil servants have declared themselves incapacitated due to the economic difficulties and regularly face serious threats when they embark on demonstrations for better wages with this in mind a further inference can be drawn that again the issue of political reforms is necessary before zimbabwe can unleash its potential in taking care of socio economic rights conclusion political reforms are a starting point for zimbabwe to socio economically recover as well as restore confidence that it is not a failed state the start of 2020 presents an opportunity for zimbabwe to expedite issues linked to the respect of human rights the rule of law and democracy for instance less police or military brutality on demonstrations by people demanding to exercise their rights peacefully zimbabwe is dogged with corruption especially within the political elite therefore naming shaming and prosecution of the ruling elite linked to highly corrupt activities is essential the state measures of attempting to silence people who demonstrate their displeasure in the high cost of living impedes on the rule of law thus turning away potential investors and delaying attempts to lift the us zidera legislation as well as eu restrictions at the same time regional bodies such as the southern african development community and the african union must castigate the zimbabwean government where wrongs are done in terms going backwards on political reforms as long as the playing field is not level inequality between the political elite and the ordinary citizen will ensure that zimbabwe remains politically unstable and a humanitarian concern this

iranian protesters gather around a fire nov 16 during a demonstration in tehran against an increase in gasoline prices two months ago when iranian security forces brutally and swiftly clamped down on protests that were sweeping the nation samira heshemi thought nothing could drown out cries for revolt in a country reeling with economic hardship and deepening animosity toward a government that has long repressed its citizens the 27 year old tehran based writer who had just started a business felt that change was on the horizon it was the moment she had spent years waiting for but it appeared short lived the u s drone strike that killed gen qassem suleimani the consequences of which are reverberating across the middle east seemed to briefly stifle the momentum for rebellion in iran yet on saturday hours after iranian officials acknowledged that it had shot down a ukrainian airliner fresh protests swept across several cities in iran including tehran hamadan and isfahan many of the protests were organized by students and took hold outside prestigious universities 26 people who died in the plane crash wednesday were alumni of colleges in the islamic republic and others were graduate students studying in canada hours after iran s admission angry demonstrators took the streets chanting slogans such as down with the dictator and shame on revolutionary guard advertisement when faced with existential threats internal domestic disputes in iran tend to be pushed aside in order to make room to present a unified front such was the case last week when hundreds of thousands of iranians took the streets of tehran to mourn suleimani s death but anger against the government s admission of the downing of the plane saturday quickly re ignited deep seated fury that many iranians have long felt behind closed doors ever since the disputed 2009 presidential election sparked weeks of protest known as the green movement iranians grievances and dissent toward the islamic republic have been simmering that anger culminated in november when president hassan rouhani announced a sudden 50 increase in gasoline prices protests erupted in cities and towns across the nation tens of thousands of people flooded the streets soon after security forces began killing hundreds of protesters and detaining thousands of others according to international human rights activists now the country is navigating an array of conflicting impulses over fears of a wider war with america anger at years of economic sanctions deepening dissatisfaction with the government and even over the legacy of suleimani considered a hero by many and a symbol of an oppressive state by others we don t want a war said heshimi reached by phone in tehran many people stopped our government and started supporting it to stop a war i m angry about it and sad that suleimani s death overshadowed the death of protesters but she added that the events of recent days have made her more scared about her country s future than at any other time in her life every day it was very strange i kept thinking are we going to be dead in 10 days she said advertisement for others the pain of the government s crackdown on protesters two months ago is still raw and they remain steadfast in their conviction that the islamic republic must be held accountable for years of corruption and neglect such is the case for mehdi rajabian a 30 year old iranian musician who has been jailed twice in the notorious evin prison once in 2013 and then 2015 every single day as soon we open our eyes we face a dark and vague future before us we only struggle to survive life means nothing to us he said we only pass the time with an empty stomach and an exhausted body heshimi has had difficulty sleeping since suleimani s death so she was already awake and riveted to the news when she learned wednesday that iran had launched missiles at u s forces in iraq to avenge the general s death later that day she was surrounded by her colleagues at work when they tuned in to cnn to watch president trump s remarks we were frozen just waiting for trump to talk to find out what would happen she said trump s comments appeared to ease back on threats of further military action calling instead for more economic pressure on iran which already faces more than 1 000 sanctions after that we felt calmer heshemi said while the islamic republic may have presented a unified front over suleimani s death a more nuanced conversation has been taking place in private spaces among iranians anger at the islamic republic though not at the forefront of people s minds remains potent advertisement one women s rights activist in iran who declined to give her name for fear of reprisal said some iranians are happy that suleimani a man who had been responsible for many deaths in syria and iraq is no longer alive others in her circle she said said the u s should be held accountable for violating human rights in killing suleimani for bita nejati a manager at mehrafarin a charity that focuses on youth homelessness and mental health the images of protesters being shot still haunt her along with the prospect that hundreds of demonstrators remain behind bars but those images were subsumed by the sea of mourners outside her window near tehran university who were grieving over the death of a general many considered the second most powerful man in the country nejati a mother of two said she feels that people are abandoning the protesters and that trump has inadvertently played into the hands of the iranian leadership by making a martyr of suleimani and taking pressure off the government to fix widespread economic and social problems because of the suleimani death people are kind of turning their back on the protesters and the government she said usually in iran people try to look for a leader in these types of situations according to the new york based nonprofit center for human rights in iran at least 304 people including 12 children were killed during the unrest the group also said that up to 7 000 protesters were arrested the u n has called on iran to release all individuals detained but to no avail the u n said in a statement in december that it heard reports that some of those who had been detained were physically abused iranians walk past a bank in shahriar that was damaged during demonstrations against gasoline price hikes afp getty images advertisement reports suggest that detainees are being tortured or are suffering other forms of ill treatment sometimes to extract forced confessions the u n said some are also reportedly being denied medical treatment including for injuries caused by the security forces use of excessive force and are being held in overcrowded detention centers videos circulating on social media also indicate violent suppression of peaceful protesters compounding matters has been the toll of sanctions which have grown more severe since trump withdrew the u s from the landmark nuclear deal in may 2018 and called for a maximum pressure campaign its crumbling economy stunted by high unemployment and rising prices on food and medicine led to increased frustrations which eventually boiled over when rouhani announced the fuel price increase in early november authorities said the price increase would help provide additional government assistance for 60 million eligible iranians including many in rural areas as well as teachers laborers public employees aid workers social workers and female heads of households the islamic republic reportedly started the subsidy payment handouts on monday life is very expensive nejati said indeed the inflation rate in iran skyrocketed to 40 in the 12 months that ended dec 22 according to iran s statistical center the most significant price hike that the center reported was in the agricultural sector and transportation sector in 2019 the value of iran s currency plummeted and according to the international monetary fund iran s gdp contracted 9 advertisement for other iranians the events of this past week compounded an already difficult life nima embrahimi a 35 year old civil engineer said that sanctions and trump s travel ban have taken a toll on his mental health he has been separated from his fiancee moojan mirbaha a naturalized u s citizen in texas for two years unable to be with her and already struggling to make ends meet in tehran embrahimi said fear has taken hold when he awoke at 6 a m wednesday to news that iran had launched missiles at u s forces in iraq he joined in the chorus of an already numbed and distraught population if you walk on the streets in tehran it looks normal because people have gotten used to it we have to continue living he said the people of america don t know about the situation of iranian people we just want good relations with america and a decent life

washington ap u s employers added 145 000 jobs in december and the unemployment rate held steady at 3 5 signaling that the job market remains strong at the start of 2020 even if hiring and wage gains have slowed somewhat more than a decade into an economic expansion friday s snapshot from the labor department showed hiring slipped from robust gains of 256 000 in november which were given a boost by the end of a strike at general motors for the year employers added an average of roughly 175 000 jobs per month compared with about 223 250 per month in 2018 annual wage growth fell in december to 2 9 down from an annualized average of 3 3 a year earlier a possible sign that some slack remains in the labor market and that unemployment could fall even further from its current half century low the picture of a slowly but steadily improving economy plus low inflation likely gives the federal reserve comfort in keeping interest rates low which has been a boon to stock markets the dow jones industrial average fell a slight 0 34 in friday afternoon trading but it briefly climbed to a record level of 29 000 in the morning we re starting 2020 in very good shape said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial services we should see continued economic expansion throughout 2020 driven by consumers the state of the job market has become a pivotal division between president donald trump and his democratic challengers trump can campaign on the low unemployment rate and job growth as he seeks a second term democrats seeking to oust him will point to wages that have not taken off in a meaningful for many americans coping with high costs for medical care and higher education this is the last jobs report before the iowa caucus in february that will serve as a first step for choosing the democratic presidential nominee the prospect of a stable job market a pick up in global growth supportive central banks an easing of trade tensions and u s economic growth of around 2 should be a positive for this year we really have the wind at our backs going into 2020 said julia pollak a labor economist at the employment marketplace ziprecruiter yet job growth has failed so far to translate into substantially better hourly pay there is the potential that wages jumped in january as many states adjusted their minimum wages some businesses in competitive industries are already taking steps to prepare for wage competition this year the big blue swim school based in chicago vies with day cares learning centers and gyms for its instructors the chain has five sites employing on average 30 people and plans to open five more schools this year and 17 in 2021 but it had to dramatically boost wages in order to attract staff for that expansion we gave all of our front line employees a 10 or 11 raise because of the fear we have about the wage pressures in the economy said ceo chris kenny we can t meet our business goal without great staff irina novoselsky ceo of the jobs site careerbuilder said that more employers are offering non wage benefits such as the chance to work remotely to potential workers and becoming less focused on educational credentials when hiring the major fact that is pushing the trend is the labor shortage in america she said companies are being forced to provide that flexibility the u s economy added 2 1 million jobs last year down from gains of nearly 2 7 million in 2018 hiring may have slowed because the number of unemployed people seeking work has fallen by 540 000 people over the past year to 5 75 million with fewer unemployed people hunting for jobs there is a potential limit on job gains the steady hiring growth during the expansion has contributed to gains in consumer spending retail sales during the crucial holiday shopping improved 3 4 compared to the prior year according to mastercard spendingpulse this likely contributed to a surge of hiring in retail as that sector added 41 200 jobs in december the leisure and hospitality sector which includes restaurants and hotels added another 40 000 jobs health care and social assistance accounted 33 900 new jobs still the report suggests a lingering weakness in manufacturing factories shed 12 000 jobs in december after the end of the gm strike produced gains of 58 000 in november manufacturing companies added just 46 000 jobs in all of 2019 manufacturing struggled last year because of trade tensions between the united states and china coupled with slower global economic growth safety problems at boeing have also hurt orders for aircraft and parts and that could restrict hiring at factories in 2020 while the jobs report painted a healthy picture of the economy the manufacturing sector took a blow friday as the boeing supplier spirit aerosystems announced layoffs for 2 800 workers in kansas
although economists say december s job gains are respectable for this stage in the economic cycle some worry that workers are losing ground as wage gains slipped to 2 9 percent on an annualized basis below economists expectations glassdoor com chief economist andrew chamberlain called the figure incredibly disappointing noting that in spite of 145 000 new jobs and an unemployment rate that remained steady at 3 5 percent pay growth has consistently lagged the rest of the labor market recovery since the great recession dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america said part of this is a function of the lower number of available jobs at this stage of the economic cycle but he added that the pressure president donald trump s trade war is exerting on corporate profits is a key culprit behind the falloff in worker pay there s no question that margins are being squeezed we re seeing a lot of evidence of that he said there are two implications it takes some of the pressure off profit margins for companies but it s healthy enough to help consumers feel like they can go out and spend said sameer samana senior global market strategist at the wells fargo investment institute although he added that further deceleration could undermine consumer confidence and lead to a cutback in spending the creation of more low paying jobs also could play a role according to josh wright chief economist at icims the december figures showed a surge in leisure and hospitality health care and social assistance and retail jobs which tend to be lower income positions jeff mills chief investment officer of bryn mawr trust offered a silver lining to slowing wage growth it suggests monetary policy will remain accommodative this year it underscores an inflation backdrop that remains pretty benign it s unlikely to provoke tightening by the federal reserve he said the good news for consumers is the federal reserve has indicated it has the economy s back having pivoted on interest rates in 2019 said mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate com but the trio of rate cuts last year has left the central bank with a weaker hand to play in the event of a downturn he added a big part of its ammunition is gone with capital investment at a trough as corporate executives wait out the uncertain outcome of trump s trade policies the u s economy has been dependent on robust consumer spending for continued momentum a sharp or sustained drop in that activity would mark an economic inflection point economists said the average hourly workweek has ticked lower from a year ago which translates into smaller take home pay and less disposable income samana also noted that the average hourly workweek has ticked lower from a year ago a potentially bad sign in the absence of robust wage gains a shorter workweek translates into lower take home pay and less disposable income in the average american pocketbook in some ways the u s economy s been doing the heavy lifting of the rest of the world hamrick said that imbalance cannot continue forever a shorter workweek also is a frequent harbinger of impending job cuts often companies reduce hours worked before they lay people off samana said it s something that could be one of those leading indicators

of passion in idaho for making our state the best it can be we have much to be proud of and much to work toward i have learned that progress requires pushing the boundaries of what s comfortable in government it requires a strong desire to get things done and i have learned you cannot do it alone i am proud of my partnership with you the idaho legislature for your collaboration in working with me to do the people s work from the beginning i stated my goal to make idaho the place where we all have the best possible opportunity to thrive where our children and grandchildren choose to stay and for the ones who have left to choose to return in america we get to choose our faith our jobs where we live i would like to acknowledge the role our veterans and military members and their families play in making that a reality this spring the idaho army national guard will mobilize more than 4 000 soldiers to germany in support of a large scale exercise to demonstrate u s military readiness the idaho air national guard will deploy more than 400 airmen to several locations throughout southwest asia in support of combat operations we wish them well and pray for their safety as we enter the

idahoans to be confident in their state government just last month i was joined by many of you my partners in the legislature in announcing idaho surpassed south dakota and we are now the least regulated state in the nation together we cut and simplified 75 percent of all regulations in less than a year how did we achieve the largest regulatory cuts in idaho history through a combination of efforts i issued two executive orders aimed at scaling back and streamlining idaho s administrative code and the legislature made it possible for us to examine the entirety of our administrative code in one sweeping step when the legislature chose not to reauthorize the administrative code i didn t know what to expect but working together we seized the opportunity before us and made history in the process our agencies held 150 public meetings throughout idaho to ensure transparency and public involvement in the evaluation of all proposed changes i would like to recognize my budget chief alex adams and his team along with many people in the agencies who were a driving force behind our progress their intense focus helped get us here thank you for working so hard for the people of idaho so what does this all mean to idahoans it means small businesses can now easily understand the regulations they are required to follow without having to hire a lawyer or call a state agency for help interpreting them it means devin trone a small business owner in meridian was able to expand and open a tele pharmacy in garden valley creating jobs and making health care more accessible in rural idaho when we reduce regulatory friction good jobs follow last month i was honored to visit with president donald trump and vice president mike pence in the white house president trump has taken on meaningful regulatory reform and he is looking to the states for help in achieving it guess who president trump held up as the shining example of how to get it done idaho folks this is what idahoans expect they expect the executive and legislative branches to work together to make government work for them and we re not done yet my first executive order this year will make it a routine practice for idaho state government to undergo the kind of successful regulatory review we saw in 2019 i am calling it zero based regulation we are determined to have the administrative code remain clear and user friendly we must also knock down barriers to prosperity by continuing to advance the licensing freedom act last year we were successful in fast tracking licensing processes for veterans members of the military and their spouses making it easier for them to start work after relocating here building on that success i pledge to work with the legislature this session and broaden those processes so that individuals moving to idaho from another state can start working as quickly as possible idaho s statutes could use a good scrub too this year my administration will bring forth more than 30 pieces of legislation that repeal outdated statutes from a wagon road in neal idaho to laws governing trespassing hogs it s time to put obsolete sections of idaho code like the non existent board of cemetarians in the grave just as regulatory restraint encourages investment and reduces the cost of doing business a lean and efficient budget does the same my budget for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 cuts spending leaves a surplus and bolsters our rainy day funds it focuses on conservative growth and transparent budgeting sound budgeting starts with sound economic forecasts that is why we started a new practice we are tapping the expertise of business leaders and economists in the private sector to help us achieve revenue forecasts that are as accurate as possible idaho has experienced tremendous growth in recent years but nationally and internationally the pace of economic growth is expected to slow last fall i asked all state entities that receive general funds to undergo a spending reset except my highest priority area public education the time to prepare for a potential downturn is now when times are good the spending reset also forces a closer examination of spending we cannot lose our focus on the taxpayer i understand it is difficult for state agencies and our universities to tighten things up but it must be done habitually and willingly because it is the right thing to do my budget leaves an appropriate cash balance and shores up our rainy day funds which have helped us weather economic storms that forced other states to raise taxes idaho is ranked in the top 10 states nationally for the balance of our budget reserves but a credible stress test showed we have more work to do to prepare for a recession that is why i am also calling for us to raise the cap on our main rainy day fund so that we can better position our state for any economic condition overall my budget for fiscal year 2021 limits true general fund spending growth to a conservative 3 75 percent from now on it will be easier for the public to discern true spending growth in the executive budget because i instructed my budget office not to rely on one time transfers or other budget gimmicks we are increasing transparency in state budgeting one of the staples of conservative governing is to put money back into taxpayers pockets i have long supported tax relief for idahoans on the most basic of needs groceries my budget leverages 35 million dollars from the dedicated tax relief fund to provide idaho families with grocery tax relief without competing against our general fund priorities i believe our people have greater opportunities to prosper when government limits regulatory hurdles respects taxpayers by spending their money as efficiently as possible and focuses as much on the needs of tomorrow as the needs of today that conservative approach aligns perfectly with my number one priority education as state elected leaders our constitutional obligation to k 12 public education is clear article 9 section 1 states it is our duty to establish and maintain a general uniform and thorough system of public free common schools but we also have a moral obligation to all our youngest citizens i subscribe to the view that it is better to prepare children today than to repair them later i want to thank the legislature for joining me last year in passing significant investments in public education we raised starting teacher pay we increased funds available for opportunity scholarships we doubled funding for one of my highest priority areas literacy every district determined the best way to use the additional literacy dollars from hiring reading coaches to conducting summer reading programs and providing full day kindergarten parts of the state are surging ahead in their progress on reading proficiency at betty kiefer elementary in rathdrum where 37 percent of students come from low income families we saw incredible overall fall to spring improvements reading proficiency among children rose an astounding 32 percent more than 85 percent of third graders at betty kiefer elementary were reading proficiently by the end of the school year this is also the first school i saw doing monthly assessments so teachers can personalize reading instruction to each student at chief joseph elementary in meridian where 40 percent of students are low income and a high portion are learning english as a second language full day kindergarten became an option to help students get on track with reading about half of the school s incoming kindergarteners couldn t read at grade level last fall by spring they saw a 30 percent improvement when we commit to giving students a strong start and provide local schools the flexibility to determine how best to achieve it we see progress but still too many students across the state are falling behind about 12 000 kindergarteners are not on track to read when they show up on day one my budget keeps our foot on the gas and makes our historic investment in literacy ongoing the push for literacy was a recommendation that came out of my our kids idaho s future task force the task force was made up of teachers school administrators education stakeholders business leaders and a bipartisan group of legislators from every corner of the state i want to voice my appreciation to every member of the task force for taking on this important job especially the co chairs debbie critchfield and bill gilbert the task force also identified the need to continue investing in our teachers a child s progress in all subjects especially reading depends on the attention and instruction of a good teacher we cannot simply rely on the good hearts of teachers any longer to retain an effective teaching workforce in idaho we must pay them competitively your property taxes shoulder a growing share of teacher salaries and operating expenses in our school districts it s out of balance and not sustainable i propose we put an additional 30 million in ongoing general fund as a down payment to continue increasing teacher pay over the next several years performance criteria will ensure accountability these investments have been ongoing for the past several years and i commend the legislature for stepping up to support our educators our efforts should elevate the profession and help us keep good teachers in idaho classrooms teachers are on the front lines of all kinds of challenges i am advancing another recommendation from my task force which should be good news to stacie and all who are concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our children my budget provides teachers additional training and resources so they can identify and better serve students facing trauma and mental illness giving parents peace of mind when they send their children to school each day as students get older our focus in education shifts to college and career readiness we have new presidents at all our four year universities president scott green at university of idaho president marlene tromp at boise state university and president kevin satterlee at idaho state university as well as president cynthia pemberton at lewis clark state college i have directed our universities community colleges and the state board of education to adopt a fresh bold approach to meeting the needs of idaho students and businesses by breaking down silos and working together more as an interconnected higher education system to that end i am recommending the development of cybersecurity programs that will be offered jointly by boise state university idaho state university and university of idaho this increased level of collaboration across idaho s higher education institutions will offer idahoans a path to earn a degree in a high demand profession by partnering with idaho employers including the idaho national laboratory we are identifying what employers need in a workforce and we are responding high schools across the state are offering more and more career technical education programs hand in hand with local businesses this is especially important for businesses in rural idaho which are more susceptible to a talent shortage i am recommending 6 million in the capital budget for new cte facilities at the college of eastern idaho lewis clark state college and the department of juvenile corrections to strengthen our commitment to cte in idaho our community colleges are a growing resource for traditional and non traditional students alike in fact i am recommending ongoing funds for idaho job corps a three year project to connect 16 to 24 year olds to in demand jobs in its first year the program will serve up to 150 students through the college of western idaho with resources expanding to other community colleges in subsequent years in addition the workforce development council and idaho department of labor are facilitating and promoting more and more internships and apprenticeships because after all the best way to learn is by doing it is also imperative that we make college accessible to more idahoans i commend our university presidents and the state board of education for freezing tuition for resident undergraduate students in 2020 combined with our increased commitments to the advanced opportunities program which enables students to earn college credit while in high school and the opportunity scholarship college is becoming more affordable and obtainable for an entire generation of idahoans last month the country took a critical step toward helping us secure future jobs and economic prosperity in idaho congress finally ratified president trump s trade agreement with two of idaho s biggest export markets canada and mexico i strongly supported the deal because it preserves and enhances critical gains made in previous trade agreements for idaho products our farmers and agriculture industry have good reason to rejoice for this important agreement making it across the finish line over the past year i visited with a lot of businesses across the state a few stood out to me because they embody my goal to make idaho the place where our children and grandchildren choose to stay in the ditch towing products in mountain home is a homegrown business selling products worldwide built by workers trained in local cte programs stancraft boat company in hayden is a fourth generation idaho company that makes world class wooden boats and continues to expand and provide good jobs for idahoans robb bloem at stancraft and chuck ceccarelli at in the ditch are idaho kids who made good they found ways to pursue their passions while creating opportunity for others prescient security in salmon is a technology company that relocated to idaho and offers apprenticeships that help train in demand cyber specialists it is the kind of business that is helping to diversify and strengthen the economy in our rural communities carl hagan with afc finishing systems moved his company to weiser after getting frustrated with the lack of business friendliness in california he plans on creating over 40 jobs and investing 2 million in weiser welcome to idaho carl we must continue to seek investments in infrastructure if companies like these can continue to succeed in idaho one thing i consistently hear about is our transportation system in a growing state we must move people and products as safely and efficiently as possible the association of idaho cities and associated general contractors are working on a study of idaho s transportation needs after it s complete i ll work closely with the legislature and others to formulate a sustainable funding plan in the meantime i am recommending that we direct close to 100 million to maintain and improve the state s highway system i am also pursuing another strategic investment improvements in idaho s broadband infrastructure for both urban and rural idaho to attract business and enhance our citizens quality of life idaho must be connected i am adopting a recommendation from my broadband task force led by idaho department of commerce director tom kealey to establish a state broadband office we will utilize existing resources at commerce and unite the efforts taking place across the state to ensure all areas of idaho are connected improving broadband will also expand tele health and pharmacy access in rural idaho where the distance to a doctor or pharmacy can be overly burdensome to entire communities of people to further address the shortage of physicians in idaho i am seeking legislative approval for ongoing general funds for 25 new medical residents these efforts build on previous investments including those in our behavioral crisis centers i am happy to report that as of last summer all regions of the state now operate a behavioral crisis center nearby serving thousands of idahoans and providing effective alternatives to hospitalization and incarceration those recovering from substance use disorders need the resources to stay in recovery my budget supports community based recovery centers and connects those individuals with the support system they need another scourge afflicting our society is addiction to opioids because of the misuse of prescription pain killers and illegal drugs for the first time in decades americans life expectancy has actually dropped there s hope for a better future for these individuals though idaho has made great progress with the prescription drug monitoring program use of the database has increased from 530 000 searches a few years ago to a staggering 21 million searches last year this is part of the reason opioid use has dropped since 2016 despite a growing population but there is more we can and must do i am recommending more than 30 million to arm physicians and pharmacists with the tools to identify and prevent opioid abuse last year we began implementing medicaid expansion my budget implements a full year of medicaid expansion with a net zero impact on the general fund we have identified offsets in the budgets for the idaho department of health and welfare the department of correction the courts and the catastrophic health care fund i am also proposing that we tap the millennium fund to help cover our share and i am asking the counties to bring the offsets in their budgets to the table as medicaid expansion begins to pay for services the counties used to cover we are bending the cost curve of health care in idaho starting this year idaho became the first state in the nation to make enhanced short term plans available offering more options to individuals and families priced out of the market by obamacare two insurance carriers have signed up to offer the plans creating competition and coverage to help drive down the cost of health care for idaho families one of the many reasons new residents tell me they moved to idaho is our low crime rate but as our state continues to grow so must investments in public safety to help the men and women in our state police force meet their mission i am recommending the replacement of dozens of vehicles in our idaho state police fleet additional investigators to assist in the daily fight against drugs and additional dispatchers our first first responders we must also acknowledge that our communities are put at risk when we simply warehouse those who break the law our safety is maintained when those returning home from a period of incarceration can become productive citizens two thirds of idaho inmates are in prison because of probation and parole violations more than any other state in the country idaho taxpayers pay 110 million dollars per year to incarcerate this population this is a taxpayer issue as well as a public safety issue we must address our growing prison population in new ways my budget calls for a new resource called connection and intervention stations they will offer support treatment and accountability for the people on community supervision who need it most meanwhile i am seeking continued investments in community reentry centers where inmates returning to our neighborhoods can learn job and life skills the cost of investing in proven interventions that help inmates turn their lives around before they re offend is fractional to the cost of incarceration we have a choice we can either invest in measures designed to reduce the demand for prison beds and promote safer communities or we can do nothing and ensure the next check we write is larger than the last in addition to feeling safe our children and grandchildren will choose to stay in idaho if they can maintain a high quality of life including the ability to get out and enjoy idaho s open spaces we have an obligation to keep our public lands and waterways healthy so that future generations can enjoy them as well idaho has chosen to lead in public land management we have established a model of heightened collaboration with our federal land management partners under the good neighbor authority and shared stewardship two related initiatives that aim to reduce fire risk and create jobs in rural communities and proactively address the ongoing forest health crisis i am seeking continued investments in these important efforts to propel us forward and show the rest of the country yet again that idaho knows how to bring together diverse interests in a common pursuit the health of our natural resources i want to stretch that commitment to our natural resources even further i am recommending the creation of a position at the office of species conservation to work with federal agencies on public lands issues just as we approach our budgets prudently we must also approach water management with an eye for efficiency and preparation for dry years we are doing that through aquifer recharge and other innovative approaches and for the past several years because of forethought from the legislature we have positioned idaho for success by setting aside funds for water infrastructure projects we have also made investments in flood management and water quality which is as important as water quantity from lake coeur d alene to bear lake and priest river to the snake river we are all working together the state tribes local government citizens stakeholders and others to ensure our waterbodies are safe and clean one very big accomplishment that serves to protect idaho s environment and jobs involves the nation s leading center for nuclear energy research and development right here in idaho the idaho national laboratory attorney general lawrence wasden and his staff worked hard over the past several years and closely with my office to revise and strengthen the 1995 settlement agreement with the department of energy to clean up legacy waste at the inl we could not have reached this achievement without the support of idaho s congressional delegation our former governors cecil andrus and phil batt left an astounding legacy for idaho with the 1995 settlement agreement we are grateful for their steadfast commitment to idaho our updated agreement is a remarkable milestone it reinforces the 1995 agreement by incentivizing the federal government to carry out remaining clean up obligations our updated agreement also paves the way for more ground breaking research at the inl it will bring high tech jobs to eastern idaho and promote cleaner and safer carbon free nuclear energy for america any organization including and especially state government functions best when it earns the confidence and trust of the public i want to thank lt governor janice mcgeachin for taking on an important task for me identifying where we can achieve efficiencies in state government her leadership on the regional efficiency working group is already showing results and will continue this year we must also advance our progress in protecting citizen data last year we made significant investments in it modernization to reduce our exposure to a cyberattack and promote consistent security across state agencies my budget furthers these efforts and strengthens the state s it infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing state i am also borrowing a page from the private sector and creating a new hotline where state employees can turn to report instances of fraud waste or abuse within state government i am putting the division of human resources in charge of implementing a new state employee hotline this year which should give state employees a secure anonymous outlet to report concerns when i stood before you last year at this time i pledged to make decisions through one lens the lens of ensuring the best possible opportunities for us our children and grandchildren to remain in idaho and enjoy an unparalleled quality of life that vision guides me every single day my friends governing is about meeting the needs of today while not losing sight of the state we want our children and grandchildren to inherit it is about making idaho strong today and prepared for tomorrow i want to thank the citizens of idaho for their trust in me and i thank the idaho legislature for working with me to do the people s work god bless you and may god continue to bless the people of idaho and our great country

these stocks aren t overvalued the way much of the market is today after a strong year on the markets in 2019 that saw the s p 500 rise by 30 many stocks are trading at relatively high valuations and could be due for corrections this year finding a good fairly valued dividend stock can be challenging this year however the stocks listed below all trade at reasonable valuation multiples have good financials and can deliver strong dividend income for your portfolio for many years to come 1 bce bce bce 0 72 is a top canadian telecom stock that currently pays investors a quarterly dividend of approximately 0 60 every quarter depending on the exchange rate that equates to a dividend yield of more than 5 2 per year the company has increased its dividend every year since 2009 and although it doesn t have as long a track record as a dividend aristocrat may have bce is a safe bet to continue raising its payouts for the foreseeable future strong free cash flow totaling 3 8 billion canadian dollars over the trailing twelve months and annual profits over the past three years consistently hovering around ca 3 billion make the stock a very safe buy for investors as there is a great deal of predictability in its future earnings bce had a solid 2019 with its share price climbing 17 during the year although that was still shy of the s p 500 s impressive performance with the stock trading at a forward price to earnings p e of 16 bce is an attractive long term buy for value oriented investors bce is among the industry leaders in the telecom industry in canada and there s little danger of this stock or its dividend being in any trouble anytime soon 2 glaxosmithkline glaxosmithkline gsk 0 81 offers investors a more modest dividend yield of 4 2 investors in the u k based drug manufacturer will also see variations in their dividend payments depending on the effect of foreign exchange glaxosmithkline doesn t offer the same payout every quarter but over the course of a full year u s investors can expect to earn around 2 per share the company has not increased its dividend payments in recent years but it can still be a good pillar for dividend investors to put in their portfolios as its business is also very stable with 41 different medicines that the company is developing and its profits coming in at 4 5 billion pounds over the past 12 months it s likely to remain a top healthcare stock for many years trading at a forward p e of just 15 like bce glaxosmithkline is also an attractive option for price conscious investors despite currently being near its 52 week high 3 centerpoint energy centerpoint energy cnp 0 18 is a texas based utility company and investors won t have to worry about their dividend payments fluctuating due to foreign exchange currently the company pays a quarterly dividend of 0 2875 and it has increased its payments annually since 2006 another increase may be right around the corner as the company has typically increased its payouts at the beginning of the year currently the stock s dividend payments yield around 4 3 with a strong 140 year history and operating in a stable industry centerpoint could be an ideal investment for risk averse investors who are looking to collect a recurring dividend without having to worry about much else the stock is coming off a disappointing 2019 where its share price fell by 2 6 however centerpoint is only a few dollars away from its 52 week low and it s valued at a forward p e of 16 the utility stock has low volatility and can be a good investment to hold if you re worried about a dip in the markets or some challenging economic conditions ahead all three offer investors diversification and stability the stocks listed above may not have the best growth prospects but they make up for that with stability and dividend income if you re looking for a high yielding stock bce could be the best of the three to buy today with its superior payouts however after a strong performance in 2019 and the company having many new products in the works glaxosmithkline is more optimal for investors who want to maximize any potential for capital appreciation in 2020 centerpoint meanwhile is more suitable for bargain hunters or investors who want consistency in their payouts
by toby okechukwu as many of us return from the christmas and new year celebrations it is quite predictable that our experiences on nigerian roads are still a major talking point road transport remains the primary means for freight and passenger movements across the country and has assumed even a more significant role since the collapse of the rail system these past decades the utilisation of our inland waterways as a viable means of transportation remains untapped while air travel has become largely an exclusive for the elite and upper middle class even then the roads still lead us through the last mile hence account for about 95 per cent of all modes of transport while there are various statistics on the true conditions of our federal state and rural roads there is a consensus among nigerians that our roads infrastructure is generally in a deplorable condition i was privileged to chair the committee on works in the 8th session of the house of representatives as a committee we traversed the length and breadth of nigeria and one can authoritatively say that the problem of road infrastructure is not restricted to any particular region of the country it is also not essentially about who occupied what position it is self evident that even presidents are not able to help themselves a journey from lagos to ota a journey to otuoke and through the east west road a journey from kano to katsina or a journey from suleja to minna will convince any doubting thomas so it is a systemic structural nationwide problem expectedly this parlous state of our roads takes heavy tolls on the nation with an estimated vehicle operating cost of about n500 billion annually the burden of inaction in naira terms is estimated to be as much as 5 1 while the losses in man hours could be as much as 10 billion hours per year at a minimum hour rate of n100 therefore the cost of loss in man hours can be as much as n1 02 trillion and this does not include the impact on the economy especially in the agriculture sector where costs occasioned by delays disruptions and destructions incurred in moving produce from farms to markets are high or the direct effect on the manufacturing and logistics industries and to our wellbeing debilitating injuries and fatalities unfortunately hopes of any improvements under the current arrangement dim when it is considered that whereas our national expenditure on roads ought to be at least 3 0 of the nigeria s gross domestic product gdp per annum it has been just 0 5 percent to 0 1 percent because funding the roads sector has been strictly through fiscal allocation and we are now constantly confronted with the stark realities of dwindling resources for appropriation and diminishing expenditures in terms of actual budgetary releases our experience as committee on works in the 8th house of representatives and indeed as a parliament is that the deficit in the quality of our roads continues to widen despite our best efforts working with the executive through the ministry and the presidency to appropriate resources to our roads it is even almost impossible to contemplate new federal highways not when capital allocations to the roads always hover around n200 billion which is a tiny drop of water on a parched land when we consider that fg awarded road contracts already amount to over n4 trillion while fg liabilities on completed portions stand at n306 billion worse still much of the annual budgetary allocations is never released due to paucity of resources for instance of the n220 billion allocated to works in the 2019 budget less than n70 billion was released it is that bad to diagnose and properly address the multi faceted problems the 8th house of representatives committee on works set up a multi stakeholder technical panel comprising representatives of 27 agencies organisations including the federal ministry of power central bank of nigeria ministries of finance and justice bureau of public enterprises nigerian institution of highway and transportation engineers nigeria infrastructure advisory facility national institute for policy and strategic studies nips federal roads maintenance agency ferma nigerian association of road transport owners narto federal inland revenue service firs petroleum products pricing regulatory agency pppra federal road safety corps frsc nigeria economic summit group nesg partnering with the uk department for international development dfid national assembly and in fact every organisation that has or would have anything to do with our roads we mandated them to give us something that would work for nigeria looking also at other jurisdictions at the end of its widely consultative work which won an nesg award that year it became very obvious that nigeria needed a fundamental paradigm shift a rethink of our approach to keeping our roads in good condition to sustain economic growth and development it is against this background that the current session of the house of representatives considered and passed two very important bills before the christmas and new year break to reform the management of the roads sector the first is the federal roads bill it will create an appropriate and structured framework for the ownership management and development of our federal roads as obtainable in other economies with better quality and well maintained road infrastructure a major highlight of the bill is the creation of the federal roads authority fra from the current ferma but with an enhanced mandate that transcends road maintenance to include road construction road rehabilitation road network planning and technical regulation of road asset design and specification this bill is consistent with global practice and will strengthen the role of the federal ministry of works housing in the roads sector so if this bill becomes law nigeria will gain from the benefits accruing from such agencies around the world like the highways england national highway authority of india south africa national roads agency soc limited and federal highway administration in the usa other countries in africa like benin ethiopia ghana malawi tanzania and zambia have also established independent road agencies the proposed fra will manage the federal roads network to keep it safe and efficient meeting our socio economic demands promoting the sustainable development and operation of the road sector and facilitating private sector participation in the development financing maintenance management and improvement of roads in nigeria that may require road concession contracts and other forms of public private partnerships ppp it will also plan and manage the development of road safety technical designs and standards in addition to advising the federal roads safety commission frsc on appropriate and effective methods of enforcing road traffic legislation for the purposes of promoting road safety and preventing damage to roads several technical publications often cite the statistics that for every additional 1 a developing country spends on road maintenance road users save 3 thus the second bill the national roads fund bill creates an independent fund that addresses the inadequate levels of funding funding unpredictability and irregular allocation from the government to road management which makes planning for maintenance difficult and irresponsive to private sector development perennial inappropriate funding for road infrastructure management leads to delayed or insufficient maintenance of roads which in turn leads to the premature failure of road assets and increased costs of construction and maintenance at the core of the road fund solution therefore is the concept that some of the insufficiency and unpredictability of funding and by extension planning can be mitigated through additional funds from those that use the road assets in the form of a user based charge or levy the proposed national roads fund involves the utilisation of a user pay model that stipulates the aggregation of a token fuel levy and other revenues including tolls derivable from road users directly to a fund managed by a board representing users interests the national roads fund will be disbursed to the federal and state governments for routine preventive maintenance through their road agencies which must be established by law with a dedicated account for that purpose as required by the bill about 26 countries in africa have established such road funds and it is the practice in other countries like india pakistan usa japan new zealand united kingdom poland croatia bulgaria and moldova fortunately feelers we get from nigerians from the everyday users of our roads from the interstate commercial transporters to owners of private cars and even the motorcycle okada and tricycle keke riders indicate a willingness to embrace the reforms proposed in these bills and in turn hold the government more accountable indeed nigerians are not averse to tolling of well built or even concessioned roads opportunity cost of our decrepit roads to the road user including wear and tear of vehicles exposure to risks like kidnapping robbery attacks accidents etc is so huge nigerians are therefore ready to pay a n500 toll to travel safely and conveniently from abuja to kano for instance than to be kidnapped robbed stranded and probably sleep or even lose their lives on dilapidated roads also related to this are the positive consequential effects that the road sector reforms will have on unemployment despite the plethora of road construction contracts nigerian engineers and other related professionals are not gainfully employed because road contracts have short terminal dates so it is road maintenance that creates sustainable employment for instance a single trunk a road under concession could employ over a hundred civil engineers safety engineers soil engineers administrators etc for over 30 years which is nearly their active working lives meanwhile i am happy with my colleagues for approving the amendments to the council for the regulation of engineering in nigeria coren act which was signed by the president in 2019 as part of the three pronged approach to the issue of capacity funding and governance with the amendments the coren act has now substantially addressed the issue of capacity by institutionalising internship or experience by our engineering students to build their to deal with issues in that sector that way they are ripe and easily assimilated on graduation it also now integrates local content into the operation of the engineering firms and makes construction companies part of the council for me therefore it has been a great privilege sponsoring these bills drawing motivation from my experience in the works committee i appreciate my colleagues for seeing the urgent need for nigeria to be forward looking and proactive in road sector reforms and to adopt pragmatic enduring and viable approaches as well captured in the federal roads bill and national roads fund bill it is heartwarming that president muhammadu buhari has never hidden his concerns over the state of nigerian roads therefore we earnestly look forward to his assent to the bills when concurred by the senate as they are in tandem with his fervent aspiration to

taiwan s presidential and legislative elections are set to take place today january 11 with president tsai ing wen of the democratic progressive party dpp predicted to win tsai and the dpp have used her campaign to fuel a growing anti china atmosphere the last poll released on december 31 indicated that tsai held a 16 point lead over the main challenger kaohsiung mayor han kuo yu of the kuomintang kmt james soong of the people first party was a distant third some 19 percent of voters indicted they were still undecided the dpp currently controls the legislature known as the legislative yuan with 68 out of 113 seats the kmt controls 35 there is no guarantee the dpp will hold on to its majority after saturday though it is likely to remain the largest party a number of candidates from the new taiwan people s party as well as independents are hoping to capitalize on public discontent with both the ruling and main opposition parties the taiwan people s party was established by taipei mayor ko wen je and has been supported by the billionaire head of foxconn terry gou none of the capitalist parties in taiwan have a progressive program for the working class or youth instead they are waging a struggle as the representative of different sections of the big business with the dpp speaking for the faction that seeks to enrich itself through closer ties with us and japanese imperialism and the kmt representing those that have strived to increase relations with the capitalist oligarchy in mainland china tsai and the dpp attempted to paint the conflict as a battle against chinese threats to sovereignty and democracy as a means of concealing the essential class issues at present cross strait relations are governed by the 1992 consensus in which both beijing and taipei agree that there is only one china of which taiwan is part while the united states recognized beijing s people s republic of china in 1979 and ended formal recognition of the government in taipei washington has maintained close ties with taiwan and provided it with a security guarantee the trump administration has sought to expand the already close relations with taiwan it has encouraged more extensive official exchanges and providing it with massive amounts of military hardware in preparation for a war with china in which the island would be on the frontlines the threat of war is constant as washington continually pushes against china s red line on taiwan beijing has always maintained that it will use force to unite the island with the mainland should taipei ever violate the one china consensus and declare itself an independent state while the dpp cautiously leans towards independence washington s support with the goal of backing beijing into a corner could encourage the dpp to make such a pronouncement washington s war plans and the ramping up of tensions with china are being kept from the taiwanese people instead the government is using claims of chinese interference to prepare for conflict and for putting down domestic opposition from youth and workers during her new year s speech last week tsai stated over the past few years china s diplomatic offensives military coercion interference and infiltration have continued unabated china s objective is clear to force taiwan to compromise our sovereignty tsai and the dpp have pointed to china s political influence in hong kong as an example of what would happen should taiwan ever accept a similar one country two system arrangement however at the heart of the protests in hong kong is deep dissatisfaction with social inequality in addition to attacks on democratic rights the conditions in hong kong are the result of capitalist rule first under great britain and now china the entire ruling layer in hong kong including the pan democrats has benefited as a result the situation is no different in taiwan both the dpp and kmt have overseen years of declining living standards for the working class and a widening gulf between the rich and poor the kmt when it held power claimed closer relations with the mainland would result in improved economic conditions for workers when these improvements failed to materialize voters turned to the dpp but social inequality has continued to worsen nearly 12 percent of youth between 15 and 24 cannot find work according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd wages have been suppressed in order to allow taiwanese companies to compete with overseas competitors taiwan s minimum wage is only around 2 6 times higher than it was 30 years ago representing a massive fall in real living standards when inflation is taken into account it will rise 3 percent next year or nt700 us24 to just nt23 800 us794 a month faced with growing discontent the legislative yuan passed an anti interference law on december 31 it heightens penalties for those accused of acting on behalf of china to influence taiwanese politics this includes up to five years in jail and fines up to nt10 million the new law focuses on political donations lobbying disrupting elections aiding elections or disrupting social order the new law could easily be deployed against workers and youth protesting war and inequality as millions of oppressed around the globe increasingly move into conflict with their ruling classes they are realizing that their struggles are shared by people around the world taiwanese workers organizing joint action with their mainland chinese counterparts could be arrested under the new legislation the government could also use it to criminalize and silence political critics by claiming they are beijing s pawns taipei s move towards restricting democratic rights has been cheered on by the us establishment and social media conglomerates the new york times wrote on january 6 that officials and researchers worry that china is experimenting with social media manipulation to sway the vote doing so would be easy they fear in the island s rowdy democracy where the news cycle is fast and voters are already awash in false or highly partisan information facebook google and messaging app line all agreed to crack down on supposed disinformation months ahead of the vote the times is calling for further repressive measures online not only in taiwan but in the united states where the newspaper is conducting an anti china campaign along the same lines as the one directed against russia
us job growth likely slowed in december but the pace of hiring probably remains more than enough to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track despite a deepening downturn in a manufacturing sector stung by trade disputes the labor department s closely watched monthly employment report on friday could buttress the federal reserve s assessment that both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place it would extend the run of upbeat data such as consumer spending trade and housing that have suggested the expansion now in its 11th year is not in immediate danger of being derailed by a recession the solid job growth at the end of 2019 set the stage for continued strength from the consumer in 2020 helping to keep the economy chugging along at a decent clip said ben ayers senior economist at nationwide in columbus ohio worries that a downturn might be triggered by the trump administration s trade war with china spurred the fed to cut interest rates three times in 2019 indeed economic growth did slow last year throttling back to 2 1 in the third quarter from 2018 s pace of nearly 3 now though with a phase 1 deal with china set to be signed next week policymakers are more confident in the outlook and last month signaled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through this year economists are pegging growth at the end of last year around a 2 3 rate according to a reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 164 000 in december payrolls surged 266 000 in november in part as 46 000 production workers at general motors returned to work after a strike some of the anticipated slowdown in december is attributed to seasonal volatility associated with a later than normal thanksgiving day more seasonal workers could have been hired in december than in november said robin anderson senior global economist at principal global investors in des moines iowa the labor market has continued to churn out jobs at a healthy clip despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages which economists had feared would significantly restrain hiring job growth averaged 180 000 per month through november well above the roughly 100 000 monthly average needed to keep up with growth in the working age population december s expected gains would lift total job growth for 2019 to more than 2 million the ninth straight year above that threshold there are however concerns the labor department s bureau of labor statistics bls which compiles the employment data may not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of president donald trump s 18 month long trade war with china which has pushed manufacturing into recession and led to company closures
entering the third decade of a new millennium probably the best way to encapsulate this transition is what a difference a decade makes during the past 10 years pennsylvania like many states experienced its most challenging fiscal period since the great depression historic declines in tax revenue resulted in enormous deficits requiring many programmatic sacrifices to achieve fiscal balance now thanks to years of financial discipline demanded by the senate appropriations committee coupled with improvements in the state s economy the commonwealth s fiscal position is considerably stronger for the first time in over 10 years 2018 2019 actual revenues were ahead of official estimate by 883 million and the 2019 2020 budget was adopted with a surplus of more than 300 million pat browne the current state budget is balanced without tax increases and controls spending to 1 8 over the prior year less than the rate of inflation despite its overall austerity the budget increases support for essential services to seniors families and citizens with disabilities promotes workforce development efforts and bolsters education spending at all levels this is encouraging as we begin a new decade and capitalize on opportunities ahead of us however notwithstanding this progress the commonwealth s projected spending trends continue to outpace our revenue capacity furthermore pennsylvania is poorly positioned to anticipate an inevitable future slowdown in our economy committing the full surplus to the rainy day fund was an important step but with our reserves currently only 10 of rating agency recommendations to promote stability we must do more to ensure efficient allocation we must continue to identify fiscal deficiencies in administration of programming not only to eliminate duplication but ensure cost effective execution of necessary functions consolidating the department of human services and the department of health will allow for more efficient administration of programs with common objectives and better align regulatory responsibilities with program execution finalizing the merger of the department of corrections with probation and parole will ensure long term efficient execution of alternative sentencing practices which have resulted in the first multiyear decline in incarceration rates in decades while increasing public safety with seniors being pennsylvania s fastest growing demographic and with growing waiting lists for services by citizens with disabilities increased focus on community based long term care services has been essential we expect this to continue through the next decade with the statewide roll out of community based managed care in long term care this effort will allow more pennsylvanians to receive the care they require in settings they prefer while reducing pennsylvania s long term care financial burden with average caseloads and inflationary growth rates of over 8 per annum this alternative delivery model is paramount over the next decade to ensure fiscal sustainability corresponding efforts to ensure efficiency the general assembly is currently in a five year implementation period of a new performance measurement system collaborating with the governor this initiative will evaluate programmatic spending by departments against outcomes based objectives completed evaluations have resulted in both reforms and elimination of several longstanding tax credit programs with fiscal stewardship the years ahead can focus on maximizing the value of key assets to promote growth and opportunity recognizing the importance that our state s world class higher education sector will play in pennsylvania s future competitive position a higher education funding commission which i chair was created the commission will hold hearings throughout the state during 2020 and will consider factors such as per institution operational costs school student performances affordability program market relevance student need and geographical capacity in developing a new formula to distribute higher education funding when adopted this new methodology will be structured to promote the greatest overall success of our institutions and the students they serve given market demands the highest public sector priority to promote commercial success must be the technical skills and competencies of pennsylvania s unmatched workforce in recognition of this reality the current fiscal plan increases our commitment to workforce development job placement and training funding increased for career and technical education and equipment grants colleges of technology programs that assist job seekers obtain the resources they require to attain employment and funding to offers grants and loans to support business expansion and job growth building on these investments over the next decade will have proven results in preparing our job seekers for quality family sustaining employment unfortunately as pennsylvania is unmatched in workforce legacy and potential our state continues to be unrivaled in its oppressive cost to operate maintaining the country s highest corporate income tax rate collaboration involving business and labor leaders will continue over the next decade to reform our business tax structure to eliminate policies discouraging investment these efforts along with the provision of more site based locally governed initiatives proven to revitalize the economic condition of our most challenged communities will provide for a comprehensive platform to expand economic opportunities throughout our great commonwealth in the wake of a decade of extreme fiscal challenge all of state government must work together to continue fiscal policies that promote sustainability such collaborative responsible action over the next decade will provide opportunities to invest in the future and pave a path of promise and opportunity for all pennsylvania citizens

department showed hiring slipped from robust gains of 256 000 in november which were given a boost by the end of a strike at general motors for the year employers added an average of roughly 175 000 jobs per month compared with about 223 250 per month in 2018 annual wage growth fell in december to 2 9 down from an annualized average of 3 3 a year earlier a possible sign that some slack remains in the labor market and that unemployment could fall even further from its current half century low the picture of a slowly but steadily improving economy plus low inflation likely gives the federal reserve comfort in keeping interest rates low which has been a boon to stock markets the dow jones industrial average closed friday with a slight loss of 0 3 after briefly climbing to a record level of 29 000 in the morning we re starting 2020 in very good shape said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial services we should see continued economic expansion throughout 2020 driven by consumers the state of the job market has become a pivotal division between president donald trump and his democratic challengers trump can campaign on the low unemployment rate and job growth as he

blue swim school based in chicago vies with day cares learning centers and gyms for its instructors the chain has five sites employing on average 30 people and plans to open five more schools this year and 17 in 2021 but it had to dramatically boost wages in order to attract staff for that expansion we gave all of our front line employees a 10 or 11 raise because of the fear we have about the wage pressures in the economy said ceo chris kenny we can t meet our business goal without great staff irina novoselsky ceo of the jobs site careerbuilder said that more employers are offering non wage benefits such as the chance to work remotely to potential workers and becoming less focused on educational credentials when hiring the major fact that is pushing the trend is the labor shortage in america companies are being forced to provide that flexibility irina novoselsky ceo of the jobs site careerbuilder the major fact that is pushing the trend is the labor shortage in america she said companies are being forced to provide that flexibility the u s economy added 2 1 million jobs last year down from gains of nearly 2 7 million in 2018 hiring may have slowed because the number of unemployed people seeking work has fallen by 540 000 people over the past year to 5 75 million with fewer unemployed people hunting for jobs there is a potential limit on job gains the steady hiring growth during the expansion has contributed to gains in consumer spending retail sales during the crucial holiday shopping improved 3 4 compared to the prior year according to mastercard spendingpulse this likely contributed to a surge of hiring in retail as that sector added 41 200 jobs in december the leisure and hospitality sector which includes restaurants and hotels added another 40 000 jobs health care and social assistance accounted 33 900 new jobs still the report suggests a lingering weakness in manufacturing factories shed 12 000 jobs in december after the end of the gm strike

as one advances in age one tends to mark each new year by reflecting on the broader developments that have run in parallel with one s own lifetime for my part i usually focus on the surprises things that would have been considered unlikely or even unimaginable in my younger years i was born during world war ii and grew up in canada with a general awareness of at least some aspects of the larger world not least the cold war television allowed us to witness the destructive power of nuclear weapons from our living rooms i and many other children had watched our friend the atom on the television series walt disney s disneyland but we nonetheless would lie awake at night listening to passing planes hoping they were not bearing the instruments of our annihilation the nukes were kept in their silos owing to the deterrent effect of mutually assured destruction and the effective leadership shown during close calls like the cuban missile crisis eventually the cold war ended and anyone under 30 has spent their entire life in a world without it to most of them u s economic and military primacy probably seems as ordinary and permanent as the cold war did to baby boomers but now we are on the verge of another anxiety inducing shift in power relations
rising tensions in the middle east after the killing of general qassem soleimani by a u s drone strike in baghdad and iranian retaliation against two iraqi bases housing american troops early wednesday sparked fears over the unpredictable actions by washington and tehran or their proxy allies in the region in particular military escalation has affected commodity markets with oil prices running up as much as 4 percent in the immediate aftermath of the ballistic missiles attack and brent crude busting through the 70 threshold as soon as president donald trump declared the united states readiness to embrace peace u s crude futures erased the recent gain and ended below their january 2 value logging their biggest percentage drop since late november in just one day energy is central in trump s middle east strategy and this has was confirmed by his wednesday speech as trump affirmed the united states achieved energy independence and is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas thus allowing washington to change its strategic priorities in the region and daringly challenge iran in its near abroad despite the likelihood of an open conflict between u s and iran seeming slight all countries depending on energy imports from the middle east including lng aim to develop possible hedging strategies in case the situation worsens the tipping point could be an unexpected situation originating from the initiative of one of the many actors exacerbating the u s iranian quarrel as an example last september houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone attack on a large oil processing facility in saudi arabia or tankers may become the target of other raids as happened to two japanese ships in june as the price volatility of oil and oil related products is likely to continue in response to political turbulence the uae energy minister said that the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec is ready to guarantee that the market is well supplied and the world can enjoy healthy economic growth nonetheless he also said that all countries in the world would be affected if supply through the strait of hormuz is cut indeed the u s energy information administration eia named the strait as the world s most important oil transit chokepoint in 2018 due to the 21 million barrels per day b d the equivalent of about 21 percent of global petroleum liquid consumption and one third of total global seaborne traded oil flowing through the same strait of hormuz yet not much attention has been granted to the political importance of the strait of hormuz for liquefied natural gas lng trade as qatar and the uae both use the maritime channel to supply an estimated volume of 81 million tons to world markets qatar with around 25 percent of global lng supplies plays a leading role in the world s lng industry additional factors like regional interconnections from qatar to kuwait or the imports of lng in dubai kuwait and soon to bahrain could further increase the significance of a closure of the strait for global lng trade china india japan south korea singapore and taiwan are all heavily relying on imports from qatar and these countries are going to be the first to suffer an eventual tightening up of volumes available on international markets last june japan s chief cabinet secretary said that ensuring the safety of the strait is a matter of life and death in terms of energy security and it is extremely important for the peace and prosperity of the international community then defense minister takeshi iwaya meeting his u s counterpart hinted that japan might be interested in a future us led coalition to protect the strait under the plan approved by prime minister shinzo abe s cabinet a helicopter equipped destroyer and two p 3c patrol planes will be dispatched in the middle east to make sure japan related ships can sail safely in the middle east the impact of any disruption will depend on a mix of different aspects determining the extent of the crisis still as explained by nikos tsafos senior fellow at csis three main adjustments are likely to happen simultaneously first the remaining lng volumes flowing toward richer consumer countries second the countries with access to domestic gas will struggle to increase the use of it and finally those consumers which can switch to alternative fuels or lower consumption will do so according to independent gas and lng consultant david ledesma from the oxford institute for energy studies spot asian lng prices would rise to reflect the concern that middle eastern lng supply could be reduced if the strait of hormuz was closed or supply through the strait limited the u s maritime administration marad remains cautious and has already warned ships that there remains the possibility of iranian action against u s maritime interests in the region similarly japan s mitsui o s k lines mol issued a new warning to its ships inviting them to keep a distance from the iranian coast and avoid iranian waters transiting the strait of hormuz another major japanese shipowner nyk line maintained its safety measures in place which include maximizing the speed when passing through the strait last september sunao nakamura jera s managing executive officer said that the company which is world s largest importer of lng was carefully following the situation in the middle east and the attacks on the saudi arabia facilities as lng prices in a big portion are linked to oil indices jera is a joint venture between japanese tokyo electric power group and the chubu electric power group in december china imported a record high monthly volume of lng overtaking japan as the world s top importer of lng for the second consecutive month up nearly 16 percent from its november imports and at the same time launched the power of siberia pipeline a seminal project connecting the chinese gas grid to gazprom s assets in the russian far east china s import volumes are impressive considering that in 2015 the country imported less than a quarter of what tokyo did natural gas consumption is encouraged by beijing as part of its make china s skies blue again policy and is seen as an alternative to coal especially for the domestic heating and industrial sector thus reducing both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions still while china has a sizable indigenous production of natural gas the first among the asia pacific countries and the 6th in the world its neighbors like japan south korea and taiwan are roughly 100 percent dependent on lng imports turmoil in the middle east can easily restart competition among the northeast asian countries for accessing new energy supplies as it did in the mid 2000s back then attention was all on oil but with china s turning to gas for domestic exigencies and structuring its response to climate change natural gas could be the heart of a new dispute mitsui and state backed jogmec have already pledged 3 billion in the arctic lng 2 project managed by novatek securing also a long term contract for about 2 million tons of lng moreover last september mol and japan bank for international cooperation jbic signed a cooperation agreement for marketing lng produced in the arctic lng 2 and yamal lng plants this agreement will allow japanese companies to also enter the novatek s transshipment projects in kamchatka and murmansk where lng will be stored and then delivered to european and asian markets during the last visit of japanese foreign minister motegi to russia trade and economic cooperation were at the center of the meetings with both his russian counterpart sergei lavrov and russian minister of economic development maxim oreshkin in the end trump s adamant move in the middle east and his unwillingness to further commit american troops in the region could have important consequences on the asia pacific energy security scheme american abstinence from oil in the middle east could transform this phase into a boon for russia novatek and gazprom s strategies in northeast asia seriously backfiring on the u s expanding lng industry and washington s overall geopolitical interests in the region francesco sassi is a ph d candidate at the university of pisa his research interests are focused on the use of national oil companies as foreign policy tools and energy security issues in eurasia
09 01 2020 our attitude to europe a long standing member of the communist party of britain has tried to start an open debate using the normal channels though this letter was sent to the cpb the morning star and communist review in december 2019 it has neither been printed not even acknowledged dear comrades in the decades that i have been an active member of first the cpg be as was and then the cpb i have had doubts concerns and now growing disagreements with our policy on europe i am more and more concerned about the road we have taken and the possible results of this road our party should be opposed to any balkanisation of europe whether it comes from the right or the left the fragmentation of europe can do the working class nothing but harm communists should strive for working class unity within but against the existing eu winning the battle for democracy in the eu and securing working class rule over this politically strategic continent is the best service we can render for our comrades in the rest of the world though i have raised my concerns with leading cpb comrades i receive the same often trite answers leave has been party policy since the uk joined in 1973 the eu is a neoliberal conspiracy and foists neoliberal strictures upon member states the eu is bureaucratic and rules are made undemocratically britain will be better off out than in and we the left can then win a general election install a left labour prime minister and then proceed to transform britain into a socialist paradise as party line no19 says the working class and peoples desperately need a government that will pursue alternative policies to those of austerity privatisation militarism and war growing social inequalities of income wealth and opportunity must be decisively reversed this is fine and good but it is clear to me that at present the referendum and brexit issue have split the left and the working class industrial production is carried out internationally across borders for example an airplane s wings may be made in say factories in germany the undercarriage in spain the fuselage in france and the engine in the uk brexit will force whole sectors of industrial capital to relocate to mainland europe at the cost of british jobs aerospace pharmaceuticals steel and cars have been mentioned for big business of course current frictionless trade with the eu is worth a great deal more than future possibly fictional trade with the us australia india or wherever and the old commonwealth countries that britain had such links with have in the meantime gone on to forge other alliances for trade does anyone remember as i do that at one time the only lamb that a working class family could afford was from new zealand where is it going now and what of the hedge fund managers the retail billionaires the parochial small businesses for them deregulation of food housing social services restriction of trade union rights would be most welcome such regulations are now optional under boris johnson s oven ready deal the nhs is already being privatised by stealth try to get a chair for dialysis in any major hospital almost all run by private companies in preparation for further privatisation after brexit just wait until the chlorinated chicken reaches our shores and all of the media writing about how good it is for us referenda almost all of the mainstream media plus political parties and much of the left appear to be treating the 2016 brexit referendum as sacrosanct as the epitome of democracy referenda are not inherently democratic in my view they bypass democratic institutions reduce what are complex questions to a false binary choice and what is worse from a marxist point of view tend to split the working class along non class lines which is why the 2016 referendum called by david cameron would always have had this appalling outcome a divided working class cameron called the referendum to secure his position as prime minister and never imagined that he would lose it the referendum was thus a sham from start to finish watching our party metaphorically get into bed with nigel farage boris johnson never a safe bellwether tommy robinson and the socialist workers party amongst others strengthened my view that what our party was doing was wrong suggestions that our comrades might appear on platforms with other parties were happily turned down but the possibility was there and then the lies the constant lying on both sides made me laugh first and then feel ill the referendum was carried out by untrue propaganda followed by untrue propaganda the morning star sought a restoration of britain s democracy party line no19 says communists and other socialists realise that britain s membership in the eu will make it more difficult and in some areas impossible to implement the kind of policies necessary for full employment the direction of investment public ownership of key industries and utilities and a substantial redistribution of wealth and power in favour of the working class and the vast majority of the population but how can a left leaning but capitalist government restore or implement those things that the working class and vast majority of the population have never had the words about the implementation of left policies under a reformist government a form of capitalist class rule after withdrawal from the eu seem to imply that before january 1 1973 britain could have done these things but now can t because of a non democratic eu but obviously both views are wrong our democracy is a bourgeois democracy amongst other predilections it fosters sectional hatreds and the politics ofdivideandrule surelyweshouldnot be voting for a constitutional monarchy an unelected second chamber a more and more presidential prime minister an established church a secret state and a left reformist opposition the cpb seems to have given little or no thought to the possibilities of developing links or joint struggle with the working class within the eu britain no longer has an empire it is no longer a world ruler or hegemon under boris johnson britain appears to be recementing the special relationship it has enjoyed with the us since the end of world war ii the relationship is so special that britain has signed an agreement to send to the us pretty much anyone they want for whatever reason julian assange whereas the us is under no obligation to reciprocate of course president trump has assured us of the lovely deals he will be holding out after brexit he makes unhinged and wild outbursts and changes his mind on a dime as they say if americans are even giving him the lowest poll numbers of any president since polls began why should we trust anything he says doing i was always taught that the goal of a communist was to work towards a socialist state followed by a rapid transition to stateless communism but that in order to do that we must have a working class which is conscious of itself as a global class an allied question can we unite the working class in one country and achieve a socialist government that can proceed towards stateless communism given the experiences and histories of various countries where this has been tried some lessons might have been learned if for instance the leaders of the october 1917 russian revolution had taken the view that each little area should have its own road after all petrograd was very different from tashkent then there might never have been a revolution the bolsheviks wanted national self determination not national break up surely the whole point of the 1902 17 struggle was to unite not only the entire working class across the vast expanse of the tsarist empire but also to link that revolution with the fate of the revolution in europe as a whole poland germany italy maybe even great britain of course the eu is not a state perhaps we could call it a semi state surely being in the eu gives marxists opportunities or should have in any case we would not have on our own but by hunkering down in a left nationalist bunker we seem to be almost returning to a british empire mentality we can do it on our own we don t need allies we re the best but the best what even with jeremy corbyn as prime minister how far can we go the best i would think would be a left reformist government exactly what party line no19 prophesied not good enough for a communist i would think when it comes to democracy the eu has its flaws no doubt its policies are anti socialist it represents a big capital some of its countries are voting in rightist governments is the turn towards the right across europe a surprise after years of disappointment and austerity not really but those of us who have been around for a while also remember the great neoliberal love affair between margaret thatcher and ronald reagan followed by george bush both senior and junior and tony blair surely neoliberal policies were put forward in britain well before anywhere else in europe by leaving the eu are we not losing an opportunity to unite the working class across a wide area lenin after all persuaded the bolsheviks to stand in tsarist elections although these were much less democratic than the eu elections but lenin saw them as an opportunity and they were vital in winning the working class to communism surely what communists should be doing is favouring a united europe as a prelude to a socialist europe that is the most important reason for opposing brexit this does not mean supporting the existing eu far from it certainly it is the unelected commissioners and behind these the appointees the council of ministers who make the decisions the directly elected parliament is almost entirely a talking shop it possesses very little in the way of real power the eu is in effect a creaking confederation of often capricious capitalist states which show precious little solidarity for each other britain wants out poland defies eu rulings over the press and the judiciary the czech republic poland hungary and slovakia refuse to take their quota of refugees to say nothing of the savage austerity imposed on ireland portugal cyprus spain and greece yes the eu is undoubtedly a bosses club which aims to increase the exploitation of european workers in order to allow european capital to compete more effectively in world markets the eu constitution even includes in its text a binding commitment to neoliberal economics the marxist strategy for achieving socialism is predicated on large states in our case this would be the continental wide terrain established by the various eu treaties we as communists should be arguing for and working towards the unity of working class forces across the whole of europe instead of a europe of the bourgeois politicians grasping capitalists and unelected bureaucrats we should be working towards a europe without monarchies without standing armies a fully democratic and indivisible europe which is committed to the struggle for world socialism with this aim the immediate necessity is working towards organising across the eu at the highest level a communist party of the european union to pursue that strategy and for that reason alone communists should be supporting continued uk membership of the eu any real socialism in a breakaway country would be met with instant retaliation perhaps a legal coup an army mutiny asphyxiating trade embargoes a joint eu us peacemaking force the eu provides the wide sphere of operations needed to organise the working class into a ruling class when that is achieved the european working class could realistically expect to make a decisive strategic breakthrough towards the world socialist revolution i would recommended this sort of programme 1 for a republican united states of europe abolish the council of ministers and sack the unelected commissioners for a single chamber executive and legislative continental congress of the peoples of europe elected by universal suffrage and proportional representation 2 state ownership of all banks in the eu and put the european community bank under the direct democratic control of the european congress no to the stability pact and spending limits stop privatisation and so called private finance initiatives end subsidies to and tax breaks for big business tax income and capital abolish vat yes to workers control over big business and the overall direction of the economy yes to a massive programme of house building and public works 3 for the levelling up of wages and social provisions for a maximum 35 hour week and a common european minimum income end all anti trade union laws for the right to organise and the right to strike for top quality healthcare housing and education allocated according to need abolish all restrictions on abortion fight for substantive real equality between men and women 4 end the common agricultural policy all land to be state owned stop all subsidies for big farms and the ecological destruction of the countryside temporary relief for small farmers green the cities free urban and rural transport with an increase in buses and trains create extensive wilderness areas forests marshes heath land both for the preservation and rehabilitation of animal and plant life and the enjoyment and fulfilment of the population 5 no to the rapid reaction force nato and all standing armies yes to a popular democratic militia 6 no to fortress europe yes to the free movement of people into and out of the eu citizenship and voting rights for all who have been resident in the eu for more than six months 7 for the closest coordination of all working class forces in the eu promote eu wide industrial unions eg railways energy communications engineering civil service print media etc for a democratic and effective european wide trades union congress 8 for a single centralised revolutionary party the communist party of the european union since i began feeling uncomfortable with what i felt the party expected me to think on the issue of europe i have been reading and discussing widely besides the capitalist press from a number of countries of course i read the morning star daily as well as other left papers i also read the cpgb s weekly worker which because of the lengthy and meaty articles on many and varied issues has given me a great deal to think about and often to agree with as a cpb member of many years despite my doubts i have publicly expressed our party view however nothing has changed my belief that we should be arguing against the uk leaving the eu and working for the unity of the working class across the eu instead we should not be arguing to be an isolated island once again cut off from the continent by fog sororally laura

president trump is heading into the final year of his first term with a strong job market that could boost his chances of winning another four years in office the u s added jobs at a steady clip in 2019 powering through the rising costs of trump s trade battles a global economic slump and myriad geopolitical crises fears of a recession that dominated the summer have faded and the stock market has shattered record highs through the first days of 2020 with the dow jones rising above 29 000 for a time on friday the december jobs report released the same day showed the u s gaining 145 000 jobs and maintaining an unemployment rate of 3 5 percent the lowest in more than 50 years and some economists say the labor market has plenty of room to expand in the new decade the economy is pretty damn good for the vast majority of americans said claudia sahm director of macroeconomic policy at the washington center for equitable growth a d c think tank this year was good news we could have a lot more good news the resilience of the economy bodes well for trump who will be the first president ever impeached to run for reelection he s already arguing that electing a democrat could cause the economy to turn south and just in case you didn t know it ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state trump said thursday during a rally in toledo even though the state lost jobs in 2019 that s not bad that s not bad and this year is going to be even better maybe much better few economists see significant risks to the economy the federal reserve is forecasting a pause on rate cuts after slashing rates three times during an anxious mid year stretch for global markets and while the economy is expected to slow few see a significant dip or recession on the horizon still there are weak spots beneath the headline numbers that could make trump vulnerable trump s promise to revive u s manufacturing and mining jobs was central to his appeal in ohio michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania four industrial states that could make or break his reelection hiring in those sectors surged in 2018 but fell flat last year amid the rising toll of trump s tariffs and the retaliation they drew from china and europe manufacturing employment rose by just 46 000 workers in 2019 after rising by 264 000 in 2018 employment in transportation and warehousing rose 57 000 last year just one quarter of 2018 s gain of 216 000 jobs and mining employment dropped 24 000 in 2019 after rising by 63 000 in 2018 economic downturns in europe and asia also cut into global demand for u s goods driving a decline in hiring the interest rate cuts issued by foreign central banks boosted the value of the u s dollar making american goods less affordable in countries with limited buying power the mix of trade blowback and global sluggishness stunted trump s mission to revive american production u s manufacturing activity has been negative for every month since august and contracted in december to its lowest level since june 2009 according to the institute for supply management s purchasing managers index pmi 2019 was one of the weakest years we ve seen for manufacturing jobs over the last decade said scott paul president of the alliance for american manufacturing a trade group representing manufacturers and the united steelworkers paul also cited a decline in u s auto sales as a drag on manufacturing overall citing the industry s wide supply network and hefty demand for steel as trump s tariffs push its prices higher the pricing mechanisms that caused steel and aluminum to be in dire straits in the first place weren t fundamentally altered by the tariffs said paul who pointed to u s steel s recent closure of a detroit plant that resulted in 1 500 layoffs closures at steel plants auto factories and other manufacturing hubs across the midwest are red flags as trump attempts to reassemble his winning industrial coalition even so republicans in key states for trump s success say the president will have little issue pitching his record his tone and tenor has made it a little harder in some of those more traditional republican areas but i mean i ve got everything from pastors to plumbers telling me okay i maybe don t like the tone but you ve got to look at the results said rep bill huizenga r mich sahm said declines in manufacturing employment are closely connected to pockets of industrial states that have lagged behind the country she also pointed to the paltry increase in wages as proof that the labor force has ample room to expand in 2020 wages grew just 2 9 percent between december 2018 and 2019 despite unemployment remaining at or below 4 percent while economists once assumed joblessness at that level would spur massive inflation sahm said an influx of workers from the sidelines could help tighten a booming labor market these are the kind of workers that employers just hadn t been willing to hire if an employer is willing to hire them they re willing to work at a low wage sahm said if employers can keep going and getting more people she added we ve got more hours to give and that means we re not at full employment
looking back reads like a history book imbued with comic fiction the very thought in today s pakistan that our country may one day become the asian tiger is laughable in itself an historical account of pakistan s reformation set in an alternate future the book was written by dr nadeem ul haque an economist giving a blow by blow account as to how it is really possible by eliminating different threats to the system one after the other he expounds that the winds of change will ultimately come from the unlikeliest corridors of academics and ordinary citizenry who become champions of a failed state whose inevitable doom has become a foregone conclusion dr nadeemul haque was the deputy chairman of the planning commission in 2011 where he presented his infamous framework for economic growth feg for pakistan a phd from university of chicago he spent his career almost in entirety with the imf chicago school of thought what he did at imf gave him an insight into the workings of third world economies a trait he employed emphatically while designing feg his expertise in fiscal monetary policies gave him an acute advantage as he formulated the comprehensive framework which unfortunately was never implemented he was also the vice chancellor of pakistan institute of development economics it is most unfortunate that he could not get a chance to implement his framework which was highly appreciated by development practitioners of the world though the framework for economic growth was approved by the parliament its implementation remained in limbo despite the fact that its expansive and inclusive approach guarantees a growth rate of 8 percent over a period of a decade to assuage an emergent demographic challenge of youth bulge this book in my opinion is purely a manifestation of his frustrations for his inability to fix a broken system of governance despite the availability of this brilliant tool and his ideas of rfps also have born of his need for a seed of change the book is an oddity in itself fiction written by an economist an economist who probably gave the country its most emphatic blueprint for economic ascendancy and societal transformation but published by one of the more obscure publishing houses in the country an economist of his stature could ve easily gone to one of the big five and had his work published but as he so modestly put that this is for pakistani people s consumption and so kitab pvt limited put a meagre price tag so it can be accessible to all narrated from the perspective of an egyptian nobel laureate daud rashida an economist heading ptc in response to a letter by a fictional secretary general of the un in the year 2051 who requests commissioning of a report to glean an understanding of the country s meteoric rise in an alternate future dr haque takes the reader on a historical journey of pakistan s turbulent past from its nascence to a turning point of a quiet revolution in the future of this parallel universe he recounts the ills that plagued pakistan through much of its existence fundamental core issues that have retarded a real change germination of crony capitalism centralization of power and decision making laissez faire mercantile behaviour lack of regulations and enforcement ineffective taxation system absence of innovation or contemporaneous practices conformity of colonial status quo utter dependence on donors religious fundamentalist tendencies rent seeking behaviour of the political and bureaucratic elites have impeded development of the country and encouraged suppression of the people at large he explains how these extractive economic institutions have crippled the pakistani economy and is constantly increasing the rich poor disparity at the heart of these problems he singles out bureaucracy both civil and military with its rent seeking tendencies as the main culprit for much of what ails the country today an indictment of the political system he elaborates how the colonial civil service instituted to make the people subservient was further mutated by its civil servants to further their own outlook as to how the country must progress governance by the people took a back seat and the state was pushed farther and farther into the gaping abyss of stagnation dr haque also derides the donors whose priorities have slowly crept into our governance hierarchy how it contributed to ineptness and laziness in our system the story of the book recounts a cataclysmic event somewhere in 2019 which precipitated a fundamental change in the fabric of our society the change was not a revolution but an evolutionary process a quiet revolution as dr haque calls it the agents of change were not discernible actors in terms of personality or a movement they were networks of ordinary citizens who only came together for national integration and national prestige the story identifies these agents of change as research for pakistan rfp these rfp networks sprang across the national strata and were essentially a platform of research and thought genesis of rfps is the awe inspiring and provocative idea which germinated the change in dr haque s story was an unrealized change that he had actually perceived through his framework of economic growth an economist at heart dr haque intersperses his fictional work with real life economic policies and goes to great lengths in explaining his ideas in terms of economics principles complexity is one of those ideas the change he espouses is completely organic and has no well defined hierarchies the interventions and course corrections come from the adaptive interactions of agents in economy as the story continues narrated by rashida the rfps instigated change within themselves and propagated the idea to the masses whose demands gradually drove the political establishment to change direction these networks facilitated better governance by highlighting the country s issues widespread participation precipitated discourse and eventually paved way for constitutional reform by educating and informing the people and politicians electoral reforms curtailing discretionary powers of the prime minister balanced budgeting judicial independence legislation through private members empowered local governments depoliticizing service delivery and census were a few outcomes of the initial change also the country was bifurcated into twenty smaller administrative units instead of five governments went under review a little more often due to the electoral reforms this decentralization of government proved to be a boon for the economy and quality of life as public accountability increased the rent seeking bureaucracy had accumulated perks and privileges by collaboration and collusion with the corrupt political elites as the political devolution took place this pyramid of power also flattened land holdings had long been the avenue of the rent seeking behaviour the reforms abolished the privileged access to land strict regulations put into place the success norm was re aligned the private sector had long been expanding on the expense of the government as it had essentially been its integral part their mercantilist policies had distorted development donors led policies in collaboration with these industrialist politicians had also distorted production trade balance sugar automotive cotton fertilizer cement and banking sectors wreaked havoc on the economy these industrialists exploited policies shunned innovation and entrepreneurship and created oligopolies in these sectors these practices in turn gave birth to an informal economy as the trust of the people in their government vanished the taxation system targeted this informal sector instead of ending mercantilism the cities became large uncontrollable sprawls fundamentalism also became an issue in the absence of state oversight education and health sectors had deteriorated beyond disrepair however the rfp espoused approach triggered political change which cascaded a complete transformation in a quarter of a century this bottom up change broke the rent seeking and reined in the rampant bureaucracy pakistani society became an inclusive one has had double digit growth rate for the past two decades literacy is all time high and one of the healthiest countries in the world developed governance and market systems have been the true reform as the daud rashida finished the fascinating report he notes systems were built rather than sectors he states that prioritizing state building and supporting agents of change is the way to achieve this transformation from a failed state to a thriving one at the end of the book dr haque does indeed paint a very rosy picture of a pakistan none of us have thought possible as long as this is treated as a work of fiction there is absolutely nothing wrong with it but considering the fact that dr haque is a serious scientist most of his ideas are grounded in experience this future seems a little too good to be true although reforms regarding local governance decentralization and rural development are promising avenues of possible change even they are a little too optimistic it is very hard to imagine even a fraction of change that dr haque has envisioned fiscal responsibility open economy efficient judiciary and general well being of our people are pipe dreams the history of the last 75 years is diametrically opposite to the picture painted by dr haque his thesis depends on genesis of rfps and considering our societal laziness it all seems a little too far fetched thus book is an essential read for anyone who is inquisitive to comprehend the process of reform and process of development especially how to trigger the two

as one advances in age one tends to mark each new year by reflecting on the broader developments that have run in parallel with one s own lifetime for my part i usually focus on the surprises things that would have been considered unlikely or even unimaginable in my younger years i was born during world war ii and grew up in canada with a general awareness of at least some aspects of the larger world not least the cold war television allowed us to witness the destructive power of nuclear weapons from our living rooms i and many other children had watched our friend the atom on the television series walt disney s disneyland but we nonetheless would lie awake at night listening to passing planes hoping they were not bearing the instruments of our annihilation the nukes were kept in their silos owing to the deterrent effect of mutually assured destruction and the effective leadership shown during close calls like the cuban missile crisis eventually the cold war ended and anyone under 30 has spent their entire life in a world without it to most of them u s economic and military primacy probably seems as ordinary and permanent as the cold war did to baby boomers but now we are on the verge of another anxiety inducing shift in power relations
us employment remains strong 145 000 jobs added in december washington u s employers added 145 000 jobs in december and the unemployment rate held steady at 3 5 signaling that the job market remains strong at the start of 2020 even if hiring and wage gains have slowed somewhat more than a decade into an economic expansion friday s snapshot from the labor department showed hiring slipped from robust gains of 256 000 in november which were given a boost by the end of a strike at general motors for the year employers added an average of roughly 175 000 jobs per month compared with about 223 250 per month in 2018 annual wage growth fell in december to 2 9 down from an annualized average of 3 3 a year earlier a possible sign that some slack remains in the labor market and that unemployment could fall even further from its current half century low the picture of a slowly but steadily improving economy plus low inflation likely gives the federal reserve comfort in keeping interest rates low which has been a boon to stock markets the dow jones industrial average closed friday with a slight loss of 0 3 after briefly climbing to a record level of 29 000 in the morning we re starting 2020 in very good shape said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial services we should see continued economic expansion throughout 2020 driven by consumers the state of the job market has become a pivotal division between president donald trump and his democratic challengers trump can campaign on the low unemployment rate and job growth as he seeks a second term democrats seeking to oust him will point to wages that have not taken off in a meaningful for many americans coping with high costs for medical care and higher education this is the last jobs report before the iowa caucus in february that will serve as a first step for choosing the democratic presidential nominee the prospect of a stable job market a pick up in global growth supportive central banks an easing of trade tensions and u s economic growth of around 2 should be a positive for this year we really have the wind at our backs going into 2020 said julia pollak a labor economist at the employment marketplace ziprecruiter yet job growth has failed so far to translate into substantially better hourly pay there is the potential that wages jumped in january as many states adjusted their minimum wages some businesses in competitive industries are already taking steps to prepare for wage competition this year the big blue swim school based in chicago vies with day cares learning centers and gyms for its instructors the chain has five sites employing on average 30 people and plans to open five more schools this year and 17 in 2021 but it had to dramatically boost wages in order to attract staff for that expansion we gave all of our front line employees a 10 or 11 raise because of the fear we have about the wage pressures in the economy said ceo chris kenny we can t meet our business goal without great staff irina novoselsky ceo of the jobs site careerbuilder said that more employers are offering non wage benefits such as the chance to work remotely to potential workers and becoming less focused on educational credentials when hiring the major fact that is pushing the trend is the labor shortage in america she said companies are being forced to provide that flexibility the u s economy added 2 1 million jobs last year down from gains of nearly 2 7 million in 2018 hiring may have slowed because the number of unemployed people seeking work has fallen by 540 000 people over the past year to 5 75 million with fewer unemployed people hunting for jobs there is a potential limit on job gains the steady hiring growth during the expansion has contributed to gains in consumer spending retail sales during the crucial holiday shopping improved 3 4 compared to the prior year according to mastercard spendingpulse this likely contributed to a surge of hiring in retail as that sector added 41 200 jobs in december the leisure and hospitality sector which includes restaurants and hotels added another 40 000 jobs health care and social assistance accounted 33 900 new jobs still the report suggests a lingering weakness in manufacturing factories shed 12 000 jobs in december after the end of the gm strike produced gains of 58 000 in november manufacturing companies added just 46 000 jobs in all of 2019 manufacturing struggled last year because of trade tensions between the united states and china coupled with slower global economic growth safety problems at boeing have also hurt orders for aircraft and parts and that could restrict hiring at factories in 2020 while the jobs report painted a healthy picture of the economy the manufacturing sector took a blow friday as the boeing supplier spirit aerosystems announced layoffs for 2 800 workers in kansas back to top

these stocks aren t overvalued the way much of the market is today after a strong year on the markets in 2019 that saw the s p 500 rise by 30 many stocks are trading at relatively high valuations and could be due for corrections this year finding a good fairly valued dividend stock can be challenging this year however the stocks listed below all trade at reasonable valuation multiples have good financials and can deliver strong dividend income for your portfolio for many years to come 1 bce bce bce 0 72 is a top canadian telecom stock that currently pays investors a quarterly dividend of approximately 0 60 every quarter depending on the exchange rate that equates to a dividend yield of more than 5 2 per year the company has increased its dividend every year since 2009 and although it doesn t have as long a track record as a dividend aristocrat may have bce is a safe bet to continue raising its payouts for the foreseeable future strong free cash flow totaling 3 8 billion canadian dollars over the trailing twelve months and annual profits over the past three years consistently hovering around ca 3 billion make the stock a very safe buy for investors as there is a great deal of predictability in its future earnings bce had a solid 2019 with its share price climbing 17 during the year although that was still shy of the s p 500 s impressive performance with the stock trading at a forward price to earnings p e of 16 bce is an attractive long term buy for value oriented investors bce is among the industry leaders in the telecom industry in canada and there s little danger of this stock or its dividend being in any trouble anytime soon 2 glaxosmithkline glaxosmithkline gsk 0 81 offers investors a more modest dividend yield of 4 2 investors in the u k based drug manufacturer will also see variations in their dividend payments depending on the effect of foreign exchange glaxosmithkline doesn t offer the same payout every quarter but over the course of a full year u s investors can expect to earn around 2 per share the company has not increased its dividend payments in recent years but it can still be a good pillar for dividend investors to put in their portfolios as its business is also very stable with 41 different medicines that the company is developing and its profits coming in at 4 5 billion pounds over the past 12 months it s likely to remain a top healthcare stock for many years trading at a forward p e of just 15 like bce glaxosmithkline is also an attractive option for price conscious investors despite currently being near its 52 week high 3 centerpoint energy centerpoint energy cnp 0 18 is a texas based utility company and investors won t have to worry about their dividend payments fluctuating due to foreign exchange currently the company pays a quarterly dividend of 0 2875 and it has increased its payments annually since 2006 another increase may be right around the corner as the company has typically increased its payouts at the beginning of the year currently the stock s dividend payments yield around 4 3 with a strong 140 year history and operating in a stable industry centerpoint could be an ideal investment for risk averse investors who are looking to collect a recurring dividend without having to worry about much else the stock is coming off a disappointing 2019 where its share price fell by 2 6 however centerpoint is only a few dollars away from its 52 week low and it s valued at a forward p e of 16 the utility stock has low volatility and can be a good investment to hold if you re worried about a dip in the markets or some challenging economic conditions ahead all three offer investors diversification and stability the stocks listed above may not have the best growth prospects but they make up for that with stability and dividend income if you re looking for a high yielding stock bce could be the best of the three to buy today with its superior payouts however after a strong performance in 2019 and the company having many new products in the works glaxosmithkline is more optimal for investors who want to maximize any potential for capital appreciation in 2020 centerpoint meanwhile is more suitable for bargain hunters or investors who want consistency in their payouts
w hat is it like being a taxman in africa a lot of sleepless nights says yankuba darboe the gambia s top revenue official describing the pressure to meet targets politicians across africa are asking ever more of their tax collectors with good reason the biggest hole in public coffers is not money squandered or stolen but that which is never collected in the first place listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element government revenues average about 17 of gdp in sub saharan africa according to the imf nigeria has more than 300 times as many people as luxembourg but collects less tax if ethiopia shared out its tax revenues equally each citizen would get around 80 a year the government of the democratic republic of congo is so penurious that its annual health spending per person could not buy a copy of this newspaper governments once turned to aid and natural resources to stay afloat historically we relied on oil says babatunde fowler until last month the head of nigeria s federal inland revenue service nobody took taxation seriously lower oil prices are now forcing a rethink he explains so too are shifts in foreign aid as a proportion of africa s income aid flows have halved since the 1990s measured as dollars per person they peaked in 2011 and then fell public debt has risen sharply since the 1980s governments have followed an imf inspired recipe slashing trade taxes reducing top rates on personal and corporate income and embracing value added tax data from the oecd for 26 african countries show that over half of their tax revenues come from taxes on goods and services only a quarter comes from personal income tax and social security contributions about the same as in latin america but much less than in the rich world from 2008 to 2017 the ratio of tax receipts to gdp rose by 1 5 percentage points but in many countries this was offset by falls in non tax revenues such as fines rents and royalties from resource extraction large firms grumble that they are footing the bill just 6 of tax paying firms generate 78 of receipts according to the african tax administration forum ataf a club of taxmen but that statistic gives only a partial picture analysis of corporate tax returns in ethiopia by giulia mascagni of the international centre for tax and development and andualem mengistu of the ethiopian development research institute reveals that small firms pay the highest effective rate perhaps because they lack accountants to find gaps in the tax code in many countries firms which are considered informal because they are not registered or do not pay income tax still cough up for licence fees and market dues ordinary africans complain the system is rigged some 56 of those surveyed by afrobarometer a pollster considered it very likely that a rich person could pay a bribe or use personal connections to dodge taxes they are probably right when ugandan tax collectors examined records for 71 government officials in 2013 14 they found that just one had paid any personal income tax only 5 of directors at leading companies were paying income tax themselves authorities try to manage such tax dodging through dedicated units that focus on say wealthy individuals or large corporations in uganda officials built on their earlier research by drawing up a list of 117 rich folk then meeting them personally at the time only 13 were filing tax returns a year later 78 were one pastor on the list even started preaching about paying taxes the taxmen also chased government agencies it s a tax morale issue if you ask people to pay their tax and then the government is not paying its taxes says doris akol the country s top revenue official technocratic tax talk often centres on such administrative reforms which also include things like strengthening it systems or adopting taxpayer identification numbers yet this package only goes so far it says build a good tax register go to electronic filing and so on says logan wort the executive secretary of ataf those are all right but you know what the problem in africa is it has signed away its tax base one example is bilateral tax treaties originally intended to eliminate double taxation and later to attract investment their practical effect is to limit taxation of cross border income such as royalties or service fees the imf estimates that signing treaties with so called investment hubs like mauritius costs african countries an average of 15 of their corporate tax revenue without increasing investment some governments such as rwanda s have wisely renegotiated terms governments also erode the tax base by dishing out generous exemptions estimates of tax expenditures or deviations from usual tax rates put the cost at up to 40 of revenues that african governments collect those figures include some sensible allowances like tax relief on medicines as well as questionable ones such as tax holidays for investors most businesses say that tax breaks do not affect their decision to invest in surveys they tend to put greater weight on things like stability and roads which a little extra tax might fund how much more could african governments collect the best estimates are that they lose revenues worth 2 of gdp through corporate tax avoidance of all kinds and perhaps another 1 2 through individual wealth stashed offshore the revenue forgone through tax expenditures is roughly 5 of gdp it is neither feasible nor desirable to close all those gaps so the realistic gains are smaller other measures such as increasing compliance or expanding property taxes could also add a few percentage points
it took only a few days of 2020 for the violence of world events to rattle any tenuous confidence canadians may have had in our economic prospects for this year the opening week of january brought us the u s it took only a few days of 2020 for the violence of world events to rattle any tenuous confidence canadians may have had in our economic prospects for this year the opening week of january brought us the u s killing of a top iranian commander and the ensuing confusion around u s president donald trump s motives putting financial and commodity markets on edge and prompting canada to move its armed forces in iraq to safer ground separately australia burns the u k churns and iranian retaliation is in the air but as wednesday morning s heavy news of 63 canadians dead in a plane crash in iran sank in our vulnerability to the unpredictable brutality of the world suddenly became all too clear we are sad we are muddled we are fearful for the future talk of recession is everywhere and it won t take much to knock us off kilter despite projections for an economy that is expected to march along solidly economists from the country s biggest commercial banks offered up their annual prognostications for canadian growth and prosperity on this all too troubling day and they gamely reflected what the data and analysis tell them even after an astounding 11 years of expansion canada s economy will yet again inch ahead in 2020 perhaps not by leaps and bounds but with oil prices looking better than they have and with the u s still strong and canadian labour markets still solid everything will be ok ish yes there are some negative signs canadian consumers who have driven the economy for so many years don t have the oomph that they used to says beata caranci chief economist at td bank we re still spending though plus consumer insolvencies are on the rise especially in ontario as indebtedness gains the upper hand in some households she notes and the job market has pulled back recently shedding 71 000 positions in november and leading to a rise in the unemployment rate to 5 9 per cent the highest since august 2018 but businesses large and small say repeatedly that their biggest challenge these days is finding enough workers to fill their job postings about half a million positions are unfilled and canada s population is surging with immigration fuelling growth that makes other countries envious doug porter chief economist at bmo financial group points out they re bringing in skills entrepreneurialism and down payments for houses that help support stability in real estate markets especially in our big cities with oil prices making a bit of a comeback alberta and british columbia are poised to lead growth in canada porter predicts it s probably not enough to inspire a fresh round of capital investment in the oilpatch adds avery shenfeld of cibc but things will be better than they have been in recent years and the united states which can usually be counted on to tug canada along is humming scotiabank s recession indices for both canada and the u s point to only very low chances of a contraction in either country any time soon yet those recession fears persist the conference board of canada s consumer confidence index sank dramatically in december to its lowest point in three years ontario consumers have become particularly pessimistic and in alberta they re downright dismal and on wednesday a survey done for bloomberg news showed 55 per cent of respondents in canada believe there s somewhat of a chance of a recession here this year perhaps that s not too surprising given there s a reasonable sense that we re due after 11 years of expansion and with global instability coming at us from all directions at unpredictable moments of course we are nervous about the impacts on our trade dependent economy but we risk talking ourselves into a frenzy at a time when global uncertainty demands that we keep our wits about us that s where politicians can play a pivotal role the chief economists make the case for responsible politics in handling the recession mirage with care the conservatives however are feeding the fragility with public statements and ads on social media that accuse prime minister justin trudeau of setting the stage for a made in canada recession they blame the liberals for driving away business investment and undermining canada s competitive edge with high deficits and new taxes the liberals for their part haven t given canadians much cause for confidence either if or when a downturn comes the traditional remedy of turning to the central bank to cut interest rates won t work like it has in the past rates are already low and heavily indebted consumers aren t in any position to respond to them in a way that would lead to an economic recovery to a name the chief economists pointed to the need for governments to stand at the ready prepared to pick up the pieces with stimulus tax measures infrastructure spending or whatever it takes to ease the pain so far though we ve heard little in the way of a plan which only exacerbates the dangerous crumbling of consumer confidence heather
