behind the huawei story we must not forget there is a wider financial war being waged by america against china and russia stories about china s banks being short of dollars are incorrect the shortage is of inward capital flows to support the us government s budget deficit by attracting those global portfolio flows instead china s belt and road initiative threatens us government finances so the financial war and associated disinformation can be expected to escalate hong kong is likely to be in the firing line due to its role in providing china with access to international finance hong kong in trouble last week the wall street journal published an article claiming china s banks are running out of dollars clearly this is untrue china s banks can acquire dollars any time they want either by selling other foreign currencies in the market or by selling renminbi to the people s bank they have their dollar position because they choose to have it and furthermore all commercial banks use derivatives which are effectively off balance sheet exposure furthermore with the us running a substantial trade deficit with china dollars are flooding in all the time following the wsj article various other commentators have come up with similar stories how convenient it seems for the us government to see these bearish stories about china just when they need to ramp up inward portfolio flows to finance the budget deficit there is anyway a general antipathy among american investors to the china story so we should not be surprised to see the china bears restating their case one leading china bear at least by reputation for his investment shrewdness is kyle bass of hayman capital management according to zero hedge he has written his first investment letter in three years saying of hong kong today newly emergent economic and political risks threaten hong kong s decades of stability these risks are so large they merit immediate attention on both fronts if only it were so simple it is time to put the alternative case hong kong is important because china uses hong kong and london to avoid being dependent on the us banking system for international finances and that s why the us s deep state want to nail hong kong lop sided analysis bass is correct in pointing out the hong kong property market appears highly geared and that property prices for office residential and retail sectors have rocketed since the 2003 trough to a large extent it has been the inevitable consequence of the currency board link to the us dollar which broadly transfers the fed s inflationary monetary policy to hong kong s more dynamic economy bass s description of the relationship between the banks the way they finance themselves and property collateral is reminiscent of the factors that led to the secondary banking crisis in the uk in late 1973 empirical evidence appears to be firmly on bass s side except that is for a significant difference between events such as the uk s secondary banking crisis and virtually every other property crisis hong kong is a truly international center and the banks role in property transactions is as currency facilitator rather than lender in 2017 hong kong was the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment substantially property after the us and china fdi inflows rose by 104bn to total nearly 2 trillion largest investors were china followed by corporate money channeled through offshore centers so yes hong kong banks will be hurt by a property crisis but not as much as bass implies it is foreign and chinese banks that have much of the property as collateral it is not the hong kong banks that have fueled the property boom with domestic credit but foreign money bass fails to mention that a collapse in property prices and the banking system is unlikely to be confined to hong kong central banks have made significant progress in ensuring all banking systems are tied into the same credit cycle unwittingly they have simply guaranteed that the next credit crisis will hit everyone at the same time it won t be just hong kong but the eu japan britain and america everyone will be in difficulty to a greater or lesser extent interestingly the lehman crisis which occurred after hong kong property prices had already doubled from 2003 caused strong inflows to develop driving the hong kong dollar to the top of its peg the situation appears to be similar today with us outward investment at low levels but near record levels of foreign ownership of dollar assets despite hong kong s foreign direct investment standing at 2 trillion the prospect of capital repatriation to hong kong should not be ignored probably the most important claim in bass s letter is over the future of the currency peg operated by the hong kong monetary authority hkma he claims that the aggregate balance which is a line item in the hkma s balance sheet is the equivalent of the us fed s excess reserves and that once depleted the pressure on the currency board will become untenable and the peg will break the aggregate balance on the hkma s balance sheet has declined significantly over the last year from hk 180bn to hk 54 4bn currently the decision about changes in aggregate balances comes from the banks themselves and for this reason they are commonly taken to reflect capital flows into and out of the hong kong dollar this is different from aggregate balances reflecting actual pressures on the peg as suggested by bass the hkma maintains a us dollar coverage of 105 112 5 of base money currently about 110 and has further unallocated dollar reserves if necessary the peg is maintained by the hkma varying its base money not just by managing a base lending rate giving a spread over the fed s fund rate not just by influencing the commercial banks aggregate balances but by addressing the three other components that make up the monetary base these are certificates of indebtedness government notes and coins in circulation and exchange fund bills and notes efbns in practice it is the efbns in conjunction with the aggregate balances that are used to adjust the monetary base and keep the currency secured in the convertibility zone of 7 75 and 7 85 to the us dollar in maintaining the peg the hkma prioritizes maintaining it over managing the money supply there is little doubt this goes against the grain of mainstream western economists who believe inflation good deflation bad over the last year base money in hong kong contracted from hk 1 695bn to hk1 635bn does this worry the hkma not at all how the chinese will act in the circumstances of a new global credit crisis is yet to be seen but we should bear in mind that they are probably less keynesian in their approach to economics and finance than westerners admittedly they have freely used credit expansion to finance economic development but theirs is a mercantilist approach which differs significantly from ours we simply impoverish our factors of production through wealth transfer by monetary inflation we think this can be offset by fueling financial speculation and asset inflation china enhances her production and innovation by generating personal savings wealth is created by and linked more directly to production the objectives and effects of monetary and credit inflation between china s application of it and the way we do things in the west are dissimilar and it is a common mistake to ignore these differences the threat to china s ability to manage its affairs in a credit crisis is significantly less than the threat to western welfare dependent nations whose governments are highly indebted while china s is not china is sure to see the financial and monetary stability of hong kong as being vital to the mainland s interests apart from the bank of china s hong kong subsidiary being the second largest issuer of bank notes the peoples bank itself maintains reserve balances in hong kong dollars which in the circumstances kyle bass believes likely they can increase to support the hkma s management of the currency peg conclusions it is a mistake to think the hong kong property market is as much of a systemic danger as it first appears expectations of a devaluation of the peg appear to be wishful thinking by the bears far more important are the consequences of the cyber and financial war being pursued against china and russia its close ally by the american deep state under president trump it was accelerated by his trade tariff policies which are fundamentally an attack on china s economy china will be a hard nut to crack and the effect of america s trade protectionism has been to trigger a diminution in international trade which is now becoming apparent the negative effects on the american economy appear to be being underestimated the attempt to destroy huawei s 5g global ambitions is both the current and most visible part of an undeclared cyber and financial war trade protectionism was only a step along the way the financial war is now escalating with the global economy facing at least a significant recession almost certain to trigger an overdue credit crisis the chinese have long been on a financial war footing as shown by qiao liang s analysis of how america needs global portfolio flows and what they are prepared to do to attract them western thinking that the chinese and their russian allies are vulnerable to american hegemony has been disproved time and again financial analysts consistently fail to understand the chinese are not muppets china will not be provoked and by standing firm they are sure to protect hong kong and get on with diverting investment flows from a failing us economy into its belt and road initiative this will force a financial crisis on the americans of their own making at least that s how china has always seen it and they see no need for their passive financial war strategy to change
overview contrary to hopes and expectations the us made good on the presidential tweet and raised the tariff on around 200 bln of chinese goods from 10 to 25 trump indicated that the process that will levy a 25 tariff on the remaining chinese imports has begun also contrary to expectations chinese officials did not detail their response though it is expected to be forthcoming however as we noted this is not always how china plays its hand sometimes it skips the american style big announcement and simply takes action as it has with canada recently and japan in the past for example meanwhile state fund buying of chinese shares appears to have sparked the reversal higher of chinese stocks and the recovery has carried into europe as well this week s steep losses are being pared bond yields are softer in europe while the us 10 year yield which briefly dipped below the three month bill yield for the first time since march is little changed at 2 44 off seven basis points on the week the three month bill yield is 2 41 the us dollar is mostly softer though the yen and sterling are a little heavy most emerging market currencies including the battered turkish lira are finishing the week on a firmer tone asia pacific the us china trade talks resume today the general indication is that there is not much progress that can be accomplished at this level of negotiations and the head of both countries is needed to break the impasse many observers argue that the approach of past us administrations has not brought china to heel and therefore the tariff war is the only alternative we find this to be a false dilemma and have long argued that a multilateral approach boosts the chance for success there is also a sense that even if china were to adopt all the policies the us wants the rivalry would only intensify defying economic logic japan reported both weaker than expected cash wages and stronger than expected consumption labor cash earnings fell 1 9 year over year in march economists surveyed by bloomberg expected a 0 5 decline median after a revised 0 7 decline in february initially 0 8 it is the third consecutive decline and is the biggest drop in a decade on the other hand household spending accelerated to 2 1 from 1 7 year over year economists had projected slow consumption it was the strongest gain since last august while some increase in consumption is possible ahead of the sales tax increase october it seems a bit early to look for it in the monetary policy statement the reserve bank of australia slashed growth forecasts to 1 75 in the year to june from 2 5 however its reluctance to cut rates may be linked to its view that the economy will re accelerate it reduced its outlook for consumption and investment but continues to count on the robust labor market for the economic resilience it continues to project meanwhile in an unusual move at least a couple of australian banks have pressed forward and announced cuts in mortgage rates the rba meets next on june 4 but the derivatives markets suggest better prospects for a cut at the july 2 meeting today is the first time this week that the dollar is holding above the previous session s low against the yen it has yet to rise above the previous session s high this week yesterday s range was roughly jpy109 50 to jpy110 10 there are two expiring options that in play jpy109 75 for about 475 mln and jpy110 00 for around 525 mln a higher close today would snap a five day dollar slide the australian dollar has traded in a 20 tick range on either side of 0 7000 if it is unable to close above the high already recorded it will be the fourth consecutive weekly losses for the aussie the greenback fell less than 0 2 against the chinese yuan today but it was sufficient to end its six day rally the dollar rose about 1 2 against the yuan this week the most since last june europe the uk reported growth accelerated in q1 to 0 5 from a 0 2 pace in q4 18 even as the economy stagnated in march consumption 0 7 quarter over quarter up from 0 3 in q4 and gross fixed capital formation 2 1 vs 0 6 were the drivers imports surged as companies and households took precautionary measures ahead brexit the softness of march monthly data warns of the lack of momentum coming into q2 some april employment data will be released next week but brexit continues to command the focus germany will report q1 gdp next week and today s trade figures will fuel some optimism despite the weakness in survey data many observers may complain about germany s large trade surplus but the unexpected increase in march exports will likely be seen as a constructive development exports jumped 1 5 on the month the median guestimate in the bloomberg survey was for a decline of 0 4 after a 1 2 decline in february german imports rose 0 4 in line with expectations imports fell by 1 6 in february france reported march industrial production figures 0 9 driven by a 1 0 drop in manufacturing output as did italy 0 9 drop in march industrial output alongside retail sales 0 3 vs forecasts for a 0 1 gain however with q1 gdp already reported and being halfway through q2 the data was of fleeting interest the euro closed above its 20 day moving average yesterday for the first time since april 22 and reach a six day high near 1 1250 of the last 11 sessions beginning with the stronger than expected us q1 gdp on april 26 the euro has risen in eight if today s gains are sustained today could be the first session since april 22 that the euro has remained above 1 12 sterling is struggling to sustain upticks and is hovering around 1 30 it is off roughly 1 2 for the week its largest loss since the end of march there is a gbp225 mln option at 1 30 that will be cut today which may hold some interest a softer us dollar could see sterling test the 1 3040 area but there is little enthusiasm america while the trade talks resume the us reports april cpi both the headline and core rates are expected to tick up to 2 1 the response is likely to be stronger on a downside miss than an upside surprise powell and some other fed officials have indicated that the recent softness in inflation was transitory recall that the headline rate had risen to 2 9 last summer before falling to 1 5 1 6 at the start of the year the issue here is not the secular decline but the recent softness the other important point is that despite the repeated claims to the contrary the federal reserve s inflation target of 2 applies to the headline pce deflator and not the core rate canada reports april employment data canada lost jobs in march 7 2k for the first time in seven months but is forecast to have grown around 11 5k jobs in april the market often seems to respond to the headline more than the mix between full and part time positions the hourly wage rate for permanent workers is also reported it had bottomed at the end last year below 1 5 in march it was 2 3 and it is expected to have maintained that pace in april mexico reports march industrial production and manufacturing data it is expected to be soft but with prices still firm the central bank is unlikely to cut rates at next week s meeting the us dollar briefly poked above cad1 35 yesterday but it quickly returned into the cad1 34 cad1 35 range that has dominated recently initial support is seen near cad1 3430 but the range is likely to be respected the us dollar spiked above mxn19 30 for the first time in a month the first level of support is pegged around mxn19 15 and then mxn19 10 levered accounts have done well in mexican cetes bills and are unlikely to give up that cash register making them buyers of peso into weakness we note that the s p 500 came close to filling the gap created by the higher opening on april 1 which underpinned out technical bullish outlook before the gap was closed the s p 500 recovered to fill the gap that was created by yesterday s sharply lower opening today s performance will shape next week s technical tone a close above 2880 would be constructive and above 2900 would likely embolden those who fear missing out

and the ontario gas utility business hit record dispatch days in january and february we also benefited from strong margins in our energy services business this quarter this strong operating performance in combination with new projects that came into service this past year drove record ebitda in the first quarter although the line 3 in service delay to 2020 relative to our full year 2019

already the operating and financial performance of our core low risk businesses have been strong and reliable our balance sheet has been reinforced and we now have significant financial flexibility which has among other things enabled us to eliminate our drip and move to a self funded growth model and we re also seeing significant efficiencies take hold namely elimination of our sponsored

446 million or 0 68 per share compared to the same period in 2018 the period over period comparability of earnings attributable to common shareholders was impacted by certain unusual and infrequent factors including the absence in 2019 of a non cash charge resulting from the write down of assets held for sale in 2018 and the change in non cash derivative fair value gains and losses also driving higher gaap earnings was the impact of stronger business performance as described below adjusted earnings in the first quarter 2019 increased by 265 million the increase was primarily driven by strong operating results and operating cost efficiencies across many of the company s business units partially offset by the loss of contributions from assets which were sold during 2018 on a per share basis adjusted earnings decreased by 0 01 per share compared to the same period in 2018 reflecting a higher share count after enbridge s common equity financed acquisition of all of the outstanding equity

agency pca as well as other local government agencies in minnesota during the quarter the dnr and the pca published processes and timelines for issuing their environmental permitting by november 2019 enbridge anticipates that the remaining federal permits will be finalized approximately 30 to 60 days thereafter this new permitting schedule updates the company s prior expectation for the receipt of final state permits in the second quarter of 2019 which underpinned an expected in service date before the end of 2019 in light of this new permitting timeline the company is developing a revised construction schedule and related cost estimates for the line 3 replacement project however as previously disclosed based on the new permitting timeline the company expects an in service date during the second half of 2020 construction costs for the line 3 replacement project are tracking below budget in canada and above budget in the u s due to permitting delays in minnesota depending on the final in service date there is a risk that the project will exceed the company s total cost estimate of 9 billion however the company does not anticipate any capital cost impacts that are material to enbridge s financial position and outlook other business updates enbridge has been advancing discussions with industry on the terms of a new commercial framework for the liquids mainline system to

period in 2018 the key drivers of quarter over quarter growth are summarized below an increase in adjusted ebitda primarily due to strong business performance across most business segments and

interest following the completion of enbridge s buy in of the publicly held interest in its sponsored vehicles which were completed in separate transactions in the fourth quarter of 2018 higher equity distributions from equity investments due to strong performance as well as new equity investments placed into service partially offsetting the dcf growth drivers noted above were higher financing costs resulting from incremental debt preferred shares and hybrid securities issued since the first quarter of 2018 partially offset by interest expense savings from debt repayments made in the second half of 2018 higher current tax which in part reflected higher earnings before income tax generated from operating segments adjusted earnings three months ended march 31 2019 2018 unaudited millions

growth in adjusted earnings was driven by the same factors impacting business performance and adjusted ebitda as discussed under distributable cash flow above other notable quarter over quarter drivers were lower earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest following the completion of enbridge s buy in of the publicly held interest in its sponsored vehicles which were completed in separate transactions in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offsetting the adjusted earnings growth drivers noted above higher depreciation and amortization expense as a result of placing new assets into service net of depreciation expense no longer recorded for assets which were classified as assets held for sale or sold during 2018 higher income tax expense in part due to higher earnings before tax and a higher effective income tax rate the period over period increase in the effective income tax rate is partly due to the buy in of the us master limited partnerships mlp enbridge energy partners l p and spectra energy partners lp which results in the company being taxed on 100 of the mlp earnings rather than the company s proportionate share of their earnings adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2019 decreased by 0 01 compared with the first quarter of 2018 the increase in adjusted earnings noted above was offset on a per share basis by the issuance of

quarter over quarter performance drivers are summarized below mainline system ebitda contribution increased primarily due to higher throughput driven by strong supply and continued optimizations of

to hedge united states dollar denominated revenues from the canadian portion of the mainline system dollar denominated revenues from the canadian portion of the mainline system regional oil sands system contribution increased in part due to incremental ebitda generated from the aoc lateral acquisition which closed in early 2019 gulf coast and mid continent system growth was driven by higher

amalgamation the financial results of egi reflect the combined performance of the two legacy utility operations gas distribution adjusted ebitda will typically follow a seasonal profile it is generally highest in the first and fourth quarters of the year reflecting greater volumetric usage during the heating season and lowest in the third quarter as there is generally less volumetric usage

colder weather in egi s franchise areas in the first quarter of 2019 driving higher utilization relative to 2018 along with higher distribution charges primarily resulting from increases in distribution rates and customer base and absence of earnings sharing which was recorded in the first quarter of 2018 under egd s previous incentive rate structure the colder weather in the first

overview contrary to hopes and expectations the us made good on the presidential tweet and raised the tariff on around 200 bln of chinese goods from 10 to 25 trump indicated that the process that will levy a 25 tariff on the remaining chinese imports has begun also contrary to expectations chinese officials did not detail their response though it is expected to be forthcoming however as we noted this is not always how china plays its hand sometimes it skips the american style big announcement and simply takes action as it has with canada recently and japan in the past for example meanwhile state fund buying of chinese shares appears to have sparked the reversal higher of chinese stocks and the recovery has carried into europe as well this week s steep losses are being pared bond yields are softer in europe while the us 10 year yield which briefly dipped below the three month bill yield for the first time since march is little changed at 2 44 off seven basis points on the week the three month bill yield is 2 41 the us dollar is mostly softer though the yen and sterling are a little heavy most emerging market currencies including the battered turkish lira are finishing the week on a firmer tone asia pacific the us china trade talks resume today the general indication is that there is not much progress that can be accomplished at this level of negotiations and the head of both countries is needed to break the impasse many observers argue that the approach of past us administrations has not brought china to heel and therefore the tariff war is the only alternative we find this to be a false dilemma and have long argued that a multilateral approach boosts the chance for success there is also a sense that even if china were to adopt all the policies the us wants the rivalry would only intensify defying economic logic japan reported both weaker than expected cash wages and stronger than expected consumption labor cash earnings fell 1 9 year over year in march economists surveyed by bloomberg expected a 0 5 decline median after a revised 0 7 decline in february initially 0 8 it is the third consecutive decline and is the biggest drop in a decade on the other hand household spending accelerated to 2 1 from 1 7 year over year economists had projected slow consumption it was the strongest gain since last august while some increase in consumption is possible ahead of the sales tax increase october it seems a bit early to look for it in the monetary policy statement the reserve bank of australia slashed growth forecasts to 1 75 in the year to june from 2 5 however its reluctance to cut rates may be linked to its view that the economy will re accelerate it reduced its outlook for consumption and investment but continues to count on the robust labor market for the economic resilience it continues to project meanwhile in an unusual move at least a couple of australian banks have pressed forward and announced cuts in mortgage rates the rba meets next on june 4 but the derivatives markets suggest better prospects for a cut at the july 2 meeting today is the first time this week that the dollar is holding above the previous session s low against the yen it has yet to rise above the previous session s high this week yesterday s range was roughly jpy109 50 to jpy110 10 there are two expiring options that in play jpy109 75 for about 475 mln and jpy110 00 for around 525 mln a higher close today would snap a five day dollar slide the australian dollar has traded in a 20 tick range on either side of 0 7000 if it is unable to close above the high already recorded it will be the fourth consecutive weekly losses for the aussie the greenback fell less than 0 2 against the chinese yuan today but it was sufficient to end its six day rally the dollar rose about 1 2 against the yuan this week the most since last june europe the uk reported growth accelerated in q1 to 0 5 from a 0 2 pace in q4 18 even as the economy stagnated in march consumption 0 7 quarter over quarter up from 0 3 in q4 and gross fixed capital formation 2 1 vs 0 6 were the drivers imports surged as companies and households took precautionary measures ahead brexit the softness of march monthly data warns of the lack of momentum coming into q2 some april employment data will be released next week but brexit continues to command the focus germany will report q1 gdp next week and today s trade figures will fuel some optimism despite the weakness in survey data many observers may complain about germany s large trade surplus but the unexpected increase in march exports will likely be seen as a constructive development exports jumped 1 5 on the month the median guestimate in the bloomberg survey was for a decline of 0 4 after a 1 2 decline in february german imports rose 0 4 in line with expectations imports fell by 1 6 in february france reported march industrial production figures 0 9 driven by a 1 0 drop in manufacturing output as did italy 0 9 drop in march industrial output alongside retail sales 0 3 vs forecasts for a 0 1 gain however with q1 gdp already reported and being halfway through q2 the data was of fleeting interest the euro closed above its 20 day moving average yesterday for the first time since april 22 and reach a six day high near 1 1250 of the last 11 sessions beginning with the stronger than expected us q1 gdp on april 26 the euro has risen in eight if today s gains are sustained today could be the first session since april 22 that the euro has remained above 1 12 sterling is struggling to sustain upticks and is hovering around 1 30 it is off roughly 1 2 for the week its largest loss since the end of march there is a gbp225 mln option at 1 30 that will be cut today which may hold some interest a softer us dollar could see sterling test the 1 3040 area but there is little enthusiasm america while the trade talks resume the us reports april cpi both the headline and core rates are expected to tick up to 2 1 the response is likely to be stronger on a downside miss than an upside surprise powell and some other fed officials have indicated that the recent softness in inflation was transitory recall that the headline rate had risen to 2 9 last summer before falling to 1 5 1 6 at the start of the year the issue here is not the secular decline but the recent softness the other important point is that despite the repeated claims to the contrary the federal reserve s inflation target of 2 applies to the headline pce deflator and not the core rate canada reports april employment data canada lost jobs in march 7 2k for the first time in seven months but is forecast to have grown around 11 5k jobs in april the market often seems to respond to the headline more than the mix between full and part time positions the hourly wage rate for permanent workers is also reported it had bottomed at the end last year below 1 5 in march it was 2 3 and it is expected to have maintained that pace in april mexico reports march industrial production and manufacturing data it is expected to be soft but with prices still firm the central bank is unlikely to cut rates at next week s meeting the us dollar briefly poked above cad1 35 yesterday but it quickly returned into the cad1 34 cad1 35 range that has dominated recently initial support is seen near cad1 3430 but the range is likely to be respected the us dollar spiked above mxn19 30 for the first time in a month the first level of support is pegged around mxn19 15 and then mxn19 10 levered accounts have done well in mexican cetes bills and are unlikely to give up that cash register making them buyers of peso into weakness we note that the s p 500 came close to filling the gap created by the higher opening on april 1 which underpinned out technical bullish outlook before the gap was closed the s p 500 recovered to fill the gap that was created by yesterday s sharply lower opening today s performance will shape next week s technical tone a close above 2880 would be constructive and above 2900 would likely embolden those who fear missing out disclaimer
if there is any one thing that has changed dramatically in the last 10 years it is the growing predominance of china in asia on many fronts and the hostile and increasingly bipartisan reaction to these developments in washington as the us china and other influential countries like india japan and australia all jockey for influence in asia sri lanka is in an excellent position to benefit from and even play off these countries against each other your strategic location on the busiest shipping lanes your democratic character and your economic openness make sri lanka an attractive partner former us ambassador to sri lanka robert o blake jr and currently senior director india and south asia of mclarty associates based in washington d c delivered a speech at the bmich on 7may the second in a series of seminars held by the pathfinder foundation and joint apparel association forum of sri lanka i return to sri lanka with mixed emotions it is wonderful to be back and to see the many positive changes that have taken place in the 10 years since i departed sri lanka and i appreciate the hospitality and leadership of my old friend milinda and the dynamic role of the pathfinder foundation but i and sri lanka s many friends in the us were also deeply saddened by the horrific easter sunday attacks that took the lives of so many and threatened to open new cleavages in sri lanka more on that later in my speech milinda asked me to talk about sri lanka s place in the administration s indo pacific vision as we look ahead how china is viewed in the us and the implications of all this for the future of us sl relations if there is any one thing that has changed dramatically in the last 10 years it is the growing predominance of china in asia on many fronts and the hostile and increasingly bipartisan reaction to these developments in washington everyone seems to focus on the trade frictions between the us and china but that is just one facet of a much larger and increasingly hostile competition between the us and china washington s list of concerns includes but is not limited to the following the influence of china s belt and road initiative and the debt labour and other impacts it has had on recipient countries china s militarisation of disputed islands in the south china sea china s growing surveillance state powered by artificial intelligence and propagated by companies such as huawei chinese theft of us company intellectual property chinese cyber attacks and cyber theft china s suppression of its uighur population the growing role of the chinese communist party and soes the widening gap between what chinese citizens and companies can do in the west as against what westerners are permitted in china underlying many of these concerns is a growing understanding that the us may have made a misguided strategic bet about china when then president clinton made the case that the us should support china s entry into the wto even though china was not yet a market economy he and most americans myself included believed that as china prospered as its middle class grew as more and more chinese travelled and studied abroad china would over time become more of a market economy and become more democratic today most americans see that this strategic calculation was wrong under xi jinping we have seen a strengthening of the role of the communist party a doubling down on the role of the state and soes in china s economy and the strengthening of china s surveillance state not only is china not a more liberal market economy it is often seeking to promote its illiberal governance model overseas most asian countries acknowledge and even share many of these concerns but they also do not want to be asked to make a choice between the united states and china they particularly want to benefit from the massive resources china is extending under its ambitious belt and road initiative china s ambassador to the us published an oped in forbes two weeks ago in which he summarised the vast scope of bri according to the ambassador 126 countries and 29 international organisations have signed bri cooperation documents with china total trade between china and other belt and road countries has exceeded 6 trillion and china s investment in these countries hassurpassed 80 billion to put these figures into context china committed 113 billion in bri financing in 2017 which substantially exceeded the commitments of the world bank and adb combined but increasingly we find pushback from bri recipients debt diplomacy the case of sri lanka s own port of hambantota has become a watchword for the rest of the world that countries must make sure they choose projects that have solid internal rates of return that will enable them to service the debt owed to china or they will face chinese pressures to convert that debt to equity labour issues every recipient country also grapples with chinese pressure to use chinese labour on these bri projects when almost every country has surplus labour of their own for whom they want to provide opportunities for work lack of transparency most bri projects also face criticism for the lack of transparency about the financial terms of the loans the extent of chinese labour and other such sensitive issues environmental concerns wri published a recent analysis of bri lending from 2014 17 found that chinese energy and transport projects in bri countries did not align with the low carbon priorities recipient countries outlined in their paris pledges what are recipient countries to do first the countries involved in bri must be more forceful and clearer in negotiating with the chinese this is already happening the wsj recently reported that last year myanmar renegotiated terms for a 7 3 billion chinese funded deep water port and industrial zone shrinking the scope of the project and slashing the country s future debt burden to its economic powerhouse neighbour pakistan malaysia myanmar bangladesh and sierra leone also have backed away from bri projects likewise the maldives has announced its own review of bri contracts undertaken by the previous government to ensure it is servicing only the debt for the true value of the projects undertaken not for the inflated cost of what the new government alleges were large corrupt kickbacks on both sides in indonesia where i served as ambassador from 2013 16 the signature bri program is jakarta bandung high speed rail many questioned the need for a 6 billion rail line given so many other infrastructure needs nindonesian ministers have criticised the high speed rail project for being opaque and non transparent complaining that even cabinet members are having trouble getting data and information the good news is that china is beginning to respond to these concerns in a speech on 26april to mark the latest bri conference president xi jinping told the conference that everything should be done in a transparent way and we should have zero tolerance for corruption and we also need to ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects so that they will achieve the intended goals as planned in another sign of greater transparency xi said china would welcome the participation of multilateral and international financial institutions in belt and road investment and financing the chinese also pledged to defuse tensions with belt and road recipients expressing willingness in principle to renegotiate debts beijing decided to forgive ethiopia s interest payments owed through the end of 2018 there are other signs china is sensitive to the criticism it has received china itself and unep have formed international coalition for green development on the belt and road to make bri greener and more sustainable the coalition includes all the major environmental groups bri countries and key chinese businesses who are major bri contractors batang toru example part of a coalition with global wildlife conservation wwf and others letter by cong henry waxman and others boc said in march by announcing it would review its loan so china is listening the test will come whether we see concrete changes implemented so how has the us sought to advance its interests in the asia pacific and respond to china s growing influence in some ways the trump administration has responded well to china s increased diplomatic and infrastructure promotion efforts first recognising that it is not enough to simply criticise bri from the sidelines the administration and congress understood that the us and other partners must provide alternatives so partner countries have choices last october the build act was signed into law it created a new us international development finance corporation which will incorporate the opic and make available financing totalling 60 billion more than double what opic had provided in the past this in turn will unlock over 30 billion in additional funding to facilitate private sector investments in the region the idfc will offer loans loan guarantees and risk insurance to support new investments they will also make equity investments and fund feasibility studies or potential investments making it even easier to collaborate with partner finance institutions now of course the idfc s 60 billion does not come close to the trillion dollars in bri financing but itdoes provide countries alternatives and in that way will oblige china to be more transparent and responsive to the needs of recipient countries the us also has signalled its readiness to cooperate with partners such as japan and india in co financing projects further expanding the scope and scale of alternatives investment these resources complement the significant us private sector investment in the asia pacific the value of us foreign direct investment in the region is nearly 1 trillion far outstripping what china or any other country has invested moreover it is not widely known that our investment in asia has more than doubled over the last decade and made the us the largest source of the region s foreign investment i also want to credit the administration s security commitment to the region one of the secretary of defencemattis first acts was to rename our pacific command to be the new indo pacific command showing our understanding that we must have one vision for the indian and pacific oceans and recognising india s growing power and influence across the asia pacific and the importance the us attaches to our partnership with india the administration also has sustained our high level military to military engagement in the region in most countries in asia where we have military partnerships the us is the largest military exercise partner and the largest provider of military training and the administration has shown a steadfast commitment to continuing our longstanding commitment to ensuring freedom of navigation throughout the indo pacific but particularly in sensitive areas such as the south china sea this security commitment has underpinned asia s extraordinary economic rise for the last 50 years current administration has damaged us interests in the asia pacific but in important other ways the current administration has damaged us interests in the asia pacific let me mention two the first is on the trade front fulfilling a misguided campaign promise one of president trump s first acts was to withdraw the united states from the trans pacific partnership which the obama administration had played such a pivotal role in helping to negotiate since sri lanka is not a tpp member i will not belabour this point except to say that almost every american business person working in asia regrets this act of unilateral disarmament particularly since the trump administration has not moved to negotiate bilateral or multilateral agreements to fill the gap sri lanka must also be careful not to allow isis or other extreme islamic groups to take root although the precise role of isis in the attacks remains to be investigated one must ask why sri lanka proved a tempting target of opportunity first they may have calculated that since muslim christian relations have historically been good and extreme islamic thought has never gained wide favour on the island they and ntj could organise with undue scrutiny secondly they probably calculated that the security forces have relaxed their efforts since 2009 and to the extent they were still concerned that concern was more likely on preventing a revival of the ltte second there is a general perception across most of the asia pacific that the us places less of a priority on asia than under president obama unlike obama trump has attended only one of the east asia and apec summits one of the few leaders to do so the president s absence is magnified by the trump administration s painfully slow progress in filling sub cabinet and ambassadorial positions just to take two examples of relevance to all of you more than two and a half years into trump s four year term we still do not have assistant secretaries of state for either east asia or south and central asia these are the point persons who are responsible for developing and executing our policy in these regions and who supervise the work of our ambassadors and their interagency teams in these regions you all recall i was a s for sca under obama obama took office in january congress approved my nomination in june of the same year us sri lanka relations let me now turn to us sri lankan relations as the us china and other influential countries like india japan and australia all jockey for influence in asia sri lanka is in an excellent position to benefit from and even play off these countries against each other your strategic location on the busiest shipping lanes your democratic character and your economic openness make sri lanka an attractive partner contd on page 14 but of course there are also caveats let me first give a brief assessment of us sri lankan relations and then offer some advice about how sri lanka can best capitalise on and benefit from the growing strategic stakes of the world in the indo pacific the current government s embrace of the need for reconciliation and healing after sri lanka s 26 year conflict has enabled steady progress in us sri lankan relations over the last several years the us and sri lanka now have regular constructive high level diplomatic contacts until the us withdrew from the unhrc we worked together to co sponsor unhrc resolutions on sri lanka and other matters turning an area of friction into opportunities for collaboration i am pleased that our military to military relations have progressed substantially from the days when i was ambassador in the last years of the war in 2008 and 2009 human rights concern almost completely circumscribed our military exercises training and assistance with the sri lankan army and air force i had to fight hard to maintain even small areas of navy to navy cooperation in part by arguing that it was in our interest to help sri lanka interdict ltte arms shipments today i am happy those restrictions are behind us our two militaries train together in areas ranging from maritime security to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief the us has announced plans for new security assistance of 39 million to sri lanka to support maritime security freedom of navigation and maritime domain awareness in 2018 the us transferred a us coast guard cutter to the sri lankan navy and we have regular joint training and exercises with all the services all these are signs of a healthy and growing military partnership likewise our law enforcement cooperation has strengthened there is no better sign of that than the quick and substantial fbi response to sri lanka s request for assistance in its investigation of the easter sunday bombings our economic relations likewise have seen welcome progress over the past 10 years our two way trade has increased by 40 to 3 2 billion and the united states remains sri lanka s largest export market us companies have invested more than 300 million in sri lanka generating high quality jobs for sri lanka s people another welcome sign of progress is that talks are proceeding well on a new millennium challenge corporation compact with sri lanka on 25april the mcc board approved a new compact agreement for sri lanka that is designed to expand economic opportunities and reduce poverty here this is a strong signal of confidence four days after the easter bombings here these decisions are made only after careful study of underlying governance trends i had the dubious pleasure when i was ambassador of cancelling a planned compact in 2008 because of declining governance indicators this new compact is therefore a concrete signal of us confidence but also one that will depend on sri lanka s adroit handling of the post easter crisis aftermath easter bombings let me now turn to some thoughts about how sri lanka can sustain progress in its relations with the us particularly given the new challenges posed by the terrible easter sunday bombings my old boss deputy secretary of state bill burns who is probably the most respected american diplomat of this generation used to joke that us diplomats are never shy about giving advice often when it is unwelcome the easter attacks were not just personal tragedies for the families of those killed and wounded they opened old wounds still fresh from sri lanka s 26 year civil conflict and they raised new questions in the minds of potential business partners about the wisdom of doing business in sri lanka what steps should sri lanka take to successfully manage these new challenges and sustain its progress of the last 10 years job one of course must be to pursue with vigour the investigation into who was responsible what links they had outside terrorist groups how the bombers were able to mount such a sophisticated and well coordinated series of attacks in multiple cities without detection from your intelligence and security services and what networks may remain so the sri lankan people can be sure the threat has abated one priority during this phase of investigating and hopefully wrapping up any remaining terrorist elements must be for the government and security services to conduct investigations in a professional and impartial manner that respects the rights of all sri lankans and does not inadvertently add to the problem the government should also make every effort to limit scope and duration of emergency regulations sri lanka can learn from mistakes america made after 9 11 most civil liberties experts believe the us over reactedby expanding government surveillance without appropriate constitutional checks by extended detentionsat guantánamo bay that circumscribed the legal rights of detainees by extraordinary renditions and interrogations all of which gave rise to questions of what the limits of government power should be in times of crisis our system of checks and balances ultimately righted most of these wrongs and the press had a powerful role to play in exposing excesses and wrong doing sri lanka can also benefit from another us lesson learned after 9 11 one of our mistakes was that there was poor communication and intelligence sharing between the cia fbi and other agencies to improve interagency communication and cooperation the bush white house established a working group of senior technocrats from all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies this group met regularly to evaluate all intelligence from all sources and agree on responsibility for follow up on specific threats the group was headed by dnsa john brennan who reported directly to the president sri lanka could benefit from a similar high level group sri lanka must also be careful not to allow isis or other extreme islamic groups to take root although the precise role of isis in the attacks remains to be investigated one must ask why sri lanka proved a tempting target of opportunity first they may have calculated that since muslim christian relations have historically been good and extreme islamic thought has never gained wide favour on the island they and ntj could organise with undue scrutiny secondly they probably calculated that the security forces have relaxed their efforts since 2009 and to the extent they were still concerned that concern was more likely on preventing a revival of the ltte having suffered the loss of their self proclaimed caliphate and territory in iraq and syria isis must show its followers it is still relevant and strong without a central caliphate isis is metastasising into smaller units wherever opportunities present themselves one is in the southern philippines where they are seeking a beach head in se asia but they are also looking to use bombings such as those in sri lanka to sow discord between muslim christian and other communities that they can then exploit for their evil ends sri lanka cannot allow that to happen which brings me to my third recommendation which is that sri lanka needs to give new focus and priority to reconciliation and good governance the easter sunday bombings opened a potential new divide in sri lanka s already complex ethnic amalgam sri lanka continues to debate the pace and scope of reforms aimed at reconciliation between sinhalese and tamils some tensions remain as important priorities such as a truth and reconciliation commission reparations and accountability remain on the drawing board even as sinhalese tamil reconciliation remains a work in progress the easter bombings threaten to open new wounds and cleavages in sri lankan society and raise new questions will the attack on st anthony s church in batticaloa rekindle memories of the tamil muslim violence in the east during the country s civil war will extremist sinhalese buddhist groups seek to exploit popular anger about the attacks to renew their attacks on muslims as we saw most recently in kandy in may of last year will christians themselves the victims of muslim and sinhalese buddhist violence seek their own retribution this complex and combustible mix requires the country to come together for a national dialogue given the political chasm and open antipathy between the president and prime minister careful thoughtmust be given as to who might lead such efforts two good places to start would be sri lanka s religious leaders and its youth groups cardinal ranjith has managed the aftermath of the attacks with considerable aplomb and grace and there is a long history of interfaith dialogue that can help bring these disparate communities together and reduce tensions with tensions high and the possibility that social media can be misused to spread false rumours the communities would be wise to set up an early warning system to monitor rumours and then have senior religious figures quickly deny these this system has worked well in eastern indonesia likewise i was impressed that after the war youth groups like sri lanka unites sprang up to counter extremist narratives and engage sri lanka s youth so they became part of the solution but religious leaders and young people can only do so much the government itself has a crucial role to play to heal old and fresh wounds every sri lankan citizen should be able to count on equal justice and no group that breaks the law or violates the rights of other citizens should be above the law renewed thought should be given to increasing tamil and muslim recruits in the country s security services so they more accurately reflect sri lankan society as a whole the same should be done with the civil service islamophobia already on the rise in india and my own country should not be allowed to take root in sri lanka in the end any country s response must depend not on its political leaders who too often succumb to the temptation to defend narrow party and personal interests but rather on the strength of its institutions the recent constitutional crisis underlined the critical role of independent institutions like the constitutional council and the judiciary their continued independence will be an important part of restoring faith in sri lanka s ability to recover and prosper they are also looking to use bombings such as those in sri lanka to sow discord between muslim christian and other communities that they can then exploit for their evil ends sri lanka cannot allow that to happen with your relatively small market you must compensate by having world class openness and ease of doing business sri lanka is ranked 100 among 190 economies according to the latest world bank ease of doing business ratings it is true that sri lanka improved to 100 in 2018 from 111 in 2017 but 100 is still far too low to draw investors away from more attractive opportunities elsewhere economic reforms let me now turn to the business climate international business looks to invest in countries that offer not only economic opportunity but also stability and predictability sri lanka s strategic location its relatively open market and its relatively well educated work force certainly will bring international business to your door but then they will measure the relative merits and risks of doing business here versus in huge and growing markets such as india or asean and sri lanka will often be found wanting in such comparisons certainly sri lanka has made impressive progress to boost its tourism sector that will face new challenges after the recent bombings apparel exports continue to thrive but efforts to diversify sources of growth beyond these areas have yielded little what to do with your relatively small market you must compensate by having world class openness and ease of doing business sri lanka is ranked 100 among 190 economies according to the latest world bank ease of doing business ratings it is true that sri lanka improved to 100 in 2018 from 111 in 2017 but 100 is still far too low to draw investors away from more attractive opportunities elsewhere india for example is 23 points better and prime minister modi has vowed that india will get to 50 countries such as uzbekistan albania and mongolia are still further up the rankings from sri lanka handicapped by what inevitably will be investor security apprehensions the country should therefore undertake efforts to work not only with the world bank to undertake more systematic reform efforts but benchmark those against those of nearby competitors like vietnam and india in the same vein more fundamental reforms are needed to address corruption transparency international ranks sri lanka 89 on its corruption perception index countries such as china belarus and cuba that any knowledgeable observer might guess would rank below sri lanka in fact rank above that should not be third as ai iot robotics and other new technologies shape the 21st century business future that future will belong to the educated in his influential new book on ai superpowers kai fu lee who headed google s ai efforts in china then started vcs in ai companies first in china then silicon valley predicts that the us and china will dominate ai because both generate huge and growing amounts have data have universities training world class engineers and have vcs to power further investment countries like sri lanka that want to succeed in this increasingly competitive environment will be wise to invest in their own universities who can then partner with us and chinese companies to support the research that can catalyse sri lanka specific ai growth unfettered pure research still matters credit suisse report thatalthough china accounted for nearly one third of the world s 326 startups valued at 1 billion or more its share of unicorns in sectors requiring more advanced scientific research capability such as ai big data robotics and software was just 14 percent compared to 40 in the us let me give another example from my own country erie pennsylvania which most people associate with the rust belt and aging uncompetitive factories most big factories there indeed have closed in recent years but the city is rebuilding itself around its local universities and a big insurance company profits from a big gambling casino in erie county are funnelled partly to innovation spaces at four local campuses that are enabling erie to re invent itself sri lanka can do the same companies like accenture already are operating here to help your export oriented companies maintain their competitive edge sri lanka should prioritise developing partnerships with us universities that will enable bright young sri lankans to get degrees in ai iot cybersecurity and other fields that will increasingly underline growth and competitiveness in this century companies like coursera can offer intermediate solutions through online courses offered by our best universities as well as companies such as google and cyber security specialists palo alto network let me conclude on a note of optimism sri lanka stands to benefit from the us and chinese competition for influence in the asia pacific but it will need strong and unified political leadership to fully investigate the easter bombings an even handed security approach and a new commitment to reconciliation that will insulate sri lanka from efforts by isis or others to exploit religious differences to expand their hate filled influence even as sri lanka grapples with these shorter term challenges it must take active measures to establish the university and business partnerships that can position the country to ride rather than be overtaken by the opportunities presented by ai and other new technologies these are tall challenges but sri lanka has overcome worse

can carry out food and beverage operations in myanmar licensing franchising and distribution overview because of the initial investment amount required under the laws and the land use requirements foreign businesses should consider using licensing franchising and or distribution arrangements to enter the myanmar market there are no specific laws regulating distribution licensing or franchising agreements these agreements are to general commercial laws these include contracts act 1872 sale of goods act 1930 competition law 2015 consumer protection law 2014 companies law 2017 income tax law 1974 and union tax law 2018 registration or disclosure requirements as there is no specific legislation regulating distribution licensing or franchising agreements there are no specific disclosure or registration requirements there is also no requirement to seek governmental approval for such arrangements this makes it easy and relatively cost effective for foreign brands to enter into the myanmar market via distribution licensing or franchising although there are no specific rules requiring a franchisor to disclose all facts material to a prospective franchisee the franchisee may rely upon the consumer protection law 2014 in the event that there is any misrepresentation protection of intellectual property ip rights overview to date myanmar relies on outdated colonial era laws to protect ip rights these laws include the registration act 1908 copyright act 1914 and the merchandise marks act 1889 myanmar s merchandise marks act was taken from india s law india has repealed the merchandise marks act by the trade and merchandise marks act 1958 which was in turn replaced by the trademarks act 1999 as myanmar does not have modern ip laws up till now there is no proper system for the registration of ip rights which confers protection for the ip registered protection of trade marks under the existing laws a trade mark is protected only if it has been used commonly known as the first to use system as there is no system of ip registration a practice has developed where a trademark owner makes a declaration of ownership and registers it with the office of registration of deeds under the registration act 1908 now repealed after the declaration is registered it is customary for the trademark owner to publish a cautionary notice in local newspapers informing the public that the mark belongs to the trademark owner there has been no reported court decision on whether the registration of a declaration of ownership confers rights on a trademark owner where the trademark has not been used in myanmar however the practice continues to date as there is no other way of recording a brand owner s right in a trademark upcoming reforms myanmar has embarked on modernising its ip laws draft laws for the protection of trademarks copyrights industrial designs and patents have been presented to the legislative committee since 2014 the long awaited trade marks law has finally received the president s assent at the end of january 2019 the trade marks law is intended to harmonise myanmar s trade mark laws and trade mark registration process with the rest of the world the current first to use system will be replaced with a first to file system under the first to file system where more than one person applies to register an identical or a similar mark the registrar will only allow the registration of the trade mark application which was i filed the earliest or ii has the earliest priority right the practice of registering a declaration of ownership will soon give way to a formal trade mark registration process owners of marks registered under the registration act 1908 must file a fresh application to register their marks under the new trade marks law once it takes effect myanmar s industrial designs act was also recently passed as with the trade marks law it has yet to come into effect and no implementing regulations are currently available it is expected that the new ip laws will only come into force in a few years time as a regulatory body has yet to be set up for the registration of the ip and to oversee the enforcement of ip rights in the meantime foreign businesses wishing to do business in myanmar are advised to continue to register declarations of ownership in respect of their trademarks under the current practice exchange control the primary legislation governing foreign exchange matters is the foreign exchange management law 2012 feml 2012 foreign currencies currently permitted to be sold and purchased by authorised dealers in myanmar are us dollars usd euros eur singapore dollars sgd thai baht thb and malaysian ringgit myr the usd is the most commonly used foreign currency in domestic and international transactions in

the feml 2012 capital transactions require approval from the central bank of myanmar as for other types of payments from a myanmar payor to a foreign recipient for example franchise fees training fees and advertising and marketing fees the myanmar payor must first obtain approval from the foreign exchange management board and the central bank of myanmar the myanmar payor must provide clear reasons for the remittance request supported by documentation and evidence that explains the purpose of the remittance hence it is necessary for the parties to enter into written contracts the bank will scrutinise the details of the remittance application and obtain approval from the respective regulatory bodies before remitting the funds to the foreign recipient withholding taxes withholding taxes for payments made to non resident persons or entities are 2 5 for goods and services and 15 for interest and royalty payments the payor is required to deduct the applicable withholding tax from the amount payable to the payee whether or not agreed to by the latter and remit the tax to the internal revenue department myanmar has entered into double taxation avoidance agreements dtas with india malaysia singapore south korea thailand the uk vietnam and laos these dtas are particularly relevant for royalty payments as the withholding tax rates are reduced or exempted as applicable the myanmar government is considering abolishing withholding taxes but the decision has yet to be formalised general issues relating to contracts governing law myanmar laws allow parties freedom in the choice of the governing law of their contracts which is welcomed by many foreign contracting parties language generally the parties are free to enter in contracts in any language generally there is no requirement for contracts to be in the myanmar language or to be translated into the myanmar language to be enforceable between the parties however if the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the myanmar courts it is necessary to have a translation of the contract into the myanmar language generally it is common for dual language contracts to be executed to ensure that both parties understand the contents of the contract when one of the parties involved is a myanmar entity or individual formalities for contracts there is no general rule requiring the execution of contracts to be witnessed or notarised there are however specific regulations requiring specific contracts to be witnessed such section 16 of the deed registration law which requires 2 witnesses to every mortgage deed if a contract is to be registered with any government office in accordance with the deed registration law the execution of the contract should be notarised where parties to the contract submit to the jurisdiction of the myanmar courts the execution of the contract should also be notarised employment contracts need not be notarised but must be translated to myanmar language and registered with the labour office of the relevant townships registration of contracts the deed registration law came into effect on 1 october 2018 replacing the registration act 1908 section 16 of the new law provides that registration is compulsory for the following documents instrument of gift of immovable property non testamentary instruments for disposal of immovable property of value not less than kyats one lakh for consolidation of the declaration assignment limitation or extinguishing of any title or interest in immovable property of value not less than kyats one lakh or decrees orders or awards issued by a court in respect of rights related to such instruments mortgage deeds and deeds cancelling mortgages certified as true by at least two witnesses in addition to the mortgagor in mortgages of value not less than kyats one lakh other than with depositing of title deeds leases of immoveable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one 1 year or reserving a yearly rent instruments which operate for collateral security providing or otherwise assigning by companies associations to a trustee all or any part of rights over immovable property or interest thereupon certificates of adoption and certificates of adoption and instruments prescribed from time to time by the union government if documents are not registered they will be rendered ineffective and will not be admitted as evidence exclusion of liability generally exclusion of liability clauses are enforceable unless they are prohibited by specific local laws restrictive covenants section 27 of the contracts act 1872 provides that any contract in restraint of trade may be considered void contracts which restrain a person from exercising a lawful profession trade or business of any kind are also void under the contracts act 1872 certain post term restrictive covenants may also contravene various provisions of the competition law 2015 for example any act which unfairly prevents the entry of new competitors into the market is punishable with imprisonment for up to two years a fine of up to mmk10 million about usd7 700 or both while making agreements which restrain competition in the market or any conduct which restrains competition is punishable with imprisonment of up to three years a fine of up to mmk15 million about usd11 550 or both in practice parties regularly insert restrictive covenants in their contracts upon careful consideration on the duration scope and territorial application in a bid to ensure that the restrictive covenants will be considered reasonable and thus enforceable concluding remarks

100 billion from china in a year for now no phone call has been made yet nor scheduled white house just noted that the negotiations will continue on friday morning in washington boj opinions clarification on forward guidance strengthens confidence in powerful easing summary of opinions at the april 24 25 boj monetary policy meeting is released today at the statement of that meeting boj added clarification of forward guidance for policy rates it noted that boj intended to keet current levels of interest rates at least through around spring 2020 the summary of opinions noted that in order to strengthen public confidence in continuing with powerful monetary easing it is appropriate to clarify forward guidance for policy rates such as through making clear the specific period for which extremely low levels of interest rates will be maintained also it is appropriate to consider revising forward guidance for policy rates given for example that uncertainties regarding overseas economies have heightened compared to the time of its introduction meanwhile boj also noted there is a possibility that a further decline in interest rates will result in a greater risk of inducing side effects on the real economy rather than positive effects but boj dismissed the argument that qqe led to deterioration in banks profitability it s noted monetary easing has brought about economic improvement an increase in lending a decline in credit costs and an increase in profits stemming from stocks and bonds rba somp slight downgrade of inflation no imminent need to cut rates in the statement of monetary policy rba noted that the economy has slowed and inflation remains low also subdued growth in household income and adjustment in housing markets affected consumer spending and residential construction still labor market is performing reasonably well underlying inflation came in lower than expected in q1 and with pricing pressures subdued across much of the economy looking at the new economic projections 2019 growth forecasts was revised down notably from 2 75 to 2 00 but 2020 growth expectation was unchanged unemployment rate will stay longer at 5 00 through dec 2020 headline cpi was expected hit 2 00 in dec 2019 and stay there throughout core cpi is revised slightly to 1 75 in dec 2019 and 2 00 in dec 2020 all in all while 2019 growth is expected to undershoot it s expected to pick up quickly the downward revision in core cpi was just showed a slower pickup back to target not anything disastrous based on this outlook rba still has a lot of room to wait and see the developments before cutting interest rates gdp growth year average 2019 at 2 00 revised down from 2 75 2020 at 2 75 unchanged 2019 at 2 00 revised down from 2 75 2020 at 2 75 unchanged

economy growing below potential needs to be pumped up rbnz deputy governor geoff bascand said the economy is growing less than potential of 2 8 and there s just not enough pressure to get inflation up we think capacity pressures will just become a little less he said there is pressure there there s just not enough pressure to get inflation up we need growth to be around 3 or more to keep being at or approaching our targets nevertheless he added nobody s talking gloom here even though it was getting a bit harder to meet the inflation target he said the headwinds have become a bit stronger the global economy has become a bit weaker the domestic economy seems to have softened hence we re going to be drifting away a little bit not staying as close there s more chance of inflation ebbing than rising and because of that we ended up coming to a view that we needed to help pump it up a bit more on the data front japan household spending rose 2 1 yoy in march above expectation of 1 6 yoy but

completion of rebound from 104 69 at 112 40 on bearish divergence condition in daily macd deeper decline should then be seen back to retest 104 69 low on the upside though rebound from current level and break of 110 28 minor resistance will mix up near term outlook intraday bias will be turned neutral in this case first in the bigger picture usd jpy is staying inside falling channel from 118 65 thus there is no confirmation of trend reversal yet sustained break of 109 71 will argue that rebound from 104 69 is completed and the down trend from 118 65 is still in progress but at this stage in case of break of 104 69 we d expect strong support above 98 9 2016 low to contain downside an bring rebound economic indicators update
overview contrary to hopes and expectations the us made good on the presidential tweet and raised the tariff on around 200 bln of chinese goods from 10 to 25 trump indicated that the process that will levy a 25 tariff on the remaining chinese imports has begun also contrary to expectations chinese officials did not detail their response though it is expected to be forthcoming however as we noted this is not always how china plays its hand sometimes it skips the american style big announcement and simply takes action as it has with canada recently and japan in the past for example meanwhile state fund buying of chinese shares appears to have sparked the reversal higher of chinese stocks and the recovery has carried into europe as well this week s steep losses are being pared bond yields are softer in europe while the us yield which briefly dipped below the three month bill yield for the first time since march is little changed at 2 44 off seven basis points on the week the three month bill yield is 2 41 the is mostly softer though the yen and sterling are a little heavy most emerging market currencies including the battered are finishing the week on a firmer tone asia pacific the us china trade talks resume today the general indication is that there is not much progress that can be accomplished at this level of negotiations and the head of both countries is needed to break the impasse many observers argue that the approach of past us administrations has not brought china to heel and therefore the tariff war is the only alternative we find this to be a false dilemma and have long argued that a multilateral approach boosts the chance for success there is also a sense that even if china were to adopt all the policies the us wants the rivalry would only intensify defying economic logic japan reported both weaker than expected cash wages and stronger than expected consumption labor cash earnings fell 1 9 year over year in march economists surveyed by bloomberg expected a 0 5 decline median after a revised 0 7 decline in february initially 0 8 it is the third consecutive decline and is the biggest drop in a decade on the other hand household spending accelerated to 2 1 from 1 7 year over year economists had projected slow consumption it was the strongest gain since last august while some increase in consumption is possible ahead of the sales tax increase october it seems a bit early to look for it in the monetary policy statement the reserve bank of australia slashed growth forecasts to 1 75 in the year to june from 2 5 however its reluctance to cut rates may be linked to its view that the economy will re accelerate it reduced its outlook for consumption and investment but continues to count on the robust labor market for the economic resilience it continues to project meanwhile in an unusual move at least a couple of australian banks have pressed forward and announced cuts in mortgage rates the rba meets next on june 4 but the derivatives markets suggest better prospects for a cut at the july 2 meeting today is the first time this week that the dollar is holding above the previous session s low against the yen it has yet to rise above the previous session s high this week yesterday s range was roughly jpy109 50 to jpy110 10 there are two expiring options that in play jpy109 75 for about 475 mln and jpy110 00 for around 525 mln a higher close today would snap a five day dollar slide the australian dollar has traded in a 20 tick range on either side of 0 7000 if it is unable to close above the high already recorded it will be the fourth consecutive weekly losses for the the greenback fell less than 0 2 against the today but it was sufficient to end its six day rally the dollar rose about 1 2 against the yuan this week the most since last june europe the uk reported growth accelerated in q1 to 0 5 from a 0 2 pace in q4 18 even as the economy stagnated in march consumption 0 7 quarter over quarter up from 0 3 in q4 and gross fixed capital formation 2 1 vs 0 6 were the drivers imports surged as companies and households took precautionary measures ahead brexit the softness of march monthly data warns of the lack of momentum coming into q2 some april employment data will be released next week but brexit continues to command the focus germany will report q1 gdp next week and today s trade figures will fuel some optimism despite the weakness in survey data many observers may complain about germany s large trade surplus but the unexpected increase in march exports will likely be seen as a constructive development exports jumped 1 5 on the month the median guestimate in the bloomberg survey was for a decline of 0 4 after a 1 2 decline in february german imports rose 0 4 in line with expectations imports fell by 1 6 in february france reported march industrial production figures 0 9 driven by a 1 0 drop in manufacturing output as did italy 0 9 drop in march industrial output alongside retail sales 0 3 vs forecasts for a 0 1 gain however with q1 gdp already reported and being halfway through q2 the data was of fleeting interest the closed above its 20 day moving average yesterday for the first time since april 22 and reach a six day high near 1 1250 of the last 11 sessions beginning with the stronger than expected us q1 gdp on april 26 the euro has risen in eight if today s gains are sustained today could be the first session since april 22 that the euro has remained above 1 12 is struggling to sustain upticks and is hovering around 1 30 it is off roughly 1 2 for the week its largest loss since the end of march there is a gbp225 mln option at 1 30 that will be cut today which may hold some interest a softer us dollar could see sterling test the 1 3040 area but there is little enthusiasm america while the trade talks resume the us reports april cpi both the headline and core rates are expected to tick up to 2 1 the response is likely to be stronger on a downside miss than an upside surprise powell and some other fed officials have indicated that the recent softness in inflation was transitory recall that the headline rate had risen to 2 9 last summer before falling to 1 5 1 6 at the start of the year the issue here is not the secular decline but the recent softness the other important point is that despite the repeated claims to the contrary the federal reserve s inflation target of 2 applies to the headline pce deflator and not the core rate canada reports april employment data canada lost jobs in march 7 2k for the first time in seven months but is forecast to have grown around 11 5k jobs in april the market often seems to respond to the headline more than the mix between full and part time positions the hourly wage rate for permanent workers is also reported it had bottomed at the end last year below 1 5 in march it was 2 3 and it is expected to have maintained that pace in april mexico reports march industrial production and manufacturing

note that the came close to filling the gap created by the higher opening on april 1 which underpinned out technical bullish outlook before the gap was closed the s p 500 recovered to fill the gap that was created by yesterday s sharply lower opening today s performance will shape next week s technical tone a close above 2880 would be constructive and above 2900 would likely embolden those who fear missing out

please go ahead advertisement advertisement jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you chuck good morning and we appreciate you joining us today for our third quarter fiscal year 2019 conference call i will begin with a brief discussion of our operations then our cfo chuck barrantes will provide a financial overview and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year following his remarks we will open the call up for questions we continue to be extremely pleased with our solid operational and financial performance as all of our companies continue to perform at a high level the strong momentum we experienced in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter making the ninth consecutive quarter where we delivered year over year growth in adjusted ebitda our north american leasing operations continue to see strong demand across virtually all of its end markets with a total revenue in the third quarter increasing by 10 year over year and leasing revenues increased by 12 driven by an increase in unit growth higher average lease rates and higher fleet utilization across most of our product lines during the quarter we are very proud of these outstanding results advertisement advertisement our core portable storage business again continues to perform at the high end of our expectation driven by solid execution and broad based demand across the majority of the end markets ground level offices and storage containers continue to show very high demand as these two product lines generated a combination year over year rental revenue increase of 29 over which was organic growth taking into account all of pac van product lines organic rental revenue growth was 15 for the quarter and 17 year to date our team continues to do a great job executing on a number of initiatives particularly our national account program and our recently introduced pv3 safety containers which together accounted for approximately 15 of the year over year growth in rental revenue pac van continues to be highly regarded by its customers and once again posted a world class net promoter score of 83 in the last 12 months in addition to organic growth we remain focused on building the pac van brand throughout north america by geographically expanding our portable storage container business advertisement advertisement during the quarter we completed one acquisition in fort worth texas increasing our presence in that dynamic state we also opened a greenfield location in panama city florida adding our eighth branch in the southeast region this week we completed an acquisition of a portable storage business in kentucky adding three locations to the three already in kentucky we continue to serve just over half of the top 100 msas in the us including 39 of the top 50 and our acquisition pipeline remains healthy our liquid containment business in north america delivered slightly improved year over year results as we have seen some moderation in leasing activity in texas while oil and gas production in both basins remain healthy we were impacted in the quarter by certain customers consolidating their field personnel due to recent acquisition activity as well as the normal seasonal slowdown combined with some pipeline availability challenges with some of our customers in the permian all indicators point to continued healthy production activity in both basins in the foreseeable future our overall business remains strong but it s not operating at peak level we were experiencing last fall our north american manufacturing operations posted a slightly positive adjusted ebitda during the quarter as sales to external customers declined from reduced sales of specialty tanks and chassis but we expect activity to increase in fourth quarter as the backlog is very strong advertisement advertisement now turning to our asia pacific region our asia pacific region continued its positive momentum by delivering third quarter growth in leasing revenues of 11 on a local currency basis up from 9 growth last quarter and marking its 10th year over year increase out of the last 11 quarters sales revenues were down year over year in local currency mostly due to one large sale that occurred last year in third quarter that wasn t repeated this year total reported revenues during the quarter in us dollar were adversely impacted by an approximate 9 decline in average australian dollar exchange rate between periods the increase in royal wolf s leasing revenues was spread across almost all of the end markets with noticeable increases in transportation construction consumer and industrial sectors the growth has mainly been driven by increases in average units on lease combined with average lease rates our team remains focused on building upon its leading market position across the region through a combination of organic growth greenfield openings and to the extent they become available accretive acquisitions to conclude we continue to see both organic growth and expansion opportunities in north america as well as ability to strengthen our market leadership in the asia pacific region as always we ll remain disciplined in our capital allocation our performance year to date positions us well to finish the year strong while also providing us with a solid foundation for continued growth in the fiscal year 2020 advertisement advertisement i ll now turn over the call to chuck barrantes for his financial review and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jody we intend on filing our annual report on form 10 q shortly at which time this document will be available on both the sec s edgar filing system and our website and i encourage investors and other interested parties to read it as it contains a substantial amount of information about our company some of which we will discuss today turning to our fiscal third quarter financial results total revenues were 86 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 84 4 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 an increase of 2 leasing revenues were 59 6 million an increase of approximately 9 over the prior year s quarter and comprised 70 of total non manufacturing revenues for the quarter versus 67 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 non manufacturing sales revenues were 25 2 million in the quarter down from 27 3 million in the third quarter of the prior year advertisement advertisement in our north american leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totaled 57 2 million compared with 51 8 million for the year ago period an increase of 10 the increases occurred across most sectors but primarily in the construction commercial and oil and gas sectors revenues at our north american manufacturing operations for the third quarter were 27 point 2 7 million excuse me including intercompany sales of 1 3 million for our north american leasing operations this compares to 3 2 million of total sales for the year ago period including intercompany sales of 922 000 ph as jody mentioned our manufacturing operations experienced reduced demand for specialty tanks and other steel related products particularly chassis in our asia pacific leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totaled 27 6 million compared to 30 3 million for the year ago period a decrease of 9 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in utility sector as one large sale totaling 1 8 million which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was not repeated this year and as jody mentioned an approximate 9 decline in the australian dollar between the periods advertisement advertisement leasing revenues increased by approximately 1 on a year over year basis and 11 on a local currency basis driven mainly by increases in the transportation construction industrial and consumer sectors consolidated adjusted ebitda was 24 1 million in the quarter compared to 21 9 million in the prior year s quarter an increase of 10 and adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of total revenues was 28 up from 26 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as jody stated this was the ninth consecutive quarter of year over year adjusted ebitda growth in north america adjusted ebitda for our leasing operations was 17 3 million in the third quarter compared to 15 2 million for the year ago quarter an increase of 14 adjusted ebitda at pac van was 12 2 million up 20 year over year and lone star s adjusted ebitda was 5 1 million up 2 from the prior year for our manufacturing operations on a stand alone basis adjusted ebitda was 17 000 for the quarter compared to 111 000 in last year s third quarter asia pacific s adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was 8 1 million compared to 7 6 million in the year ago period an increase of approximately 7 on a local currency basis adjusted ebitda increased by approximately 17 interest expense for the third quarter was up 10 2 million an increase of 800 000 from the year ago period the increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense in the asia pacific area due to a 1 2 million fee on the prepayment of the bison capital term notes which resulted in a higher weighted average interest rate of 13 7 versus 10 4 in the year ago period and was partially offset by a lower average borrowings and a weaker australian dollar between the periods during the quarter we completed we completely repaid the over 60 million bison capital senior note in the asia pacific area replacing this higher cost debt with lower cost borrowings on an amended and expanded syndicated credit facility led by deutsche bank ag this move is expected to generate interest savings of over 3 million per year net loss attributable to common stockholders in the third quarter was 1 3 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 1 5 million or 0 06 per share in the year ago quarter included in these results were non cash charges of 1 1 million and 500 000 ph in fiscal year 2019 and 2018 respectively for the change in valuation of the stand alone bifurcated derivatives in our asia pacific convertible note both periods include 922 000 for the dividends paid on our preferred stock for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 we generated free cash flow before fleet activity of 35 7 million compared to 32 2 million in the prior year period an increase of 11 now turning to our balance sheet at march 31st the company had a net leverage ratio of 4 times for the trailing 12 months an improvement from 4 6 times at june 30 2018 the reduction in leverage is due to a combination of factors including the forced conversion of the convertible note at royal wolf and our strong financial performance turning to our companywide outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 based on our year to date results we remain confident that consolidated revenues for the fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 370 million to 390 million and that consolidated adjusted ebitda will increase by 20 to 25 in fiscal year 2019 from fiscal year 2018 this outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 this now concludes our prepared comments and i would like to turn the call back to the operator for the question and answer session questions and answers operator thank you at this time ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brent thielman of d a davidson brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey thanks good morning jody e miller president and chief executive officer hey good morning brent charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning brent thielman d a davidson analyst i mean the outlook to get to the upper end of that ebitda guidance range you need to see a pretty sizable increase in ebitda from 3q to 4q can you get there even with the containment business sort of sideways here jody e miller president and chief executive officer i think a lot of it will depend on the energy side we had a little bit more of a hit we knew some of the challenges coming but through the consolidation and the pipeline issues and everything else it appears it s picking up i don t know if it will pick up quite enough to make up the gap our core business in the us as we stated on the call is doing exceptionally well with our containerized fleet growing at 29 for the year but it s probably not quite enough to make up the top of the range for the energy side and then australian dollars really hurting us at 9 year over year as well so it ll be a little bit tough to get up to the top of the range charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer brent as jody mentioned earlier on the call i mean it s we re still doing very well on the permian it s just not shooting at all levels it was early part of the year but we do still expect to have year over year growth in q4 so like anything else it s always at a point in time so we re still very very optimistic and on the future in that sector in our business in north america brent thielman d a davidson analyst sure and yes i mean jody it sounds like things are picking up i ll assume that means slowly but you ve seen some changes since the end of the quarter in that business out there jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay and then chuck were there additional costs that showed up in the interest line this quarter relative to the paydown at bison capital charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean that s very taking brent s side maybe didn t seem clearly but in the quarter we had about 1 2 million 1 3 million of the prepayment fee on the full repayment of the bison term note so that was the reason for the primary increase brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay got it got it okay and then maybe just last question jody the business in australia i mean obviously doing really well it s evident in the numbers i guess i m just kind of curious what the boots on the ground are telling you just with all the noise around china obviously that has an impact on the economy there i guess what are you seeing from a demand perspective jody e miller president and chief executive officer yeah not much of a change to be honest the construction sector s still doing really well as we said before everything in australia has moved with containers right all the freight so our freight business is still very good they still got to get product in and out all the major cities the bnc ph and stackable solutions are getting more accepted and growing and that s still our fastest growing segment so all indications show that it s still going to be strong we get double digit growth in leasing which i think is exceptional we had a couple large sales that didn t repeat this year we also as you guys would probably remember we have a large majority of camps setting that are getting deployed currently there s a big chunk of them going to a project that will help as well so i think there s good optimism in this coming quarter brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay great thank you jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you brent charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brent operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of scott schneeberger of oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst thanks hey good morning guys jody e miller president and chief executive officer good morning scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst let s go back just following on a bunch of things that were just discussed in texas how would you classify your visibility there given the slightly changing dynamic with regard to volume and with regard to pricing jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes so i don t think we ll see the pricing increases that we ve seen the first half of the year i think it s kind of flattened out the price of oil is still fine i think with the consolidation happening right now and some of that obviously they re not buying companies to taper that off long term but there s a little bit of a stall where they catch their breath the drill rigs are down slightly so completions and some of the other things are kind of catching their breath but i look for those to kind of stay stable and gradually pick back up so there s a little bit more happening then there was in the past we don t have the crystal ball to say this is what it s going to be we had scheduled out three to six months on some of our customers and some of those are changing a little bit long term we think it ll work its way out and everything will be fine but i think there s just the last three months and maybe now it seems to be kind of picking back up and being a little more positive than it has been in the last three to four months scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst thanks appreciate that it s helpful i want to go back to swing factors i was asking in the context of what how you could finish the fiscal year but just in that light but also in the quarter itself how much of an impact to the australian dollar have relative to what you were expecting at the start of the quarter i m just curious what kind of a swing factor that was in the quarter itself charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no we the australia dollar for the quarter pretty much performed what we had expected we were looking at around 0 71 ph and that s what it was going to q4 australian dollars dipped down a little bit i think it was below 0 70 so we re getting obviously some negative impact on the translation of the dollar not on the economics locally but for the quarter it was what we expected but 9 reduction compared to the prior year third quarter scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst i appreciate that color and then the last thing on pac van looking really good and hearing from some of your competitors recently the same trends are what we re hearing there too so jody just how do you feel about visibility there and kind of the same question i was asking about texas lone star the pricing the volume and the sustainability there jody e miller president and chief executive officer yeah i think the core portable storage side is extremely strong i think still year to date it s a 17 organic which i think it s just awesome they re doing a great job there i think some of the new innovation national accounts and things that we have implemented i think will continue there and we see nothing but a positive forecast in our core business the tank or liquid storage side in texas and also on the pac van side pricing is doing very very well as well we re getting nice increases and we continue to be very consistent on the lone star side as i said earlier i think pricing is kind of flattened out where we were raising prices the first half maybe not quite as much visibility into the short term future with some of the things that are happening with consolidation they re starting to get their pipeline challenges worked out so we still feel very optimistic about it but in the short term maybe not quite as clear as we ve seen the last year but still very optimistic in the long haul scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst okay thanks i appreciate it guys operator our next question comes from the line of luis hernandez an investor luis hernandez private investor yes hello good morning thanks for taking the question jody e miller president and chief executive officer good morning luis charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning luis luis hernandez private investor hello all right the first one on the refi of the bison loan that one was around 11 or 12 and charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah 12 luis hernandez private investor sorry go ahead charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no no 11 9 12 was the luis hernandez private investor and the refinancing is what was at what rate roughly charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer it s with the deutsche bank rate so it s somewhere not quite senior facility rates but around 6 level luis hernandez private investor okay all right i guess that s a pretty good news there then on the pac van which segments are you most more optimistic on over the next 12 18 months jody e miller president and chief executive officer yeah luis i think it s honestly across the board if we look at our growth we break it out by segment all segments are doing very well i think construction looks very positive i think our national accounts is probably the most optimistic opportunity for us some of our new product innovation is helping with all segments but it s really across the board i think we re outgrowing obviously the industry but i think everything looks very optimistic on the core business luis hernandez private investor okay all right great then the other next question would be on do you expect a higher level of free cash flow in q4 i mean this first nine months chuck you said 30 36 million roughly 35 7 million do you expect sort of a bump on q4 just maybe some coming from working capital or something charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i think luis just by the fact that on the refinance of bison capital we should get a nice pick up from there just some free cash flow and yes i do expect free cash flow to pick up luis hernandez private investor okay all right and finally on pac van just to basic to dig little details have you grown the fleet at all jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes yes we re running about 80 utilization so obviously there s branches that are running short we continue to that s a big part of our organic number right so we re 17 organic so when you re running close to that 80 more we definitely have added to the fleet luis hernandez private investor yeah because you were roughly around 4 000 tanks just wanted to know if you had grown those kinds at all jody e miller president and chief executive officer no it s all been core storage and glo our glo is still leads our growth percentage and then storage containers are next those are two higher growth products we ve not really we ve not added anything on the tank side and very little in any other categories charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer in north america last year at march 31 2018 we had about a total lease fleet including 4 000 something frac tanks about 43 000 and at the end of march this current third quarter we re at 51 500 ph luis hernandez private investor okay yeah i when i asked the fleet i meant the tank fleet not something jody e miller president and chief executive officer tanks have not grown significant at all last march we had total tanks in north america 4 146 and we have 4 260 now luis hernandez private investor okay so it s pretty much roughly the same slightly above right that s good and then on the rates on the tanks versus 2014 we always check that number how is that the pickup or the relationship of that jody e miller president and chief executive officer the rates on of which product are you luis hernandez private investor on the tanks on the oil tanks charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and so last year third quarter average rate was about for the quarter it was 805 versus little over 900 this quarter this third quarter luis hernandez private investor okay so 900 and then versus 2014 rates charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer we re still well behind not even close to the peak of those rates i d have to look and see but i would state still 30 40 under what we were at that time luis hernandez private investor right so maybe 70 of the rates okay jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes or a little less luis hernandez private investor yeah all right sounds good thanks good quarter and talk to you guys in next three months jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you luis operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of brian gagnon of gagnon securities brian gagnon gagnon securities analyst hey jody and chuck you have inaudible this year i m looking at the repayment of the bison note and you got hit with 1 2 ph million in q3 and it looks to me like your savings going forward is something on the order of 700 000 or 800 000 a quarter so can i think about the fourth quarter having an automatic 2 million increase versus where you were in q3 on interest hit charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i would think that s fair deal ph brian gagnon gagnon securities analyst good gentlemen thank you very much charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you operator and there are no other questions at this time i would now

by rashid abdi addis standard two mass protest movements have in quick succession forced regime changes in sudan and ethiopia two of the horn of africa s quintessential hard states a deep seated disillusion with the security and developmental states drives the new revolutionary mood what is less clear is where all the ferment and the popular demand for a new dispensation will lead in sudan the ouster of al bashir has been followed by a partial retreat of the security state in ethiopia the election of a reformist pm and a year of sweeping reforms have extensively eroded the power of the security deep state yet neither pm abiy s extensive cull nor sudanese military council s modest targeted purge constitute a fundamental dismantling of the structures of the security state more important the transitions under way in the two countries were in the initial phases at least top down attempts by the security state to engineer a soft landing with minimal disruptions pm abiy s singular act of genius lay in the way he deftly subverted that strategy of piecemeal reform assigned to him by the ruling party and began almost single handedly to unravel old ethiopia at break neck speed the retreat of the authoritarian order in both cases opens huge possibilities a generational opportunity for meaningful and positive change but also great risks in ethiopia a year of deep reforms under the reformist premier abiy ahmed has put the transition on a rocky but relatively steady positive trajectory overall prospects for good governance civil liberties and human rights continue to improve in sudan the situation is less hopeful and remains so far uncertain the hopes and expectations raised by the resignation of omar al bashir after 30 years in power now grates against the reality of a potentially messy and protracted transition following a controversial intervention by the army the transition military council tmc made up of bashir s allies is struggling against mounting popular discontent to manage an interregnum the horn is at strategic crossroads there is immense hope but also great fear how ethiopia and sudan manage their fraught transitions and the prospects for success and reversal remain unknown what is not in doubt is that a botched transition in both nations will crush the dream of millions and their quest for liberty and better quality of life embolden autocratic regimes and vindicate their ideology of stability the unprecedented upheaval and ferment in the two horn states provide an extraordinary window into the complex diverse and obscure changes and currents shaking up society and traditional politics these contextual dynamics must not be overlooked in the analyses of ethiopia and sudan sudan s turbulent interregnum sudan and ethiopia offer two fraught transition models a typical unstable and potentially reversible while dissimilar in some key aspects both are attempts at a top down fix reliant on continued goodwill and support of the military security services and dominant parties more important the two transitions are not outcomes of a political and constitutional settlements and likely to remain contested and unsettled for some time sudan s transition is in its infancy and dogged by a host of challenges of the two it is the one with the greatest potential for short term crisis but if successful one that opens enormous possibilities for improved governance and stability formal direct talks between sudan s protest movement and the military began on 27 april but quickly hit a snag barely two days later the key sticking points the length of the transition military wants 2 years the protest movement favours 4 years arguing more time was needed to undo the damage of 30 years of misrule composition of the proposed sovereign transition council stc and who should lead it on 30 april the tmc issued a series of controversial and unilateral decisions that escalated the stalemate into a crisis the council said the stc would be headed by the military 7 out 10 posts allocated to the military contrary to spa s demand for a 15 member council the bulk of whose members are civilian it further called on the spa to dismantle barricades at the army command in khartoum and get protesters off the streets the generals have been angling for a longer pre transition period from the start this was largely based on the assumption they stood to gain more from the tactical point of view the spa had more to lose but there are other pressing calculations first more time allows the tmc to sort out internal divisions second it gives them the leg room to craft and fine tune its negotiation strategy third it provides the tmc with the opportunity to drag out the process wear down the pro democracy movement the so called attrition option that has served the military well in the past the decision by the au to extend the tmc s life by three months is therefore a major victory for the military it now has up to the end of july 2019 to set up an authority to oversee the transition agree a roadmap with the opposition a viable transition roadmap in sudan depends on consensus between the five distinct actors constituencies the street the leadership of the protest movement traditional parties the tmc and support from regional actors this will not be easy it is almost certain divergent aims interests and calculations could prove a major impediment military council a reluctant reformer at the heart of sudan s chaotic and bitter transition contest indeed the crisis of legitimacy credibility is the self appointed tmc it is made up of senior generals all beneficiaries of the army purges in the last one decade by bashir that elevated loyalists to key posts they eased bashir out made a number of significant concessions but controversially stone walled when it came to the speedy transfer of power to a civilian administration significantly it has so far resisted popular calls for the dismantling of the so called deep state dawlah al amiqah widely perceived as a covert power centre whose members included senior generals securocrats and politicians and which exercised extra constitutional influence on the state what the tmc s true aims are its interests and links with the deep state and foreign powers are all a matter for debate and conjecture far less speculative and hazardous perhaps is what it isn t the council is essentially a product of a deep crisis within the state a hastily created crisis response tool to reassert military influence and manage a fluid political situation it pulled back from imposing state of emergency allowed protests to continue quickly shed unpopular senior ex regime figures such as intelligence chief salah gosh released some not all political prisoners and reached out to protest leaders all positive and encouraging steps that demonstrate it has significant agency is pragmatic and amenable to a political settlement yet the clumsy nature of the coup the confusion in the first 48 hours as well as incoherent pronouncements and policy flip flops since then point to deep internal frictions tactically this could be an advantage for the coalition leading the protests potentially giving them greater room to nudge the tmc towards reform and influence the agenda it could also pose serious challenges in the coming weeks and months especially if as some fear the council becomes opportunistic and capricious and its cohesions becomes more frayed but there must be no mistake about the tmc s politics its primary goal is to maintain national stability it views retention of military power influence and privilege as necessary to achieve that noble goal there is no evidence it shares the democratic aspirations of the majority of the sudanese people it is instinctively suspicious of civilians and resistant to the idea of civilian oversight and even much less civilian rule sudan s military for three decades waged not just war but also engaged in multiple peace processes and political negotiations at local and national levels involving armed and non armed civilian opponents under bashir talks were conducted in the same manner as war was waged invariably three distinct tactics with roots in war strategy were deployed to outflank and eviscerate the civilian opposition accommodation co option and containment the official discourse and rhetoric surrounding the series of national dialogues in train for nearly two decades offers a fascinating glimpse into the appropriation of martial metaphors a progressive militarization of politics domestic politics was officially referred to as jabhat al daakhiliyah internal front political parties were reminded of the value of national cohesion and called upon to help unify the ranks tawhid al saf dissidents were cat s paw mikhlab qit of foreign enemies sudan s protest movement will be negotiating with a military that has set ways of dealing with civilian adversaries expectations it is willing to make a strategic and irreversible retreat from politics seems over optimistic the tmc s 30th april pronouncements and the subsequent hardening of language certainly sow doubt about the prospect of that happening any time soon the unilateral and escalatory nature of the council s statement goes against the letter and spirit of the negotiations it may be a hint of an intense internal power struggle it could also signal an attempt by hardline factions to assert greater control a hypothesis lent some credence by the fact it was the tmc s second in command gen muhammad hamdan dagalo aka hemedti who was personally involved hemedti the commander of the rapid support forces rsf quwaat al da m al sari has in recent weeks emerged as the real power within the tmc playing court to visiting dignitaries and diplomats his swift maneuvers to consolidate power within the military and security services is anything but coincidental he was for example elevated to a member of the national intelligence and security service official suna news agency dispatch said he was now uzw a member of niss a vague term that is both odd and inexplicable at a low key event in khartoum in late april the rsf itself is affiliated to the niss since it was established in 2013 from the rump of the janjaweed militia and one would assume hemedti as commander would be a member of the intelligence and security service the original force roughly 7 000 was drawn mainly from hemedti s own rizaygat tribe in darfur an important factor in itself that partly explains its strong internal cohesion and loyalty to hemedti it has a complicated dual command chain answerable to both the niss dg and the regular army general command bashir increasingly relied on the rsf and the popular police forces in recent years to quell social unrest and low level armed insurrections the bulk of the rsf is now fighting in yemen alongside emirati troops a decision based on rsf s perceived counterinsurgency competence adaptability to the yemeni battlefield conditions hemedti is young ambitious and has powerful gulf friends keen to see him play an influential role in the transition he has a fearsome reputation deemed both an able battle field commander and skillful political operator his rise to prominence since bashir s ouster and high visibility within the tmc suggest a resurgence of hardline elements keen not to cede too much ground to the protest movement old parties protest movement sudan s bewildering array of political parties weakened and deeply fragmented and caught off guard by the protests seem keen to be included in the transition talks the tmc initially seemed to prefer a broad based dialogue in part because that could have neutralized the weight of the protest movement it has since walked back and proposed a format that significantly shortened list of participants not least because of the risks of an unwieldy and fractious dialogue process impossible to conclude within the short time frame it now has three months sudan s protest movement and its leadership hold the initiative in the contest to shape the transition the call for freedom justice and peace emblazoned on every placard gelled a fragmented nation and triggered the horn s most powerful and unprecedented mass protest movements the expectations are high and the road to achieving them daunting the risk of fragmentation within the protest movement is high it is now made up of two distinct groups quwaa i laan al huriyyat wal tagyiir declaration of freedom and change forces and the sudanese professionals association tajamm u al mihniyiin al sudaniyin they are now broadly aligned in their demands tmc co option strategies and the attrition of protracted negotiation highly likely to sow division the spa and the dfcf have so far done a remarkable job in leading a cohesive disciplined and non violent mass protest movement they must not sell themselves short in the delicate negotiations now under way they must safeguard their cohesion eschew personal ambition remain vigilant against the familiar co option traps stay resilient and focused in the face of setbacks and hard nosed at every phase of the negotiations ethiopia s rocky transition ethiopia s transition is the outcome of two severe crises that shook the regime to the core over four years of relentless mass protests in oromia and amhara regional states and a sharp economic downturn the eprd the coalition of four ethno regional parties that dominated politics since the early 90s played a central role in the transition engineered abiy ahmed s rise it started off well in the early years combining a reformist zeal with an accommodative approach to politics its fortunes for over two decades was tied to that of the charismatic and talented meles zenawi its owes its structural and organizational resilience more importantly its internal consensus style ethos to him the aftermath of the controversial elections in 2005 and massive crackdowns on protests ushered in a long period of repression deflected the party from its democratic goals and progressively strengthened the hegemony of the tplf but even in its weakened state the eprd proved its dependability as an instrument of crisis management at critical junctures it engineered a smooth transition of power after the death of meles in august 2012 leaned on hailemariam to resign as pm in february 2018 abiy capitalized on the party s internal institutional strength exploited the antipathy to the tplf to build the tactical alliances necessary to seal his victory at the eprdf congress in february 2018 ironically abiy s radical reforms in particular the planned swift transition to a conventional multi party system makes the future of the governing coalition perilous and uncertain while the pm has orchestrated changes within the eprdf and consolidated his grip over his own oromo democratic party odp many suspect the era of the dominant vanguard party may be coming to a close significantly the pm has relied on a close knit circle of politicians and inexperienced advisers to drive his fast paced reforms with minimal or no input from the eprd and other key institutions the benefits of a personalized elite driven reform seem obvious abiy arguably needed the latitude and flexibility it provides to push through a raft of deep reforms and swiftly dismantle key pillars of tplf power in the military security services and economy the potential drawbacks of a highly personalized leadership style and an elite driven reform process lacking sufficient institutional buy in and support must be obvious it is inherently risky alienates the very agencies indispensable to implementation and long term sustainability understood thus the risks to reform in ethiopia seem not so much bureaucratic inertia as bureaucratic recalcitrance rumblings of unease within the state and in the parastatals over key aspects of the reforms from privatization to the future of the ethnic federalism system reinforce these fears the pm rhetorically at least is increasingly aware of this potential problem stepped up meetings with key departments and pledged to deepen institutional engagement however his critics charge the impromptu townhall style meetings are cosmetic and do not constitute structured policy dialogue ethnic unrest identity politics may act as a catalyst for change but it s huge capacity to complicate transitions foment new unrest must not be ignored ethiopia is an egregious example aggressive and adversarial strains of ethno nationalisms resurgent in recent years pose grave conflict risks many ethnic conflicts are traditionally driven by contested borders and resource competition ethno regionalism nationalism aggravate these conflicts and make them intractable pm abiy s stabilization and consolidation efforts have had minimal impact in de escalating the problem balancing multiple and contending ethnic interests proved far trickier than anticipated 62 ethiopians arrested over suspected roles in deadly ethnic violence ethiopia via ecadf ecadf ethiopian news ecadf may 10 2019 his policy of accommodation to remedy historical injustices allocate more government posts to marginalized communities and disadvantaged segments of the population won wider praise but either failed to mollify more militant and younger ethno nationalist activists clamoring for deeper affirmative action or reinforced resentment among other ethnicities this is particularly the case in oromiya where factions loyal to the oromo liberation front that view the pm as a traitor to the oromo cause continue to stoke violence undermine social cohesion several attempts to mediate an end to the ructions in oromiya and reconcile the rival factions so far have produced shaky truces that failed to hold those responsible for this massacre have to be held accountable adigo amsaya d president benishangul gumuz state said by phone from assosa no arrests over the killings perpetrated by armed ethnic amhara youth hv been made so far he said blumberg abebe etana abebeetana may 7 2019 meanwhile the pm s anti corruption drive and political consolidation strategy perceived targeted at curbing the influence exerted by the minority tigrayan ethnic community on the country s political and economic life fomented serious backlash widely held perception the premier s new friendship with eritrean president isaias afwerki is partly motivated by a common desire to isolate the tplf served to further inflame sentiments in tigray the region is now effectively a mini state its relations with addis abeba deeply fraught and antagonistic on off dialogue between addis and mekele and series of high level meetings in 2018 failed to smooth relations or diminish the potentially dangerous siege mentality developing in tigray the region is where the country s elite military units are garrisoned and sophisticated heavy military hardware including air combat assets kept a legacy of the border conflict with eritrea an armed conflict highly improbable but impossible to rule out would be catastrophic economic hardship economic hardships remain core drivers of social unrest in sudan and ethiopia conditions for the vast majority of their populations progressively worsened in the last five years sudan s loss of oil revenues in 2012 and subsequent deadlock over oil transshipment fees with south sudan triggered the country s severest economic crisis in decades high inflation currency turbulence and a series of austerity measures that saw subsidies lifted on bread and other commodities hit the lower classes hard and fomented the mass protests that quickly engulfed the whole country in ethiopia the crisis was largely induced by the frenetic pace of growth skewed development expensive infrastructure mega projects and dependence on foreign loans chinese abiy in early 2018 inherited a state that was virtually bankrupt its foreign exchange reserve depleted and saddled with mounting and unsustainable debt servicing obligations an emergency deposit of 1 billion dollars into the treasury by the uae helped to stabilize the volatile fiscal situation the short to medium term prospects look bleak even though china s decision to write off some of the debt in late april figures and signals of support from multilateral financial institutions donors promise some relief in sudan the uae similarly stepped in to shore up the currency by depositing 500m in the treasury in april 2019 donors have equally signaled readiness to help the gravity of the economic crisis in the two states and the improbability of a quick and dramatic improvement portend huge risks for the transition yet the kind of tangible and irreversible progress in their delicate transitions necessary to unlock donor support and foreign investment hardly exists now and bound to take years by which time conditions would have deteriorated further in ethiopia the continued proliferation of ethnic unrest and violence in economically productive regions that has triggered massive displacement estimated at 3 million government inability to get on top of the situation is hugely destabilizing in itself but also certain to prove a major impediment to new foreign investment an emergency financial aid package for sudan and long term economic relief and stimulus package for ethiopia seem the best options for the international community to shore up the transitions a youth revolt the uprisings in ethiopia and sudan constitute the horn s first uniquely large scale youth revolt the first political coming of age of two youth generations embittered by economic hardship and the inequities of the hard state ethiopia with over 70 of the population out of a total of 110 million under 30 and sudan with 60 of the population 42 5 million under the age of 25 are examples of states where the demographic shift has been at its most starkest reflecting both the promise and destabilizing potential of the so called youth bulge two distinct but complimentary historical trends converged in the horn protests a massive demographic shift that progressively moved the youth to the centre of politics a technological revolution that provided them with the tools to effectively resist and organize the sheer demographic weight the volatility and restless energy unleashed by these changes cannot be ignored the long term viability and sustainability of the transitions hinges on how the disruptive impact of the youth bulge is managed the recurrent themes of the protests are familiar revolve around a set of socio economic grievances that cut across the age divide jobs and better wages economic growth opportunities and autonomy better services sudan s unemployment rate estimated around 21 4 or over two million of the productive labor force 21 million social media diaspora the protest movements in ethiopia and sudan are beneficiaries of the digital revolution effectively harnessing the power of the smartphone and social media facebook twitter whatsapp to challenge the regimes in power these tools allowed them to organize break state s monopoly over information generate their own multimedia content in the contest for narrative space the state was severely disadvantaged its power of monopoly over communication and access to sophisticated cyber spying software was offset by the technical savvy and ingenuity of the protesters frequent communication shutdowns that targeted sms internet access proved ineffective protesters used vpns encrypted messaging apps and relied on diaspora supporters to bypass state censorship diaspora support in both instances was crucial and went beyond amplifying social media messages activists in north america and europe mobilized funds organized pickets and petitions highlighted rights abuses raised the profile of these protests at the international stage the oromo diaspora in the us close knit and with its own influential media outlets played a particularly pivotal role a role recognized by pm abiy himself when he made a thanksgiving tour of the us in 2018 a number of high profile exiled figures have since been given high level posts in the ethiopian government diaspora influence and power has not been without controversy especially in ethiopia there have been claims hardline activists and media disseminated fake news and inflammatory messages to stoke ethnic hostility and division in sudan there is speculation probably fueled by the military the diaspora is inciting intransigence and radicalizing the protest movement the transition in ethiopia has brought to the fore the simmering tensions between political classes inside the country and those abroad growing intra oromo divisions partly reflect both the type of rivalries political divergence and clash of ambitions that could complicate the transition a fracturing of the protest movement s core support base remains a potential risks inherent in a delicate transition such as ethiopia s but also that in sudan the sudanese reform movement has so far stayed remarkably cohesive that unity is almost certain to come under great strain especially in the highly likely scenario of protracted and intensely contested transition the transition military council favors a fragmented and weak opposition all the signs indicate that is an outcome it is actively working to achieve identity politics sudan and ethiopia are similar in a variety of ways they are the horn s most diverse states with a combined total of 99 major ethnic groups and over 200 languages and dialects they still remain geographically vast and unwieldy even after secessionist wars and peace settlements led to a partition that diminished their original size both share a long history of multiple armed conflicts vast ill governed and severely underdeveloped peripheries conditions that incubated volatile forms of identity politics insurrections and social unrest both also experimented with decentralization models designed to foster self rule greater autonomy neither ethiopia s radical ethnic federal system nor sudan s conventional one achieved the desired aims instead they replicated the ills of the central state bred their own inequities inflamed ethno regional nationalisms and reinforced core periphery tensions ethnic identity politics was a potent factor in the ethiopian mass protests providing the glue and energy what is fascinating is not just the complex ways in which group grievances intersect feed off bleed into wider discontent but the subtle somewhat counter intuitive ways in which even hitherto antagonistic ethnicities regions and religious groups managed to cooperate and transcend their differences ethiopia s mass protests never evolved into a single nationwide movement like sudan s they were almost exclusively confined to oromiya and amhara regional states dominated by two ethnicities divided by a long history of mutual antipathy yet activists in the two regions drew energy succor from each other s protests cross fertilized and learnt effective protest tactics from one another for example amhara region s ghost town tactics that paralyzed cities were replicated in oromiya gradually a new sense of mutual empathy and solidarity developed between oromo and amhara protesters the seminal moment was when protesters in the two regions chanted down down woyane proof the two distinct ethnic discontents had coalesced into a single national demand what tipped the scale was not critical mass though that was important but the emergence of a proto narrative that encapsulated shared national goals in sudan the protest leadership quickly tapped into and harnessed the vast array of diverse grievances to weave a set of key national objectives with a comparably freer civic space well organized trade union movement and professional associations with a proud tradition of political activism sudan s mass revolt took on a national character much more quickly than in ethiopia the rallies in khartoum reflected the diversity of the nation s social fabric and remained characterized throughout by a convivial ecumenical spirit as remarkable as it is rare identity protest and culture sudan achieved in protest what eluded it for decades a genuine moment of unity in diversity the protest rallies in khartoum were a microcosm of the nation bringing together diverse ethnicities civic groups drawn from all regions social strata and professions darfuris kordofanis and nubians women and other distinct social groups aggrieved workers and traders all disenfranchised rendered powerless and invisible by state policies were catapulted onto the national stage they all made common cause and rallied around a single political message but the mass uprisings in sudan and ethiopia were more not just animated by political and economic grievances activists in sudan actually took slight at media characterization of their protests as bread riots they were also impelled by cultural discontent a sense of humiliation and anger at the state s perceived cultural homogenization discrimination and misogyny in ethiopia the oromo unrest was fueled in part by long simmering grievances over status of the oromo language and state interferences in religious affairs while in sudan state driven islamization and arabization remained major sources of social frictions the act of protest was in itself psychologically culturally transformative providing for opportunity to assert cultural pride and reclaim self confidence and autonomy the oromo pride movement in ethiopia and the rise of women in sudan exemplify the cultural forces shaping the politics of protests and transitions pm abiy s open embrace appropriation of oromo culture and his gender parity campaign are just two examples of the symbolic and practical policy impacts hopes are high sudan s new breed of assertive female activists could capitalize on the national mood for change harness their collective picketing power to influence the transition s agenda no less important the rallies served as vehicle for collective catharsis and radical empathy a space to affirm values of mutual interdependence solidarity and peaceful co existence the slogan kuluna darfur we are all darfur at the rallies in khartoum hopefully was not just a feel good empathetic response but marks a fundamental positive shift in the way communities relate to one another religion culture religion as a powerful galvanizer conduit for protest and repository of moral ethical values necessary for a just society and government has a long history in the horn the protests in sudan and ethiopia provide contrasting lessons in the resilience of religion its potency to inspire and channel protest but far more interesting how the debate over relevance of religion in governance continues to evolve the oromo mass insurrection in ethiopia gestated for many years fed off diverse small and localized communal grievances before it snowballed into a national crisis the big triggers high youth unemployment state driven land grabs punitive taxation repression and violent crackdowns are well known less remarked and examined are the obscure and overlapping cultural and religious roots of the discontent brewing for close to a decade the political rebellion owed much of its resilience and success to the cultural revivalist movement gaining in momentum and influence in recent years it drew energy inspiration and self confidence from the potent message of ethnic pride preached by oromo elders abba gadda oromo traditional waqqeffana religion practiced by a small fraction of the community roughly less than 5 played an important complimentary role as a central pillar of cultural expression regarded as the indigenous faith of the oromo nation its rituals and spiritual teachings deemed ecumenical and non threatening to believers of other faiths it progressively galvanized millions the irrecha annual festival of harvests with roots in the waqqeffana religion drew tens of thousands became a visible symbol of political and cultural consciousness a focal point for the protests series of muslim unrests in oromiya in 2012 quickly spread to other regions and continued to simmer for over 18 months much of it initially triggered by alleged state interference in muslim affairs but quickly aggravated by mass arrests of clerics and community leaders suspension of muslim publications such as ye muslimoch guday the muslim protests viewed across oromiya as evidence of the state s wider malign intent against the oromo thus triggered the first spark that lit the fire of large scale rebellion in 2014 oromo nation s ability to harness its cultural heritage and multiple faith traditions and foster internal mutual respect and tolerance is unique so too the tradition of syncretism which indigenized islam and christianity and reduced the heat and social frictions generally associated with puritanism and proselytism this cultural adaptability and inherent resistance to exclusivist manifestations of faith may partly explain why salafism found oromiya a less ambient and sympathetic territory to put down roots the bid to project this benign and positive face of oromo culture on the national stage was thwarted by fragmentation and factionalism as well as the political clout exerted by militant factions widely perceived wedded to exclusivist ethnic agenda pm abiy a practicing pentecostal with muslim heritage represents this hybrid pluralistic and healthy attitude to religion while his fervent faith and the occasional unnerving messianic tenor to his speeches raised some concerns the pm so far has acted with great sensitivity on faith matters he released detained muslim leaders appointed record numbers to key state posts reached out to the orthodox church abiy s medemer philosophy based on values of love compassion and solidarity in the new testament does not signal intent to christianize or change the strong secular character of the state the primary motive is to create a unifying principle around which the nation can rally the rise of evangelical churches and their aggressive proselytization remains a source of anxiety within the influential orthodox church but the greatest threat to religious harmony stems from ethnic conflict inter communal violence in troubled pockets of the country in the last one year exacerbated religious tensions and triggered attacks on mosques and churches sudan islam in transition a striking feature of sudan s protest movement is the near total absence of islamist slogans and the emergence of a more assertive youthful female activists keen to raise their visibility subvert the strict dress code and claw back the huquq al mar a al maqsub usurped fundamental rights of women the language and tone of discourse is deliberately non confessional these two complimentary dynamics lend a mildly secular character to the uprising for the first time in three decades islam is no longer a contentious subject for its young but we ought to be careful in not drawing hasty conclusions more important we must avoid the binary secular religious mindset prism in analyzing events in sudan that the battle over sudan s future is being waged over traditional secular issues liberty justice and bread and butter issues is emblematic not so much of a society that is becoming secular but one deeply disillusioned with the brand of islamization advocated by hassan al turabi and enforced by bashir for three decades sudan s young are rejecting the politicized islam that underpinned bashir s quasi islamic state and the stifling social conservatism fostered by its intrusive policies put differently what we are seeing in sudan is the early sign of a society that is self correcting seeking both to restore health to islam and return it to its traditional orbit sphere it is not yet clear who the secularists are in sudan s transition no group has so far articulated what one might call a clear secular agenda it is conceivable some in the protest movement traditional left leaning parties that played a big role in the protests and even elements in the tmc opposed to islamism may make common cause and lock out islamists from the transition whether all these diverse anti islamist stakeholders can agree on a common strategy to address the issue of islam and state is hard to tell an aggressive enclavement strategy that criminalizes islamism locks islamists out is certain to prove hugely destabilizing it risks driving islamists underground and bound to incubate the same toxic type of militancy and violence familiar in many parts of the muslim world sudan s best hope to achieve a viable and sustainable transition lays in a policy of accommodation that is genuinely inclusive islamist parties are predominantly moderate and including them in the tent has potential to lock them into the broader reform process temper their politics and progressively isolate the more militant groups gulf meddling the controversial intervention in sudan s transition in recent weeks by gulf actors principally uae and ksa ostensibly aimed at preventing the muslim brotherhood from staging a comeback is both ill advised and dangerous first there isn t the kind of cohesive highly organized islamist opposition able to single handedly gain dominance second the tmc cannot be a guarantor of long term stability nor can it serve as an effective bulwark against islamism third and assuming they cared to look deeper at the uprising and the social political trends they would have realized the depth of disillusionment with islamist politics and generally with all traditional politics and parties finally the saudi emirati axis s meddling alienates huge segments of society and counter productive to their twin strategic goals maintaining sudanese troops in yemen and isolating the muslim brotherhood share this post facebook twitter telegram whatsapp email print

customers and once again posted a world class net promoter score of 83 in the last 12 months in addition to organic growth we remain focused on building the pac van brand throughout north america by geographically expanding our portable storage container business during the quarter we completed one acquisition in fort worth texas increasing our presence in that dynamic state we also opened a greenfield location in panama city florida adding our eighth branch in the southeast region this week we completed an acquisition of a portable storage business in kentucky adding three locations to the three already in kentucky we continue to serve just over half of the top 100 msas in the us including 39 of the top 50 and our acquisition pipeline remains healthy our liquid containment business in north america delivered slightly improved year over year results as we have seen some moderation in leasing activity in texas while oil and gas production in both basins remain healthy we were impacted in the quarter by certain customers consolidating their field personnel due to recent acquisition activity as well as the normal seasonal slowdown combined with some pipeline availability challenges with some of our customers in the permian all indicators point to continued healthy production activity in both basins in the foreseeable future our overall business remains strong but it s not operating at peak level we were experiencing last fall our north american manufacturing operations posted a slightly positive adjusted ebitda during the quarter as sales to external customers declined from reduced sales of specialty tanks and chassis but we expect activity to increase in fourth quarter as the backlog is very strong now turning to our asia pacific region our asia pacific region continued its positive momentum by delivering third quarter growth in leasing revenues of 11 on a local currency basis up from 9 growth last quarter and marking its 10th year over year increase out of the last 11 quarters sales revenues were down year over year in local currency mostly due to one large sale that occurred last year in third quarter that wasn t repeated this year total reported revenues during the quarter in us dollar were adversely impacted by an approximate 9 decline in average australian dollar exchange rate between periods the increase in royal wolf s leasing revenues was spread across almost all of the end markets with noticeable increases in transportation construction consumer and industrial sectors the growth has mainly been driven by increases in average units on lease combined with average lease rates our team remains focused on building upon its leading market position across the region through a combination of organic growth greenfield openings and to the extent they become available accretive acquisitions to conclude we continue to see both organic growth and expansion opportunities in north america as well as ability to strengthen our market leadership in the asia pacific region as always we ll remain disciplined in our capital allocation our performance year to date positions us well to finish the year strong while also providing us with a solid foundation for continued growth in the fiscal year 2020 i ll now turn over the call to chuck barrantes for his financial review and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jody we intend on filing our annual report on form 10 q shortly at which time this document will be available on both the sec s edgar filing system and our website and i encourage investors and other interested parties to read it as it contains a substantial amount of information about our company some of which we will discuss today turning to our fiscal third quarter financial results total revenues were 86 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 84 4 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 an increase of 2 leasing revenues were 59 6 million an increase of approximately 9 over the prior year s quarter and comprised 70 of total non manufacturing revenues for the quarter versus 67 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 non manufacturing sales revenues were 25 2 million in the quarter down from 27 3 million in the third quarter of the prior year in our north american leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totaled 57 2 million compared with 51 8 million for the year ago period an increase of 10 the increases occurred across most sectors but primarily in the construction commercial and oil and gas sectors revenues at our north american manufacturing operations for the third quarter were 27 point 2 7 million excuse me including intercompany sales of 1 3 million for our north american leasing operations this compares to 3 2 million of total sales for the year ago period including intercompany sales of 922 000 ph as jody mentioned our manufacturing operations experienced reduced demand for specialty tanks and other steel related products particularly chassis in our asia pacific leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totaled 27 6 million compared to 30 3 million for the year ago period a decrease of 9 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in utility sector as one large sale totaling 1 8 million which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was not repeated this year and as jody mentioned an approximate 9 decline in the australian dollar between the periods leasing revenues increased by approximately 1 on a year over year basis and 11 on a local currency basis driven mainly by increases in the transportation construction industrial and consumer sectors consolidated adjusted ebitda was 24 1 million in the quarter compared to 21 9 million in the prior year s quarter an increase of 10 and adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of total revenues was 28 up from 26 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as jody stated this was the ninth consecutive quarter of year over year adjusted ebitda growth in north america adjusted ebitda for our leasing operations was 17 3 million in the third quarter compared to 15 2 million for the year ago quarter an increase of 14 adjusted ebitda at pac van was 12 2 million up 20 year over year and lone star s adjusted ebitda was 5 1 million up 2 from the prior year for our manufacturing operations on a stand alone basis adjusted ebitda was 17 000 for the quarter compared to 111 000 in last year s third quarter asia pacific s adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was 8 1 million compared to 7 6 million in the year ago period an increase of approximately 7 on a local currency basis adjusted ebitda increased by approximately 17 interest expense for the third quarter was up 10 2 million an increase of 800 000 from the year ago period the increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense in the asia pacific area due to a 1 2 million fee on the prepayment of the bison capital term notes which resulted in a higher weighted average interest rate of 13 7 versus 10 4 in the year ago period and was partially offset by a lower average borrowings and a weaker australian dollar between the periods during the quarter we completed we completely repaid the over 60 million bison capital senior note in the asia pacific area replacing this higher cost debt with lower cost borrowings on an amended and expanded syndicated credit facility led by deutsche bank ag this move is expected to generate interest savings of over 3 million per year net loss attributable to common stockholders in the third quarter was 1 3 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 1 5 million or 0 06 per share in the year ago quarter included in these results were non cash charges of 1 1 million and 500 000 ph in fiscal year 2019 and 2018 respectively for the change in valuation of the stand alone bifurcated derivatives in our asia pacific convertible note both periods include 922 000 for the dividends paid on our preferred stock for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 we generated free cash flow before fleet activity of 35 7 million compared to 32 2 million in the prior year period an increase of 11 now turning to our balance sheet at march 31st the company had a net leverage ratio of 4 times for the trailing 12 months an improvement from 4 6 times at june 30 2018 the reduction in leverage is due to a combination of factors including the forced conversion of the convertible note at royal wolf and our strong financial performance turning to our companywide outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 based on our year to date results we remain confident that consolidated revenues for the fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 370 million to 390 million and that consolidated adjusted ebitda will increase by 20 to 25 in fiscal year 2019 from fiscal year 2018 this outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 this now concludes our prepared comments and i would like to turn the call back to the operator for the question and answer session questions and answers operator thank you at this time ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brent thielman of d a davidson brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey thanks good morning jody e miller president and chief executive officer hey good morning brent charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning brent thielman d a davidson analyst i mean the outlook to get to the upper end of that ebitda guidance range you need to see a pretty sizable increase in ebitda from 3q to 4q can you get there even with the containment business sort of sideways here jody e miller president and chief executive officer i think a lot of it will depend on the energy side we had a little bit more of a hit we knew some of the challenges coming but through the consolidation and the pipeline issues and everything else it appears it s picking up i don t know if it will pick up quite enough to make up the gap our core business in the us as we stated on the call is doing exceptionally well with our containerized fleet growing at 29 for the year but it s probably not quite enough to make up the top of the range for the energy side and then australian dollars really hurting us at 9 year over year as well so it ll be a little bit tough to get up to the top of the range charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer brent as jody mentioned earlier on the call i mean it s we re still doing very well on the permian it s just not shooting at all levels it was early part of the year but we do still expect to have year over year growth in q4 so like anything else it s always at a point in time so we re still very very optimistic and on the future in that sector in our business in north america brent thielman d a davidson analyst sure and yes i mean jody it sounds like things are picking up i ll assume that means slowly but you ve seen some changes since the end of the quarter in that business out there jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay and then chuck were there additional costs that showed up in the interest line this quarter relative to the paydown at bison capital charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean that s very taking brent s side maybe didn t seem clearly but in the quarter we had about 1 2 million 1 3 million of the prepayment fee on the full repayment of the bison term note so that was the reason for the primary increase brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay got it got it okay and then maybe just last question jody the business in australia i mean obviously doing really well it s evident in the numbers i guess i m just kind of curious what the boots on the ground are telling you just with all the noise around china obviously that has an impact on the economy there i guess what are you seeing from a demand perspective jody e miller president and chief executive officer yeah not much of a change to be honest the construction sector s still doing really well as we said before everything in australia has moved with containers right all the freight so our freight business is still very good they still got to get product in and out all the major cities the bnc ph and stackable solutions are getting more accepted and growing and that s still our fastest growing segment so all indications show that it s still going to be strong we get double digit growth in leasing which i think is exceptional we had a couple large sales that didn t repeat this year we also as you guys would probably remember we have a large majority of camps setting that are getting deployed currently there s a big chunk of them going to a project that will help as well so i think there s good optimism in this coming quarter brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay great thank you jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you brent charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brent operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of scott schneeberger of oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst thanks hey good morning guys jody e miller president and chief executive officer good morning scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst let s go back just following on a bunch of things that were just discussed in texas how would you classify your visibility there given the slightly changing dynamic with regard to volume and with regard to pricing jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes so i don t think we ll see the pricing increases that we ve seen the first half of the year i think it s kind of flattened out the price of oil is still fine i think with the consolidation happening right now and some of that obviously they re not buying companies to taper that off long term but there s a little bit of a stall where they catch their breath the drill rigs are down slightly so completions and some of the other things are kind of catching their breath but i look for those to kind of stay stable and gradually pick back up so there s a little bit more happening then there was in the past we don t have the crystal ball to say this is what it s going to be we had scheduled out three to six months on some of our customers and some of those are changing a little bit long term we think it ll work its way out and everything will be fine but i think there s just the last three months and maybe now it seems to be kind of picking back up and being a little more positive than it has been in the last three to four months scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst thanks appreciate that it s helpful i want to go back to swing factors i was asking in the context of what how you could finish the fiscal year but just in that light but also in the quarter itself how much of an impact to the australian dollar have relative to what you were expecting at the start of the quarter i m just curious what kind of a swing factor that was in the quarter itself charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no we the australia dollar for the quarter pretty much performed what we had expected we were looking at around 0 71 ph and that s what it was going to q4 australian dollars dipped down a little bit i think it was below 0 70 so we re getting obviously some negative impact on the translation of the dollar not on the economics locally but for the quarter it was what we expected but 9 reduction compared to the prior year third quarter scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst i appreciate that color and then the last thing on pac van looking really good and hearing from some of your competitors recently the same trends are what we re hearing there too so jody just how do you feel about visibility there and kind of the same question i was asking about texas lone star the pricing the volume and the sustainability there jody e miller president and chief executive officer yeah i think the core portable storage side is extremely strong i think still year to date it s a 17 organic which i think it s just awesome they re doing a great job there i think some of the new innovation national accounts and things that we have implemented i think will continue there and we see nothing but a positive forecast in our core business the tank or liquid storage side in texas and also on the pac van side pricing is doing very very well as well we re getting nice increases and we continue to be very consistent on the lone star side as i said earlier i think pricing is kind of flattened out where we were raising prices the first half maybe not quite as much visibility into the short term future with some of the things that are happening with consolidation they re starting to get their pipeline challenges worked out so we still feel very optimistic about it but in the short term maybe not quite as clear as we ve seen the last year but still very optimistic in the long haul scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst okay thanks i appreciate it guys operator our next question comes from the line of luis hernandez an investor luis hernandez private investor yes hello good morning thanks for taking the question jody e miller president and chief executive officer good morning luis charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning luis luis hernandez private investor hello all right the first one on the refi of the bison loan that one was around 11 or 12 and charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah 12 luis hernandez private investor sorry go ahead charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no no 11 9 12 was the luis hernandez private investor and the refinancing is what was at what rate roughly charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer it s with the deutsche bank rate so it s somewhere not quite senior facility rates but around 6 level luis hernandez private investor okay all right i guess that s a pretty good news there then on the pac van which segments are you most more optimistic on over the next 12 18 months jody e miller president and chief executive officer yeah luis i think it s honestly across the board if we look at our growth we break it out by segment all segments are doing very well i think construction looks very positive i think our national accounts is probably the most optimistic opportunity for us some of our new product innovation is helping with all segments but it s really across the board i think we re outgrowing obviously the industry but i think everything looks very optimistic on the core business luis hernandez private investor okay all right great then the other next question would be on do you expect a higher level of free cash flow in q4 i mean this first nine months chuck you said 30 36 million roughly 35 7 million do you expect sort of a bump on q4 just maybe some coming from working capital or something charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i think luis just by the fact that on the refinance of bison capital we should get a nice pick up from there just some free cash flow and yes i do expect free cash flow to pick up luis hernandez private investor okay all right and finally on pac van just to basic to dig little details have you grown the fleet at all jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes yes we re running about 80 utilization so obviously there s branches that are running short we continue to that s a big part of our organic number right so we re 17 organic so when you re running close to that 80 more we definitely have added to the fleet luis hernandez private investor yeah because you were roughly around 4 000 tanks just wanted to know if you had grown those kinds at all jody e miller president and chief executive officer no it s all been core storage and glo our glo is still leads our growth percentage and then storage containers are next those are two higher growth products we ve not really we ve not added anything on the tank side and very little in any other categories charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer in north america last year at march 31 2018 we had about a total lease fleet including 4 000 something frac tanks about 43 000 and at the end of march this current third quarter we re at 51 500 ph luis hernandez private investor okay yeah i when i asked the fleet i meant the tank fleet not something jody e miller president and chief executive officer tanks have not grown significant at all last march we had total tanks in north america 4 146 and we have 4 260 now luis hernandez private investor okay so it s pretty much roughly the same slightly above right that s good and then on the rates on the tanks versus 2014 we always check that number how is that the pickup or the relationship of that jody e miller president and chief executive officer the rates on of which product are you luis hernandez private investor on the tanks on the oil tanks charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and so last year third quarter average rate was about for the quarter it was 805 versus little over 900 this quarter this third quarter luis hernandez private investor okay so 900 and then versus 2014 rates charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer we re still well behind not even close to the peak of those rates i d have to look and see but i would state still 30 40 under what we were at that time luis hernandez private investor right so maybe 70 of the rates okay jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes or a little less luis hernandez private investor yeah all right sounds good thanks good quarter and talk to you guys in next three months jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you luis operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of brian gagnon of gagnon securities brian gagnon gagnon securities analyst hey jody and chuck you have inaudible this year i m looking at the repayment of the bison note and you got hit with 1 2 ph million in q3 and it looks to me like your savings going forward is something on the order of 700 000 or 800 000 a quarter so can i think about the fourth quarter having an automatic 2 million increase versus where you were in q3 on interest hit charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i would think that s fair deal ph brian gagnon gagnon securities analyst good gentlemen thank you very much charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you operator and there are no other questions at this time i would now

columbia may 08 2019 globe newswire acadian timber corp acadian or the company tsx adn today reported financial and operating results1 for the three months ended march 30 2019 the first quarter operating rates for acadian s primary sawmill and pulp and paper customers remained strong through the first quarter of the year said mark bishop chief executive officer of acadian mr bishop further noted that while our operations during the quarter were negatively impacted by unseasonably cold weather which interrupted harvesting and transportation activities log demand remains firm and we anticipate meeting our target harvest and sales volumes for the full year acadian generated adjusted ebitda1 of 8 9 million for the first quarter in line with the prior year period acadian continues to benefit from strong demand reflecting the favourable dynamics of the northeast regional log markets operations were however impacted by adverse weather conditions throughout the first quarter as a result acadian s log sales volumes decreased 7 which was offset by the benefit of an increase in the weighted average log selling price of 4 compared to the prior year period for the three month period ended march 30 2019 the board of directors has declared dividends of 0 29 per share or 4 8 million compared to 4 6 million during the same period of 2018 reflecting dividend increases announced in may 2018 and february 2019 amounting to a combined 5 increase in our quarterly dividend per share this represents a payout ratio1 of 75 which is below our long term annual target of 95 but in line with expectations given the seasonality of our operations review of operations financial and operating highlights three months ended cad thousands except per share information march 30 2019 march 31

32 9 million in the prior year period acadian benefited from strong seasonal demand however operations were impacted by adverse weather conditions during the quarter resulting in a 7 decrease in log sales volumes and a 20 decrease in ancillary revenues primarily related to timber services these impacts were partially offset by a 4 increase in the weighted average log selling price as our products benefited from favourable market dynamics costs were 22 1 million during the first quarter compared to 24 0 million during the prior year period reflecting lower log sales volumes and administrative cost savings variable log harvest costs were in line with the prior year period adjusted ebitda of 8 9 million during the first quarter was in line with the prior year period the adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was 29 higher than 27 in the prior year period due to improved log selling prices and lower relative operating costs partially offset by the impact of lower log sales volumes net income of 6 2 million or 0 37 per share was 4 2 million higher than the prior year period of 2 0 million or 0 12 per share the variance from the prior year period is primarily due to an unrealized foreign exchange revaluation gain on u s dollar denominated long term debt during the first quarter compared to an unrealized revaluation loss in the prior year period segment performance new

entitled cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements section of this news release for a description of material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements in the following please see the risk factors section of our management s discussion and analysis of acadian s most recent annual report and annual information form available on our website at www acadiantimber com or filed with sedar at www sedar com acadian s key markets include softwood sawtimber hardwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood northeast north american softwood dimension sawmills represent over one third of acadian s end use market and are the primary market for our softwood sawtimber our mixed softwood and hardwood resource combined with diversified end use markets underpin acadian s best in class long term performance well balanced regional supply demand fundamentals continue to support attractive stable log pricing across all key markets the u s economy has continued to perform well through early 2019 and forecasters expect continued steady performance supported by job growth and wage increases however first quarter new home construction activity was below expectations due to several factors including increased mortgage rates the u s federal government shutdown uncertainty regarding chinese economic outlook and possible fallout from u s trade policy decisions and importantly the impact of severe winter weather in much of north america and heavy rainfall in the u s south while the u s home building sector has had some recent headwinds factors including favourable demographics for growth in household formation low home inventories and moderating rates suggest upward momentum in housing construction should resume in the near term recent consensus forecasts anticipate average year over year growth in u s housing starts for 2019 and 2020 of about 2 and 3 respectively forecasters continue to expect the proportion of single family starts the largest lumber consuming segment of u s housing starts to improve modestly through 2019 and 2020 additionally home repair and remodeling are also projected to grow modestly over the next two years north american sawtimber consumption is therefore expected to post modest year over year growth average q1 2019 quarterly benchmark eastern spruce pine fir lumber prices increased 8 while southern yellow pine lumber prices declined 4 compared to the prior quarter while we anticipate continued volatility in lumber prices in the near term dictated by the pace of regional inventory drawdown and spring building conditions forecasters expect steady demand growth combined with capacity and log supply constraints in western canada to support a robust recovery in lumber pricing in mid 2019 albeit below the levels achieved in 2018 by extension we anticipate continued stable softwood sawtimber pricing in acadian s regional markets acadian s hardwood sawtimber and pulpwood markets remain well balanced with a continued positive outlook for the foreseeable future softwood pulpwood markets acadian s smallest product segment by volume and margin have improved modestly and the expected pulp mill restart during h2 2019 in maine is expected to be a catalyst for further recovery in demand and pricing while the biomass market in maine remains weak the new brunswick biomass market continues to be supported by steady export demand at attractive prices management team changes acadian announced today that ms mabel wong will be leaving the position of chief

make americaâ s economy great again a lot of americans find themselves in a quandary over donald trump on the one hand they can t stand the braggadocious billionaire for his lack of principles business ethics exorbitant wealth his treatment of women minorities the list goes on and on but they also have to admit the economy is in better shape now than when barack obama was installed in the white house can trump justifiably take credit for the economic expansion of the last two and a half years why is the us economy growing in this article we ll take a deep dive into the question why is the american economy great again the sweet spot the facts would appear to support that notion the evidence shows that the economy has done extremely well since trump was inaugurated as president in january 2017 in the first quarter the us economy barreled along at 3 2 a year ago it was at 4 2 that s not the highest growth the american economy has seen historically but it s pretty good taking a look at the chart below by trading economics we can see that economic growth peaked in 2014 at close to 6 when obama was president then dropped under 1 as the us election cycle began in 2015 since trump has taken the helm the trend line is clearly up examining the usual economic indicators we find employment has fallen to 3 6 which is the lowest since the mid 1960s over 50 years ago african american unemployment is at a record low the stock market is loving it after hitting an all time high of 26 828 on october 3 2018 the dow jones industrial average traded sideways until april 5 2019 when the closing bell rang on a yearly top of 26 424 the s p 500 is up about 25 since its december low bubble what bubble the economy has added over 5 4 million jobs since trump and his team entered the white house the usual response to low unemployment is to argue that wages haven t kept pace but we can t say that after a decade of stagnation real wages hourly pay accounting for inflation have grown 3 2 an economy that shows those kind of numbers usually has high inflation not just wage inflation but goods and services inflation but even here the united states is well within a comfortable range at 1 6 it s actually below the fed s 2 target june will mark the 10th year of a growing us economy ipolitics sums it all up nicely never before has there been such a perfect economic sweet spot solid growth low inflation steady increasing wages and full employment in practical terms everyone who wants a job can find one everyone with a job is taking home a bigger paycheque inflation isn t eroding savings and most americans just got a bigger refund check courtesy of trump s tax cuts fed reaction on may 1st the us federal reserve decided to hold interest rates steady at between 2 2 and 2 5 going against the president s desire to cut them in order to stimulate the economy donald trump tweeted that the fed should slice 1 off borrowing costs to help the us economy go up like a rocket mike pence the vice president has made similar statements in support of a cut but chairman jerome powell and the rest of the fed s open market committee ignored them by sticking to their position of not changing interest rates for the rest of the year since 2015 the us central bank has raised rates nine times lifting them from near 0 to 2 5 four of the raises were last year as it transitioned from stimulating economic growth through quantitative easing to stabilizing it in economics there is a direct relationship between economic growth and interest rates when an economy is doing well rates should be allowed to rise because businesses can handle the increased cost of borrowing a raise also keeps inflation a by product of a strong economy in check when an economy is in trouble as the united states was in 2008 09 cutting interest rates has the opposite effect it stimulates the economy rates can remain at rock bottom levels as long as inflation the higher costs of goods and labor doesn t increase too much this year the fed has given mixed signals as to what it s going to do in the second half of last year interest rate hikes and the ongoing us china trade war caused a stock market correction that and recessionary signals such as a flattening treasury yield curve during the first quarter had the fed backtracking on planned rate hikes for 2019 now that the stock market has bounced back and the us economy is doing well the fed has less reason not to raise rates on the other hand us core inflation a sign of a growing economy has lessened from 1 7 in february to 1 6 in march some economists argue that low inflation supports the case for interest rate cuts which may be needed to stimulate the economy others caution that the federal reserve should keep stimulus in the form of interest rate cuts and bond buying qe in its back pocket for when the fed really needs it not when the economy is on a tear raking it in let s pause for a moment to consider the situation as it stands the us economy is doing very well even though it s in the midst of a trade war with china farmers whose crops have been slapped with tariffs are having to get bailed out the us dollar index has risen helped by interest rate hikes from february 2018 when it was at 89 10 to its current as of wednesday 97 60 a gain of 9 4 dollar strength is indicative of the us economy s health so it s a good thing even though trump wants a lower dollar to boost exports and to mend the us trade deficit eight months ago the stock market was faltering over worries that trump would enact 200 billion worth of tariffs on chinese goods a month later those worries were forgotten now they re back or should be with the us government about to escalate tariffs on chinese imports from 10 to 25 yet the dow and the s p have barely flinched meanwhile the national debt continues to mount but nobody especially democrats seems very perturbed in september 2018 the house of representatives passed a 3 8 trillion tax cut adding to the 1 5 trillion slash in 2017 the debt is currently 22 trillion and counting what gives shouldn t the us economy be hurting why is it doing do well the clue lies in corporate profits which despite concerns over labor shortages and wage inflation are holding up well earnings have beat expectations buyback bonanza in december 2017 the trump administration passed the tax cuts and jobs act the legislation slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and the top individual tax rate shrunk to 37 it also cut income tax rates doubled the standard deduction and eliminated personal exemptions but the most important change concerned the repatriation of profits that us corporations were holding overseas under the tax cuts and jobs act companies were incentivized to bring their overseas profits to the united states where they would be taxed at a one time rate of 15 5 which is lower than the regular corporate tax rate of 21 previously companies would defer really avoid us tax on profits held in low tax jurisdictions like switzerland and ireland until they brought their profits into the us where they would be taxed at 35 in 2018 us multinationals took full advantage of the tax holiday sending home over half a trillion dollars held overseas to be taxed at the lower rate suddenly these companies found themselves flush with cash and they needed to find a way to spend it the options are typically to plough funds back into the company via capital expenditures like new buildings products or equipment or distribute the money back to shareholders in the form of dividends or through share buybacks which don t go directly to shareholders but reduce the number of outstanding shares thereby making the share float less diluted share buybacks are a relatively new phenomenon for most of the 20th century they were illegal because they were considered to be a form of stock market manipulation but that all changed in 1982 when the sec legalized them since then buybacks have been a popular tool for management to stuff cash back into the company indirectly by reducing the share float they ve been on the rise for over a decade from 2007 to 2016 s p companies bought 4 2 trillion of their own stock almost double the 2 4 trillion purchased 2003 12 purchasing company stock generally inflates the share price and boosts earnings per share a key metric on which ceo bonuses are calculated in 2018 us companies set a record 1 trillion in stock buybacks apple is the biggest re purchaser having poured a quarter trillion dollars into buying its own stock over the last decade according to cnbc among the top five companies on the 2018 buyback train reported yahoo finance were oracle wells fargo microsoft and merck out of the s p 500 companies 444 repurchased stock in 2018 compared to 424 in 2017 as an example of how companies have used buyback programs to improve their metrics consider tech giants apple and alphabet since 2012 apple s buyback program cut its outstanding shares by one quarter doubled its earnings per share and ended up with a 150 increase in its share price since alphabet launched its buyback program in 2015 google s parent company has repurchased 17 billion worth of stock thereby helping to reduce its total share count and like apple double its per share earnings over the past four years alphabet s stock has run up 123 there is clearly a strong connection between repatriation stock buybacks and higher than normal corporate earnings is it any coincidence that half a trillion dollars worth of overseas profits were brought home in 2018 during which time the united states saw the most share buybacks in history along with sky high corporate earnings data firm refinitiv estimates profit growth among s p 500 companies at 23 in 2018 s p stocks were up 13 in the first quarter of 2019 the best q1 performance since 1998 and a booming stock market i don t think so and even though repatriation has run its course buybacks are popular on wall street share repurchases have increased every quarter of the last four quarters and the buying frenzy is set to continue bank of america merrill lynch says repurchases have almost doubled up 91 year over year and at the current pace will probably eclipse the 2018 record no surprise then that the 1 5 trillion tax cut passed by the trump administration has had little impact on business investment or hiring plans reuters quotes a poll conducted by the national association of business economics that found 84 of respondents had no plans to accelerate investments because of lower corporate taxes it s not a stretch to assume that s because any money left over from repatriation was used to buy back their own stock rather than investing in the companies themselves or increasing orders the us purchasing mangers index plunged from 60 in the beginning of january 2018 to 55 last fall it currently sits around 53 pmi is a forward looking economic indicator that typically includes new orders factory output employment supplier deliver times and stocks of purchases there are plenty of pros and cons to stock buybacks as my previous articles on this topic show i m in the con camp on the positive side of the ledger reducing a company s outstanding shares makes each dollar of earnings more valuable on a per share basis which is good for investors another plus for shareholders executives seemingly know how much their company is worth so if they are buying back shares it s a signal that the stock is undervalued otherwise why would they buy high really though the most insightful thing to say about share buybacks is that they re good for management not shareholders buybacks make it easier for executives to hit targets by reducing the number of shares management receives compensation usually in the form of stock options that is tied to the company s stock price the higher the stock price the more they make cashing out their options but executives are foregoing the opportunity to put that extra cash back into the business instead which could potentially grow the company studies have linked increased spending on buybacks to decreased corporate investment such as expansion plans more hiring or raises buybacks have been used as a punching bag for democrats in particular who argue that buybacks enrich companies and wealthy shareholders at the expense of workers unequal spoils but isn t the fact that companies are able to purchase their own stock even if it doesn t benefit shareholders directly a sign of a healthy economy surely if they didn t have confidence in the future of their own corporations they wouldn t invest in them preferring to save their cash for a better day in other words is corporate enrichment the answer to the question what is making the american economy grow the short answer is yes according to the congressional budget office cbo about 0 3 of the 2 9 gdp growth in 2018 can be attributed to the 1 5 trillion tax cut the problem is in allowing companies to keep more of their profits the government is depriving itself of tax revenue the cbo forecasts the tax cut and this is just the first tax cut the 1 5 trillion will add 1 5 trillion to the national debt over the next 11 years how will the government pay for such massive ticket items as the 2 trillion infrastructure plan just proposed print more money i guess and heave it onto the mountainous debt pile as for the old trickle down effect cnn quotes the congressional joint committee on taxation in reporting that two thirds of taxpayers paid around 100 less in taxes in 2018 about the cost of a nice dinner for two for households making under 50 000 in 2018 their after tax income rose by 0 6 whereas those making between 500 000 and a million were an average 5 2 richer consumption is the largest component of gdp but it is very unlikely that households hanging on to a few hundred dollar more per year due to tax cuts will increase their consumption enough to have any impact on gdp another day older and deeper in debt so far our investigation into what is making the us economy grow has found that corporate earnings which in turn drive the stock market are a key piece of the puzzle to understanding why the us economy is booming when in many ways it shouldn t be another way to test this idea is to look at the amount that business investment contributed to gdp in 2018 business investment is the amount that businesses purchased to produce consumer goods according to the balance in 2018 us business investments amounted to 3 39 trillion 18 of gdp double the recessionary low of 1 5 trillion in 2009 so although many companies used the opportunity of a tax cut and repatriation to buy back their own shares they were still purchasing a lot of inputs needed to make consumer goods this of course benefits suppliers to those companies speaking of consumers we know that consumer spending makes up 68 of the us economy if most businesses are doing well and they appear to be from the statistics employees should theoretically have more to spend on goods and services people are keeping their jobs and their wages are going up this in fact is what we find the balance reports that consumer spending increased by 1 2 in the first quarter of this year and notes that strong consumer spending is the main reason the gdp growth rate has been within the 2 3 healthy range since the great recession the chart below from trading economics shows consumer spending going up steadily since the first quarter of 2018 when it was 12 7 trillion to 13 trillion in q1 2019 in march when inflation hit a one year low consumer spending increased by 0 9 the most in nearly a decade bloomberg said that got me curious as to where people are finding the money to spend 13 trillion in the first quarter the answer appears to be uncle visa another bloomberg article reports that us credit card debt skyrocketed to 870 billion in 2018 a new record conclusion this article started with a simple question why is the us economy doing so well our answer is two fold first the high gdp is due to rising consumer spending on the back of personal tax cuts a very minor portion imo and enough confidence in one s own financial circumstances and the overall economy to rack up unprecedented credit card debt to this we should add that for high income earners the extra 5 2 on average of income saved due to personal tax cuts likely did translate into significant consumer spending especially big ticket items like houses vacation property vehicles etc second the high gdp growth can be attributed to healthy corporate earnings these earnings remember s p 500 companies in 2018 saw a 23 increase in net profits came about due to the trump administration s corporate tax cuts that resulted in a jaw dropping half a trillion dollars moved into us multinationals from their overseas tax havens these companies then plowed around 1 trillion into their own coffers through share buybacks thus lowering their outstanding shares goosing their earnings per share and hiking their stock prices this artifical goosing of the economy helped the gdp number and made corporate america look great but the shine didn t and still doesn t extend to employees the 95 of americans not in the stock market and in most cases the companies themselves stock price centric management and boards invested little to nothing into growing their businesses preferring instead to take the easy route and just buy stock curious as to what the official reason is for the 3 2 annual growth rate in the first quarter here is the answer verbatim from the bureau of economic analysis the increase in real gdp in the first quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures pce private inventory investment exports state and local government spending and nonresidential fixed investment imports which are a subtraction in the calculation of gdp decreased table 2 these contributions were partly offset by a decrease in residential investment tough to decipher what that means in plain english but it pretty much jibes with what we re saying we haven t mentioned government spending which is 17 of gdp we know that federal state and local governments spent 3 18 trillion in 2018 of which washington spent 1 23 trillion more than 60 of that went to the military according to the balance although state and local government contributions rose a bit since 2017 other sectors of the economy grew faster so we can eliminate it from our variables as to what is causing us gdp to rise when trump runs for re election in 2020 he s going to claim the strength of the economy is all his doing from everything we ve read he s not wrong but it s more nuanced than he will make it out to be as to whether the average american is feeling the love we are guessing probably not his opponents will find plenty of other

rashid abdi for addis standard addis abeba may 10 2019 two mass protest movements have in quick succession forced regime changes in sudan and ethiopia two of the horn of africa s quintessential hard states a deep seated disillusion with the security and developmental states drives the new revolutionary mood what is less clear is where all the ferment and the popular demand for a new dispensation will lead in sudan the ouster of al bashir has been followed by a partial retreat of the security state in ethiopia the election of a reformist pm and a year of sweeping reforms have extensively eroded the power of the security deep state yet neither pm abiy s extensive cull nor sudanese military council s modest targeted purge constitute a fundamental dismantling of the structures of the security state more important the transitions under way in the two countries were in the initial phases at least top down attempts by the security state to engineer a soft landing with minimal disruptions pm abiy s singular act of genius lay in the way he deftly subverted that strategy of piecemeal reform assigned to him by the ruling party and began almost single handedly to unravel old ethiopia at break neck speed the retreat of the authoritarian order in both cases opens huge possibilities a generational opportunity for meaningful and positive change but also great risks in ethiopia a year of deep reforms under the reformist premier abiy ahmed has put the transition on a rocky but relatively steady positive trajectory overall prospects for good governance civil liberties and human rights continue to improve in sudan the situation is less hopeful and remains so far uncertain the hopes and expectations raised by the resignation of omar al bashir after 30 years in power now grates against the reality of a potentially messy and protracted transition following a controversial intervention by the army the transition military council tmc made up of bashir s allies is struggling against mounting popular discontent to manage an interregnum the horn is at strategic crossroads there is immense hope but also great fear how ethiopia and sudan manage their fraught transitions and the prospects for success and reversal remain unknown what is not in doubt is that a botched transition in both nations will crush the dream of millions and their quest for liberty and better quality of life embolden autocratic regimes and vindicate their ideology of stability the unprecedented upheaval and ferment in the two horn states provide an extraordinary window into the complex diverse and obscure changes and currents shaking up society and traditional politics these contextual dynamics must not be overlooked in the analyses of ethiopia and sudan sudan s turbulent interregnum sudan and ethiopia offer two fraught transition models atypical unstable and potentially reversible while dissimilar in some key aspects both are attempts at a top down fix reliant on continued goodwill and support of the military security services and dominant parties more important the two transitions are not outcomes of a political and constitutional settlements and likely to remain contested and unsettled for some time sudan s transition is in its infancy and dogged by a host of challenges of the two it is the one with the greatest potential for short term crisis but if successful one that opens enormous possibilities for improved governance and stability formal direct talks between sudan s protest movement and the military began on 27 april but quickly hit a snag barely two days later the key sticking points the length of the transition military wants 2 years the protest movement favours 4 years arguing more time was needed to undo the damage of 30 years of misrule composition of the proposed sovereign transition council stc and who should lead it on 30 april the tmc issued a series of controversial and unilateral decisions that escalated the stalemate into a crisis the council said the stc would be headed by the military 7 out 10 posts allocated to the military contrary to spa s demand for a 15 member council the bulk of whose members are civilian it further called on the spa to dismantle barricades at the army command in khartoum and get protesters off the streets the generals have been angling for a longer pre transition period from the start this was largely based on the assumption they stood to gain more from the tactical point of view the spa had more to lose but there are other pressing calculations first more time allows the tmc to sort out internal divisions second it gives them the leg room to craft and fine tune its negotiation strategy third it provides the tmc with the opportunity to drag out the process wear down the pro democracy movement the so called attrition option that has served the military well in the past the decision by the au to extend the tmc s life by three months is therefore a major victory for the military it now has up to the end of july 2019 to set up an authority to oversee the transition agree a roadmap with the opposition a viable transition roadmap in sudan depends on consensus between the five distinct actors constituencies the street the leadership of the protest movement traditional parties the tmc and support from regional actors this will not be easy it is almost certain divergent aims interests and calculations could prove a major impediment military council a reluctant reformer at the heart of sudan s chaotic and bitter transition contest indeed the crisis of legitimacy credibility is the self appointed tmc it is made up of senior generals all beneficiaries of the army purges in the last one decade by bashir that elevated loyalists to key posts they eased bashir out made a number of significant concessions but controversially stone walled when it came to the speedy transfer of power to a civilian administration significantly it has so far resisted popular calls for the dismantling of the so called deep state dawlah al amiqah widely perceived as a covert power centre whose members included senior generals securocrats and politicians and which exercised extra constitutional influence on the state what the tmc s true aims are its interests and links with the deep state and foreign powers are all a matter for debate and conjecture far less speculative and hazardous perhaps is what it isn t the council is essentially a product of a deep crisis within the state a hastily created crisis response tool to reassert military influence and manage a fluid political situation it pulled back from imposing state of emergency allowed protests to continue quickly shed unpopular senior ex regime figures such as intelligence chief salah gosh released some not all political prisoners and reached out to protest leaders all positive and encouraging steps that demonstrate it has significant agency is pragmatic and amenable to a political settlement yet the clumsy nature of the coup the confusion in the first 48 hours as well as incoherent pronouncements and policy flip flops since then point to deep internal frictions tactically this could be an advantage for the coalition leading the protests potentially giving them greater room to nudge the tmc towards reform and influence the agenda it could also pose serious challenges in the coming weeks and months especially if as some fear the council becomes opportunistic and capricious and its cohesions becomes more frayed but there must be no mistake about the tmc s politics its primary goal is to maintain national stability it views retention of military power influence and privilege as necessary to achieve that noble goal there is no evidence it shares the democratic aspirations of the majority of the sudanese people it is instinctively suspicious of civilians and resistant to the idea of civilian oversight and even much less civilian rule sudan s military for three decades waged not just war but also engaged in multiple peace processes and political negotiations at local and national levels involving armed and non armed civilian opponents under bashir talks were conducted in the same manner as war was waged invariably three distinct tactics with roots in war strategy were deployed to outflank and eviscerate the civilian opposition accommodation co option and containment the official discourse and rhetoric surrounding the series of national dialogues in train for nearly two decades offers a fascinating glimpse into the appropriation of martial metaphors a progressive militarization of politics domestic politics was officially referred to as jabhat al daakhiliyah internal front political parties were reminded of the value of national cohesion and called upon to help unify the ranks tawhid al saf dissidents were cat s paw mikhlab qit of foreign enemies sudan s protest movement will be negotiating with a military that has set ways of dealing with civilian adversaries expectations it is willing to make a strategic and irreversible retreat from politics seems over optimistic the tmc s 30th april pronouncements and the subsequent hardening of language certainly sow doubt about the prospect of that happening any time soon the unilateral and escalatory nature of the council s statement goes against the letter and spirit of the negotiations it may be a hint of an intense internal power struggle it could also signal an attempt by hardline factions to assert greater control a hypothesis lent some credence by the fact it was the tmc s second in command gen muhammad hamdan dagalo aka hemedti who was personally involved hemedti the commander of the rapid support forces rsf quwaat al da m al sari has in recent weeks emerged as the real power within the tmc playing court to visiting dignitaries and diplomats his swift maneuvers to consolidate power within the military and security services is anything but coincidental he was for example elevated to a member of the national intelligence and security service official suna news agency dispatch said he was now uzw a member of niss a vague term that is both odd and inexplicable at a low key event in khartoum in late april the rsf itself is affiliated to the niss since it was established in 2013 from the rump of the janjaweed militia and one would assume hemedti as commander would be a member of the intelligence and security service the original force roughly 7 000 was drawn mainly from hemedti s own rizaygat tribe in darfur an important factor in itself that partly explains its strong internal cohesion and loyalty to hemedti it has a complicated dual command chain answerable to both the niss dg and the regular army general command bashir increasingly relied on the rsf and the popular police forces in recent years to quell social unrest and low level armed insurrections the bulk of the rsf is now fighting in yemen alongside emirati troops a decision based on rsf s perceived counterinsurgency competence adaptability to the yemeni battlefield conditions hemedti is young ambitious and has powerful gulf friends keen to see him play an influential role in the transition he has a fearsome reputation deemed both an able battle field commander and skillful political operator his rise to prominence since bashir s ouster and high visibility within the tmc suggest a resurgence of hardline elements keen not to cede too much ground to the protest movement old parties protest movement sudan s bewildering array of political parties weakened and deeply fragmented and caught off guard by the protests seem keen to be included in the transition talks the tmc initially seemed to prefer a broad based dialogue in part because that could have neutralized the weight of the protest movement it has since walked back and proposed a format that significantly shortened list of participants not least because of the risks of an unwieldy and fractious dialogue process impossible to conclude within the short time frame it now has three months sudan s protest movement and its leadership hold the initiative in the contest to shape the transition the call for freedom justice and peace emblazoned on every placard gelled a fragmented nation and triggered the horn s most powerful and unprecedented mass protest movements the expectations are high and the road to achieving them daunting the risk of fragmentation within the protest movement is high it is now made up of two distinct groups quwaa i laan al huriyyat wal tagyiir declaration of freedom and change forces and the sudanese professionals association tajamm u al mihniyiin al sudaniyin they are now broadly aligned in their demands tmc co option strategies and the attrition of protracted negotiation highly likely to sow division the spa and the dfcf have so far done a remarkable job in leading a cohesive disciplined and non violent mass protest movement they must not sell themselves short in the delicate negotiations now under way they must safeguard their cohesion eschew personal ambition remain vigilant against the familiar co option traps stay resilient and focused in the face of setbacks and hard nosed at every phase of the negotiations ethiopia s rocky transition ethiopia s transition is the outcome of two severe crises that shook the regime to the core over four years of relentless mass protests in oromiya and amhara regional states and a sharp economic downturn the eprd the coalition of four ethno regional parties that dominated politics since the early 90s played a central role in the transition engineered abiy ahmed s rise it started off well in the early years combining a reformist zeal with an accommodative approach to politics its fortunes for over two decades was tied to that of the charismatic and talented meles zenawi its owes its structural and organizational resilience more importantly its internal consensus style ethos to him the aftermath of the controversial elections in 2005 and massive crackdowns on protests ushered in a long period of repression deflected the party from its democratic goals and progressively strengthened the hegemony of the tplf but even in its weakened state the eprd proved its dependability as an instrument of crisis management at critical junctures it engineered a smooth transition of power after the death of meles in august 2012 leaned on hailemariam to resign as pm in february 2018 abiy capitalized on the party s internal institutional strength exploited the antipathy to the tplf to build the tactical alliances necessary to seal his victory at the eprdf congress in february 2018 ironically abiy s radical reforms in particular the planned swift transition to a conventional multi party system makes the future of the governing coalition perilous and uncertain while the pm has orchestrated changes within the eprdf and consolidated his grip over his own oromo democratic party odp many suspect the era of the dominant vanguard party may be coming to a close significantly the pm has relied on a close knit circle of politicians and inexperienced advisers to drive his fast paced reforms with minimal or no input from the eprd and other key institutions the benefits of a personalized elite driven reform seem obvious abiy arguably needed the latitude and flexibility it provides to push through a raft of deep reforms and swiftly dismantle key pillars of tplf power in the military security services and economy the potential drawbacks of a highly personalized leadership style and an elite driven reform process lacking sufficient institutional buy in and support must be obvious it is inherently risky alienates the very agencies indispensable to implementation and long term sustainability understood thus the risks to reform in ethiopia seem not so much bureaucratic inertia as bureaucratic recalcitrance rumblings of unease within the state and in the parastatals over key aspects of the reforms from privatization to the future of the ethnic federalism system reinforce these fears the pm rhetorically at least is increasingly aware of this potential problem stepped up meetings with key departments and pledged to deepen institutional engagement however his critics charge the impromptu townhall style meetings are cosmetic and do not constitute structured policy dialogue ethnic unrest identity politics may act as a catalyst for change but it s huge capacity to complicate transitions foment new unrest must not be ignored ethiopia is an egregious example aggressive and adversarial strains of ethno nationalisms resurgent in recent years pose grave conflict risks many ethnic conflicts are traditionally driven by contested borders and resource competition ethno regionalism nationalism aggravate these conflicts and make them intractable pm abiy s stabilization and consolidation efforts have had minimal impact in de escalating the problem balancing multiple and contending ethnic interests proved far trickier than anticipated his policy of accommodation to remedy historical injustices allocate more government posts to marginalized communities and disadvantaged segments of the population won wider praise but either failed to mollify more militant and younger ethno nationalist activists clamoring for deeper affirmative action or reinforced resentment among other ethnicities this is particularly the case in oromiya where factions loyal to the oromo liberation front that view the pm as a traitor to the oromo cause continue to stoke violence undermine social cohesion several attempts to mediate an end to the ructions in oromiya and reconcile the rival factions so far have produced shaky truces that failed to hold meanwhile the pm s anti corruption drive and political consolidation strategy perceived targeted at curbing the influence exerted by the minority tigrayan ethnic community on the country s political and economic life fomented serious backlash widely held perception the premier s new friendship with eritrean president isaias afwerki is partly motivated by a common desire to isolate the tplf served to further inflame sentiments in tigray the region is now effectively a mini state its relations with addis abeba deeply fraught and antagonistic on off dialogue between addis and mekele and series of high level meetings in 2018 failed to smooth relations or diminish the potentially dangerous siege mentality developing in tigray the region is where the country s elite military units are garrisoned and sophisticated heavy military hardware including air combat assets kept a legacy of the border conflict with eritrea an armed conflict highly improbable but impossible to rule out would be catastrophic economic hardship economic hardships remain core drivers of social unrest in sudan and ethiopia conditions for the vast majority of their populations progressively worsened in the last five years sudan s loss of oil revenues in 2012 and subsequent deadlock over oil transshipment fees with south sudan triggered the country s severest economic crisis in decades high inflation currency turbulence and a series of austerity measures that saw subsidies lifted on bread and other commodities hit the lower classes hard and fomented the mass protests that quickly engulfed the whole country in ethiopia the crisis was largely induced by the frenetic pace of growth skewed development expensive infrastructure mega projects and dependence on foreign loans chinese abiy in early 2018 inherited a state that was virtually bankrupt its foreign exchange reserve depleted and saddled with mounting and unsustainable debt servicing obligations an emergency deposit of 1 billion dollars into the treasury by the uae helped to stabilize the volatile fiscal situation the short to medium term prospects look bleak even though china s decision to write off some of the debt in late april figures and signals of support from multilateral financial institutions donors promise some relief in sudan the uae similarly stepped in to shore up the currency by depositing 500m in the treasury in april 2019 donors have equally signaled readiness to help the gravity of the economic crisis in the two states and the improbability of a quick and dramatic improvement portend huge risks for the transition yet the kind of tangible and irreversible progress in their delicate transitions necessary to unlock donor support and foreign investment hardly exists now and bound to take years by which time conditions would have deteriorated further in ethiopia the continued proliferation of ethnic unrest and violence in economically productive regions that has triggered massive displacement estimated at 3 million government inability to get on top of the situation is hugely destabilizing in itself but also certain to prove a major impediment to new foreign investment an emergency financial aid package for sudan and long term economic relief and stimulus package for ethiopia seem the best options for the international community to shore up the transitions a youth revolt the uprisings in ethiopia and sudan constitute the horn s first uniquely large scale youth revolt the first political coming of age of two youth generations embittered by economic hardship and the inequities of the hard state ethiopia with over 70 of the population out of a total of 110 million under 30 and sudan with 60 of the population 42 5 million under the age of 25 are examples of states where the demographic shift has been at its most starkest reflecting both the promise and destabilizing potential of the so called youth bulge two distinct but complimentary historical trends converged in the horn protests a massive demographic shift that progressively moved the youth to the centre of politics a technological revolution that provided them with the tools to effectively resist and organize the sheer demographic weight the volatility and restless energy unleashed by these changes cannot be ignored the long term viability and sustainability of the transitions hinges on how the disruptive impact of the youth bulge is managed the recurrent themes of the protests are familiar revolve around a set of socio economic grievances that cut across the age divide jobs and better wages economic growth opportunities and autonomy better services sudan s unemployment rate estimated around 21 4 or over two million of the productive labor force 21 million social media diaspora the protest movements in ethiopia and sudan are beneficiaries of the digital revolution effectively harnessing the power of the smartphone and social media facebook twitter whatsapp to challenge the regimes in power these tools allowed them to organize break state s monopoly over information generate their own multimedia content in the contest for narrative space the state was severely disadvantaged its power of monopoly over communication and access to sophisticated cyber spying software was offset by the technical savvy and ingenuity of the protesters frequent communication shutdowns that targeted sms internet access proved ineffective protesters used vpns encrypted messaging apps and relied on diaspora supporters to bypass state censorship diaspora support in both instances was crucial and went beyond amplifying social media messages activists in north america and europe mobilized funds organized pickets and petitions highlighted rights abuses raised the profile of these protests at the international stage the oromo diaspora in the us close knit and with its own influential media outlets played a particularly pivotal role a role recognized by pm abiy himself when he made a thanksgiving tour of the us in 2018 a number of high profile exiled figures have since been given high level posts in the ethiopian government diaspora influence and power has not been without controversy especially in ethiopia there have been claims hardline activists and media disseminated fake news and inflammatory messages to stoke ethnic hostility and division in sudan there is speculation probably fueled by the military the diaspora is inciting intransigence and radicalizing the protest movement the transition in ethiopia has brought to the fore the simmering tensions between political classes inside the country and those abroad growing intra oromo divisions partly reflect both the type of rivalries political divergence and clash of ambitions that could complicate the transition a fracturing of the protest movement s core support base remains a potential risks inherent in a delicate transition such as ethiopia s but also that in sudan the sudanese reform movement has so far stayed remarkably cohesive that unity is almost certain to come under great strain especially in the highly likely scenario of protracted and intensely contested transition the transition military council favors a fragmented and weak opposition all the signs indicate that is an outcome it is actively working to achieve identity politics sudan and ethiopia are similar in a variety of ways they are the horn s most diverse states with a combined total of 99 major ethnic groups and over 200 languages and dialects they still remain geographically vast and unwieldy even after secessionist wars and peace settlements led to a partition that diminished their original size both share a long history of multiple armed conflicts vast ill governed and severely underdeveloped peripheries conditions that incubated volatile forms of identity politics insurrections and social unrest both also experimented with decentralization models designed to foster self rule greater autonomy neither ethiopia s radical ethnic federal system nor sudan s conventional one achieved the desired aims instead they replicated the ills of the central state bred their own inequities inflamed ethno regional nationalisms and reinforced core periphery tensions ethnic identity politics was a potent factor in the ethiopian mass protests providing the glue and energy what is fascinating is not just the complex ways in which group grievances intersect feed off bleed into wider discontent but the subtle somewhat counter intuitive ways in which even hitherto antagonistic ethnicities regions and religious groups managed to cooperate and transcend their differences ethiopia s mass protests never evolved into a single nationwide movement like sudan s they were almost exclusively confined to oromiya and amhara regional states dominated by two ethnicities divided by a long history of mutual antipathy yet activists in the two regions drew energy succor from each other s protests cross fertilized and learnt effective protest tactics from one another for example amhara region s ghost town tactics that paralyzed cities were replicated in oromiya gradually a new sense of mutual empathy and solidarity developed between oromo and amhara protesters the seminal moment was when protesters in the two regions chanted down down woyane proof the two distinct ethnic discontents had coalesced into a single national demand what tipped the scale was not critical mass though that was important but the emergence of a proto narrative that encapsulated shared national goals in sudan the protest leadership quickly tapped into and harnessed the vast array of diverse grievances to weave a set of key national objectives with a comparably freer civic space well organized trade union movement and professional associations with a proud tradition of political activism sudan s mass revolt took on a national character much more quickly than in ethiopia the rallies in khartoum reflected the diversity of the nation s social fabric and remained characterized throughout by a convivial ecumenical spirit as remarkable as it is rare identity protest and culture sudan achieved in protest what eluded it for decades a genuine moment of unity in diversity the protest rallies in khartoum were a microcosm of the nation bringing together diverse ethnicities civic groups drawn from all regions social strata and professions darfuris kordofanis and nubians women and other distinct social groups aggrieved workers and traders all disenfranchised rendered powerless and invisible by state policies were catapulted onto the national stage they all made common cause and rallied around a single political message but the mass uprisings in sudan and ethiopia were more not just animated by political and economic grievances activists in sudan actually took slight at media characterization of their protests as bread riots they were also impelled by cultural discontent a sense of humiliation and anger at the state s perceived cultural homogenization discrimination and misogyny in ethiopia the oromo unrest was fueled in part by long simmering grievances over status of the oromo language and state interferences in religious affairs while in sudan state driven islamization and arabization remained major sources of social frictions the act of protest was in itself psychologically culturally transformative providing for opportunity to assert cultural pride and reclaim self confidence and autonomy the oromo pride movement in ethiopia and the rise of women in sudan exemplify the cultural forces shaping the politics of protests and transitions pm abiy s open embrace appropriation of oromo culture and his gender parity campaign are just two examples of the symbolic and practical policy impacts hopes are high sudan s new breed of assertive female activists could capitalize on the national mood for change harness their collective picketing power to influence the transition s agenda no less important the rallies served as vehicle for collective catharsis and radical empathy a space to affirm values of mutual interdependence solidarity and peaceful co existence the slogan kuluna darfur we are all darfur at the rallies in khartoum hopefully was not just a feel good empathetic response but marks a fundamental positive shift in the way communities relate to one another religion culture religion as a powerful galvanizer conduit for protest and repository of moral ethical values necessary for a just society and government has a long history in the horn the protests in sudan and ethiopia provide contrasting lessons in the resilience of religion its potency to inspire and channel protest but far more interesting how the debate over relevance of religion in governance continues to evolve the oromo mass insurrection in ethiopia gestated for many years fed off diverse small and localized communal grievances before it snowballed into a national crisis the big triggers high youth unemployment state driven land grabs punitive taxation repression and violent crackdowns are well known less remarked and examined are the obscure and overlapping cultural and religious roots of the discontent brewing for close to a decade the political rebellion owed much of its resilience and success to the cultural revivalist movement gaining in momentum and influence in recent years it drew energy inspiration and self confidence from the potent message of ethnic pride preached by oromo elders abba gadda oromo traditional waqqeffana religion practiced by a small fraction of the community roughly less than 5 played an important complimentary role as a central pillar of cultural expression regarded as the indigenous faith of the oromo nation its rituals and spiritual teachings deemed ecumenical and non threatening to believers of other faiths it progressively galvanized millions the irrecha annual festival of harvests with roots in the waqqeffana religion drew tens of thousands became a visible symbol of political and cultural consciousness a focal point for the protests series of muslim unrests in oromiya in 2012 quickly spread to other regions and continued to simmer for over 18 months much of it initially triggered by alleged state interference in muslim affairs but quickly aggravated by mass arrests of clerics and community leaders suspension of muslim publications such as ye muslimoch guday the muslim protests viewed across oromiya as evidence of the state s wider malign intent against the oromo thus triggered the first spark that lit the fire of large scale rebellion in 2014 oromo nation s ability to harness its cultural heritage and multiple faith traditions and foster internal mutual respect and tolerance is unique so too the tradition of syncretism which indigenized islam and christianity and reduced the heat and social frictions generally associated with puritanism and proselytism this cultural adaptability and inherent resistance to exclusivist manifestations of faith may partly explain why salafism found oromiya a less ambient and sympathetic territory to put down roots the bid to project this benign and positive face of oromo culture on the national stage was thwarted by fragmentation and factionalism as well as the political clout exerted by militant factions widely perceived wedded to exclusivist ethnic agenda pm abiy a practicing pentecostal with muslim heritage represents this hybrid pluralistic and healthy attitude to religion while his fervent faith and the occasional unnerving messianic tenor to his speeches raised some concerns the pm so far has acted with great sensitivity on faith matters he released detained muslim leaders appointed record numbers to key state posts reached out to the orthodox church abiy s medemer philosophy based on values of love compassion and solidarity in the new testament does not signal intent to christianize or change the strong secular character of the state the primary motive is to create a unifying principle around which the nation can rally the rise of evangelical churches and their aggressive proselytization remains a source of anxiety within the influential orthodox church but the greatest threat to religious harmony stems from ethnic conflict inter communal violence in troubled pockets of the country in the last one year exacerbated religious tensions and triggered attacks on mosques and churches sudan islam in transition a striking feature of sudan s protest movement is the near total absence of islamist slogans and the emergence of a more assertive youthful female activists keen to raise their visibility subvert the strict dress code and claw back the huquq al mar a al maqsub usurped fundamental rights of women the language and tone of discourse is deliberately non confessional these two complimentary dynamics lend a mildly secular character to the uprising for the first time in three decades islam is no longer a contentious subject for its young but we ought to be careful in not drawing hasty conclusions more important we must avoid the binary secular religious mindset prism in analyzing events in sudan that the battle over sudan s future is being waged over traditional secular issues liberty justice and bread and butter issues is emblematic not so much of a society that is becoming secular but one deeply disillusioned with the brand of islamization advocated by hassan al turabi and enforced by bashir for three decades sudan s young are rejecting the politicized islam that underpinned bashir s quasi islamic state and the stifling social conservatism fostered by its intrusive policies put differently what we are seeing in sudan is the early sign of a society that is self correcting seeking both to restore health to islam and return it to its traditional orbit sphere it is not yet clear who the secularists are in sudan s transition no group has so far articulated what one might call a clear secular agenda it is conceivable some in the protest movement traditional left leaning parties that played a big role in the protests and even elements in the tmc opposed to islamism may make common cause and lock out islamists from the transition whether all these diverse anti islamist stakeholders can agree on a common strategy to address the issue of islam and state is hard to tell an aggressive enclavement strategy that criminalizes islamism locks islamists out is certain to prove hugely destabilizing it risks driving islamists underground and bound to incubate the same toxic type of militancy and violence familiar in many parts of the muslim world sudan s best hope to achieve a viable and sustainable transition lays in a policy of accommodation that is genuinely inclusive islamist parties are predominantly moderate and including them in the tent has potential to lock them into the broader reform process temper their politics and progressively isolate the more militant groups gulf meddling the controversial intervention in sudan s transition in recent weeks by gulf actors principally uae and ksa ostensibly aimed at preventing the muslim brotherhood from staging a comeback is both ill advised and dangerous first there isn t the kind of cohesive highly organized islamist opposition able to single handedly gain dominance second the tmc cannot be a guarantor of long term stability nor can it serve as an effective bulwark against islamism third and assuming they cared to look deeper at the uprising and the social political trends they would have realized the depth of disillusionment with islamist politics and generally with all traditional politics and parties finally the saudi emirati axis s meddling alienates huge segments of society and counter productive to their twin strategic goals maintaining sudanese troops in yemen and isolating the muslim brotherhood editor s note rashid abdi is an

like to turn it over to mark mark w begor chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks trevor and good morning everyone as you can see from our press release this morning this has been a busy quarter for us particularly during the past few weeks and days we re pleased with our start to 2019 with strong progress on our strategic priorities and our financial results were within the guidance we provided in february while we are continuing to return usis to a growth mode we re executing well against our efx 2020 initiatives before i get into a discussion of our first quarter financial results and the business units let me spend a few minutes discussing the 690 million charge we took this quarter related to outstanding litigation and potential fines related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we delayed our earnings discussion until this morning because we ve made significant progress on our legal and regulatory settlements in the past few weeks as you know we ve been in active discussions for months related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and those discussions accelerated in the past month importantly the 690 million accrual we booked includes our estimate of probable losses associated with our global settlement discussions with certain federal and state regulators as well as the federal class action cases we recently reached confidential settlement terms in the consumer federal class action cases that upon approval by the court will resolve and dismiss the claims asserted in the consumer cases the proposed global settlement provides for the establishment of a single consumer redress fund which was our goal and certain other non monetary terms as we ve discussed previously we believe the consumers are better served through a single consumer fund and a global settlement of the federal and state government investigations together with the consumer class action litigation we expect to complete definitive settlement agreements with the parties in the coming weeks advertisement advertisement while this charge represents our current estimate to resolve many of the significant issues facing the company we expect to incur additional losses associated with the other claims and litigation related to the 2017 incident we will continue to work with all parties to bring these matters to closure as soon as possible while balancing the needs of our company employees customers and shareholders as you know we prepared ourselves financially for the settlement by strengthening our balance sheet including us suspending our stock buyback and freezing our dividend in 2017 this settlement will not have an impact on our internal investment plans new product introductions our 1 25 billion efx 2020 technology and security program or our plans to grow and expand equifax with acquisitions this is a positive step forward for equifax as we work to put the 2017 cybersecurity event behind us let me now move to our financial results we re pleased with our start to the year as our first quarter financial results were consistent with the guidance we gave you in june in february with revenue in the middle and adjusted eps at the top of the range provided revenue at 846 million was up almost 1 in constant currency foreign exchange further weakened during the quarter relative to our february guidance impacting revenue negatively by just under 2 million during the quarter us mortgage market inquiries again declined meaningfully down 10 but were better than our projection of down 13 excluding the almost 2 negative mortgage market impact total constant currency revenue growth was 2 5 and we were pleased with that overall our combined us b2b businesses usis and ews performed better than our expectations both benefiting relative to expectations due to the mortgage market with us also delivering nice growth in offline revenue and ews delivering very strong verification services revenue growth ews saw weakness in employer services revenue which impacted overall growth advertisement advertisement international revenue was only marginally weaker than our expectations as somewhat weaker than expected revenue in australia was mostly offset by stronger revenue in canada and gcs was a bit weaker than we expected driven by lower us subscriber growth this weaker than expected gcs revenue was offset the better offset the better than expected performance in us b2b adjusted eps of 1 20 per share was on the top end of the guidance we provided in february in the first quarter total non recurring or one time costs related to the cybersecurity incident in our transformation exclusive of the accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident were 97 million and consistent with our expectations this includes 83 million of technology and security spending 12 million for legal and investigative fees and 2 million for consumer support we continue to expect 2019 one time costs related to the cybersecurity incident in transformation exclusive of any legal accruals to be about 350 million now for some comments on the business units usis revenue was down almost 3 on a reported basis as we expected compared to last year with usis up about 50 basis points excluding the over 3 percentage point negative impact of the mortgage market on revenue and that 50 basis point increase ex mortgage was quite positive from our perspective advertisement advertisement in the quarter we also saw a mix shift in our mortgage business with transaction shifting toward our reseller channel this also negatively impacted usis revenue by over 1 in the quarter adjusting for both of these factors non mortgage revenue growth was up almost 1 5 a positive sign of continued improvement by usis and was slightly better than our expectations for the quarter our new usis leader sid singh is driving a new level of energy and accountability with our customers in the usis team inside of usis mortgage solutions was down 23 in the quarter given the decline in the overall mortgage market and due to the mix shift with mortgage resellers which occurred in fourth quarter 2018 our usis mortgage revenue can be impacted by movements between our tri bureau business in mortgage solutions and selling a single file to a mortgage reseller which is included in our online business we manage our mortgage solutions tri bureau business such that its dollar profit contributions exceed the dollar profit of a single file to the reseller mix shift had occurred had negative impact of over 1 in usis revenue growth in the first quarter while usis operating profit was not materially impacted we expect the revenue headwind from the mortgage mix shift to continue for the remainder of 2019 financial marketing service was up about 6 driven by new deal wins this is the first time we ve seen growth in fms since prior to the cybersecurity incident while we are encouraged by the growth in fms this quarter the timing of closing deals is still not as predictable as it was prior to the cybersecurity incident which may impact the timing of future revenue in may impact the timing of revenue in future quarters advertisement advertisement online was down 1 but was up 2 excluding the mortgage market impact while online did benefit from the mortgage market mix i previously discussed this was partially offset by a decline in our direct to consumer revenue which is revenue we generate with the other bureaus online was also benefited from continued growth in our telecom and utilities verticals in terms of customers we re selling across the portfolio of usis customers and we should start to continue to see those benefits from these commercial engagement in the second half of 19 our pipeline of new business continues to grow positively we continue to believe that our differentiated data assets in usis coupled with our technology investments will return the business to its traditional growth mode but we remain cautious on the pace of the recovery we are confident in the usis growth plan for 2019 usis adjusted ebitda margins of 42 9 were down 120 basis points from first quarter 18 primarily driven by lower fixed leverage as revenue declined in the quarter and additional investments in security and data analytics to drive new product partially offsetting these margin declines usis continued to effectively manage their sg a costs reducing both the dollars and percent of revenue from the fourth quarter restructuring that we did shifting now to workforce solutions they had a very strong quarter with revenue up 9 verification services delivered very strong results with revenue up 16 driven by strong double digit growth across healthcare talent solutions auto and government ews like usis was also impacted by a decline in the overall margin mortgage market which negatively impacted revenue by about 2 5 percentage points overall ews revenue excluding the negative mortgage market impact grew almost 11 which we were very pleased with advertisement advertisement employer services declined in the quarter down almost 4 driven principally by tax management services given low unemployment levels and to a lesser extent workforce analytics and our aca business talent solutions our and our i 9 and onboarding businesses also we saw growth in the quarter which we expect to continue throughout the year we expect employer services revenue to be down for the full year consistent with the levels we saw in the first quarter the strong verifier revenue growth resulted from in a very strong adjusted ebitda margins of 49 4 an expansion in the quarter of 50 basis points ebitda margin growth was slightly offset by investments in sales resources resources to support incremental revenue growth activities ews continues to be a great equifax franchise and positioned for a very strong 2019 international revenue was down 8 on a reported basis and up 2 5 in local currency but slightly below our expectations the slower growth continues to be driven by the weak consumer and commercial lending markets in australia that started to soften late in the third quarter of last year and to a lesser extent the ongoing weak economic condition in argentina we expect the australia and argentina markets to remain weak through the bulk of 2019 although the revenue growth impacts will begin to lessen in the second half of 19 as we approach the periods of their initial declines in the third quarter of 18 in australia in the second quarter of 18 in argentina advertisement advertisement our latin america businesses grew mid single digits in local currency in first quarter despite the continued headwinds in argentina revenue growth was driven by double digit constant currency growth in chile and ecuador and high single digit constant currency growth in paraguay and uruguay our latin america franchises continue to benefit from the expansion of ignite and interconnect saas and strong npi rollouts in both 2017 and 2018 i was in peru earlier this week meeting with our team and key customers our european business in the uk and spain grew mid single digits in local currency in the first quarter 19 we saw mid single digit local currency growth in our european credit operations and low single digit growth in our european debt management business i ll be in madrid and london next week meeting with customers and investors canada delivered another strong quarter with high single digit growth in local currency in the first quarter consistent with the full year revenue growth rate of 8 we saw in 2018 reflecting a strong focus on customer innovation and new products we re excited about the benefits our technology transformation will have in canada in the first quarter we migrated our first canadian customer into interconnect in the public cloud we also completed a small bolt on acquisition in montreal jlr that brings unique real estate data assets to equifax in canada asia pacific which is predominantly australia for us declined 2 5 in local currency in the first quarter principally related to the weakening we began to see in the third quarter last year in australia consumer lending particularly in mortgage and other consumer and commercial credit markets in australia although only one month data in april we began to see signs of market bottoming in australia we expect second quarter to also see revenue declines but australia should return to growth in the second half particularly with easier comparisons to last year in the second half despite the strong headwinds in australia we are encouraged by the growth potential we continue to win top customers particularly in telco and we continue to hold a substantial data advantage in the australian market as we mentioned last year the move to positive data in australia continues to progress well at the end of april just over 50 of the consumer accounts that have been shared have been shared and we expect to have over 80 by the end of the third quarter of this year incorporating positive data will allow us to develop new products for our customers as well as enable new use cases for example incorporating positive data into portfolio management solutions we believe provides more predictive outcomes than just using negative data i ll also be in australia in the next few weeks to spend time with the team and customers international adjusted ebitda margins of 25 3 were down 410 basis points in the first quarter principally reflecting lower margins in australia and latin america driven by argentina we expect growth in international to improve in the second quarter and improve significantly in the second half second quarter will be driven by stronger growth in canada and latin america and in the second half growth returns to asia pacific with easier comparisons we believe this improved growth along with some additional cost reductions taken not only in the fourth quarter but in the first quarter will significantly improve margins in the second half shifting now to global consumer solutions their revenue declined almost 9 on a reported basis and 8 in local currency basis in the first quarter and this decline was greater than our expectations our global consumer direct business was down about 20 and was just over 40 of total gcs revenue as we discussed throughout 2018 our us consumer direct business saw revenue declines of about 20 as a result of our suspension of us consumer advertising in the fourth quarter of 2017 after the cybersecurity incident gcs began limited direct marketing to us consumers in the fourth quarter which continued into the first quarter and we re starting to see subscriber growth from our restarted marketing a good sign as we begin 2019 we re also continuing to invest in our new consumer platform and are rolling out our myequifax consumer portal and seeing growth in myequifax members we expect to see us subscriber growth as the year unfolds our gcs partner businesses which are almost 60 of total gcs revenue delivered mid single digit growth in the quarter and id watchdog grew double digit in the quarter which we expect that growth to continue in 2019 we expect gcs revenue to be down in second quarter at levels similar to the first quarter however starting in the third quarter as we lap the periods where the consumer direct revenue begin to stabilize in 2018 we expect to see revenue to return to flat and begin to grow in the second half as we move through the remainder of the year and into 2020 adjusted gcs ebitda margins declined as expected in the first quarter as we saw the effective revenue loss and an increase in advertising however margins were up nicely on a sequential basis from fourth quarter 18 reflecting the sequential revenue growth we expect margins in gcs in the second quarter to remain in the low 20s however we expect margins to increase in the second half as we see the benefit from stable to growing revenue driven by our return to consumer marketing and growing partner revenue as well as some cost actions that we took in the fourth quarter and some additional cost actions we took in the first quarter shifting now to technology our technology transformation in the last call we laid out detailed plans for our 1 25 billion efx 2020 technology transformation for 2018 to 2020 we are convinced that our technology transformation will differentiate our products and our ability to deliver them by combining unique data assets analytics and leading technology it will also accelerate the speed of our products to market and the ease of which they re consumed and reduce our costs as we move our data and applications to the cloud we re on plan with our timeline to be completed with most major activities in our efx 2020 transformation program by late by the end of next year we ll be posting after this call as we did in the first quarter our quarterly technology planned milestones for 2019 in our investor relations deck let me give you some commentary on where we stand with our major technology plan tracks through the first quarter first our data fabric is being built in the google cloud platform in a virtual private cloud environment utilizing gcp native tooling our data fabric will fundamentally make it easier for to bring our unique assets together including customer data to create new products and solutions for our customers our data fabric pattern is now in place at google cloud in the google cloud platform and our usis ews canadian and corporate teams are working actively on migrating the us consumer credit the work number and canadian consumer credit exchanges to our new cloud fabric establishing our data fabric pattern at gcp was delayed from our original planning however we remain on track to migrate several of our other us and ews exchanges including nctue ixi datax i 9 and unemployment claims as well as ignite to the common data fabric by the end of this year beginning in the third quarter any new datasets will be directly ingested into this new cloud based data fabric so very strong progress on this first priority for us in our efx 2020 transformation second building on the latest suite of interconnect and ignite native and ignite cloud native product offerings we are using reusable application in cloud native services to rebuild our customer applications over the past year equifax has worked to migrate these applications to a virtual private cloud using cloud native services we completed production implementations of ignite direct and interconnect in a virtual private cloud in all global regions we expect to complete the integration of ignite and interconnect services in our vpcs this quarter to allow customers to seamlessly promote attributes and models to find in ignite including those driven by machine learning into production on interconnect these services should be broadly available by the end of the second quarter third we will migrate customers from legacy decisioning systems interface systems and ignite instances to ignite and ignite product suite over the course of 2019 and 2020 we expect to migrate the vast majority of our customers to our next generation interconnect and ignite cloud applications in usis we are on track to migrate approximately half of these customers by the end of this year with the balance of the customers migrated during 2020 the technology and business teams are focused on deploying standard industry solution sets that will both productize this ignite and interconnect service and make the migration experience as frictionless as possible for our customers last we ll migrate our global consumer systems and customer and consumer support systems using standard application services and cloud native services and operate them in the private cloud our new consumer system renaissance that will include digital consumer support is in the process of being migrated to a virtual private cloud environment using cloud native services we expect to launch the first phase with aws in the third quarter separately we are deploying sales force and an integrated genesys google contact center ai solution for customer and call center support worldwide we expect significant deployment of all these systems to be ongoing through the third quarter with consistently consistent quarterly releases thereafter i hope this gives you a sense of our intense focus and positive progress we have on making our technology transformation that will deliver new cloud based technology to our customers we re excited about the strong technology team that bryson koehler has built in the past nine months and all of these actions are being executed consistent with our commitment to be a leader in data analytics and cloud based technology we continue to be convinced this investment will differentiate equifax and move us back to a growth and market leading position we made good progress in the first quarter and we ll continue to our focused efforts in 2019 and 2020 shifting now m a remains an important avenue of growth for equifax and is one of the key elements of our strategy for the future last month you saw that usis closed the acquisition of paynet a leader in commercial lending data and insights we are excited to add paynet and the team to equifax their proprietary commercial leasing and loan data enables commercial finance and lending institutions to improve credit analytics on business credit underwriting and portfolio reviews paynet complements our existing commercial database that includes tradeline information on short term loans with longer term loans and leasing payment data a very unique commercial data asset customer reaction on the acquisition is very positive and integration is proceeding quickly usis revenue was not benefited in the first quarter by the paynet acquisition we expect the contribution to usis revenue growth to be about 1 5 in the second quarter from the paynet acquisition next on new product innovation that continues to be a key component of our strategy and a core strength at equifax we have an active pipeline of new product innovations with over 110 new products at various stages in the funnel and we expect to launch over 50 new products in 2019 a pace similar to each of the past three years we re starting to see an increase in new product deployments in usis in the first quarter usis launched seven new products which will start to generate revenue later this year but have greater opportunities for revenue growth in 2020 and 2021 as we have discussed we expect npi revenue in 2019 will be below historic levels in the us however this is a positive sign as us collaborates with customers and returns to a growth mode with their new product integrations in the first quarter usis launched insight a new insight score for personal loans which developed in collaboration with fintechs is a risk tool optimized ph to help lenders evaluate applications seeking unsecured personal loans the insight score for personal loans uses advanced modeling techniques by combining equifax s unique data assets from telecommunications utility and trended data using patented explainable machine learning capabilities to cover a broad spectrum of consumer profiles for personal loans the new insight score for personal loans is a win for fintech companies and consumers as we help lenders develop greater predictive power and improve accuracy when evaluating applicants with thin or no credit profiles while m a and npi are core to our long term strategy we believe partnering opportunities are another avenue to deliver revenue growth at equifax as you recall in march we announced a strategic partnership agreement with fico to launch the data decisions cloud an integrated end to end data and analytics suite that addresses key risk key needs across risk marketing and fraud to enable financial institutions to meet the needs of consumers faster and more precisely than ever before while we continue to focus on embedding our ignite and interconnect platforms with customers this is an example the fico partnership is an example of using partnerships to extend our reach you ll see more partnerships to extend our distribution as we move through 2019 we also expect to identify additional areas to partner with fico ph on as we continue to work closely with them i am very energized about what the fico partnership means for our financial institutions and consumers so wrapping up we made several big and positive steps forward in our drive back to market leadership and growth during the first quarter first we re pleased with our continued progress with our global settlement discussions with certain federal and state regulators as well as the federal class action lawsuits we expect these settlements to be completed in the coming weeks and include a single consumer fund we are also pleased to reach confidential terms in the us consumer class action lawsuits as you know we ve been preparing for this settlement we have the financial structure to absorb it while continuing to invest in the growth of equifax internally and externally via acquisitions including new products and our 1 25 billion efx 2020 investment in security program this is a positive step forward as we work to put the 2017 cybersecurity event behind us second financially and operationally we re pleased with our start to the year usis as a new level of energy understood thing the team is on their front feet with customers with pipelines and commercial activity growing positively ews had a very strong quarter and is positioned for a very strong 2019 we are watching our international business closely particularly with the australian economy third we continue to invest in strategic acquisitions to expand our data assets including the paynet acquisition we announced last week fourth we continue to focus intensely on our efx 2020 technology and transformation plans that will move our data and applications to the cloud we believe the investment will deliver speed growth and reduce costs and differentiate us from our competitors we ll continue to share our progress on efx 2020 during the rest of the year and in 2020 fifth we continue to focus on expanding partnerships in this quarter launched that our new strategic partnership with fico that brings unique data assets technology and analytics to our customers to help them grow faster you will see further expansion of partnerships from equifax as we move to 2019 and then we also continue to focus on new products with strong collaboration with customers as i passed the one year mark at efx i m more confident than ever that we are moving equifax in the right direction with positive progress on all fronts we re investing at record levels to make equifax a market leader in data analytics and technology and security we know that we still have a lot of work to do we are excited about the opportunity ahead john will share more detail but we re also committing to our prior guidance for 2019 we are confident in our path forward and expect continued positive progress in 2019 with that let me turn it over to john john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer thanks mark and good morning everyone i will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on the gaap basis but will refer to non gaap results as well as mark covered our overall results the business unit details i will cover overall margins some corporate items free cash flow and our guidance for all of 2019 us mortgage market inquiries are expected to decline about 2 versus 2018 which is stronger than the down 5 we had expected in february 1q 19 inquiries were down 10 versus the 13 we had expected in february increase in 2q 19 are expected to be down about 1 to be about flat in 3q 19 and slightly positive in 4q 19 in the first quarter we extended the resource realignment activities principally in australia the uk and gcs that we began in 4q 18 to further improve our cost structure related to these activities we incurred an 11 million charge in 1q 19 total savings from the two combined actions are expected to exceed 60 million in 2019 with second half 19 savings exceeding the first half by about 10 million in the first quarter general corporate expense was 833 million excluding the non recurring costs associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident and technology transformation and the cost associated with the realignment of internal resources the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was 74 million up 9 million from 1q 18 this was about 5 million better than we had expected the increase versus 1q 18 predominantly reflects the increased investment in security and transformation and related technology as we ramp these costs in the first half of 18 and increased variable compensation given the timing of hiring certain executives last year adjusted ebitda margin was 30 5 in 1q 19 down 300 basis points from 1q 18 and in line with our expectations as we discussed in february and as is covered in mark s remarks that the decline in adjusted ebitda margins year to year is principally about two thirds in the bus about half in gcs reflecting the lower consumer revenue and return to consumer advertising that mark discussed a quarter in usis as declines in revenue impact fixed leverage and a quarter in international again principally as revenue declines impacted fixed leverage about a third was increased corporate cost in 1q 19 as i just covered the bus continue to do a very good job managing sg a for 1q 19 the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted eps was 24 1 in line with our guidance we continue to expect our calendar year 19 tax rate used for adjusted eps to be about 24 5 with 2q slightly higher than this level in 1q 19 operating cash flow was 31 million compared to 120 million in 1q 18 the decline was driven by the following items several of which are one time in nature 1q 18 in 1q 18 equifax received 35 million in insurance proceeds offsetting costs incurred related to the cybersecurity incident equifax received no proceeds in 1q 19 investments in security and transformation of 97 million were up 18 million than 1q 18 employee variable compensation for 2018 paid in 1q 19 exceeded the levels paid in 1q 18 for 2017 the year in which no bonuses were paid to the ceo and senior staff by about 15 million ph and payments in 1q 19 related to the 57 million of charges taking in 4q 18 and 1q 19 for cost reduction actions were about 11 million capital spending or the cost of capital projects that was incurred in 1q 19 of 95 million was up 38 million from 1q 18 as we ramp investment in the cloud capabilities mark described earlier the capital spending is aligned with our estimate of 365 million for 2019 capital expenditures which are equal to capital spending plus the net change in payables related to capital spending were 115 million in 1q 19 as activity that completed just prior to year end was not paid until january we do not expect similar large decreases in capital related payables to occur in the remainder of 2019 the negative free cash flow we saw in the first quarter reflected this high level of capital expenditures excluding any payments related to settlements of litigation or regulatory actions as we look forward we expect to deliver positive free cash flow in each of the remaining quarters of 2019 and for 2019 free cash flow to exceed 200 million now turning to our guidance for 2q 19 and 2019 for 2q 19 we expect revenue to be 865 million to 880 million up 0 5 to 2 5 in constant currency fx expected to negatively impact revenue by 2 5 adjusted eps is expected to be 1 32 to 1 37 per share fx is expected to impact adjusted eps negatively by up ph about 0 035 per share in february we provided some perspective on the factors impacting 2019 resulting in an unusual seasonal pattern for equifax and overall negatively impacting both 1q 19 and 2q 19 impacting revenue in the first half of 19 were market factors including the us mortgage markets australian credit markets and the argentinian economic weakness and expected gcs revenue declines in the first half in february we had expected that in total these factors would impact 1q 19 revenue by about 30 million and would continue to impact revenue in 2q 19 although to a lesser degree in 1q 19 although the us mortgage market was about 3 better than expected gcs which declined about 8 million and to a lesser extent australia were weaker than expected offsetting this benefit in 2q 19 in line with our february view we expect these factors to impact revenue by over 15 million again although the us mortgage market is now expected to only decline slightly gcs will be down more than previously expected at the at about the same levels as 1q 19 international is still being impacted by australian credit market weakness fx is also negative to revenue versus our february view by about 5 million impacting operating profit and eps in the first half of 19 were profit impacts of the revenue impacting factors and higher corporate costs in first half 19 relative to first half 18 as we indicated in february the higher corporate costs reflect a significant ramp in security and related technology cost in 2018 that not that did not reach their run rate until the second half of 18 also higher equity and variable comp in 2018 relative to 2017 and increased spending on data and analytics in 1q 19 these factors impacted operating profit by approximately 30 million as expected as lower cost corporate cost increases were offset by greater impact from gcs in 2q 19 we expect these factors to impact operating profit by over 15 million although mortgage market impact will be minimal and much less than anticipated in february gcs operating profit gcs operating profit will have a negative impact that will be greater than expected increased corporate costs principally in security and related technology and data and analytics as well as lower australia operating profit will continue to impact 2q 19 as we had expected the 2q 19 tax rate and interest expense are expected to be consistent with the guidance we provided in february specifically that our 2019 tax rate for adjusted eps is expected to be just over 24 5 and that quarterly interest expense is expected to be approximately 2 million reflecting our may 2018 bond issue the combination of the over 15 million impact to operating profit as well as the increased interest expense and expected 24 5 tax rate principally explained the year to year decline in adjusted eps in the second quarter of 19 our full year 2019 guidance for equifax revenue and eps are unchanged from the previous guidance we provided in february with revenue between 3 425 billion and 3 525 billion and adjusted eps between 5 60 and 5 80 per share revenue improvements from the acquisition of paynet and a smaller decline in the us mortgage market are principally offset by a decline in expected gcs revenue a somewhat deeper decline in the australian credit markets impacting international revenue and negative fx to revenue of about 0 5 since our february view this change in revenue mix is negative to margin and operating profit our actions to manage cost will allow us to maintain our adjusted eps guidance as well as the year over year improvement in bu ebitda margins our guidance for 2019 implies that our second half performance will be stronger than the normal sequential pattern in both revenue and operating profit this is principally driven by non mortgage growth in usis as well as sequential growth across all regions international we expect ews to continue the strong year to year growth that they will show in the first half of 19 into the second half and we expect gcs to return to year to year growth in the second half of 19 in terms of operating profit we expect all bus to show stronger than normal sequential operating profit growth in the second half this is driven by the stronger sequential revenue growth in usis and international this is also driven by the cost reductions executed over the last two quarters that will benefit sequential margins in international as well as gcs and workforce delivering this performance requires we continue strong execution across our team as well as continued focus on firmly managing costs throughout 2019 and with that operator we ll now open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from manav patnaik with barclays manav patnaik barclays capital analyst thank you good morning mark just first on the legal settlement can you just help frame for us the remaining cases like is this 690 million basically take care of i don t know 90 of the issues so forth just wanted some color there mark w begor chief executive officer yeah thanks manav as you heard me earlier mention we ve we re not prepared to talk about which settlements are included in here and which are not but we try to be clear that included the significant issues facing the company our expectation is in the coming weeks as i also mentioned earlier in the call will have some real clarity around that once we finalize the discussions that are actively under way john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer and manav there will be quite a bit of disclosure in the 10 q that will be filed later today manav patnaik barclays capital analyst okay got it and then john if i could just follow up on some color on the guidance in terms of the total m a contribution i know mark just called out paynet but what was that contribution from m a this quarter and then for the full year i guess john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yeah the contribution from m a this quarter was relatively small all right really the most substantial contribution was datax and it s less than 5 million in the period and then we had some other very small acquisitions in international and very small acquisitions in ews none of which were material in anyway manav patnaik barclays capital analyst and for the full year john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer for full year we gave a for full year we gave a view for paynet if you get into the second half the substantial impact for equifax of acquisitions is really just paynet because we start to wrap around that period in which we bought datax as we get into early in the third quarter mark w begor chief executive officer i think i said manav in my comments that we expect paynet to add 1 5 to usis in the second quarter manav patnaik barclays capital analyst yeah got it all right thank you guys mark w begor chief executive officer thanks operator we ll now hear from george mihalos with cowen george mihalos cowen company llc analyst hey good morning guys and nice to see the progress on the settlement side i guess maybe mark two things to kind of kick it off first you sounded upbeat about the pipeline maybe you can provide a little bit more color of that vertical anything vertical specific or if you re having a lot more success maybe leveraging the workforce and winning new business and then i understand that financial marketing is probably going to be a bit choppier but it s nice to see the 6 growth should we expect that to now be positive throughout the course of the year will there continue to be some variability mark w begor chief executive officer yeah i think on last one that s one that i tried to be clear in my comments first off we were pleased to see that growth which is really the first growth that we ve had since the cyber incident in 2017 those pipelines are building also but i would still characterize the pipeline there and then broadly in usis is still building meaning they re not at full maturity we ve made great progress as you know go back a year ago we were on hold with many of our customers and that really improved as it went through the year so the pipelines broadly as well as in the financial marketing side really started building in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and i tried to give some color that pipeline is continuing and i also highlighted our new leader is brought what i would characterize has a new level of energy and focus and accountability with that team as well as commercial engagement i m spending a lot of time with customers as is sid our new leader and all the discussions around growth help us with new products help us with new ways to grow our business we want to access equifax assets so we re seeing good momentum there and but we still expect usis and financial services to be what i would characterize as choppy until they get to full maturity around their pipelines which it s hard to predict when that s going to be we just haven t seen it yet george mihalos cowen company llc analyst okay great and just as a quick follow up if we look at mortgage i think you talked about the sort of mix shift if you will to reseller is that secular would you expect that to continue over the long term and is the right way to think about sort of a lower revenue per transaction but sort of a de minimis impact on profitability thanks john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer so for your second question that s correct right the revenue per transaction is lower but the level of profit per transaction is relatively similar slightly higher in mortgage solutions obviously but relatively similar in terms of whether it s a secular trend that s going to continue no i think it s really more market based right so it depends on competitive forces in the market and you ve seen our share of mortgage solutions go up and down within our portfolio over the years that will probably continue to happen just right now we re in a situation where the competitive environment is such that we re better off we re better off having more of those sales go through the channel mark w begor chief executive officer and there was really one big customer that drove this one situation which i think we talked about in the fourth quarter and maybe some in the first quarter too that really drove that change in the revenue and i don t view it as that kind of a secular change it was really one customer made that change and we focus on margin george mihalos cowen company llc analyst thanks guys operator our next question will come from david togut with evercore isi david togut evercore asset management analyst thank you good morning could you provide an update on demand trends from the other major drivers of us consumer credit services like auto and credit card for example and then just as a follow up if you could update us on your progress with trended data how are you doing in your existing verticals and then are there some new verticals that you could enter with trended data in the future john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yeah in terms of the overall market performance we haven t seen much of a change really and you ve probably seen that from what the banks have announced right over the last several quarters we re continuing to see the same trends that we saw in the fourth quarter continuing into the first quarter in the card market in the auto market you re seeing you might be you re starting to see delinquencies tick up a little bit in subprime but that really tends to be relatively localized we believe and you re actually seeing the overall credit quality we think of the entire auto portfolio actually improving so but generally speaking the trends in the markets we serve as you mentioned other than mortgage we think are relatively consistent with what we saw late last year mark w begor chief executive officer and the trended john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer sure trended data i think what trended data is a key part of what we re trying to deploy and we continue to expand our product focus on trended data i think probably the most important thing as mark indicated is as we move more and more to data fabric you ll see an increasing number of products that are focused on trended information we still think we re the only party out there with trended commercial products which will certainly extend now that we ve acquired paynet and it s something that we continue expand in our portfolio it isn t the driver behind our npi but it is an option it is something that we re focused on in npi david togut evercore asset management analyst understood thank you very much mark w begor chief executive officer thanks operator we will now hear from andrew steinerman with jpmorgan andrew steinerman jp morgan securities analyst hi this is andrew i wanted to ask about visibility in the usis i definitely heard you talk about the new leadership and the growing pipeline and the new level of energy but could you just give us a sense of how much revenue visibility you have now versus six months ago in usis and i mean that s separate from any mortgage dynamic mark w begor chief executive officer yeah maybe i ll start john and then you could jump in andrew you put a great mark around there you go back six months ago it was probably a good mark to look back on there s no question our revenue visibility has increased dramatically and how we can look through in usis versus where we were last summer that visibility has improved as we went through the fourth quarter and certainly into the first we are still trying to be clear with you and our other investors and analysts that while that visibility is getting stronger which one metric for that is our pipelines and how they re growing and how they re being rebuilding it s still not back to where it was before the cyber incident in usis that s really the business where that s still moving forward so i would say a lot more visibility than we had six months ago and part of that is gives us the confidence in our comments around guidance for both the second quarter and well as the second half i think as you know we re showing the second half of this year improving on a year over year basis at a faster rate than the first half and we re doing that based on our confidence in our visibility would you add john john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer i think mark covered it all all right but and the fact is i think we re starting to see more consistency in terms of delivery versus near term forecast right and that gives us comfort that the visibility that we believe we have as we look forward is starting to improve it s not what it was two years ago but the accuracy of our forecast versus delivery is certainly getting better mark w begor chief executive officer i think we mentioned andrew that in the first quarter usis was slightly above our expectations which those are the kind of signs we re looking to see meaning that the team says they re going to deliver something and they deliver it that gives us more confidence that they have the visibility and we have it also andrew steinerman jp morgan securities analyst right they do i appreciate it mark w begor chief executive officer yeah operator our next question will come from toni kaplan with morgan stanley toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you good morning question for you john you mentioned the 200 million free cash flow guidance for the year and you have a cash balance right now of 133 million and so just looking at the size of the after tax accrual you re making i guess what s the timeline for paying the cash for the losses and are you planning on raising debt i m assuming maybe not because the interest expense incorporated in the guidance didn t go up so i just wanted to hear about that and also does a settlement mean that you will resume buybacks at this point are you going to wait till the litigation is in the clear thank you john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yeah so in terms of the of the timing of any payments i think we need to complete the complete the discussions as mark mentioned so when that s done we ll have a lot more clarity on that but the payments are likely sometime in the future and our expectation is that we ll be borrowing to make any payments that we make so that is our expectation mark w begor chief executive officer and the second half of your question about buyback or dividend we re not prepared to make have any discussions about what our plans are in that front yet we need to finalize these discussions as john pointed out finalize the timing of the payments we ve been clear with you and other investors that we also want to see some clarity on the usis recovery which is positive but still not as predictable as we would like and then the other leg on that chair about our capital allocation plan is around efx 2020 technology investment that we re in the middle of and we want to see a little more visibility on kind of say ph delivery on that so the long winded answer around the question around stock buyback or dividend that s a discussion that we ll be having in the future with you we re not ready to have that today toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst okay very helpful and then just wanted to ask a little bit about sentiment during the quarter it sounds like you re happy with the growth in and the new business starting to come back just wanted to also just sort of get a sense of a competitor of yours mentioned maybe some client caution after the fourth quarter market volatility so did you see that as well and just wanted to hear about your sense on what s going on with the industry and the clients thank you mark w begor chief executive officer yeah no we haven t seen those kind of dialogs around you characterized client caution we have seen an increased dialog with our customers around their work and we re partnering with them to do that about preparing for a potential economic slowdown and what that really means is some of their focus around data assets changes to line management credit line decreases credit and collections the different focus on underwriting so we got a number of customer dialog going about wanting to work with us to be prepared for a potential economic slowdown i don t think anyone is predicting it but i would say that s a change for me in the last three four five months than it was kind of the middle of last year where that dialog has been added to the kind of growth dialog toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst perfect thanks a lot mark operator we ll now hear from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse kevin mcveigh credit suisse anlayst great thanks hey congrats on shifting that first canadian customer to the cloud just any thoughts as to kind of the guide post on that and what it can ultimately mean for the usis business overall and maybe just frame that out within the context to the us transformation mark w begor chief executive officer i assume you re referring kevin to like the benefits of speed to market and cost savings and all that stuff if that s where you re heading we re working on that we are going to be prepared to share that in the future with you and our investors we re not ready to do that yet but we tried to be quite clear that we view this investment not only for usis but what we re doing around the globe as being transformational we think it s going to differentiate us from our competitors it s something that would be hard for our competitors to do at the same pace we re doing we re seeing there s clear cost benefits of cloud versus legacy there s clear stability reliability benefits meaning our focus is to move to always on versus three nines four nines and five nines ph of stability and in today s world that s critically important and then the speed to market the ability to get products to market or ingest data assets in weeks versus months is going to be another real benefit so we continue to be energized about what it s going to deliver and we know we ve got a plan and a requirement to really share with you guys some clarity around those benefits and i think that will certainly come to the table when we re ready to put our long term framework back in place i think that s the time that we ll share some real visibility about not only our view of equifax for the future but the view of equifax including our investment in technology and security through efx 2020 john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer and i think we said previously that in both cost of sales and then also our development expense that we would expect to see the type of savings that you have seen from other companies that have moved to the cloud so you ve seen savings that are that are double digits in percentages and we would expect to be able to deliver those types of savings kevin mcveigh credit suisse anlayst super helpful and then just any initial thoughts on the reception to the fico partnership from a client perspective mark w begor chief executive officer yeah it s great question it s quite positive we made the announcement back in march and we were working with fico for about six months on this and start talking to customers really in the fourth quarter about it and between us and fico we ve got a pipeline of i don t know a couple dozen customers that are really energized about it but the feedback is quite positive from customers about this is an option customers still want to buy from fico directly they want to buy from equifax directly but there s a set of customers that are really energized about the benefits that come from an integrated solution of fico s software assets and equifax s ignite interconnect and differentiated data assets so we re energized about it as we roll through the second quarter and into the second half kevin mcveigh credit suisse anlayst super congrats mark w begor chief executive officer thanks operator our next question will come from ashish sabadra with deutsche bank ashish sabadra deutsche bank analyst hi thanks for taking my question just a quick follow up on an earlier comment both in regards to fms so fms is essentially batch ph downloads both for marketing as well as for decisioning have you seen a better demand on one versus another or any particular vertical where we have seen strength thanks john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer our financial marketing services business is principally cms if i don t cover your question sorry but it s principally cms and we saw a nice growth in cms this quarter cms is really consistent with a normal type of products that you see go into credit marketing services and financial institution so we don t sell anything particularly different than that we have seen an expansion into a new customer base we ve started to start selling into consulting firms and some other firms that also can utilize data for appropriate for reasons so we re starting to see an expansion of the customer base but other than that no trends that are different than normal ashish sabadra deutsche bank analyst that s good that s good and then maybe just quickly on gcs and it s kinds expect the results that you inflect below ph expectations but as you look forward are there anything on the strategic front that you re planning to do in order to improve the growth there mark w begor chief executive officer yeah it s really two efforts there one is on our partner business as you know we ve got relationships with credit karma lifelock and others like that so continued growth there and that s performing well that side of the business and on the core d2c business direct to consumer we re both accelerating our advertising so that s going to help grow our subscriber growth there but the real game changer for us is the big investment we re making in our technology our renaissance platform that s going to allow us to do things like cross selling and other things with the business that we think will help later in the year and particularly in 2020 so that s some of the things that the team is working on gcs ashish sabadra deutsche bank analyst thanks that s helpful operator and we will now hear from tim mchugh with william blair tim mchugh william blair analyst yes just wanted to follow up on some of the technology comments you made in the prepared remarks i want to think there s comment that move to the data fabric as slightly later than you thought i guess is that i guess elaborate on why that is and then secondly you talked about the target of trying to migrate half of the customers on to interconnect the cloud version by the end of the year how does as you plan for that i guess how disruptive is that to the clients what s the approach you are using as you migrate people and kind of what s the profile of people migrating this year versus next year thanks john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer yeah so maybe on the first one obviously this is a big project that we re doing and we re going to have slight delays this was delayed by weeks or whatever and that s going to happen and we just want to be transparent with you that we re working on it and when we have something that s a little bit behind will share it with you when we re ahead we ll do the same thing so we don t view that as a big issue but it s just a level of transparency that we want to have because of the scale of the investment with regards to the customer piece our goal and what we work on is to make this as easy as possible but as you know these are never easy each customer has their own technology department and we ve done this before and we do it all the time and it s when you just have to be open and transparent with the customer you got to be visible with them we got to work around their schedule make sure it works on where they want to do it but our goal is to make it as frictionless as possible for them but there s always work that they have to do when you make these transformations mark w begor chief executive officer the team s done a nice job of putting the customers in categories we have some customers where the impact on them will be relatively minor because they use gateways more than anything else so that s a relatively small lift for them and quite straightforward other customers that use our decisioning very heavily we actually manage the decisioning system for them so in that case we can do most of the work and for them it s mostly testing which isn t nothing left but it s but we can try to take a lot of the heavy lifting ourselves and then with kind of the rest of the customers which is a large group of customers the team s done a really great job of building out standard solution architecture sets that they can help the customers deploying more rapidly and that should actually give them more functionality than they have today so it s not just a migration for same it s a migration that gets them more and gets them onto a standard product set that will allow them to actually extend the usage of the product and we re going to build on that as we go forward and that s a promise we re making to the customers so i think they have a very good plan that structured well and that they re progressing on ashish sabadra deutsche bank analyst those customers that you re starting with i mean should i think of those as the simpler ones that you want to start with or they the bigger or smaller customers anything about kind of the initial cohort john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer actually it s done as mark said based on based on when the customer is ready to engage so a lot of the smaller ones occur that s certainly true because that s more within our control but there is also substantial customers where we are also working on migration already so it s really depending on when the customer is ready to receive the work ashish sabadra deutsche bank analyst okay thank you operator your next question will come from andrew jeffrey with suntrust andrew jeffrey suntrust analyst hi good morning appreciate taking the question i wonder if i could just drill down a little bit on the commentary in usis about visibility mark you mentioned i think you referenced delivery timing from sort of customer engagement to delivery what about close rates i mean when you start your sales cycle i guess to close rate from engagement to actually getting the customer to commit i mean is has that changed at all i mean how much of the improvement that you re anticipating is a function of customer behavior versus equifax s ability and timing on delivery john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer so i think what s mark kind of mentioned timing which is certainly important right and that s really what s going on now as we continue to build the funnel and there s more opportunities available our comfort with our ability to close within the funnel which is now larger is improving right so to us timing of closure and rate of closure are very similar because they re just separated in time right and we continue to focus and sid and team have done a great job of focusing on just building the funnel so that if the timing is variable which it has been and continues to be and is more variable than it used to be that s all still through but as we continue to build the funnel they have more opportunities we are getting more comfortable that we re able to deliver our forecasts because we have greater opportunities to deliver so i really i don t think it s really any more complicated than that and as the funnels continues to fill better we get more comfortable with delivery and quite honestly as months pass and we deliver on the numbers that we commit to ourselves we get more comfortable as well and that s really what s going and is still choppy mark w begor chief executive officer and you go back to fourth quarter usis which is kind of where we thought they should be and where they committed to be we saw them again in the first quarter they were actually a little bit ahead of our expectations so that kind of a track record gives us confidence that all the things you re talking about are happening close rates are getting more predictable and pipelines are building but it s we still remain cautious it s only a couple of quarters in here of that kind of a track record john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer and the choppiness is still there we don t want to have you think that it s not it s still there and certainly there could be periods where things just don t occur the way we expect because the pipeline isn t as big as normal we could still end up with an unexpected outcome so it s better but not different than we said a quarter ago andrew jeffrey suntrust analyst okay i appreciate that and then with regard to sort of your broad fintech facing solutions and position in the market could you just sort of characterize where you think you are competitively and whether there s whether you d anticipate a ramp sort of generally speaking in fintech end market mark w begor chief executive officer yeah i think we ve talked in the past that this is a space that you go back as recently as a year ago or late 2017 we weren t as focused on fintech as we should have been i think that s an understatement i think it s clear that our competitors are much stronger we have a great market position with the fintechs with workforce solutions a lot of the fintechs are using the work number so that s a strong market position but if you look at our overall share in fintech it s quite small and we talked last year i think mid last year we doubled our commercial team in fintech we ve got real pipelines now of dialogs with fintechs i ve met with a bunch of them personally and the dialogs with them are really quite positive about the fact that we have differentiated data work number is one our credit file is another one nctue the utility cellphone database so the dialogs are quite positive and we would expect to see fintech grow from a fairly small level where it is today as we go through the rest of this year and into next year we are really focused on getting into fintech and being a bigger player there andrew jeffrey suntrust analyst all right appreciate it thank you operator we ll now hear from gary bisbee with bank of america gary bisbee bank of america analyst hi guys good morning i guess the first question just how should we think about the risk of customers pushing out signing new business until after the tech transformation is complete and are you hearing that feedback hey it sounds good but let s wait and see you get your house in order before we sign on rather than coming on board amid the migrations and everything mark w begor chief executive officer zero don t hear anything on that the term house in order we look at it our house is in order meaning our technology is sound it works and i don t have to remind you you go back to last year before the cybersecurity breach our technology was working fine it still does today we re taking advantage of our big investment in security to really transform our technology and the dialogs with customers is really they re quite positive they look at it while this is the partner i want to be with if they re going to make this kind of investment in their technology and you couple that with our differentiated data assets the discussions are very positive so we don t have any customers saying we re going to hold off they re really quite energized when i sit with them and talk about the commitment we have to them through this technology investment the dialog is we want to be partners with you guys so that s kind of how what i m hearing in the marketplace john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer we have customers that want to work with us to help us do this faster so we can help them right mark w begor chief executive officer totally john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer it s a very positive mark w begor chief executive officer well the other thing is most of our customers we have a few that are quite advanced on the cloud but very few and those customers see what we re doing the amount of investment we re making and our technology teams are increasingly engaging with their technology teams about their own cloud transformation and they want to learn from us they want to follow what we re doing so that s another element of the dialog and the same thing happens and security we re obviously have a commitment to be an industry leader in security and we ve made massive investments in the last 18 months in security and that s another dialog with the technology teams about what are you guys doing around security so we can learn from that gary bisbee bank of america analyst great thanks and then just a second the follow up you ve talked a lot about the savings you expect to get from the transformation over the next several years i guess at this point do you have a view on how much you d likely fall to the bottom line versus is there is there maybe a view that stepping up innovation spending or some other to drive the topline would be a way to reinvest a meaningful portion of the savings mark w begor chief executive officer it s hard for me gary to talk about the technology savings i think we ll get to that when we put our long term framework back in place but i think you see us making decisions now and we have in the last six 12 months around investment decisions we did our fairly significant restructuring in the fourth quarter and took some of those cost savings to the bottom line but we also plowed savings back into more commercial resources we plowed savings back into more d a resources we re obviously investing a ton in technology you are very visible on that and security so and then npi in new products has been and continues to be a priority for us where we re continuing to make significant investments and we give you visibility on the new products we re rolling out to the marketplace and some of that new product work is coming through our technology transformation so we re investing in the future today and what we do with the benefits from our technology and security investment i think we ll talk about that when we get to our long term financial framework gary bisbee bank of america analyst great thank you operator our next question will come from bill warmington with wells fargo mark w begor chief executive officer hey bill bill warmington wells fargo analyst so good morning everyone so first congratulations to mark on hitting the one year mark and on settlement so first question for you is on the price increase that fico put through this year starting january 1 they that s going to phase in throughout 2019 equifax is a big player in auto and i was hoping you could help us understand how that could potentially help usis in the second half mark w begor chief executive officer john you want to john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer so obviously the fico price increase impacts us it impacts our customers we pass it through to our customers and it will impact both revenue and margin it s kind of a very similar story to what we had last year with the price increase related to mortgage so it s really no different than that in terms of magnitude we don t give specific numbers in terms of the magnitude of dollars that occur with a partner but it will be very similar in concept to what happened with mortgages much smaller bill warmington wells fargo analyst got it and then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there was potential for you to work with fico in some new ways in the near future i was hoping you could expand on that mark w begor chief executive officer yeah i don t think we re ready bill to talk about those but we ve got because of this partnership kind of structure or umbrella that we ve created we re in kind of constant dialogs with will lansing and his team in different ways that we might work together and we re seeing some new things that were kind of percolating on that could be beneficial for us and fico i m a big believer in leveraging our strengths with another company s through partnerships and this is an example of where we re trying to exercise that muscle and find ways to do things that are going to benefit us fico and our joint or new customers so stay tuned i guess is the right answer bill warmington wells fargo analyst all right well thank you very much operator our next question will come from george tong with goldman sachs george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning you ve indicated that you re still cautious around the pace of recovery of usis but are confident that the business will get back to traditional growth levels over the long term can you discuss any structural factors that may be holding you back from formally reinstating your long term growth targets mark w begor chief executive officer you got two different questions in there i think george on the long term growth targets we ve been very clear with you and others that we certainly intend to put long term growth framework back in place we ve been clear that there were a number of things we wanted to see some clarity on one was our legal and regulatory settlements which we made progress there but that s not complete yet second was on our technology transformation and again we re making progress on that and we want some more visibility there and third was on usis which have been part of your question we want to see some stability in the recovery and we re kind of a couple of quarters into say do meaning they re delivering where we thought they were going to deliver and we want to see some continued performance as well as sequential growth there and those are kind of the three things that john and i and the leadership team think about before we re going to put a long term framework in place we continue to be confident that not only usis but ew equifax will recover to where it was pre reach and that confidence comes from our discussions with customers our growing pipeline our differentiated data assets all those we think are going to allow us to return i don t see anything structural it s just a matter of time and we re seeing some positive progress in the first quarter we expect that to continue in the second quarter and as well as through the rest of the year george tong goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful and turning to the pipeline specifically in usis it sounds like the pipeline is still building and not yet back to full maturity can you talk about how quickly the pipeline is growing and what changes to the sales force you may have made to drive better and faster close rates mark w begor chief executive officer on the sales force we continue to energize our sales team we re incenting them and there s some new talent coming in obviously we have a new leader in the business now which i m quite energized about the last 60 days under sid s leadership as regards to the pipeline building i don t have any metrics john john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer and we don t disclose by one metric so mark w begor chief executive officer but we try to give visibility and just maybe more anecdotally here that john and i are seeing those pipelines build and the evidence for you is usis kind of delivering what this what we committed they re going to do and we ve done that for a couple of quarters and we want that to continue george tong goldman sachs analyst got it thank you operator now we ll here from brett huff with stephens brett huff stephens inc analyst good morning guys thanks for taking the question two questions for me one can you talk a little bit about paynet i want to make sure i understand that it was 150 basis points in 2q on usis held or total company held it s just a housekeeping question mark w begor chief executive officer usis brett huff stephens inc analyst okay and then was that originally in the guide i don t think it was so is there something else in the guide that is it australia that s a little bit more muted is there an offset to that inorganic help that we didn t raise our overall guidance for or is it just kind of conservatism john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer so for the full inaudible full year so for the full year paynet was a plus actually we said the mortgage market would be better would be less bad than we had indicated initially and then the weakness to gcs is a bit weaker than we said initially back in february than we thought and fx was quite a bit more negative than we thought right we ve had 0 5 point of growth we re being impacted by fx and probably the smallest of the three is australia is a bit weaker but that isn t the driver brett huff stephens inc analyst okay that s super helpful and then on the migrations that are happening congrats on the remarkable pace you guys are going to take up on that with half i think usis has been done in 19 once that starts and have we done in the couple of trials or are we right in the middle of that or kind of what do we have early results on smaller clients being moved over or how do you kind of feel about that john w gamble jr corporate vice president chief financial officer so we currently have moved we re not going to give numbers as we go but we re well into the migration it s still early days so but the team has moved a substantial number of clients onto cloud fabric so that s we think that s going well and the migrations are going onto interconnect saas and initially things move onto the our private cloud and then they ll move onto the public private cloud as things move forward but that migration is going well and that last step is simple so we feel very good about how things are progressing and that the team is working really well brett huff stephens inc analyst great appreciate the insights operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over

for the quarter ended march 31 2019 compared to an eps of 0 13 for the same period in the prior year which was primarily driven by a weaker film slate in the first quarter compared to the same period

general and administrative expense for the quarter ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year decreased by 18 or 1 1 million to 5 0 million the quarterly decrease mainly relates

189 or 2 2 million compared to the equivalent prior year period the change between 2019 and 2018 is primarily related to the pretax loss in 2019 other financial information balance sheet and liquidity total assets increased by 235 5 million to 674 5 million at march 31 2019 compared to 439 0 million at december 31 2018 this was primarily driven by the implementation of the lease accounting standards effective january 1 2019 which also resulted in a similar increase in our liabilities additionally assets increased due to the capital investments relating to major real estate projects primarily i the redevelopment of our union square property in new york and ii improvements at our mililani and harbour town cinemas these were partially offset by a reduction in our foreign operation asset values due to a decrease in the foreign exchange rates relative to the u s dollar cash and cash equivalents at march 31 2019 were 12 6 million including approximately 8 8 million in the u s 3 2 million in australia and 0 7 million in new zealand we manage our cash investments and capital structure so we are able to meet short term and long term obligations for our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity as part of our operating cycle we utilize cash collected from i our cinema business when selling tickets and f b items and ii rental income typically received in advance to reduce our long term borrowings and realize savings on interest charges we then settle our operating expenses generally with a lag within traditional trade terms this generates a temporary working capital deficit we review the maturities of our borrowings and negotiate for renewals and extensions as necessary for liquidity purposes we believe the cash flow generated from our operations coupled with our ability to renew and extend our credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity in the upcoming year other information our stock repurchase program that expired on march 2 2019

factors on march 14 2019 our board of directors approved the company s three year strategic plan to focus across the u s australia and new zealand on the upgrading of our existing cinemas to add luxury recliner seating titan branded auditoriums and enhanced f b options the development in appropriate markets of new cinema opportunities and the continued development and or redevelopment of our current real estate assets after considering the approval of the strategic plan our board concluded that the interests of our company and our stockholders would be best served by the continued pursuit of our strategic plan as an independent company and that it had no interest in considering any sale process at this time accordingly we have advised patton vision that our board does not have any present interest in engaging in discussions regarding their unsolicited indication of interest in the sale of our company our controlling stockholders are in agreement with this approach in a matter

appeals on april 15 2019 struck down the california trial court s order appointing a trustee ad litem to solicit offers for the purchase of a controlling interest in our company the basis for that disposition was the appeals court s determination that mr james j cotter jr lacks standing to seek the appointment of such a trustee ad litem the appeals court noted that mr cotter jr is neither a trustee of nor a beneficiary of the trust established to hold such controlling interest the voting trust and accordingly determined that he lacked any standing to bring before the trial court matters relating to the internal affairs of that trust such as the appointment of a trustee ad litem the court of appeals also noted in an observation not material to the specific grounds on which the

presents aggregate segment operating income and ebitda which are important financial measures for the company but are not financial measures defined by u s gaap these measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant u s gaap financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of eps cash flows or net income as determined in accordance with u s gaap aggregate segment operating income and ebitda as we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies aggregate segment operating income we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment operating income and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses separate from non operating factors we believe that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company s business separate from non operational factors that affect net income thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results refer to consolidated and non segment results for a reconciliation of segment operating income to net income ebitda we use ebitda in the evaluation of our company s performance since we believe that ebitda provides a useful measure of financial performance and value we believe this principally for the following reasons we believe that ebitda is an accepted industry wide comparative measure of financial performance it is in our experience a measure commonly adopted by analysts and financial commentators who report upon the cinema exhibition and real estate industries and it is also a measure used by financial institutions in underwriting the creditworthiness of companies in these industries accordingly our management monitors this calculation as a method of judging our performance against our peers market expectations and our creditworthiness it is widely accepted that analysts financial commentators and persons active in the cinema exhibition and real estate industries typically value enterprises engaged in these businesses at various multiples of ebitda accordingly we find ebitda valuable as an indicator of the underlying value of our businesses we expect that investors may use ebitda to judge our ability to generate cash as a basis of comparison to other companies engaged in the cinema exhibition and real estate businesses and as a basis to value our company against such other companies ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and it should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for net income or other operations data or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for purposes of analyzing our profitability the exclusion of various components such as interest taxes depreciation and amortization limits the usefulness of these measures when assessing our financial performance as not all funds depicted by ebitda are available for management s discretionary use for example a substantial portion of such funds may be subject to contractual restrictions and functional requirements to service debt to fund necessary capital expenditures and to meet other commitments from time to time ebit and ebitda also fail to take into account the cost of interest and taxes interest is clearly a real cost that for us is paid periodically as accrued taxes may or may not be a current cash item but are nevertheless real costs that in most situations must eventually be paid a company that realizes taxable earnings in high tax jurisdictions may ultimately be less valuable than a company that realizes the same amount of taxable earnings in a low tax jurisdiction ebitda fails to take into account the cost of depreciation and amortization and the fact that assets will eventually wear out and have to be replaced adjusted ebitda using the principles we consistently apply to determine our ebidta we further adjusted the ebidta for certain items we believe to be external to our business and not reflective of our costs of doing business or results of operation specifically we have adjusted for i gains on insurance recoveries ii legal expenses relating to extraordinary litigation iii adjustments for gains losses relating to property sales and iv any other items that can be considered non recurring in accordance with the 2

portfolio in the first quarter of 2019 was lower than in the same period of 2018 mostly due to lower solar radiation and scheduled maintenance stops that took longer than expected however solar radiation has improved since the end of march and production from the u s solar assets is in line with expectations for the first four months of 2019 production in spain increased significantly year over year due to higher solar radiation and strong operating performance kaxu south africa had a strong operating performance reaching a significant increase in production with a capacity factor of 48 7 compared with 36 9 in the first quarter of 2018 finally production of the wind assets was significantly higher year over year as a result of the contribution of the newly acquired melowind asset with no contribution in the first quarter of 2018 regarding atlantica s assets for which revenue is based on availability they continue to deliver solid performance in transmission lines and in water assets in act the efficient natural gas fired power generation plant a scheduled major overhaul in one of the turbines was performed in the first quarter of 2019 and is expected to continue in the other turbine during the second quarter of 2019 this explains lower availability and production levels compared with the first quarter of 2018 since the major overhaul was scheduled it did not have any impact on revenues the solid operating performance of atlantica in the first quarter of 2019 demonstrates the advantage of having a diversified portfolio where a significant percentage of our revenue is based on availability and not only on generation liquidity and debt as of march 31 2019 cash at the atlantica corporate level was 107 9 million additionally as of march 31 2019 the company

2019 these estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable as of the date atlantica yield published its fy 2018 financial results atlantica yield disclaims any current intention to update such guidance except as required by law non gaap financial measures this press release also includes certain non gaap financial measures including further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as a percentage of revenues margin and cafd non gaap financial measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by iasb and should not be considered alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities please refer to the appendix of this presentation for a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with ifrs as well as the reasons why management believes the use of non gaap financial measures in this presentation provides useful information we present non gaap financial measures because we believe that they and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity the non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under ifrs as issued by the iasb non gaap financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by the iasb and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities some of the limitations of these non gaap measures are they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs they may not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and further adjusted ebitda and cafd do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating further adjusted ebitda reflect cash payments that were made or will be made in the future and the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate further adjusted ebitda and cafd differently than we do which limits their usefulness as comparative measures we define further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as profit loss for the period attributable to the company after adding back loss profit attributable to non controlling interest from continued operations income tax share of profit loss of associates carried under the equity method finance expense net depreciation amortization and impairment charges cafd is calculated as cash distributions received by the company from its subsidiaries minus all cash expenses of the company including debt service and general and administrative expenses our management believes further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates and cafd is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods further adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired our management believes cafd is a relevant supplemental measure of the company s ability to earn and distribute cash returns to investors and that cafd is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make quarterly distributions in addition cafd is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth further adjusted ebitda and cafd are widely used by other companies in the same industry our management uses further adjusted ebitda and cafd as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and in communications with our board of directors shareholders creditors analysts and investors concerning our financial performance in our discussion of operating results we have included foreign exchange impacts in our revenue and further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates by providing constant currency growth the constant currency presentation is not a measure recognized under ifrs and excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations we calculate constant currency amounts by converting our current period local currency revenue and further adjusted ebitda using the prior period foreign currency average exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our prior period reported results this calculation may differ from similarly titled measures used by others and accordingly the constant currency presentation is not meant to substitute for recorded amounts presented in conformity with ifrs as issued by the iasb nor should such amounts be considered in isolation consolidated statements of operations amounts in thousands of u s dollars for the three month period ended march 31 2019 2018 revenue 221 452 225 265 other operating

portfolio in the first quarter of 2019 was lower than in the same period of 2018 mostly due to lower solar radiation and scheduled maintenance stops that took longer than expected however solar radiation has improved since the end of march and production from the u s solar assets is in line with expectations for the first four months of 2019 production in spain increased significantly year over year due to higher solar radiation and strong operating performance kaxu south africa had a strong operating performance reaching a significant increase in production with a capacity factor of 48 7 compared with 36 9 in the first quarter of 2018 finally production of the wind assets was significantly higher year over year as a result of the contribution of the newly acquired melowind asset with no contribution in the first quarter of 2018 regarding atlantica s assets for which revenue is based on availability they continue to deliver solid performance in transmission lines and in water assets in act the efficient natural gas fired power generation plant a scheduled major overhaul in one of the turbines was performed in the first quarter of 2019 and is expected to continue in the other turbine during the second quarter of 2019 this explains lower availability and production levels compared with the first quarter of 2018 since the major overhaul was scheduled it did not have any impact on revenues the solid operating performance of atlantica in the first quarter of 2019 demonstrates the advantage of having a diversified portfolio where a significant percentage of our

2019 these estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable as of the date atlantica yield published its fy 2018 financial results atlantica yield disclaims any current intention to update such guidance except as required by law non gaapfinancialmeasures this press release also includes certain non gaap financial measures including further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as a percentage of revenues margin and cafd non gaap financial measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by iasb and should not be considered alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities please refer to the appendix of this presentation for a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with ifrs as well as the reasons why management believes the use of non gaap financial measures in this presentation provides useful information we present non gaap financial measures because we believe that they and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity the non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under ifrs as issued by the iasb non gaap financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by the iasb and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities some of the limitations of these non gaap measures are they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs they may not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and further adjusted ebitda and cafd do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating further adjusted ebitda reflect cash payments that were made or will be made in the future and the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate further adjusted ebitda and cafd differently than we do which limits their usefulness as comparative measures we define further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as profit loss for the period attributable to the company after adding back loss profit attributable to non controlling interest from continued operations income tax share of profit loss of associates carried under the equity method finance expense net depreciation amortization and impairment charges cafd is calculated as cash distributions received by the company from its subsidiaries minus all cash expenses of the company including debt service and general and administrative expenses our management believes further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates and cafd is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods further adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired our management believes cafd is a relevant supplemental measure of the company s ability to earn and distribute cash returns to investors and that cafd is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make quarterly distributions in addition cafd is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth further adjusted ebitda and cafd are widely used by other companies in the same industry our management uses further adjusted ebitda and cafd as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and in communications with our board of directors shareholders creditors analysts and investors concerning our financial performance in our discussion of operating results we have included foreign exchange impacts in our revenue and further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates by providing constant currency growth the constant currency presentation is not a measure recognized under ifrs and excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations we calculate constant currency amounts by converting our current period local currency revenue and further adjusted ebitda using the prior period foreign currency average exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our prior period reported results this calculation may differ from similarly titled measures used by others and accordingly the constant currency presentation is not meant to substitute for recorded amounts presented in conformity with ifrs as issued by the iasb nor should such amounts be considered in isolation consolidated statements of operations amounts in thousands of u s dollars for the three month period ended march 31 2019 2018 revenue 221 452 225 265 other operating

calgary may 10 2019 prnewswire obsidian energy ltd tsx obe nyse obe bc obsidian energy the company we us or our is pleased to announce its financial and operational results for the three months ended march 31 2019 all figures are in canadian dollars unless otherwise stated michael faust interim president and ceo commented stepping into my role at obsidian energy i am focusing my attention on three main areas first i will ensure we continue to deliver strong and repeatable well results from our cardium asset focused on growing our light oil production consistent with the recent performance of the first 19 well program second i will prioritize the strength of our balance sheet by ensuring we are spending within funds flow from operations and seek to divest non core properties if the market conditions are favorable to reduce our overall leverage profile my third priority will be to conduct a thorough review of our cost structure to identify areas for improvement aiming to bring our costs in line with peers this initiative will be focused on both capital expenditures and expenses this will include streamlining internal processes improving operational productivity and enhancing capital efficiencies details of the cost reduction initiatives will be presented at the annual general meeting demonstrating cardium deliverability during the first quarter of 2019 the company drilled completed and equipped five cardium wells 5 0 net of the 2019 wells that we have drilled to date we are particularly excited about our 12 18 three well pad which has averaged initial production rates over the first 30 days ip30 of 620 boe per day per well and approximately 83 percent oil the 12 18 pad is the most northern pad drilled in the crimson area further demonstrating the extent of our willesden green inventory over the past nine months the company has drilled 19 cardium wells 19 0 net averaging an ip30 of 538 boe per day per well and approximately 86 percent oil the next phase of the program will resume after spring break up and continue until march 2020 we have all our locations ready to license with the construction of the first two pads expected to commence as soon as road conditions and weather permits q1 production beat and improved liquids weighting obsidian energy delivered strong operational results in the first quarter 2019 highlighted by average oil production of 16 472 bbl per day and average total production of 27 651 boe per day both figures are ahead of our pre released target ranges for the quarter the production beat is attributed to the cardium program s strong production rates and was achieved in spite of considerably colder temperatures observed in february the company s liquids production weighting also improved in the first quarter of 2019 to 67 percent liquids a three percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2018 this shift was the result of our gas weighted legacy production that was shut in toward the end of 2018 and early 2019 the company plans to further rationalize the portfolio to focus the company towards light oil and higher margin production strong cash flow generation with continued positive operational momentum and significant improvements in canadian benchmark prices first quarter of 2019 funds flow from operations ffo was 36 million or 0 07 per share a 38 million increase over the previous quarter operating netbacks in the first quarter of 2019 were 18 98 per boe a 17 00 per boe increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase was largely driven by crude oil differential improvements underpinned by the company s focus on its light oil low operating cost cardium development program which resulted in a realized field netback in the first quarter of 2019 of 28 08 per boe an increase

the perspective atlanta georgia may 10 2019 we are at a point in time relative to our nation s history that in all terms and appearances mimics the gradual build up of tensions which culminated in the disastrous loss of lives and properties on april 14 1979 most liberians alive today witnessed the violence firsthand those who were not yet born might have read about the horrific events that occurred on that fateful day or have become acquainted with the subject through word of mouth april 14 1979 monrovia liberia knowing this liberians cannot afford a repeat of april 14 1979 mass protest and the devastation that ensued we must therefore act quickly come together and cobble workable policy prescriptions to avert a potential disaster which neither the government nor the people of liberia can outrightly dismiss the problem the widely talked about the protest which is scheduled to take place on june 7 2019 is from all indications rapidly gaining momentum throughout the length and breadth of liberia it is dividing liberians along political sectoral ethnic and religious lines the alleged missing 16 billion that galvanized the entire population the controversial 25 million mop up exercises coupled with sky rocketing exchange rate and the extremely high cost of basic commodities have made the idea of a mass protest an attractive remedy for all the ills facing the country this however could all be offset in a relatively short period of time if recommendations proffered herein are adopted and acted upon in a timely manner taking charge of the situation to effectuate the proposed recommendations and other policy prescriptions will require the president himself taking charge and issuing orders necessary to implement these forward looking ideas as president and commander in chief mr weah during this critical moment must be resolute and direct with his chief lieutenants line ministers deputies and others to ensure that all instructions and directives are executed accordingly amid the ensuing national crisis the president must be a hands on leader without any hesitation to micromanage the day to day activities required of his administration if this is not done and something unfortunate were to happen that negatively impacts the country it is he the president who will bear the greatest responsibility suggestions for resolving current pressing issues while the quick impact solutions put forth in this document are doable and workable however to be effective government functionaries including the president must not lose sight of the fact that they are servants of the people and as such doing the people s business must be the highest priority the president must without delay make several major pronouncements backed by executive orders because there is not enough time to enact legislations that will address these critical issues and positively impact the lives of the liberian people each executive order must be read by the president himself and he must explain exactly how it will benefit the citizens president weah also must deliver on this national unification day may 14 2019 a major speech that points the nation in the direction of true genuine unification because a house divided against itself cannot stand and since there is no guarantee that the june 7th protest will be violence free we recommend the following as measures that could defuse rising tensions 1 the president must cancel with immediate effect the controversial ctn cargo tracking number regime container tracking in the past has worked just fine without this regime which has been blamed for placing an additional cost on imported goods and the weah government must become more business friendly 2 mandate a 25 kg bag of rice must be sold for no more than 1 625 ld as it was in december 2017 minimum price markups for transportation to rural areas are allowed companies affected by the price reduction could receive tax waivers also designate a government approved standardized rice measuring cup to be used by retail rice sellers throughout the country violators must be penalized 3 call on all merchants to reduce the price of commodities and stop hoarding especially as regards the u s dollar priced items since inflation is mostly driven by the depreciation of the liberian dollar 4 mandate the liberian dollar exchange rate which is now above ld 175 must with immediate effect return to 125 ld as it was in december 2017 vigorous enforcement of this mandate must be carried out by the central bank of liberia as well as law enforcement agencies 5 a mandate by executive order that all cash transfers into liberia through companies such as western union money gram etc must be paid in liberian dollars as a means of increasing the central bank s u s dollars reserves 6 a mandate by executive order that all bank transfers into the country must be paid to recipients in liberian dollars for the duration of this mandate the central bank shall be the sole dispenser of u s dollars however for convenience the cbl shall designate select commercial banks that will also dispense u s dollars to the public under tight monetary controls and the central bank must respond expeditiously to requests for u s dollars and improve its overall efficiency as the central bank moves towards reshaping monetary policies and stabilizing the exchange rate it must also consider changing the liberian currency and printing new bills and as soon as possible all bills currently in circulation must be removed from the market 7 a mandate by executive order that all licensed foreign exchange bureaus and all other money changers must no longer dispense u s dollars to the public penalty for violating this mandate must be severe 8 a mandate by executive order that effective immediately natural born liberians will no longer be required to have a visa to enter liberia it is well documented that liberians in the diaspora contribute tremendously to the liberian economy infusing millions of dollars yearly in hard currency these remittances ease the pressure on the government to provide essential services for the population the government must recognize this critical asset 9 announce the government mass agriculture initiative gmai program which is designed to convert thousands of hectares of land along the monrovia buchannan highway monrovia ganta highway and the brewerville bomi highway etc into major agriculture corridors for food production on a commercial scale the lands will be cleared de stumped and made ready for farming the first of these projects must begin within four to six months gmai essentially are quick impact agriculture projects that involve planting of crops with relatively short gestation periods such as corn cassava okra pepper bitter balls etc and it is also intended to create jobs for the youths as well as skilled and unskilled persons and make liberia self sufficient in for production note there is a comprehensive package for producing food in liberia on a commercial scale that is available for the president review and consideration if he so desires this plan was prepared by liberians who believe agriculture is critical in lifting liberians out of poverty 10 announce a new government proactive initiative that will address the high crime rate across the country particularly within greater monrovia 11 announce a plan to clean up the city of monrovia and its environs as a short term measure the monrovia city corporation mcc could station its workers at various garbage deposit sites and supply them with large specially marked heavy duty plastic garbage bags garbage brought to the site will be placed into these large garbage bags for transport to the general dumpsite 12 the president must declare with immediate effect a one year moratorium on the increase of school fees across the country in light of the dire economic situation liberians are currently undergoing it would be a highly appreciative gesture 13 the president must with immediate effect roll back executive order 84 that reduced liberia exclusion zone and the weah administration must put forth a plan that protects the local fishing industry 14 the president must make a passionate appeal to both the legislative and judicial branches calling for their support in restoring liberians confidence in the government 15 it s high time the president assess the performance of heads of the various ministries and agencies of government and consider repositioning some of his appointees for maximum productivity he might find it necessary to recruit more competent individuals to replace a number of individuals who have consistently underperformed conclusion there is much that the government has to do in order to address the myriad problems facing liberia which has given rise to widespread discontent and calls for mass protests if the recommendations put forth in this document are implemented in a timely manner this will in the short term reduce downward pressure on the economy and address liquidity issues as the planned june 7th protest approaches the president must become the government s chief communicator constantly calling upon the citizens to remain calm and act in accordance with basic principles of law and order he must acknowledge the citizens right to protest peacefully accept responsibility for the problems and take concrete steps to correct them the focus now must be on keeping liberia safe peaceful and protecting lives and properties about the author tq harris can be reached at phone 231 88

calculated in accordance with gaap reconciliations of the most directly comparable gaap measures to non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share are provided within the schedules attached to this release we use non gaap measures in our operational and financial decision making believing that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations as a result internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews include adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share additionally we believe that the presentation of non gaap measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates for example our ability to meet capital expenditures and working capital requirements and otherwise meet our obligations as they become due investors are cautioned that non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for gaap disclosures this communication also includes certain forward looking non gaap financial measures we are unable to present without unreasonable efforts a reconciliation of forward looking non gaap financial information to the corresponding gaap financial information because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary information forward looking non gaap financial information is based on numerous assumptions including assumptions with respect to general business economic market regulatory and financial conditions and various other factors all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information non gaap measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to cision many of which present non gaap measures when reporting their results these measures can be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because we believe the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of gaap financial disclosures however non gaap measures have limitations as an analytical tool non gaap measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies they are not presentations made in accordance with gaap are

public seminar ps what motivated you to write rated agency michel feher mf well three motivations probably the first one which is the longer one comes from reading many years ago foucault s lectures on neoliberalism and then thinking through that from the foucauldian perspective but also realizing soon that these lectures were delivered in 1979 and the last one was delivered two or three weeks before thatcher was elected for the first time so these were lectures that took place before or on year zero of the neoliberal era and so they talk about the neoliberal agenda as it was developed by neoliberal scholars they don t talk for obvious reason what neoliberalism became once these reforms were actually implemented and so what struck me and that was the starting point of the work and its first incarnation was an article i wrote in 2009 in public culture the type of subject that is constituted by the neoliberal regime or the neoliberal art of government is quite different from the one that the neoliberal scholars had in mind and that foucault described in other words the entrepreneur of the self the concept that you find in foucault s lectures is or at least so is my claim not something that actually panned out and that the reason why it didn t pan out is the financialization of neoliberal policy but not the actualization of their agenda so that discrepancy is the beginning of the project ps how did the project and your arguments develop from this initial observation it led to a double project one which is now published which is developing this discrepancy but is also trying to think through what it meant and what it implied in terms of political and social activism and resistance the main motivation is a certain malaise with the left critique for several reasons first of all in the wake of the 1980s the first left critique was that this was basically a backswing from social democracy to good old wild capitalism and liberalism the concern was the throwback to a previous stage of capitalism and there were some elements that could contribute to that just the fact that inequality would rise to point that was unknown since the 1920s the golden years of capitalism there was some kind of analogy in it but then the first amendment to that very much prompted by the reading of foucault s lectures was the reading that neoliberalism in fact was not a return to old laissez faire neoliberalism but in fact what the neoliberals would try to do and say is that competitive market economy is the optimal social system but not the natural social system so instead of needing the state to withdraw they came to think that the state should sustain it which meant a retooling not a loosening or withdrawal of government that instead of a keynesian or a social democratic government the purpose of which was to protect the most fragile parts of the populations against the roughness of market relations what we should have is a government that protect the fragile mechanism of the market from the demagogy of the people the other thing also brought up by foucault was the fact that there was an element of social engineering in neoliberalism which is about shaping every economic agent government company or private citizen into an entrepreneur and especially essential was to make sure that people who were not entrepreneurial would nonetheless think and behave as entrepreneurs because as long as we lived in liberal democracy if wage earners continued to identify as wage earners whose interests would be opposed to the interest of the property trustees it was just a matter of time before socialism would come so the only way to prevent that would be either to suppress democracy which could be done in some countries like chile but not in northern europe or the united states or retool the wage earner so that s he would seize to identify as such and would instead adopt the mindset of entrepreneurs the neoliberal project was then producing financialization which then was producing a different kind of subject and maybe a different priority for government because governments were now there to sustain financial markets and not just any market and then there was of course a big interest in finance and financialization in the wake of 2008 because the left started to plan its combat but then they focused on that as if financialized economy itself was a problem not only that it was producing bubbles that would burst but that it would in fact itself be a bubble that would eventually burst which meant that the horizon of the left is very much the fact the bubble is going to burst and we would be back in 1978 dealing with the problems and hopes of the 1970s so going against that was very much the motivation the ultimate motivation of the book not only by showing that the subjective formation of financialized capitalism was not the same as the neoliberal agenda but also making another foucauldian move with regard to activism which was the fact that once we identify the type of subjectivity moulded shaped and fashioned by financialized capitalism instead of rejecting it the main point becomes to appropriate it and to try to turn it towards different purposes ps are there future projects that continue the work you started in rated agency mf writing rated agency gave birth to a much longer project which is not finished yet where i basically to try to sketch what could be seen as a genealogy of ambition in other words the conditions that preceded the i used to call it the neoliberal condition but now i think of it as the investee condition precisely because the discrepancy that is interesting in terms of social engineering is that the purpose of the neoliberal was to an extent the restoration of the liberal subject in other words the subject of interest pursuing his or her interest and pursuing the maximization of his or her satisfaction instead it seems to me that the neoliberal subject is a credit pursuing subject that prioritizes their appreciation as portfolio seekers which is not the same thing as satisfaction raising expectations life under financialized capitalism while scholarly studies of neoliberalism describe the anatomy and triumphal march of an art of governing the literature on the hyper trophy of finance recounts the emergence of a new regime of capital accumulation since the late 1970s western economies have experienced what the sociologist gerald davis characterizes as a copernican revolution they no longer revolve around the industrial corporation wagering its prosperity on vertical integration and internal growth as in the fordist era instead both the corporations and the economies of which they are a part revolve around financial markets dominated by large universal banks and institutional investors the financialization of developed economies can be measured by the relative size of the financial sector in their gdp the volume of profits made by financial companies compared with those of other enterprises and the proportion of portfolio income relative to commercial cash flow in the accounts of nonfinancial firms however over and above such indicators the examination of which corroborates the thesis of a massive transfer of funds from the real economy to speculative financial circuits what truly manifests the ascendancy of credit suppliers is their ability to select the projects that deserve to be financed ultimately their power consists more in deciding what the real economy will comprise than in draining it of resources the hegemony of finance is therefore bound to modify the conduct and expectations of those who experience it for if economic agents are now primarily intent on making themselves attractive to investors what they pursue is arguably less the profit yielded by their professional activity than the credit necessary to exercise it initial evidence for this behavioral shift comes from the strategy of publicly traded firms what for more than three decades has been called corporate governance does not aim to maximize the difference between sales revenues and production costs over the long term its sole objective is eliciting an increase in the very near future of the value assigned by financial markets to the stock held by shareholders a corporation s real success does not reside in the profits generated by the sale of the goods or services it produces but in the capital gain resulting from its next share sale that is why practitioners of good governance so often use a substantial portion of their resources to buy back shares of their own company absurd as a commercial or industrial strategy this practice is nevertheless sound when in order to be competitive a ceo must attract investors whose sole concern is the shareholder value of the firms they finance the primacy of credit is not confined to the private sector meeting the preferences of the holders of their public debt has also become the main preoccupation of national governments rather than reviving growth or forwarding the transition of their economies toward sustainable energy sources public officials are primarily committed to boosting the attractiveness of their territory to bond markets to avert the distrust of bondholders which is expressed by a rising interest rate on treasury bills and bonds political rulers who want to appear responsible cater to their creditors famously predictable tastes by increasing the flexibility of their labor market cutting social programs slashing corporate and capital gains taxes and putting off any serious regulation of financial institutions finally the pursuit of creditworthiness also informs the conduct of individuals including those who once staked their economic security on stable jobs regular pay raises and guaranteed social benefits since both corporations and states have made it their priority to sustain the confidence of investors employers and governments are no longer in a position to promise lifelong careers to their employees and constituents it is now up to job applicants to make themselves valuable either by advertising highly prized skills and an appealing address book or failing that by displaying unlimited availability and flexibility altogether their ability to find work depends more on the credit attributed to their human capital than on collective agreements about salaries and labor conditions the material precarity created by this alteration in the conditions of recruitment forces large swaths of the population to borrow whether in order to access real estate continue their studies acquire consumer durables or simply survive yet anyone hoping to obtain a loan must offer guarantees in the absence of sizable assets aspiring borrowers generally rely both on prospective collaterals such as the market value of the house they wish to buy or the income that the degree they want to get is purported to generate and on the reputation for reliability they have acquired by repaying previous loans demonstrating their solvency whether predicated on actual resources a reputable record or wise projects enables borrowers to sustain their creditworthiness moral as much as financial thereby persuading creditors to keep lending to them historically the ascent of financial capitalism has largely resulted from the implementation of the mont pelerin agenda even prior to margaret thatcher and ronald reagan s conservative revolution a group of economists and legal scholars of neoliberal observance the founders of the law and economics program at the university of chicago were instrumental in legitimizing the claim that the pursuit of shareholder value should be the focus of corporate governance worried about the technocratic drift of corporate culture already denounced by schumpeter these disciples of milton friedman blamed the declining productivity of the american economy on the disconnection between power and ownership within corporations in their view once they were empowered by the dispersion of stockholders managers had ceased to assume that maximizing the distribution of profits to capital owners was their mission instead they prioritized the development of the firm s productive capacities which meant that maintaining a high rate of reinvestment took precedence over satisfying employees but also over shareholders demands furthermore in order to keep both labor and capital providers acquiescent they attended to the reinforcement of their own power by filling their board of directors with cronies and negotiating mutually beneficial deals with public authorities law and economics scholars charged that the strategic priorities characteristic of managerial capitalism were conducive to a progressive interpenetration of the private and public sectors they argued that on account of the cultural affinities between the salaried managers of large corporations and senior civil servants the former were not only prone to behave like the latter thereby entrenching the technocratic turn of business culture but also relied on their assistance to evade competition to reverse these unfortunate tendencies neoliberal reformers called for the creation of an institutional environment wherein corporate managers would be once again compelled to do the bidding of their employers as milton friedman wrote in a famous opinion piece those entrusted with the task of managing a company they do not own must be made to recognize that their only social responsibility is to meet the expectations of shareholders for the promoters of the law and economics agenda restoring the subordination of corporate managers to capital owners called for a new type of competition henry manne in particular argued that preventing salaried ceos from imposing their agenda and personal ambitions however dressed up as the firm s best interests required the institution of a market for corporate control such a market he claimed would enable actual and potential shareholders to choose keep or replace a managerial team based on its ability to increase the value of the capital under its care in other words the kind of corporate governance manne promoted would subject the fate of managers to the impact of their decisions on the price of the corporation s stock by the mid 1970s the law and economics approach to governance had already made major headways in business schools its growing prestige was largely due to the declining profitability of fordist vertically integrated firms in search of the economies of scale however it was not until the election of ronald reagan that a propitious environment for generalizing the new mode of governance was created guided by neoliberal precepts the new republican administration hastened to remove the obstacles to hostile tender offers and leveraged buyouts thereby enabling raiders to take control of underperforming firms underperforming with respect to their shareholder value by virtue of deregulating capital markets us authorities were thus instrumental in impressing upon corporate managers that raising the stock price of their company was their only mandate while helping corporate managers understand that their job was to create value for the shareholders the deregulatory measures pioneered by the reagan administration and gradually replicated throughout the euro atlantic world rapidly proved equally transformative of statecraft indeed the involvement of governments inspired by the neoliberal doctrine in the emergence of corporate governance would soon affect the definition of their own economic agendas for if they were to enhance the competitiveness of their country s private sector in a global environment where financial capital could travel freely public officials had to make the territory under their jurisdiction as attractive as possible to international investors they thus staked the success of their own tenure on their capacity to lure liquidity handlers with a business friendly tax code a flexible labor market and strong property rights while such perks did draw the desired flows of financial capital governments quickly realized that offering them had a cost for the measures that were appealing to investors deprived their own budgets of a significant portion of the tax revenue hitherto allocated to their citizens welfare though unwilling to question the wisdom of market deregulation they still feared that their new priorities could make them unpopular enough to darken their prospects for reelection eager to sustain the reputation of their territory among creditors without losing their appeal among voters elected leaders increasingly opted to substitute borrowing for taxation in other words they assumed that the clash between investors wishes and their constituents needs could be avoided only through a swelling public debt yet by resorting to bond markets to balance their budgets the heads of states and governments whose deregulatory initiatives had subjected the fate of corporate managers to the whims of the stock market ended up putting themselves in a similar situation for once reliant on borrowed funds to fulfill their missions as providers of public goods and social protection they too became dependent on the confidence of their creditors as had already been the case with corporate governance the sway of investors tastes on political representatives was justified in neoliberal terms financial markets were praised for the discipline they allegedly imparted to economic agents making governments accountable to bondholders the reasoning went would keep their propensities to overspend and overreach in check instead of indulging the demands of special interest groups to secure their own reelection the fear of jeopardizing the trustworthiness of their treasury bills and bonds would persuade them to exercise the same kind of restraint that the threat of hostile takeovers had imposed on power hungry managers the argument of accountability loomed even larger in the third phase of financialization when public officials endeavored to curb their ever increasing reliance on debt by facilitating the access of their citizens to commercial credit throughout the 1980s issuing bonds had enabled governments to honor the preference of investors for lower taxes while still attending to the welfare of their constituents however by the beginning of the following decade the deficits they had incurred to compensate for the loss of fiscal revenues became large enough to make creditors anxious about their solvency loath to see their public debt downgraded by the markets but still afraid of being voted out of office representatives of the state devised a new compromise which amounted to sharing the burden of living on credit with the people under their administration since appeasing bondholders involved major cuts in the budgets devoted to the weaving of a social safety net households and individuals who had hitherto depended on public grants subsidies or benefits were now actively encouraged to borrow the funds they no longer could apply for or collect to justify the substitution of commercial loans for social transfers its promoters argued in typical neoliberal fashion that the former would train their recipients in the discipline of managing their own lives as a business autonomously and responsibly whereas the latter could breed only dependency and sloth there is thus ample evidence that over the last four decades neoliberal reforms and their proclaimed objectives have respectively tightened and legitimized the grip of finance on the economy furthermore the beneficiaries of financialization and the intellectual heirs of hayek and friedman essentially live in harmony on the one hand the efforts deployed by neoliberal governments to make labor markets more flexible tax codes more business friendly and public sectors leaner can only elicit investors enthusiasm on the other hand the discipline imposed by financial markets and institutions powerfully contributes to the enforcement of the neoliberal agenda the pursuit of shareholder value prevents corporate managers from giving in to labor unions the fear of losing the confidence of bondholders deters public officials from spending their way to reelection and personal indebtedness dissuades private borrowers from supporting political agendas that are likely to drive up interest rates should we then assume that the prescriptions initially formulated by the leading members of the mont pelerin society are perfectly consistent with the empowerment of investors that financialization was part of the neoliberal plan and is now the condition under which the neoliberal agenda continues to prevail friedrich hayek liked to quote adam ferguson a distinguished representative of the eighteenth century scottish enlightenment for whom human societies are the result of human action but not the execution of any human design ironically enough ferguson s pronouncement applies especially well to the societies that have been exposed to the implementation of neoliberal policies for while governments looking to control inflation and stimulate supply have undeniably shaped our brave new financialized world the people who have to reside in it hardly fit the type that neoliberal social engineering was intent on fashioning to protect liberal polities against creeping socialism mont pelerin luminaries devised measures that were meant to restore the appeal and more decisively extend the reach of the entrepreneurial ethos as they saw it enticing individuals regardless of their occupation to treat their lives as a business would go a long way toward realigning their aspirations with the interests and the political representatives of the business community however for economic agents who are subjected to the selecting power and continuous ratings of investors the prevailing concern is not so much the profitability of their endeavors as the cultivation of their creditworthiness required to divine and striving to inflect the expectations of potential funders they are less prone to act and think like entrepreneurs seeking commercial profit than like asset managers speculating on the value of their portfolios though hardly indifferent to the revenues that their activities generate the attractiveness on which their welfare depends derives primarily from the appreciation of their resources real estate equity but also skills and social connections neoliberal reforms purported to fashion individuals who would rely on utilitarian calculus rather than on collective bargaining and vested rights to maximize their income by contrast the subjects of financialized capitalism tend to wager their prosperity on the continuously rated value of the assets material and immaterial that make up their capital because market deregulations featured prominently in their program neoliberal reformers played a decisive role in freeing up finance in return the hegemony of the financial markets has largely fulfilled their hopes thanks to investors upholding time honored institutions such as freedom of association and universal suffrage no longer amounts to putting the socialist fox in charge of the liberal henhouse yet in spite of what neoliberalism and financialization provide to and owe each other it is hardly inconsequential that the latter breeds credit seeking traders keen on speculative wagers instead of the profit seeking entrepreneurs driven by rational expectations that the former sought to fashion the identification of wage earners with either character type would have doubtless proved equally damaging to their class consciousness and thus to their involvement in social struggles about the distribution of the wealth created by the labor process however contrary to their conversion to the entrepreneurial ethos the subscription of economic agents to the dictates of financial markets and institutions does not deactivate the polarity between employers and employees without fostering another kind of conflict one that involves the allocation of credit and that pits investors against the investees who depend on their largesse faced with what they interpret as the success of the deproletarianization program devised by neoliberal intellectuals and implemented by governments converted to their viewpoint political parties formerly characterized as progressive are today split into two irreconcilable camps in the wake of 1990s third way reformers such as bill clinton tony blair and gerhard schro der most custodians of the social democratic creed assume either with pitiful sighs of resignation or sometimes with the brazen ardor typical of recent converts that there is no alternative to the pursuit of what corporate and new public managements call competitiveness as for unrepentant advocates of a break with capitalism they paradoxically spend most of their time and energy defending the remaining scraps of the postwar social compact that earlier generations of anticapitalists used to denounce as the most alienating of snares caught between the opportunistic capitulation of the former and the nostalgic resistance of the latter it is no wonder that left leaning voters find refuge in melancholy when they do not give up on politics altogether at first glance there is little solace to be found in the fact that the stakes and expectations molded by the ascendency of finance diverge from what neoliberal social engineering purported to achieve if anything the empowerment of investors provides an even more efficient bulwark against lax fiscal policies rigid labor markets and sloth inducing social benefits than the conversion of wage earners to the entrepreneurial ethos yet in contrast with the project of weeding out class warfare by means of turning virtually anyone into a profit seeking and utility maximizing entrepreneur the fashioning of credit seeking traders prone to speculative wagers on their assets delineates a new divide predicated on capital valorization rather than on income distribution now what remains to be shown is that seizing on the conflicts whose main protagonists are no longer the employer and the employee but the investor and the investee will actually help the left shake its melancholy in order to test this claim the next chapters will successively examine the challenges that stakeholders might issue to companies exclusively concerned with increasing the value of their shares the initiatives that the governed can take to counter the subservience of their governments to the ratings of bond markets and the political aspirations and imagination that financialized economies impart to those investees who seek to alter the conditions

7 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 23 9 for the first quarter of 2018 our effective tax rate was lower during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 2018 due to permanent tax differences resulting from the accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we computed income taxes for the first quarter of 2019 using the discrete method applying the actual year to date effective tax rate to our pre tax loss we believe that this method yields a more reliable income tax calculation for the period due to the uncertainty associated with the estimate of our annual domestic pre tax book income due to the ongoing litigation claims and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident 3 what is the breakdown of the costs related to the september 2017 cybersecurity incident costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are defined as incremental costs to transform our information technology infrastructure and data security legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal government and regulatory claims as well as costs to provide the free product and related support to the consumer in addition in the first quarter of 2019 the company recorded an accrual of 690 0 million for certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses while it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued will be incurred it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident based on a number of factors such as the various stages of these proceedings and investigations that alleged damages have not been specified or are uncertain the uncertainty and complexity of achieving a multi party resolution the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class as applicable and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues the ultimate amount paid on these actions claims and investigations in excess of the amount already accrued could be material to the company s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods we recorded 786 8 million 665 0 million net of tax and 68 7 million 50 6 million net of tax for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 respectively for costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident incremental information technology and data security costs and the accrual

when i was your age i used to go to the movies for a dime i d get a big bag of candy for a nickel i still remember my father saying those words as i headed off to the movies in the 1970s when the afternoon matinees cost 1 75 per ticket more than 10 times what my father had paid 35 years earlier i remember because my father said that every time i went to the movies for my entire childhood and all my teenage years i doubt i m alone on this consistently rising prices there isn t an american alive for whom steadily rising prices haven t been a fact of life for all his or her life most employed americans risk their savings in the stock market through 401ks or other tax deferred investments because everyone knows merely stockpiling cash is useless it will lose all its value because of inflation just imagine if it were the other way around imagine if you could simply put your cash savings in the bank and without even considering any interest it would earn see it gain value over time imagine if your father or grandfather repeatedly told you that something you were purchasing today used to cost him a lot more when he was your age yes technology continued to advance and americans continued to produce more per capita than they had previously but prices ceased falling well for america s first full century that was exactly how it was prices fluctuated year to year but over the course of the 19th century prices fell dramatically a basket of goods that cost 100 in 1800 cost less than 50 in 1900 that means one could buy twice as much with the same amount of dollars average americans could simply stockpile dollars over the course of their working lives and realize a return on their investment in the form of dollar appreciation contrary to the absurd notion now ingrained in the minds of generations of americans that economic growth causes inflation that the economy can somehow overheat all this price deflation occurred during the industrial revolution a period of spectacular economic growth that makes economic sense as more goods and services are produced per capita and compared to the supply of dollars the dollar prices of those goods should fall and they did the 20th century was a different story yes technology continued to advance and americans continued to produce more per capita than they had previously but prices ceased falling that same 100 basket of goods in 1800 which had fallen to 48 94 in 1900 cost 1 265 14 in 2007 today it costs 1 588 81 and that is using the federal reserve s current price inflation methodology which is riddled with tricks to make price increases look more modest than they are automation and retirement what happened are americans producing far fewer products per capita than they did previously as some politicians claim nope manufacturing output has steadily increased since the early 20th century recovering from a pullback after the 2008 financial crisis to hit an all time high earlier this year the decrease in manufacturing jobs is mostly due to automation not free trade deals but america produces more products than it ever has in its history americans are producing so much more with so fewer people that another perennial silly idea has resurfaced that technology will render most americans unemployed this idea is easily debunked but the important takeaway for our purposes here is that the explosion in productivity is a massive deflationary force it should be driving consumer goods prices down there are almost four times as many us dollars in existence today than there were a mere 10 years ago also deflationary is the mass retirement of the baby boomers retirees only consume about two thirds of the goods and services they previously did when they were working in other words the wave of retirements represents a huge decrease in demand for goods and services which should also put downward pressure on the price so with these two massive deflationary forces acting upon prices why aren t they falling answer the increase in the supply of us dollars has outpaced the increase in the supply of goods and negated the retirees decrease in demand this is what the federal reserve has done since its inception in 1913 accelerating rapidly after 1971 and exponentially after the 2008 financial crisis a federal reserve chart of the monetary base shows the tsunami of money created by the fed after 2008 when the monetary base was in the 800 billions it peaked in the 4 trillions during the quantitative easing period and only backed off to about 3 3 trillion during the modest tightening efforts since 2016 that means there are still almost four times as many us dollars in existence today than there were a mere 10 years ago inflation and the fed are americans producing four times as much stuff no not even close that s why prices rise every year despite all the real economic forces that should be driving them down it s all federal reserve money creation the true definition of inflation during the entire progressive era and especially since the new deal americans have been taught a whole range of economic fallacies designed to do one thing keep them from realizing they re being ripped off every day every hour every minute all for the sake of the so called common good at the root of these fallacies is the idea that a currency must be elastic to provide tools for combatting depressions now euphemistically called recessions one of the tools is the central bank adding liquidity to the markets to create jobs it all sounds very technical and complicated but it s not all quantitative easing lowering interest rates or anything else in the federal reserve s so called toolbox amounts to is creating new money out of thin air they can dress it up any way they want but that s what it is when all is said and done the government is stealing your money it s stealing it s not as if the fed can create new capital goods just by adding more dollars to the economy the purchasing power must come from somewhere otherwise the fed could just produce a million dollars for everyone and we d all be rich but if they aren t creating the purchasing power out of thin air then the recipients of newly created dollars must be getting their purchasing power from someone else they re getting it from you let s say you have saved 10 000 in us dollars at that moment you have the purchasing power to acquire some very small percentage of all the goods and services available at that time just to make the point if there were only 1 million worth of goods and services available you would have the purchasing power to acquire one percent of all goods and services available anywhere americans are told this is necessary to create jobs but how did it become your responsibility to underwrite creating someone else s job when the fed creates new dollars and they re lent out to investors you no longer have the purchasing power to acquire the same percentage of goods purchasing power has been taken from you and given to someone else without your consent this is stealing no matter how many pretty words politicians and central bankers spew to cover it up americans are told this is necessary to create jobs but how did it become your responsibility to underwrite creating someone else s job if it is your responsibility why aren t you simply asked for the funds rather than having your dollars surreptitiously depreciated americans are being ripped off answer they don t want you to realize you re being ripped off they know that if they asked the public to give up their hard earned savings for the sake of creating jobs for complete strangers they d never agree so the fed steals your purchasing power without asking you and as john maynard keynes once said they do it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose as of this writing the stock markets are selling off again media are blaming trump s tariff tweet on friday that the sell off started two days earlier is troublesome for that theory it looks more like the market tested the january 2018 high for a second time and backed away when the crisis comes it will be because of the unprecedented monetary tsunami the fed loosed upon the world from 2008 to 2016 trump s tariffs certainly aren t helpful and may provide a pin to burst the bubble but when the crisis comes it will have much less to do with trump and much more to do with the unprecedented monetary tsunami the fed loosed upon the world from 2008 to 2016 media are already gearing up to blame the next crash on tax cuts and deregulation which is absurd they re correct that government spending has something to do with it they ll say trump s pro free market policies caused the crash just as george w bush s supposedly did democratic presidential candidates will pile on that bandwagon until the axles break how long will the american public keep buying this story and allowing the federal reserve to loot them with one hand and claim to save them with the other

7 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 23 9 for the first quarter of 2018 our effective tax rate was lower during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 2018 due to permanent tax differences resulting from the accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we computed income taxes for the first quarter of 2019 using the discrete method applying the actual year to date effective tax rate to our pre tax loss we believe that this method yields a more reliable income tax calculation for the period due to the uncertainty associated with the estimate of our annual domestic pre tax book income due to the ongoing litigation claims and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident 3 what is the breakdown of the costs related to the september 2017 cybersecurity incident costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are defined as incremental costs to transform our information technology infrastructure and data security legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal government and regulatory claims as well as costs to provide the free product and related support to the consumer in addition in the first quarter of 2019 the company recorded an accrual of 690 0 million for certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses while it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued will be incurred it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident based on a number of factors such as the various stages of these proceedings and investigations that alleged damages have not been specified or are uncertain the uncertainty and complexity of achieving a multi party resolution the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class as applicable and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues the ultimate amount paid on these actions claims and investigations in excess of the amount already accrued could be material to the company s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods we recorded 786 8 million 665 0 million net of tax and 68 7 million 50

financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the material cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles these financial measures are not prepared in conformity with gaap management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition related amortization and other items that are not comparable allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis certain acquired intangibles result in material cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value equifax management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability evaluating performance trends setting performance objectives and calculating our

and 2018 respectively associated with the costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident legal fees to respond to subsequent litigation costs to deliver the free product offering made to all u s consumers and incremental costs to transform our information technology data security and infrastructure management believes excluding these charges is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability evaluating performance trends setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital this is consistent with how management reviews and assesses equifax s historical performance and is useful when planning forecasting and analyzing future

for the realignment of internal resources and other costs of 11 5 million 8 8 million net of tax which predominantly relates to the reduction of headcount and the realignment of our internal resources to support the company s strategic objectives management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for

benefit of 3 0 million related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation expense in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three months ended march 31 2019 because this amount is non operating and relates to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost this is consistent with how management reviews and assesses equifax s historical

7 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 23 9 for the first quarter of 2018 our effective tax rate was lower during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 2018 due to permanent tax differences resulting from the accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we computed income taxes for the first quarter of 2019 using the discrete method applying the actual year to date effective tax rate to our pre tax loss we believe that this method yields a more reliable income tax calculation for the period due to the uncertainty associated with the estimate of our annual domestic pre tax book income due to the ongoing litigation claims and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident 3 what is the breakdown of the costs related to the september 2017 cybersecurity incident costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are defined as incremental costs to transform our information technology infrastructure and data security legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal government and regulatory claims as well as costs to provide the free product and related support to the consumer in addition in the first quarter of 2019 the company recorded an accrual of 690 0 million for certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses while it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued will be incurred it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident based on a number of factors such as the various stages of these proceedings and investigations that alleged damages have not been specified or are uncertain the uncertainty and complexity of achieving a multi party resolution the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class as applicable and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues the ultimate amount paid on these actions claims and investigations in excess of the amount already accrued could be material to the company s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods we recorded 786 8 million 665 0 million net of tax and 68 7 million 50 6 million net of tax for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 respectively for costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident incremental information technology and data security costs and the accrual

services and products and other costs added either directly or indirectly to manage execute and support the implementation of these plans the 12 5 million and 28 9 million of legal and investigative fees include legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal government and regulatory investigations and claims related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident the 1 5 million and 4 1 million of product liability costs include the expected costs of fulfillment of trustedid premier and support of consumers using trustedid premier additionally in 2018 the company extended the free credit file monitoring services for impacted consumers using the free trustedid premier service by providing them the opportunity to enroll in experian idnotify at no cost for an additional twelve months since the announcement of the cybersecurity incident in september 2017 we have incurred a total of 1 352 0 million of costs related to the incident incremental technology and data security costs and an accrual for losses associated with legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we expect 2017 cybersecurity incident related costs for the remainder of 2019 to be less than the levels incurred in 2018 2017 cybersecurity incident related costs do not include the accrual for legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident as further described in the notes to the reconciliations of this release at the time of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we had 125 0

the northern triangle of central america ntca made up of el salvador honduras and guatemala has experienced overwhelming economic political and security challenges in recent years a combination of domestic challenges including anemic economic growth high rates of violence and few jobs in the formal economy have had international repercussions such as an influx of unaccompanied minors uacs entering the united states in the summer of 2014 and the ongoing migration crisis at the u s mexican border 1 the united states remains a major partner for these three countries disbursing over 401 million in foreign aid in fy2018 with strong bipartisan support for approving appropriations of 1 8 billion for fy17 19 2the ntca countries also attract considerable foreign direct investment fdi surpassing 3 1 billion in 2017 3 while the united states has always played a powerful role in the ntca region the coverage in washington tends to be erratic in its grasp of northern triangle issues the region is portrayed as having insoluble problems with little in the way of progress there is neither a magic bullet nor an out of the box solution to the problems of the northern triangle most of the solutions are relatively straightforward but politically hard and involve a mixture of economic development political and security reforms the problems of the region are in fact solvable but they require sustained attention from the united states political will in the ncta countries including cooperation rather than obstruction from elites in these societies and ultimately strong and inclusive economic growth to go with strengthened governance the united states has had a sporadic relationship with the ntca tending to focus on the region only when there is a crisis when the crisis subsides the united states turns its focus elsewhere illustratively there have been significant declines in migration from el salvador since 2015 thanks to targeted programs in high violence municipalities but this trend reversed when official borders were threatened to close these are the trends that the united states needs to pay attention to it should double down on the programs that are working and be mindful that migration to the united states will not halt completely especially for family reunification purposes moreover there is no strong and ongoing discussion of economic governance and environmental issues in the ntca in washington mass migration from the northern triangle to the united states will significantly decline when 1 gnp per capita reaches around 8 000 which is slightly over double the current gnp per capita 2 transnational crime drug trafficking and gang violence and activity are significantly reduced and 3 the social contract is reset and basic needs such as jobs education health infrastructure and power are reliably delivered case study mexico mexico was once a country of origin for legal and illegal migrants journeying into the united states now more people are crossing to mexico from the united states than vice versa while mexico is still a country of origin it is increasingly a country of transit and destination for central american migrants figure 1 immigration from mexico to the united states vs gdp growth source pew research center and world bank development indicators a variety of factors have contributed to this declining migration flow one theory is that emigration decreases when countries reach a certain level of wealth around 8 000 gdp per capita 4 mexico surpassed this level of gdp per capita in 2005 which corresponds to the beginning of major decreases in mexican u s migration see figure 1 5 other economic factors include increased trade and employment for example nafta signed in 1994 had a positive impact on mexico s development global exports and foreign direct investment in the long term 6 furthermore the recession of 2007 2009 led to a decrease in jobs in construction and other sectors in the united states where illegal immigrants tended to work which diminished incentives to migrate illegally 7 demographic and social factors have also played a role in decreased migration such as lower birth rates and perceived hostility towards mexicans additionally crossing the border into the united states is increasingly difficult due to increased security and border enforcement and dangerous due to human trafficking and organized crime challenges and progress the region suffers from a myriad of social economic political and security issues including figure 3 gdp per capita current us source world bank development indicators violence and criminal activity violence has lingered from the aftermath of unresolved violence in the 1960s and 1970s and outright civil war in the 1980s and has persisted due to weak governance and corruption 8 el salvador and honduras have some of the highest homicide rates in the world for countries not at war see figure 2 9 in el salvador recent policies have combined comprehensive and targeted violence reduction programs along with more effective policing this represents a change in tactics after mano dura hardline policies for crime and violence had produced only limited impact consequently the homicide rate in el salvador decreased from 105 to 51 per 100 000 people from 2015 to 2018 but criminal activity remains rampant and forced migration high 10 in guatemala alone criminal extortion leads to an annual loss of 60 to 400 million more than 3 percent of gdp 11 drug trafficking through honduras and guatemala has continued to endanger lives there and ultimately in the united states as well gender based violence is another important driver of migration el salvador has the highest femicide rate in latin america at 10 2 per 100 000 women as of 2017 12 in 2017 46 percent of latinobarometro respondents agreed that violence against women is one of the of the most damaging types of violence in the ntca 13 figure 2 intentional homicides per 100 000 people source world bank development indicators and insight crime violence is also perpetuated by large and growing gangs that are financed by extortion and links to cartels supplying illicit drug for u s consumption and empowered by u s extradition policies the largest gangs in the ntca ms 13 and m 18 have 85 000 members combined 14 in a 2017 latinobarometro survey 70 percent of respondents from the ntca said that gang violence was one of the most damaging types of violence more than any other countries in latin america 15 violence is a direct driver of migration research from the inter american dialogue finds that a 1 percent increase in homicides corresponds with respective increases in migration of 120 percent 100 percent and 188 percent in honduras guatemala and el salvador 16 poor economic performance ntca countries feature low levels of economic growth and inadequate economic policies the average gdp per capita of el salvador guatemala and honduras was 3 613 in 2017 which is considerably lower than the latin america and caribbean lac average of 9 244 see figure 3 17 ntca countries have not taken full advantage of trade agreements such as the dominican republic central america free trade agreement cafta dr moreover ntca countries together with haiti and venezuela remain some of the poorest in the western hemisphere 18 weak governance and social services the countries of the ntca have weak governance structures with high levels of corruption corruption in all three countries undermines trust in government diverting public funds to private pockets recently former presidents ministers and elected representatives have been jailed or indicted thanks to high civil society pressure and external support to public prosecutors there is little or no political consensus and there is a noticeable lack of state presence in many parts of these countries especially in terms of judicial institutions in turn there is insufficient infrastructure and poor electricity there are myriad other problems many populations suffer from health nutrition and agricultural challenges law enforcement and security sectors are inadequate family systems are disintegrating due to violence and migration and economies feature high unemployment and informality all of these factors create an enabling environment for crime and gangs the elites rather than trying to alleviate these issues by supporting tax reform to raise revenues to finance public services find work arounds to safety and social problems protecting themselves and the upper echelons of society with vast private security networks and private hospitals demography and employment the population of the ntca region was 32 5 million people in 2017 with half of the population under the age of 25 19 the population is expected to reach 40 million by 2030 with 70 percent living in urban areas 20 it is important to address the challenges of crime weak governance and poor economic performance before they become even more pronounced as the population increases and becomes more urban providing adequate employment to youth and managing labor informality are interrelated challenges 73 percent of non agricultural workers were informally employed in guatemala in 2017 21 this figure is also high in honduras and el salvador at 71 percent and 64 percent respectively 22 this has important implications for migration as economic informality has been shows to drive migration by up to 27 percent in el salvador 12 percent in honduras and 4 percent in guatemala 23 the fourth industrial revolution 4ir has the potential to either alleviate or aggravate the employment situation currently the ntca region is losing ground in productivity and competitiveness due to its slow adoption of 4ir technology and its focus on governance issues rather than innovation and the future of work the potential of 4ir needs to be taken into consideration in long term development plans to ensure it can be harnessed to empower the growing population and rising demand for labor in spite of these problems the three countries have made some progress over the last 10 years but the gaps remain large and challenging 24 while progress varies from country to country there are notable commonalities energy the percentage of population with access to electricity has increased considerably since the 1990s see figure 4 due to a series of power market reforms 25 in may 2016 for example the mexico and central america interconnection commission was established to enhance the integration of the electricity market with the help of the united states 26 domestic resource mobilization and remittances the united states and other donors have sought to help these countries improve financial management but there remain important gaps in areas such as tax collection and evasion fiscal and procurement transparency public spending effectiveness and partisan rather than merit based public sector employment 27 the ntca collects similar levels of tax revenues as other central american countries see figure 5 but is far from other latin american countries such as brazil and argentina whose tax revenues average 30 percent of gdp 28 levels differ within the ntca as well el salvador collects the highest tax revenue of all three ntca countries as a percentage of gdp and is making efforts to increase government funding as well additionally ntca countries have significant remittance flows see figure 6 which fuel the consumption of goods and services 29 in el salvador remittances totaled 5 4 billion in 2018 equal to 21 percent of gdp 30 honduras collected remittances totaling 4 7 billion almost 20 percent of gdp and guatemala saw remittance inflows worth 9 5 billion or 12 percent of gdp 31 security the ntca countries have some of the highest homicide rates in latin america and the caribbean only surpassed by venezuela 32 nevertheless homicide rates have been decreasing in recent years see figure 2 u s assistance in support of justice reforms professionalizing police and community violence prevention have had a positive and measurable impact on improving security and reducing violence and homicide rates u s engagement to date the united states has contributed foreign assistance to the ntca since the 1940s notably in 1961 president john f kennedy launched the alliance for progress with the purpose of establishing economic cooperation social development and democratic reform between the united states and latin america however alliance for progress funds were also used to create counterinsurgency programs and to train paramilitary forces to stop the spread of communist influence in latin america 33 in the 1980s the united states provided significant funds to heavily militarized latin american regimes despite repression massacres by security forces and violations of human rights to counter leftist insurgencies and prevent soviet influence in the region in the late 1980s and 1990s with the end of the cold war the united states supported un and oas facilitated peace processes throughout central america that brought an end to civil conflicts and then helped finance major post conflict reconstruction efforts more recently the united states and the inter american development bank helped develop the alliance for prosperity a4p plan launched by the three northern triangle countries 34 the alliance for prosperity plan is a five year initiative aimed at addressing the factors that incentivize central americans to migrate during 2016 2018 the governments of the ntca allocated 7 7 billion to the plan 35 the bipartisan u s strategy for central america added 2 5 billion in appropriations from fy 2016 2019 since fy2016 the united states has allocated approximately 2 5 billion to central america with 40 percent going to ntca 36 the trump administration has proposed lesser amounts each year but a bipartisan congress rejected those cuts including in the fy 2019 omnibus bill vice president pence stated at the june 2017 northern triangle conference in miami that the united states stands with the nations and the people of the northern triangle however at the end of march 2019 president trump announced that he intended to cut aid to the region ending fy 2017 and fy 2018 foreign assistance programs and also not spending fy19 monies because of the failure of these countries to curb the migration crisis 37 there already has been congressional pushback including a recent letter signed by the chairman and ranking member of the house foreign affairs committee 38 u s engagement moving forward the challenges in the northern triangle require economic growth good governance and social progress and the private sector needs to be front and center in its development 39 these challenges must be addressed with a mixture of economic development political and security reforms most of the work must happen in country and progress will take at least 10 to 15 years of consistent attention and commitment ultimately the northern triangle needs to achieve enough economic growth to reach approximately 8 000 per capita and with far less income disparity than is currently present 40 this growth can only come about with real citizen security reduced gang violence and a new social contract that brings together all sectors of society and government there needs to be a high level of political commitment from elites in these countries the ntca political parties need to sign a 10 year commitment with business leaders and unions and set bold goals for 2030 sustainable development in the region will also require continuous long term u s engagement and partnership that build upon and complement the alliance for prosperity plan ntca countries view stability security economics and governance as the major issues plaguing their societies and yet the united states views immigration and drugs as the core of the issue to ensure success in long term development the united states should consider these differing needs and make greater efforts to incorporate the ntca s in country needs in its regional policy the best thing to happen would be for republicans and democrats to make a 10 to 15 year authorization similar to the one that the united states made in the nunn lugar nuclear demobilization or the commitment made to fighting hiv aids and malaria even though hiv aids remains a world challenge the united states bipartisan long term commitment has significantly helped ameliorate the crisis the united states has made a similarly long term commitment to plan colombia which has made astounding progress even if some work remains to be done we should expect that the northern triangle which is home to some of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere will still be a work in progress 10 15 years from now but with long term u s commitments it can make significant inroads in development what should u s engagement look like in the next 10 15 years first at the political level the united states is going to have to create mechanisms to maintain attention and engage republicans to do so the united states must identify a high level administration champion or create a presidential level commission for the ntca u s policymakers can work with their ntca counterparts to set conditions for policy reform and concrete development targets under the alliance for prosperity u s funding levels could be dependent on the progress towards these goals the more progress the higher the funding levels mexico should also become an equal partner to the united states in its engagement with the ntca providing advice funding and help for security forces in these countries for example the north american development bank nadb charter could be revised to include the ntca second in terms of security and justice reform the ntca must invest more resources in gang prevention community safety corruption control transnational crime and drug and human trafficking both in the short term and long term the united states should build on the experience of the international commission against impunity in guatemala cicig and the mission to support the fight against corruption and impunity in honduras maccih to bring robust international support including south south cooperation to those combatting corruption the region must also further efforts on violence and crime prevention partly by creating sufficient economic and social opportunities the united states can contribute to this effort by providing added support to professionalize and stem corruption in the police justice and military in the ntca in all three countries the mano dura policy deploying military into the streets and using harsh and extreme sentencing has been tried in different ways but has not been demonstrated to be an effective response over time the army is not trained for police work and it tends to come in with heavy weapons all too frequently abuses even if only a small minority undermine confidence in the military as an institution and trust in the government overall in this context replicating the kinds of programs that have shown impact in homicide reduction make the most sense usaid state department and justice department programs in el salvador and to a lesser extent in honduras and guatemala have shown impact in recent years they need replication and expansion particularly when so many migrants apprehended on the southwest u s border identify fear of violence as a major driver of their exodus successful programs have emphasized investing in preventive measures dealing with education inequality youth employment and school retention a clear strategy focused on high risk places people and behavior is needed addressing persistent inequality youth unemployment weak security and justice institutions and organized crime additionally it is essential to strengthen the capacity of the police prosecutors and judiciary in ways that are inclusive of communities rather than approaching communities in armored personnel carriers investment focused on deterrence and problem oriented policing is important the united states should also think about innovative financing mechanisms such as social impact bonds targeting criminal justice reform domestic violence prevention and recidivism reduction moreover the united states can help diminish drug related criminal activity by taking measures to decrease drug demand in the united states as long as there is high drug demand in the united states nefarious actors from the ntca and elsewhere will find means to import drugs into the country even if the united states closes its southern border migration drug trafficking and the illegal flow of weapons will continue to prevent this the united states needs to invest both in domestic drug prevention initiatives and in cooperation with mexico and central america to control the flow of money and weapons from the united states which also fuels gang related and other types of violence in the ntca third the united states needs to continue economic programs that help governments increase their tax bases so that they are able to fund investments in security education and infrastructure big investments will be needed in cities after africa central america is the fastest urbanizing region in the world by 2050 70 percent of the latin american population will be living in cities essentially doubling the region s urban population as of 2017 41 usaid in partnership with the new international development finance corporation usdfc national governments and the private sector will need to devote more program resources in urban areas supporting sectors with high employment potential through technical assistance equity investments and loans for example investments in tourism will require new skills and training such as english language proficiency absent u s engagement and long term commitment in the ntca other powers such as china will look for investment and geopolitical opportunities in the region of the ntca countries only el salvador has severed diplomatic ties with taiwan in favor of china honduras and guatemala still retain diplomatic ties with taiwan but president juan orlando hernandez of honduras has expressed that china s presence in the region presents an opportunity 42 china could plausibly extend its belt and road initiative to central america increasing chinese influence in the region and offering potentially unfavorable infrastructure deals dreaming big what does success look like for the ntca what could the northern triangle look like in 10 to 15 years if there were greater regional cooperation and investment continued u s assistance and a renewed social contract the ntca needs to set bold quantitative targets for 2030 creating an sdg agenda for the ntca to hold countries accountable for results measure progress and monitor success the region needs to make concrete commitments in the areas of security governance and economics in terms of economic growth ntca countries should strive to double gdp per capita by 2030 by investing in infrastructure education and training in promising sectors such as tourism textiles and bpo ntca countries should aim to achieve a tax to gdp ratio closer to the hemispheric average regarding poverty alleviation meeting sdg targets 1 1 eradicating extreme poverty and 1 2 halving the national poverty line would be necessary to achieve more inclusive societies targets such as halving homicide rates and human trafficking are just as attainable ultimately if these targets are met the number of migrants coming to the united states would decline and inspire the ntca diaspora in the united state to return home start businesses and contribute to the economic and social fabric of their countries ntca countries should look to their regional peers and strive to become like panama or costa rica in the next 10 years by 2030 the ntca may still be a work in progress but gnp per capita could reach well beyond 8 000 enough to deter irregular migration to the united states if accompanied by significant reductions in gang activity crime and corruption reduced violence is not implausible with a joint and sustained u s mexican and regional commitment and could lead to greater citizen trust in and engagement with their governments to succeed a u s long term commitment in the ntca needs to be balanced with real and measurable country ownership and political economic and

elizabeth warren pins a lot of hopes on her ultra millionaire tax the democratic presidential candidate would like to put a 2 levy on assets over the 50 million mark and 3 on those over 1 billion the revenues would pay for her plans to pay for universal child care student debt forgiveness and other programs she has in mind in a fox news op ed an analyst at the conservative heritage foundation noted that a wealth tax isn t a new idea joel griffith said many european nations have tried it and scrapped it of the 14 wealthy organization for economic cooperation and development countries with a wealth tax in 1996 10 have since then abandoned it griffith wrote april 28 we found different numbers but there has been a turn away from wealth taxes and with warren s plan on the table the european experience is worth exploring a decline in europe griffith got his numbers from an article on the website of the tax foundation a group that is concerned about the ways that taxes distort business decisions the foundation s analysis drew on data from the organization for economic cooperation and development a paris based international body that has its roots in the post war recovery of europe the oecd data shows 13 countries collected revenues from net wealth taxes in 1996 measured in local currency but it shows 14 when measured as a percentage of gdp we can t account for the difference there s another twist one of those countries is austria but austria ended its wealth tax in 1994 so the actual count that year was either 12 or 13 it s only slightly off from what griffith wrote but we care about these details tallying the countries that have a wealth tax today is even trickier largely because definitions vary we found room for debate over what constitutes a wealth tax all wealth taxes tax things that are owned not money earned but they vary in a couple of key respects they might target the wealthy norway s tax for example affects net worth above 1 48 million norwegian kroner or a broader swath of residents and some tax all assets while others such as belgium with stocks and bonds or france with real estate focus only on specific assets a 2018 report from the respected german based think tank ifo institute for economic research counted just three countries with a wealth tax switzerland norway and spain but the authors noted that italy and the netherlands also tax wealth in limited ways and france swapped a broad wealth tax for a narrow one on real estate wealth that kicks in on property worth at least 1 3 million euros the international accounting firm ernst and young affirmed that italy does have a wealth tax another accounting firm kpmg reported in 2018 that belgium added a wealth tax when it imposed a tax on securities such as stocks and bonds to make things even more complicated some oecd countries dropped added or changed their wealth taxes since 1996 the tax foundation article griffith relied on said that today six oecd countries had wealth taxes in one form or another one of its charts showed four but that stopped counting in 2017 how to sort this out by the strictest definition today only three wealthy oecd countries have a wealth tax with a looser standard as many as seven do some tallies include hungary but it might not count as a wealthy country as the claim says low revenues big administrative headaches the general reason european countries dropped their wealth taxes was they were more trouble than they were worth in germany the tax was found unconstitutional but it wasn t raising that much money anyway a review of the wealth tax option by the european commission said that in the past determining the value of assets was challenging and cheating was easier opportunities of avoidance and evasion reduce the capacity of wealth taxes to generate revenue and they contribute to the perception that wealth taxes produce little net benefit the report said decisions to repeal net wealth taxes have often been justified by efficiency and administrative concerns oecd analysts wrote in a 2018 report the revenues collected from net wealth taxes have also with a few exceptions been very low switzerland reaps far more than other nations taking in revenues equal to 1 of gdp but norway brings in 0 4 and spain 0 2 of the countries that did away with a wealth tax denmark was typical in 1996 the tax brought in just 0 1 of gdp the earlier taxes also tended to reach down into the middle class not just the uber rich getting rid of them was politically popular a debate over the lessons from europe for some the european experience casts a deep shadow over warren s proposal wojciech kopczuk an economist at columbia university warned that no matter what valuing assets is tough warren s plan would apply only to the very rich kopczuk said that does not at all resolve administrative problems those are as daunting in the united state as in europe on the other hand kopczuk added that a tax that starts at 50 million could hold popular support there s also a difference in overall tax regimes the oecd analysts said that the arguments for and against a wealth tax depend on all the other tax laws in a given country in that light reuven avi yonah director of the international tax program at the university of michigan law school said europe is not at all like america income tax rates and sometime inheritance taxes are higher in europe avi yonah said this means there is less need to tax the rich through a wealth tax we ve looked before at the debate whether warren s plan would raise as much as she hopes warren s campaign staff told us that they have learned the lessons from europe they argue that focusing on the 76 000 wealthiest people and taxing all assets with no complicating exceptions would lighten the administrative burden there s also a hint that europe is taking a second look at wealth taxes both the oecd and the european commission wrote of a renewed interest in wealth taxation our ruling griffith said that of the 14 wealthy oecd countries with a wealth tax in 1996 10 have since then abandoned it we found there are different ways to consider wealth taxes and griffith used the strictest one based on dated information we found that either 12 or 13 countries had a wealth tax in 1996 and nine ended their taxes since then today six or seven european nations have some form of a wealth taxes either broad ones or narrow ones the meaning of the european experience from two decades ago is debatable but that s not the basis for our ruling we looked only at the countries and their tax laws the numbers in the statement are off european countries did move away from the wealth taxes but not quite to the extent stated in the op ed we rate this claim mostly true

key strength for sun life as we adhere to our disciplined approach to capital allocation including investments to grow our business organically and the repurchase of shares in the quarter for the first time in our history we reached 1 trillion of assets under management it took us 147 years to reach the first 500 billion of aum and just seven years to add the next 500 billion our clients in aum have benefited from a prolonged bull market and the positive investment returns we have generated for clients the growth in aum also reflects an important aspect of our four pillar strategy in which we favor businesses that have built in growth whether it be through equity markets healthcare trends or the demographics in asia insurance sales in the quarter were up 17 over the prior year with double digit growth in both individual insurance and group benefits wealth sales were down 10 primarily driven by lower sales in our canadian and asian businesses importantly our value of new business vnb was up 14 compared to the first quarter of 2018 from higher individual life and group insurance sales and improved pricing in the u s across our businesses we continue to drive outcomes that reflect our purpose and make it easier for clients to do business with us in canada we collaborated with rise people inc to launch an integrated human resources platform that simplifies benefit

multiple sun life products which is one of our objectives in asset management we delivered strong investment performance across the global platform sun life investment management generated positive net flows of 1 3 billion in the quarter assets under management ended the quarter at 67 billion up 12 over the prior year with the upcoming edition of greenoak our assets will grow to 80 billion and

and three year periods respectively mfs continued to show well in the annual barron s ranking of u s mutual fund families for long term performance where they ve ranked in the top 10 for both 10 and five year performance in nine out of the last 10 years in asia insurance sales in our seven local markets were up 24 over the prior year sales benefited from growth in the number of advisors in the number of our countries like the philippines and bank insurance distribution in india where we continue to expand our presence in hdfc s branch network insurance sales were down in our international high net worth segment as we continue to adjust to changing product preferences with new product launches across asia we re working hard to digitize the client experience and make it seamless for

ll now turn the call over to kevin strain will take us through the financials kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dean and good afternoon everyone turning to slide 6 we take a look at the financial results from the first quarter of 2019 we ve had a good start to the year with strong profitability double digit value of new business growth and continued financial strength reported net income of 623 million was down from 669 million in the prior year prior year results included the impact of interest on par seed capital in canada and the u s s results which contributed 110 million to earnings in q1 2018 reported net income this quarter reflected market related impacts which reduced earnings by 69 million after tax underlying earnings were 717 million down from 770 million in the prior year excluding the interest on par seed capital underlying earnings are up 9 or 11 on an earnings per share basis compared to prior year underlying earnings also included favorable experience items including investing activity gains mortality morbidity lapse in policyholder behavior and expense experience this was partially offset by unfavorable credit experience related to downgrades from indirect exposure to a single name in the u s utilities sector which i will discuss in a few minutes our underlying roe of 13 3 was within the target range for our medium term objective of 12 14 we maintained a strong capital position with a licat ratio of 145 for sun life financial inc or slf and 132 for sun life insurance company of canada the higher ratio at the slf level reflects the excess cash of 2 6 billion held by slf our leverage ratio of 21 1 remain below our long term target of 25 and is another potential source of capital for capital deployment on may 13th we will redeem 250 million in subordinated debentures which will reduce our leverage ratio by approximately 70 basis points to 20 4 we saw good growth in our book value per share this quarter up 7 over the prior year reflecting income growth over the past year as well as the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income partially offset by payments of common share dividends we repurchased approximately 4 million common share for 200 million in the first quarter of 2019 with additional shares we purchased in the month of april we have now repurchased all 14 million shares under our current normal course issuer bid yesterday we announced our intent to amend or existing normal course issuer bid to increase the number of shares that we can repurchase by 4 million we also announced a 5 increase to our common share dividend to 0 525 per share turning to slide 7 we provide details of underlying reported net income by business group for the quarter in canada underlying net income of 237 million was down from the prior year reflecting 75 million of interest on par seed capital recognized in q1 2018 and unfavorable credit experience in the first quarter of 2019 this was partially offset by strong business growth across all business units as well as favorable investing activity gains mortality and expense experience excluding the impact of par seed capital underlying earnings in canada grew by 8 in the u s underlying net income was up 16 in the first quarter of 2018 reflecting favorable mortality morbidity and lapse in policyholder behavior experience partially offset by lower investing activity gains and unfavorable credit experience the prior year also benefited from 35 million of interest on par seed capital our group benefits after tax profit margin was 7 9 on a trailing 12 month basis in the quarter compared to 5 6 in the prior year driven by continued strong results in our stop loss business asset management underlying earnings were 227 million down slightly from the prior year the impact of lower average net assets at mfs primarily is a result of equity market decline from the fourth quarter of 2018 and was largely offset by favorable investment income including returns on seed capital mfs pre tax net operating profit margin was 38 in line with the prior year sun life investment management generated underlying net income of 4 million in asia underlying net income was down 6 million from last year with growth in our core asia businesses of 16 offset by weakness in our international results reflecting unfavorable credit and mortality experience and higher new business stream the next slide slide 8 we provide details on our sources of earnings presentation expected profit of 739 million was up 5 million from the same period last year with business growth in canada and in the u s stop loss business offset by the impact of lower average net assets at mfs excluding the impact of currency and the results of asset management expected profit grew by 2 over the prior year we had new business strain this quarter of 11 million reflecting higher strain in asia as a result of lower sales in our international business segments experience losses of 96 million for the quarter primarily reflected net unfavorable market impact driven by interest rate movements in the quarter and partially offset by equity market increases credit lapse in policyholder behavior and other experience also had an unfavorable impact which was partially offset by investment activity mortality morbidity and expense experience the unfavorable credit experience in the first quarter of 2019 includes 57 million after tax related to several renewable energy projects and our corporate loan portfolio related to private fixed income investments or pfis that have contracts to sell power to pacific gas electric pg e given the bankruptcy proceeding for pg e we downgraded these pfis these downgrades reduced canadian results by 29 million asia results by 19 million mostly in the international segment with the remainder of the impact in the u s the downgrades were on internal ratings we have on these pfi investments and were driven by their role as suppliers of power to pg e there has been no impact on cash flows for us on these investments assumption changes were moderately negative at 10 million in the quarter other in our sources of earnings which amounted to a loss of 29 million includes a fair value adjustment on mfs share based awards acquisition integration and restructuring cost and the impact of certain hedges in canada that do not quality for hedge accounting earnings on surplus of 125 million were 32 million lower than the first quarter last year reflecting lower realized gains our effective tax rate on reported net income for the quarter was 11 driven by a market movement on investments with lower tax rates on an underlying basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17 8 and in line with or expected range of 15 20 slide 9 shows sales results across our insurance and wealth businesses total insurance sales of 780 million were up 17 or 16 on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2018 insurance sales in canada were up 22 driven by large case sales in group benefits as well as higher individual insurance sales in the u s sales were up 11 in u s dollars as a result of higher sales and stop loss asia individual insurance sales excluding international were up 24 in constant currency with double digit growth in six of our seven markets sales in asia s international business segment were down from prior year reflecting changing product preferences total wealth sales of 36 billion were down 10 from the prior year or 13 on a constant currency basis wealth sales were primarily impacted by a weaker rsp season in canada institutional sales which were lower in a few of our businesses included mfs and defined benefit solutions in canada and in asia where we had lower money market sales in the philippines and lower sales in our india asset management business primarily driven by market volatility value of new business was up 14 to 382 million driven by strong insurance sales and improved pricing to conclude we had a good first quarter we saw strong growth in earnings an eps after reflecting the impact of interest on par seed capital strong growth in insurance and value of new business and a continuation of our strong capital generation with that i ll turn the call over to greg to begin the q a portion of the call gregory dilworth vice president of investor relations thanks kevin to help ensure that all of our participants have an opportunity to ask questions on today s call i would ask each of you to please limit yourself to one or two questions and then to requeue with any additional questions with that i d like to please poll the participants for questions questions and answers operator at this time i would like to inform everyone in order to ask a question press then the number 1 on your telephone keypad to withdraw your question press the key we will pause for a moment to compile the q a roster your profession comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey lee dowling partners analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking my question my first question is related to the favorable expense experience in a quarter and i was just wondering if kevin can provide some color in terms of was it a benefit of more disciplined expense management that you highlighted at the investor day or was it just the timing of expenses if you can elaborate a little bit on the level of expense gap in the quarter that would be helpful dean connor president and chief executive officer well thanks humphrey i ll start and kevin morrissey may add some comments as we talked about at investor day we ve been working hard across the organization on expenses and as we called it bending the cost curve and if you reflect the impact of currency take the impact of currency out of your flat year over year on expenses and for our controllable expenses we had a moderate increase of 1 at the same time as we were working hard on controlling our expenses we saw the business grow both on the new business side and in the in force which saw us adding allowables the combination of those higher allowables and good work on a managing the expenses resulted in the gain humphrey lee dowling partners analyst it sounds like it s more the expense management that you talked about as opposed to timing dean connor president and chief executive officer i think it is yeah you re seeing a lot of good impacts of the expense management coming through humphrey lee dowling partners analyst okay kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah humphrey it s kevin morrissey maybe i ll just add that you saw that we had 11 million after tax gain and in the expense line it is from the growth of the business and the expense management so both of those components we would expect to see those to be volatile moving forward quarter to quarter and our outlook on that would probably be more around zero but it was certainly a strong quarter humphrey lee dowling partners analyst got it and then shifting gears to u s group benefits i think when you look at the overall strong sales and in force premium growth in the business especially in stop loss i was just wondering from a perspective have you seen any kind of market expansion in the stop loss market or are you just simply you and maybe some other companies are taking market share daniel fishbein president of sun life financial united states humphrey this is dan fishbein the stop loss market continues to grow for a few different reasons first of all the size of stop loss premiums grow with medical cost trends so that s about 6 8 a year also more employers are self insuring in recent years we get about a 0 5 growth in the proportion of employers that are self insuring versus fully insured as a percentage of the total market each year and then we are also taking share there s no question we re taking share from competitors so our very good growth is fueled by all three of those factors humphrey lee dowling partners analyst at the same time you have very favorable underwriting results do you feel like that would potential lead to any kind of downward pressure on pricing or just the fact that the medical cost trend and the level of additional employers looking to self insure would more than offset that pressure daniel fishbein president of sun life financial united states well historically if you look back over the past 10 years or so the stop loss business has been somewhat cyclical there have been times of expanding margins and then increasing competition that s led to compressing margins we re not seeing that phenomenon right now although we ve been in the good part of the cycle for about two and a half years now from our own perspective what we can say is that we re still selling and renewing our business at or above our targeted pricing so at the moment we re not seeing irrational or aggressive market behavior humphrey lee dowling partners analyst thank you so much operator your next question comes how many meny grauman from cormark securities meny grauman cormark securities analyst hi good afternoon i just wanted to start with the asia segment it was noted that there was favorable joint venture experience in that segment so i m just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail what s driving that experience what geography is this is this primarily bank assurance driven thanks dean connor president and chief executive officer we ll ask claude accum to take that question claude accum president of sun life financial asia hey meny it s claude accum here i m not sure which particular item you re seeing i actually see joint venture experience going the other direction can you give me where you re getting your question from meny grauman cormark securities analyst in the md a i thought there was a reference to positive joint venture experience in asia but let me see kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer meny it s kevin we have two large joint ventures of course we have a joint venture in malaysia which we manage but that come through the joint venture piece which is india and china we did have some gains in china in that segment but overall i think claude is talking about you re focusing on one piece and claude is talking about the overall joint venture experience so the two do tie in but that s how they do meny grauman cormark securities analyst okay moving on just in terms of mfs i m just wondering about that institutional flow and if there s anything unusual there that you would highlight or are we just seeing the trends that we ve been talking about for a while just continuing or if there s anything that you would call out in the quarter in terms of influencing those flows michael roberge chief executive officer of mfs investment management good afternoon meny it s mike roberge yeah it really is the same things that we discussed de risking rebalancing it has not been performance related and so the same things that we ve talked about over a number of quarters were true in q1 as well meny grauman cormark securities analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from gabriel dechaine from national bank financial gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst good afternoon my first question is on the buybacks and yeah just trying to figure out what that says about your m a ambitions i know you re notionally looking at something in asia or bulking up the u s group business does the decision to upsize the buyback mean there s nothing really imminent on any of those files or is it really just an expression that overall you could do that plus accommodate more buyback dean connor president and chief executive officer gabriel it s dean it s the latter we have as you know a very strong balance sheet lots of excess cash at the hold co lots of leverage capability and so this extension of the buyback which is not big in dollar terms just gives us some more flexibility as we run through to the end of this particular ncib period we re pleased that we ve been able to fully execute on the previous ncib that we launched last august executed on that over the first nine months and this just gives us a little bit more flexibility as you know we re getting close to closing soon on the greenoak transaction that will be deployment around 200 million when that transaction closes we ve got the capital to do things like that to give us the flexibility to do more ncib but also to do acquisitions small medium and large kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer i might just add to that gabriel as we discussed at the investor day the company is generating after dividends 800 million in capital each year and we ve been running in the buyback close to 200 million a quarter which is kind of keeping us at the excess capital position we ve been at gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay and is there heat meter on the m a file that i see anywhere no i m joking but if you answer that that d be great my real second question now i tend to kind of disregard the macro factors i shouldn t probably but this quarter the interest rate impact is pretty large larger than what i did get to using your sensitivity guidance and i m just wondering if there s an element of the flat yield curve we saw during the quarter and inverted for a bit that may have been a factor there or perhaps maybe another explanation as to why it was large and if it s just gabe your math is wrong then that s fine kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary gabriel it s kevin morrissey thanks for the question no you are right it was larger than would be implied by our sensitivity which are very simple stylized sensitivities based on parallel movement in yield curves as you noted we had a bit of a flattening in the yield curve and for sun life that does cause us some larger losses probably about 60 of the incremental loss would have been from flattening of the yield curve we also had some losses related to derivatives that we use to hedge some of the interest rate risk and a market to implied volatility changed a bit which reduced the value of those derivatives that s something again that wouldn t be in the simple sensitivities we disclosed gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst what s that 60 of the deviation kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary if you look at the markets broadly they were down about 30 basis points so based on our sensitivity that would imply about a 60 million drop we saw about twice that so the variation would have been about 60 million incremental loss so 35 million ballpark additional loss from the flattening of the yield curve gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay great thanks a lot operator your next question comes from doug young from desjardins capital douglas young desjardins capital analyst good afternoon just maybe starting kevin with you on the lap side obviously you may have made some adjustments from the actuarial side recently but it keeps persistently being negative and just wanting to get an update what it was this quarter in what you re seeing kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary doug thanks it s kevin morrissey again what we did see in the quarter we saw a loss of 8 million it was from various sources across a number of business groups all quite small and i d say relatively benign so as you noted we had some historically large losses related to the u s in force business we took significant strengthening in q3 and we ve been pleased with the results that have been very small gains and losses since then so we re very satisfied with the action that we took relative to those historical losses and we see the results this quarter the small loss being in the range of normal volatility douglas young desjardins capital analyst you re not seeing any particular trend in any one business this seems to be a shotgun and your u s experience on the lap side seems to be normal is that fair kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary that s fair yes douglas young desjardins capital analyst okay i m actually going to go at the buyback a little differently you increased your buyback 4 million shares again it s 220 million if you re generating 800 million of capital excess capital a year and you re buying back 200 million you ve giving yourself another quarter of buyback why not increase it more why not double the buyback and give yourself more flexibility or am i doing the math wrong or missing something thanks dean connor president and chief executive officer no doug this is an amendment to our current ncib which would end in august and at that time we would look at whether we renewed or not this gave us the most flexibility douglas young desjardins capital analyst okay that s fine thank you operator your next question comes from sumit malhotra from scotiabank your line is open sumit malhotra from scotiabank your line is open sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst can you hear me dean connor president and chief executive officer yeah sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst hello dean connor president and chief executive officer yeah we can hear you sumit sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst oh ok good i was having some phone problems just making sure everything s ok just on a couple of the moving parts on the book value that are upcoming so this is likely for kevin strain you gave us or you reconfirmed your sensitivity and that would be i think you told us about 100 million if the 15 basis point reduction is enacted are you expecting that to be in the actuarial review in q3 kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah sumit this is kevin morrissey we are expecting that so as you re probably aware the actual standard board did release their initial standard and it is a 15 basis point reduction in the long term urr which is the one that we re sensitive to our estimate of that is 100 million after tax reduction we are planning to do that in q3 that s similar to what we had done the last time this came around in 2017 sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst okay we ll see that then and then as far as a greenoak is concerned when that transaction was announced in december it was stated that the impact on shareholders equity on merging the two entities greenoak and bentall kennedy would be 730 million is that kevin still a good accurate number and are we likely to see that before the end of june kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer well i ll let steve talk about the timing of the transaction but in terms of the accounting impact that s roughly what we re still expecting stephen peacher president of sun life investment management in terms of the timing of the transaction it s taken a while because we ve had to get regulatory approval in a number of jurisdictions those are going quite well in fact we just got one more approval today we would expect this to close right around the end of the quarter maybe july 1st as opposed to june 30th but we re on track for closing over the next couple of months sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst to the extent we talked about this transaction steve over the last few months a lot of it has been on the potential diversification for the business with respect to geography and frankly strategy in terms of how the respective real estate portfolios are managed it may be the right time to ask it in a quarter where sun life had positive expense experience for the first time in a few years at least the way you report it you re putting together two entities here that get you to close to 40 billion in assets is there anything we should expect from an expense synergies prospective or with this franchise being more in growth mode are expenses not really a big part of the story in the near term stephen peacher president of sun life investment management i think that as these two entities come together we re going to find some efficiencies from an operating standpoint that really was not the driver of the deal the driver of the deal as you mentioned was about an expanded range of capabilities on the real estate side which allows us there s a trend in the market of institutions wanting to reduce the number of real estate managers this gives us a broader platform with a high growth entity with exceptional return so the transaction was really about broadening our positioning i do expect to the margin we re going to find some efficiencies but it wasn t the driver of the transaction sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst last one for me i m going to say it s going to be kevin or claude i just wanted to circle back on asia i know obviously you ve got let s call it the credit provision in the quarter or the credit downgrade in the quarter that had an impact on the earnings and the segment but when we look at expected profit where i don t think that would have factored in the growth rate was about 2 kevin in your comments you seem to be distinguishing between what was happening in the core insurance and wealth part of the business and then international i feel like we haven t had to talk too much about the international piece of late maybe just a little bit of color from you to reiterate what exactly drove the contribution from the international piece down this quarter and are there factors that were one offish in nature or is this something where we should see a lower run rate from international in the near term kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll start and then maybe claude can jump in it s kevin strain on the international there were three big impacts to international international took almost the entire pg e impact that i talked about in asia so the downgrades to the investments the pfi s we had the second is international it s the first time this has happened in a long time and you do get some volatility here had bad mortality experience and then with the lower sales it had some more new business strain in international if you looked at the earnings impact to asia international was a significant piece of the decline in underlying earnings with each of those three components and in order that i mentioned the credit the mortality and then the new business strain if you looked at asia expected profit from the core seven local businesses as dean called them earlier we did see some the expected profit there grew but more moderately than you would expect there was an impact on our fee income from equity market declines in six of our seven markets in asia and that impacted the fee income there so you ve got the combination of a couple of different things happening in asia sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst just on the fee income piece i would think that that has a lot to do with where you started the quarter in terms of aum as opposed to where you ended it kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s right it s really to do with the equity market performance and where the quarter started and what happens you ve got a lot of impact in asia related to china and the china economy and those types of things as well sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst thanks for your time operator the next question comes from steve theriault from eight capital steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks very much to start if i could just follow up a bit on the asia international pg e i understand that was split across divisions but just going into the sales and probably for claude last quarter you talked about new product launches rate volatility extending the selling cycle and how sales are getting pushed into this year but the q1 sales were pretty modest can you update us on just the confidence level around getting sales back to the prior run rate and how quickly we should expect to see that claude accum president of sun life financial asia yes steve it s claude accum here and we ve seen this two quarters now starting in q4 we did see a shift in market preferences for certain products away from the traditional universal life product that has been very successful for us for the last decade as you pointed out that shift away from ul continued in q1 in the high net worth space so how we ve responded is we re focusing on products that operate better in a low interest rate environment and offer equity market participation so the two products we re focused on our indexed universal life and par whole life we ve actually already launched the indexed universal life high net worth product offshore and we ve also successfully launched a high net worth par product onshore in hong kong and that product is gaining quite a bit of traction and it s driving some of the strong sales that you re seeing in hong kong we re going to continue that progress and this week this month we re going to be launching a competitive high net worth par product into the offshore market so we ll have two products out there in this space and we re looking for that product to garner some good sales traction in the second half steve theriault eight capital analyst in the second half and then just one last thing on that as you re migrating away from that traditional ul product that was a good support item in the context of the strain line would these new products have will they have similar propensity to help that line item and the source of earnings dean connor president and chief executive officer this product would have similar strength of the ul product it s an interesting product in that it s the cycle ultimately it s a very low capital intensive product so we think that could be quite favorable steve theriault eight capital analyst okay the last thing for me was also in asia but on the wealth side i think kevin you mentioned in your opening remarks about was it philippines money market but the last few quarters the sales have been more like 2 billion versus 3 billion when you look back to prior run rates i think that s right anyway how much of that is that sort of money market noise that s not all that impactful to the margin how much of it is potentially just slower wealth sales that have been offset by some strong insurance sales over the last little bit claude accum president of sun life financial asia it s claude accum here i would be happy to go with that first as you point out wealth sales were down in q1 they re down by 1 9 billion about 1 3 billion of that is actually coming from india and about 300 million from the philippines in india what you re seeing is industry sales are actually down about 50 and that s similar to us and that s due to the indian markets where mid cap is down 3 small cap is down 14 and so that s impacting the india markets in the philippines the 300 million decrease was mainly in money market sales and that was more in the institutional space due to a large institutional sale in the prior year so that s not retail our wealth sales are basically following what s happening in the equity markets as kevin has indicated six of our eight countries are down significantly year over year but as the market rebounded and we saw that in q1 we did see an uptick in march and so we think our wealth sales will follow the equity market cycle steve theriault eight capital analyst okay thanks for that color operator your next question comes from tom mackinnon from bmo capital markets thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks i was wondering if you might be able to split out what the expected profit is in asia between asia proper i ll say and then international because it s kind of different stories one is a complete high net worth and another is a growth in the emerging middle class would you be able to share with us proportionately how the expected profit might split between those two dean connor president and chief executive officer we haven t separated those two out tom we can think about that going forward and how we want to disclose these but we ve included just the one item on the source of earnings i think if you thought about my broader comments you can think about the local markets in asia and focus on growth and getting the growth up and what really impacted them this time was the fee income on the markets in terms of the expected profit in international the sales don t have a significant impact on changing that that s over a longer term that that would impact those pieces but we haven t separated out the two thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst okay then if i go to the u s employee benefits or the u s group benefits the margin obviously better at 7 9 probably helped by the great mortality morbidity experience you had in the quarter in your 6 5 target are their policyholder experience gains mortality or morbidity gains in that 6 5 and if so how much do you need in order to hit that daniel fishbein president of sun life financial united states tom this is dan fishbein we recently updated our target to 7 plus and we don t assume explicit morbidity or mortality gains in order achieve that we price for the margins that we re seeking to achieve as i mentioned earlier in stop loss for example we ve been able to be very successful pricing for those margins the margin in the first quarter on a trailing 12 month basis was obviously very much benefited by favorable morbidity experience in the stop loss business thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst okay that s great you assume zero the final thing with respect to canada years ago we had a career sales force that was probably growing i don t know modestly and now if you look over the last several years this career sales force continues to decline strategically it used to be a good par sales and maybe a mutual fund sales machine strategically what s happening here with the sun life career sales force down 8 in 2017 8 in 2018 and then another 5 year over year jacques goulet president of sun life financial canada thanks for the question tom this is jacques you re right 5 this last time i ll take you back perhaps 18 months to 24 months because we changed our focus a little bit one from i would say just recruiting more advisors to one of improving the overall client and advisor experience right that s met a lot of changes in terms of the digital experience that we re delivering so that ultimately our advisors can work more effectively with their clients deliver a better quality product and so on the other thing i would say is it s not shown in a numbers but because of the increased focus on quality tom we ve been putting the bar higher on the number of recruits and so we re recruiting and quite a few less than we used to and those that we do it s the fail pass process in a way we tend to recognize faster if they re going to make it or not but if you d split the number of advisors into two buckets and let s say you define these buckets as more experienced advisors versus newer more developing advisors you d find that actually were kind of flat on the experienced advisors that support this a strategy that i was telling you about strategically speaking i ll remind you that we are focused on two different channels career sales force is very strategic for us but so is the third party the sales continue to be good if you go back seven or eight quarters we re either number one or number two we were number one for the full year 2018 when we look out we ve said that at investor day if you remember but we have a point of view generally that canadians are insufficiently insured so we think the model we have is a pretty good one and in terms of the csf as said very focused on digital and technology and bringing tools to our advisors it s stabilizing so we think that you ll see a decreasing numbers there in terms of headcount decrease thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst okay thanks for that operator our last question is from mario mendonca from td securities your line is open mario mendonca td securities analyst good afternoon can we just go back to the u s expected profit and let s exclude mfs for a moment it does look like on a u s dollar basis it was flat year over year and i m trying to piece together what we re seeing here because it doesn t look like it s a margin story necessarily it looks maybe like it s more around the asset growth side and the reason i m going at this is because what we are instead seeing instead of the expected profit growth we re seeing the experience gains emerge so strongly is that really where you d guide us that we really should be piecing those two together dean connor president and chief executive officer i might be able to start because i ve got the detail thing front of me and i ll give dan a chance to talk about the other piece but you have to remember mario there s a couple of other pieces inside of the u s including individual insurance which is a runoff business so you see an expected profit that ll come down a little bit over time and there was a small negative in business group capital it may be a little counterintuitive because it doesn t relate directly back to the group benefits piece on the group benefits piece we saw a growth in stop loss that really supported the overall growth in group benefits expected profit daniel fishbein president of sun life financial united states you ll see some additional growth and expected profit in the second quarter because the way we record this is in the quarter when business is effective it s recorded as new business gain and then it transitions over to expected profit in the subsequent quarters so with such large stop loss sales this past january 1st which was part of the first quarter you re seeing that phenomenon and then we ll see some of that switchover next quarter mario mendonca td securities analyst okay i think that s sort of clarifies it for me if we could think a little bit about experience then and just on the total company basis there were a few items there that threw me off first the other the minus 35 million i think last quarter you gave us a good understanding what was in the positive 38 million have you spoken yet to the minus 35 million i may have missed it i m not sure kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah mario this is kevin morrissey i ll talk a bit about the other we had losses this quarter of 18 million and so that s more in line with what we would expect on a going forward basis and that s similar to what i had said a couple quarters ago what we re seeing in that line are some of the shorter term strategy costs build out of our wealth strategy and digital projects in canada some of that in the u s is related to maxwell health and in the corporate line we also have some projects then related to the ifrs 17 project those totals of about minus 18 million that s more in line with what we d expect in a normal quarter mario mendonca td securities analyst those are minus 18 million so there was just other stuff going on that got you to minus 35 million then kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah mario mendonca td securities analyst sorry i just don t follow you were offering me an explanation of how it got to minus 18 million but the number is minus 35 million is there anything else you can offer kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer the minus 18 million is the after tax number mario mario mendonca td securities analyst i m sorry kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah minus 18 million is the after tax for the quarter mario mendonca td securities analyst i misunderstood kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah mario mendonca td securities analyst okay i totally understand now the investment activities were also very strong is this just a number that we ll see bounce around based on the opportunities to invest the proceeds of sales or new business essentially kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think that s the way to think about that mario that s a little higher than our typical run rate but we were able to deploy some pfi investments with higher spreads against some of our liability segments and that drove the gains kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah and mario it s kevin morrissey i may just add to that you are right that it s going to bounce around a bit with the volume of new business sales as well and so where we have big annuity sales in the quarter you might expect to see that a little lighter in the in force but we continue to source good volumes with good spreads to put against the liabilities kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer if you looked at the total of experience notables 57 million in the quarter the last eight quarters have averaged around 42 million so it is a little higher in total despite the fact that we had the pg e impact in the quarter mario mendonca td securities analyst that s helpful thank you again operator your next question comes from darko mihelic from rbc capital markets darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst hi thank you i just wanted to look for a little more color on the indirect exposure to pg e it surprised me a little bit in the quarter and i guess what i mean by color is i don t really understand where you sit today in other words you downgraded some of these credits by how much what happens next quarter do they go up do they go back down again what is the prospect for more hits coming from this then i guess because i have to go back all the way to q1 2010 to find credit experience of this magnitude for sun life and so on a broader question i guess the question is should i be tracking bankruptcy s for further sort of downgrades and credit experience i guess essentially what i m asking is the upgrade to downgrade ratio that you had this quarter how far off from normal is it maybe i ll just stop talking there and you can provide us with a little more color on this so that i can better prepare for the future randolph brown chief investment officer sure it s randy thank you for the question we have as you know no direct exposure to pacific gas and electric but rather these indirect exposures in the corporate loan book these are renewable energy power agreements where they purchase the power coming off of these production units we downgraded them internally based upon the public bankruptcy of pacific gas and electric and the reason we do that is the rating methodology that we ve used is standard and it is a combination of expected loss and probability of default while we feel economically we have many levels of protection we d have to burn through because we are quite secured in these cash flows the probability of default rose which led to an internal downgrade and therefore strengthening of the reserve if you were to exclude this one name we actually had more upgrade than downgrade and had one of our best credit quarters in quite a long time it is fairly idiosyncratic in nature darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst given that there was a bankruptcy that caused this is this credit now considered also in default even though it s current is there a further downside possibility what happens next if they go through the bankruptcy proceedings does it come back to haunt you later on or does it actually get upgraded i m just curious on where we sit today with respect to this credit dean connor president and chief executive officer from where we sit today it s definitely a complicated workout which we think will take several years pg e is current in all their payments on these contracts and our holdings are all current so that s why you re seeing no impairments on these in terms of the future path as i said there are multiple layers of protection in a bankruptcy and in certain states in particular anything can happen but we think that the probable course is a fairly protracted workout where we think economically we should recover if that s the case you would see these being written up over time if for some reason things turn materially negative which again is not what we expect there is potentially downside on them remember they are producing energy and californians need energy so that s not going away they re producing renewable energy and california has mandated 33 of all of their energy in state will be provided by renewables by 2020 moving up to 100 by 2045 remember these are long dated project so they re not going away then the payments are being passed through to the cost to the ratepayers so it s a complicated situation but based on every piece of analysis we ve done to date we think that it should work out favorably kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer darko it s kevin i think it might help if kevin morrissey talks about how the downgrade impacts the liabilities because this ends up being a significant portion of the investment as well kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary sure darko it s kevin morrissey here when the securities aren t downgraded the actual reserves pick up an increased risk margin in these provisions in the future as randy noted they re quite long term securities so the reserving impacts the present valuing of this extra risk margin over extended periods of time and so that s part of what s contributing to the severity of the impact in the quarter darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay but i guess i don t want to keep beating this dead horse too much longer but it was just a one notch downgrade i don t know this sounds like it must be a large exposure and i guess what s the ultimate worst case scenario randolph brown chief investment officer it s randy darko no internally we had a multiple notch downgrade that we did we have a standard methodology and that s what came out of the probability to default and the expected loss calculation there s a wide range of potential outcomes within any rating as we ve said so it s not that the position itself was in any way particularly outsized for our balance sheet it was the multiple notch downgrade given the duration and the reserving methodology darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay that s very helpful that s what i was searching for great thank you very much operator your next question comes from tom mackinnon from bmo capital markets thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks just a quick follow up i think just to confirm i think you talked about a target licat at sla of 120 and maybe a leverage target of 25 and of the 2 5 billion at the hold co if you can confirm those and at the 2 5 billion at the hold co how much would you be prepared to take that down to 500 million at the lowest level thanks kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer tom it s kevin yeah we ve talked about a leverage target of 25 that s correct and we ve talked about keeping a 500 million cash buffer so that second part is also correct we haven t given our licat target ratio there are a lot of assumptions out there that i know different analysts have been making but we have not given a specific target around that but we have given the cash which is how we look at our capital position at the hold co we ve also talked at investor day how much additional cash we d get from going to our target of 25 leverage and then how much in addition to that we could get if we went up to 30 we have significant capital flexibility and the other thing we look at when we think about capital we look at our capital sensitivity and the strength of the capital in terms of sensitivities improve significantly with the movement to licat and that also gives us confidence in different scenarios i think the right way to look at it is that the cash of the hold co 2 5 million and thinking about 500 million to be held as a buffer and then the leverage position and we can move up on the cash thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst okay thank you operator that was our last question at this time i will turn the call back over to greg dilworth for closing remarks gregory dilworth vice president of investor relations thanks mike i would like

today for our third quarter fiscal year 2019 conference call i will begin with a brief discussion of our operations then our cfo chuck barrantes will provide our financial overview and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year following his remarks we will open the call up for questions we continue to be extremely pleased with our solid operational and financial performance as all of our companies continue to perform at a high level the strong momentum we experienced in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter making the ninth consecutive quarter where we delivered year over year growth in adjusted ebitda our north american leasing operations continue to see strong demand across virtually of its end markets with total revenue in the third quarter increasing by 10 year over year and leasing revenues increased by 12 driven by an increase in unit growth higher average lease rates and higher fleet utilization across most of our product lines during the quarter we are very proud of these outstanding results advertisement advertisement our core portable storage business again continues to perform at the high end of our expectation driven by solid execution and broad based demand across the majority of the end markets ground level offices and storage containers continue to show very high demand as these two product lines generated a combination year over year rental revenue increase of 29 over which was organic growth taking into account all pac van product lines organic rental revenue growth was 15 for the quarter and 17 year to date our team continues to do a great job executing on a number of initiatives particularly our national account program and our recently introduced pv3 safety containers which together accounted for approximately 15 of the year over year growth in rental revenue pac van continues to be highly regarded by its customers and once again posted a world class net promoter score of 83 in the last 12 months in addition to organic growth we remain focused on building the pac van brand throughout north america by geographically expanding our portable storage container business during the quarter we completed one acquisition in fort worth texas increasing our presence in that dynamic state we also opened a greenfield location in panama city florida adding our 8th branch in the southeast region this week we completed an acquisition of a portable storage business in kentucky adding three locations to the three already in kentucky we continue to serve just over half of the top 100 msas in the u s including 39 of the top 50 and our acquisition pipeline remains healthy our liquid containment business in north america delivered slightly improved the year over year results as we have seen some moderation in leasing activity in texas while oil and gas production in both basins remain healthy we were impacted in the quarter by certain customers consolidating their field personnel due to recent acquisition activity as well as the normal seasonal slowdown combined with some pipeline availability challenges with some of our customers in the permian all indicators point to continued healthy production activity in both basins in the foreseeable future our overall business remains strong but it s not operating at the peak level we were experiencing last fall our north american manufacturing operations post a slightly positive adjusted ebitda during the quarter as sales to external customers declined from reduced sales of specialty tanks and chassis but we expect activity to increase in fourth quarter as the backlog is very strong now turning to our asia pacific region advertisement advertisement our asia pacific region continued its positive momentum by delivering third quarter growth in leasing revenues of 11 on a local currency basis up from 9 growth last quarter and marking its 10th year over year increase out of the last 11 quarters sales revenues were down year over year in local currency mostly due to one large sale that occurred last year in third quarter that wasn t repeated this year total reported revenues during the quarter in u s dollar were adversely impacted by an approximate 9 decline in average australian dollar exchange rate between periods the increase in royal wolf s leasing revenues was spread across almost all of the end markets with noticeable increases in transportation construction consumer and industrial sectors the growth has mainly been driven by increases in average units on lease combined with average lease rates our team remains focused on building upon its leading market position across the region through a combination of organic growth greenfield openings and the extent they become available accretive acquisitions to conclude we continue to see both organic growth and expansion opportunities in north america as well as ability to strengthen our market leadership in the asia pacific region as always we ll remain disciplined in our capital allocation our performance year to date positions us well to finish the year strong while also providing us with a solid foundation for continued growth in the fiscal year 2020 i ll now turn over the call to chuck barrantes for his financial review and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks jody we intend on filing our annual report on form 10 q shortly at which time this document will be available on both the sec s edgar filing system and on our website and i encourage investors and other interested parties to read it as it contains a substantial amount of information about our company some of which we will discuss today turning to our fiscal third quarter financial results total revenues were 86 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 84 4 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 an increase of 2 leasing revenues were 59 6 million an increase of approximately 9 over the prior year s quarter and comprised 70 of total non manufacturing revenues for the quarter versus 67 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 non manufacturing sales revenues were 25 2 million in the quarter down from 27 3 million in the third quarter of the prior year in our north american leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totals 57 2 million compared with 51 8 million for the year ago period an increase of 10 increases occurred across most sectors but primarily in the construction commercial and oil and gas sectors revenues at our north american manufacturing operations for the third quarter were 27 point 2 7 million excuse me including intercompany sales of 1 3 million for our north american leasing operations this compares to 3 2 million of total sales for the year ago period including intercompany sales of 922 000 as jody mentioned our manufacturing operations experienced reduced demand for specialty tanks and other steel related products particularly chassis in our asia pacific leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totaled 27 6 million compared to 30 3 million for the year ago period a decrease of 9 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in utility sector as one large sale totaling 1 8 million which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was not repeated this year and as jody mentioned an approximate 9 decline in the australian dollar between the periods leasing revenues increased by approximately 1 on a year over year basis and 11 on a local currency basis driven mainly by increases in the transportation construction industrial and consumer sectors consolidated adjusted ebitda was 24 1 million in the quarter compared to 21 9 million in the prior year s quarter an increase of 10 advertisement advertisement and adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of total revenues was 28 up from 26 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as jody stated this was the ninth consecutive quarter of year over year adjusted ebitda growth in north america adjusted ebitda for our leasing operations was 17 3 million in the third quarter compared to 15 2 million for the year ago quarter an increase of 14 adjusted ebitda at pac van was 12 2 million up 20 year over year and lone star s adjusted ebitda was 5 1 million up 2 from the prior year for our manufacturing operations on a stand alone basis adjusted ebitda was 17 000 for the quarter compared to 111 000 in last year s third quarter asia pacific s adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was 8 1 million compared to 7 6 million in the year ago period an increase of approximately 7 on a local currency basis adjusted ebitda increased by approximately 17 interest expense for the third quarter was up 10 2 million an increase of 800 000 from the year ago period the increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense in the asia pacific area due to a 1 2 million fee on the prepayment of the bison capital term note which resulted in a higher weighted average interest rate of 13 7 versus 10 4 in the year ago period and was partially offset by lower average borrowings and a weaker australian dollar between the periods during the quarter we completed we completely repaid the over 60 million bison capital senior note in the asia pacific area replacing this higher cost debt with lower cost borrowings on an amended and expanded syndicated credit facility led by deutsche bank ag this move is expected to generate interest savings of over 3 million per year net loss attributable to common stockholders in the third quarter was 1 3 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to net loss of 1 5 million or 0 06 per share in the year ago quarter included in these results were noncash charges of 1 1 million and 504 000 in fiscal year 2019 and 18 respectively for the change in valuation of the stand alone bifurcated derivatives in our asia pacific convertible note both periods include 922 000 for dividends paid on our preferred stock for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 we generated free cash flow before fleet activity of 35 7 million compared to 32 2 million in the prior year period an increase of 11 now turning to our balance sheet advertisement advertisement at march 31 the company had a net leverage ratio of four times for the trailing 12 months an improvement from 4 6 times at june 30 2018 the reduction in leverage is due to a combination of factors including the forced conversion of the convertible note at royal wolf and our strong financial performance turning to our companywide outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 based on our year to date results we remain confident that consolidated revenues for the fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 370 million to 390 million and the consolidated adjusted ebitda will increase by 20 to 25 in fiscal year 19 from fiscal year 18 this outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 this now concludes our prepared comments and i would like to turn the call back to the operator for the question and answer session questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of brent thielman of d a davidson advertisement advertisement brent thielman d a davidson analyst on the outlook to get to the upper end of that ebitda guidance range you need to see a pretty sizable increase in ebitda from 3q to 4q can you get there even with the liquid containment business sort of sideways here jody miller president and chief executive officer i think a lot of it will depend on the energy side we had a little bit more of a hit we knew some of the challenges coming but through the consolidation and the pipeline issues and everything else it appears it s picking up i don t know if it ll pick up quite enough to make up the gap our core business in the u s as we stated on the call is doing exceptionally well with our containerized fleet growing at 29 for the year but it s probably not enough to make up the top of the range for the energy side and then the australian dollar s really hurting us at a 9 year over year as well so it ll be a little bit tough to get up to the top of the range charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer look brent as jody mentioned earlier on the call i mean it s we re still doing very well in the permian it s just not shooting at all levels it was early part of the year but we do still expect to have year over year growth in q4 so like anything else it s always at a point in time so we re still very very optimistic and on the future in that sector in our business in north america brent thielman d a davidson analyst sure and yes i mean jody it sounds like things are picking up i ll assume that means well but you ve seen some changes since the end of the quarter in that business out there jody miller president and chief executive officer yes correct brent thielman d a davidson analyst ok and then chuck were there additional costs that showed up in the interest line this quarter relative to the paydown at bison capital charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean that s very taking brent s side maybe didn t seem clearly but in the quarter we had about 1 2 million 1 3 million of a prepayment fee on the full repayment of the bison term note so that was the reason for the primary increase brent thielman d a davidson analyst and now it s ok got it got it ok then maybe just last question jody the business in australia i mean obviously doing really well it s evident in the numbers i guess i m just kind of curious what the boots on the ground are telling you just with all the noise around china obviously that has an impact on the economy there i guess what are you seeing from a demand perspective jody miller president and chief executive officer yes not much of a change to be honest the construction sector s still doing really well as we said before everything in australia is moved with containers right all the freight so our freight business is still very good they still got to get product in and out all the major cities the bnc and stackable solutions are getting more accepted and growing and that s still our fastest growing segment so all indications show that it s still going to be strong we got double digit growth in leasing which i think is exceptional we had a couple large sales that didn t repeat this year we also as you guys would probably remember we have a large majority of camps setting that are getting deployed currently there s a big chunk of them going to a project that will help as well so i think there s good optimism in this coming quarter operator our next question comes from the line of scott schneeberger of oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company inc analyst let s go back just following on a bunch of things that were just discussed in texas how would you classify your visibility there given the slightly changing dynamic with regard to volume and with regard to pricing jody miller president and chief executive officer yes so i don t think we ll see the pricing increases that we ve seen the first half of the year i think it s kind of flattened out the price of oil is still fine i think with the consolidation happening right now and some of that obviously they re not buying companies to taper that off long term but there s a little bit of a stall while they catch their breath the drill rigs are down slightly so completions and some of the other things are kind of catching their breath but i look for those to kind of stay stable and gradually pick back up so there s a little bit more happening then there was in the past don t have the crystal ball to say this is what it s going to be we had scheduled out three to six months on some of our customers and some of those are changing a little bit long term we think it ll work its way out and everything will be fine but i think there s just this the last three months and maybe now it seems to be kind of picking back up and being a little more positive than it has been the last three or four months scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company inc analyst right appreciate that it s helpful i want to go back to swing factors i was asking in the context of what how you could finish the fiscal year but just in that light but also in the quarter itself how much of an impact did the australian dollar have relative to what you were expecting at the start of the quarter i m just curious what kind of a swing factor that was in the quarter itself charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no we the australia dollar for the quarter pretty much performed what we had expected we were looking at around 0 71 and that s what it was going to q4 the australian dollar s dipped down a little bit i think it was below 0 70 so we re getting obviously some negative impact on the translation of the dollar not on the economics locally but for the quarter it was what we expected but 9 reduction compared to the prior year third quarter scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company inc analyst all right appreciate that color and then a last thing on pac van looking really good and hearing from some of your competitors recently the same the trends are what we re hearing there too so jody just how do you feel about visibility there and kind of the same question i was asking about texas lone star the pricing the volume and the sustainability there jody miller president and chief executive officer yes i think the core portable storage side is extremely strong i think still year to date it s 17 organic which i think is just awesome they re doing a great job there i think some of the new innovation national accounts and things that we have implemented i think will continue there and we see nothing but a positive forecast in our core business the tank or liquid storage side in texas and also on the pac van side pricing is doing very very well as well we re getting nice increases and continue to be very consistent on the lone star side as i said earlier i think pricing s kind of flattened out where we were raising prices the first half maybe not quite as much visibility into the short term future with some of the things that are happening with consolidation they re starting to get their pipeline challenges worked out so we still feel very optimistic about it but in the short term maybe not quite as clear as we ve seen the last year but still very optimistic in the long haul operator our next question comes from the line of luis hernandez an investor unknown speaker all right the first one on the refi of the bison loan that one was around 11 or 12 and right charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes 12 unknown speaker sorry go ahead charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no no 11 9 12 was the unknown speaker and the refinancing is what was at what rate roughly charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer it s with the deutsche bank rate so it s somewhere not quite the senior facility rates but around 6 level unknown speaker ok but i guess that s pretty good news there then on the on pac van which segments are you most more optimistic on over the next 12 18 months jody miller president and chief executive officer yes luis i think it s honestly across the board if we look at our growth we break it out by segment all segments are doing very well i think construction looks very positive i think our national accounts is probably the most optimistic opportunity for us some of our new product innovation is helping with all segments but it s really across the board i think we re outgrowing obviously the industry but i think everything looks very optimistic in the core business unknown speaker ok all right great then the other next question would be on do you expect a higher level of free cash flow on in q4 i mean these first nine months chuck you said 30 million 36 million roughly 35 7 million do you expect sort of a bump on q4 just maybe some coming from free from working capital or something charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i think luis just by the fact that on the refinance of bison capital we should get a nice pick up from there just some free cash flow and yes i do expect free cash flow to pick up unknown speaker ok all right and finally on pac van just to basic little details have you grown the fleet at all jody miller president and chief executive officer yes yes we re running about 80 utilization so obviously there s branches that are running short we continue to that s a big part of our organic number right so we re 17 organic so when you re running close to that 80 more we definitely have added to the fleet unknown speaker yes because you were roughly around 4 000 tanks just wanted to know if you had grown those kinds at all jody miller president and chief executive officer no it s all been core storage and glo our glo still leads our growth percentage and then storage containers are next those are two high growth products we have not really we ve not added anything on the tank side and very little in any other categories charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer so luis in north america last year at march 31 2018 we had about a total lease fleet including 4 000 something frac tanks about 43 000 in at the end of the march this current third quarter we re at 51 500 unknown speaker ok yes i when i asked the fleet i meant the tank fleet not jody miller president and chief executive officer tanks have not grown significant at all last march we had total tanks in north america 4 146 and we have 4 216 now unknown speaker ok so it s pretty much roughly the same slightly above all right that s good and then on the rates on the tanks versus 2014 we always check that number how is that the pickup or the relationship of that charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer the rates on which product are you unknown speaker on the tanks on the oil tanks charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and so last year third quarter average rate was about for the quarter was 805 versus a little over 900 this quarter this third quarter unknown speaker ok so 900 and then the versus 2014 rates charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer we re still well behind not even close to the peak of those rates i d have to look and see that i would state still 30 40 under what we were at that time unknown speaker right so maybe 70 of the rates ok jody miller president and chief executive officer yes or a little less operator our next question comes from the line of brian gagnon of gagnon securities brian gagnon gagnon securities analyst i m looking at the repayment of the bison note and you got hit with 1 2 million in q3 and it looks to me like your savings going forward is something on the order of 700 000 or 800 000 a quarter so can i think about the fourth quarter having an automatic 2 million increase versus where you were in q3 on interest charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i would think that s fair operator and there are no other questions at this time i would now like to turn the call over to mr jody miller president and ceo for closing remarks please go ahead mr miller jody miller president and chief executive officer thank you operator appreciate you joining us today and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter operator duration 31 minutes call participants charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer jody

intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions the company presents these non gaap financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans non gaap income loss from operations non gaap net income loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and non gaap ebitda reflect the company s ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period to period comparisons free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from jd digits related credit

the use of the non gaap financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the company s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does if they so choose the company also believes that the non gaap financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses gain loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the company s core operating results and business outlook the non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools the company s non gaap financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the company s operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures further these non gaap measures may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including peer companies and therefore their comparability may be limited the company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non gaap financial measures to the nearest u s gaap performance measure all of which should be considered when evaluating performance the company encourages you to review the company s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure contacts investor relations

forward dundee precious metals inc dpm or the company today reported first quarter net loss attributable to common shareholders of 1 5 million 0 01 per share compared to net earnings attributable to common shareholders of 2 7 million 0 02 per share for the same period in 2018 net earnings loss attributable to common shareholders in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were impacted by several items not reflective of the company s underlying operating performance including unrealized gains on commodity price hedges that prior to the adoption of ifrs 9 in 2018 did not receive hedge accounting treatment and net gains and losses on sabina special warrants which are excluded from adjusted net earnings loss 1 adjusted net loss 1 in the first quarter of 2019 was 1 6 million 0 01 per share compared to adjusted net earnings of 0 6 million nil per share for the same period in 2018 this decrease was due primarily to higher chelopech treatment charges related to unfavourable final settlements of provisionally priced concentrate sales the mark to market impact related to strong share price performance and a higher cost per tonne of gold copper concentrate produced and sold reflecting lower copper grades partially offset by higher volumes of complex concentrate smelted higher volumes of payable gold in concentrate sold as a result of higher gold grades in concentrate sold and a stronger u s dollar relative to the zar and euro adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda 1 during the first quarter of 2019 was 16 7 million compared to 19 5 million in the corresponding period in 2018 reflecting the same factors affecting adjusted net earnings loss except for depreciation interest and income taxes which are excluded from adjusted ebitda production in the first quarter of 2019 gold contained in concentrate produced decreased by 25 to 43 034 ounces and copper production decreased by 13 to 8 0 million in each case relative to the corresponding period in 2018 these decreases were due primarily to lower grades at chelopech in line with its 2019 mine plan chelopech remains on track to meet its 2019 production guidance complex concentrate smelted during the first quarter of 2019 of 62 822 tonnes was 16 higher than the corresponding period in 2018 due primarily to strong performance and a steady state of operations at tsumeb this is a record first quarter performance where seasonal power grid instability typically impacts operations a concern that was successfully mitigated during the quarter deliveries in the first quarter of 2019 payable gold in concentrate sold increased by 13 to 39 559 ounces and payable copper increased by 4 to 6 3 million pounds in each case relative to the corresponding period in 2018 the increase in payable gold was due primarily to higher gold grades in the concentrate sold in 2019 cost measures cost of sales in the first quarter of 2019 of 64 7 million was comparable to the corresponding period in 2018 the favourable impact of a stronger u s dollar relative to the zar and euro offset the higher cost per tonne of gold copper concentrate produced and sold at chelopech reflecting lower copper grades and higher local currency expenses at tsumeb this increase was due primarily to higher employment costs as a result of higher performance based compensation and annual increases in line with local inflation and higher rates for fuel partially offset by the benefits of cost savings initiatives which resulted in a decrease in contractor and consultant expenses all in sustaining cost per ounce of gold in the first quarter of 2019 of 817 was 121 higher than the corresponding period in 2018 due primarily to a higher cost per tonne of gold copper concentrate produced and sold and higher allocated corporate general and

corresponding period in 2018 sustaining capital expenditures 1 incurred during the first quarter of 2019 were 2 5 million compared to 5 3 million in the corresponding period in 2018 due primarily to the timing of executing planned projects krumovgrad project bulgaria as at march 31 2019 construction of the project was substantially completed initial operations are going well with first concentrate production achieved during the first quarter as planned achievement of commercial production and commencement of the depreciation of invested capital is on track and is expected to begin

facilities and to support the current 18 month ausmelt operating cycle and the planned move to 24 months in the next campaign which would significantly increase average annual throughput and defer the next furnace rebuild to 2021 volumes of complex concentrate smelted in the second half of 2019 are expected to be lower than the first half due to the maintenance shutdown which is planned to take place in the fourth quarter at the completion of the current 18 month ausmelt campaign krumovgrad as at march 31 2019 approximately 152 million has been incurred and with an additional 12 million to 14 million forecast for 2019 the aggregate cost of the project is expected to be between 164 million and 166 million compared to the original estimate of 178 million gold contained in concentrate produced is expected to be between 55 000 and 75 000 ounces in 2019 there is significant operating flexibility given the various grades of current stockpiles which is expected to reduce the impact of potential delays in ramp up during the first quarter of 2019 the company amended its prepaid forward gold sales arrangement shifting the first six months of deliveries scheduled from may 2019 to october 2019 to november 2019 to april 2020 such that 46 210 ounces will now be delivered over a 15 month period commencing november 2019 representing approximately 14 of expected gold deliveries during this period with approximately 75 of the deliveries occurring in 2020 minerp dpm does not anticipate a material contribution to earnings or cash flow from minerp operating results in 2019 given that it is in a growth ramp up phase but does expect to see an increase in new customers based on its pipeline of prospective new customers chelopech anticipates finalizing the implementation of minerp s planning software early in the third quarter of 2019 which is expected to support further optimization initiatives being developed in the smart center and integration into a new business planning system currently under development exploration expenditures related to exploration in 2019 are expected to range between 12 million and 14 million in line with 2018 spending the 2019 budget is being used to fund major drilling programs at chelopech consisting of 10 000 metres of underground drilling on the sebpz and 7 000 metres of surface drilling at the krasta prospect and other near mine targets around chelopech as well as drill programs at krumovgrad on the concession and on nearby exploration licenses for a total 8 900 metres a further 2 000 metres is planned for exploration

joining us today for our third quarter fiscal year 2019 conference call i will begin with a brief discussion of our operations then our cfo chuck barrantes will provide our financial overview and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year following his remarks we will open the call up for questions we continue to be extremely pleased with our solid operational and financial performance as all of our companies continue to perform at a high level the strong momentum we experienced in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter making the ninth consecutive quarter where we delivered year over year growth in adjusted ebitda our north american leasing operations continue to see strong demand across virtually of its end markets with total revenue in the third quarter increasing by 10 year over year and leasing revenues increased by 12 driven by an increase in unit growth higher average lease rates and higher fleet utilization across most of our product lines during the quarter we are very proud of these outstanding results our core portable storage business again continues to perform at the high end of our expectation driven by solid execution and broad based demand across the majority of the end markets ground level offices and storage containers continue to show very high demand as these two product lines generated a combination year over year rental revenue increase of 29 over which was organic growth taking into account all pac van product lines organic rental revenue growth was 15 for the quarter and 17 year to date our team continues to do a great job executing on a number of initiatives particularly our national account program and our recently introduced pv3 safety containers which together accounted for approximately 15 of the year over year growth in rental revenue pac van continues to be highly regarded by its customers and once again posted a world class net promoter score of 83 in the last 12 months in addition to organic growth we remain focused on building the pac van brand throughout north america by geographically expanding our portable storage container business during the quarter we completed one acquisition in fort worth texas increasing our presence in that dynamic state we also opened a greenfield location in panama city florida adding our 8th branch in the southeast region this week we completed an acquisition of a portable storage business in kentucky adding three locations to the three already in kentucky we continue to serve just over half of the top 100 msas in the u s including 39 of the top 50 and our acquisition pipeline remains healthy our liquid containment business in north america delivered slightly improved the year over year results as we have seen some moderation in leasing activity in texas while oil and gas production in both basins remain healthy we were impacted in the quarter by certain customers consolidating their field personnel due to recent acquisition activity as well as the normal seasonal slowdown combined with some pipeline availability challenges with some of our customers in the permian all indicators point to continued healthy production activity in both basins in the foreseeable future our overall business remains strong but it s not operating at the peak level we were experiencing last fall our north american manufacturing operations post a slightly positive adjusted ebitda during the quarter as sales to external customers declined from reduced sales of specialty tanks and chassis but we expect activity to increase in fourth quarter as the backlog is very strong now turning to our asia pacific region our asia pacific region continued its positive momentum by delivering third quarter growth in leasing revenues of 11 on a local currency basis up from 9 growth last quarter and marking its 10th year over year increase out of the last 11 quarters sales revenues were down year over year in local currency mostly due to one large sale that occurred last year in third quarter that wasn t repeated this year total reported revenues during the quarter in u s dollar were adversely impacted by an approximate 9 decline in average australian dollar exchange rate between periods the increase in royal wolf s leasing revenues was spread across almost all of the end markets with noticeable increases in transportation construction consumer and industrial sectors the growth has mainly been driven by increases in average units on lease combined with average lease rates our team remains focused on building upon its leading market position across the region through a combination of organic growth greenfield openings and the extent they become available accretive acquisitions to conclude we continue to see both organic growth and expansion opportunities in north america as well as ability to strengthen our market leadership in the asia pacific region as always we ll remain disciplined in our capital allocation our performance year to date positions us well to finish the year strong while also providing us with a solid foundation for continued growth in the fiscal year 2020 i ll now turn over the call to chuck barrantes for his financial review and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jody we intend on filing our annual report on form 10 q shortly at which time this document will be available on both the sec s edgar filing system and on our website and i encourage investors and other interested parties to read it as it contains a substantial amount of information about our company some of which we will discuss today turning to our fiscal third quarter financial results total revenues were 86 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 84 4 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 an increase of 2 leasing revenues were 59 6 million an increase of approximately 9 over the prior year s quarter and comprised 70 of total non manufacturing revenues for the quarter versus 67 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 non manufacturing sales revenues were 25 2 million in the quarter down from 27 3 million in the third quarter of the prior year in our north american leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totals 57 2 million compared with 51 8 million for the year ago period an increase of 10 increases occurred across most sectors but primarily in the construction commercial and oil and gas sectors revenues at our north american manufacturing operations for the third quarter were 27 point 2 7 million excuse me including intercompany sales of 1 3 million for our north american leasing operations this compares to 3 2 million of total sales for the year ago period including intercompany sales of 922 000 as jody mentioned our manufacturing operations experienced reduced demand for specialty tanks and other steel related products particularly chassis in our asia pacific leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totaled 27 6 million compared to 30 3 million for the year ago period a decrease of 9 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in utility sector as one large sale totaling 1 8 million which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was not repeated this year and as jody mentioned an approximate 9 decline in the australian dollar between the periods leasing revenues increased by approximately 1 on a year over year basis and 11 on a local currency basis driven mainly by increases in the transportation construction industrial and consumer sectors consolidated adjusted ebitda was 24 1 million in the quarter compared to 21 9 million in the prior year s quarter an increase of 10 and adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of total revenues was 28 up from 26 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as jody stated this was the ninth consecutive quarter of year over year adjusted ebitda growth in north america adjusted ebitda for our leasing operations was 17 3 million in the third quarter compared to 15 2 million for the year ago quarter an increase of 14 adjusted ebitda at pac van was 12 2 million up 20 year over year and lone star s adjusted ebitda was 5 1 million up 2 from the prior year for our manufacturing operations on a stand alone basis adjusted ebitda was 17 000 for the quarter compared to 111 000 in last year s third quarter asia pacific s adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was 8 1 million compared to 7 6 million in the year ago period an increase of approximately 7 on a local currency basis adjusted ebitda increased by approximately 17 interest expense for the third quarter was up 10 2 million an increase of 800 000 from the year ago period the increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense in the asia pacific area due to a 1 2 million fee on the prepayment of the bison capital term note which resulted in a higher weighted average interest rate of 13 7 versus 10 4 in the year ago period and was partially offset by lower average borrowings and a weaker australian dollar between the periods during the quarter we completed we completely repaid the over 60 million bison capital senior note in the asia pacific area replacing this higher cost debt with lower cost borrowings on an amended and expanded syndicated credit facility led by deutsche bank ag this move is expected to generate interest savings of over 3 million per year net loss attributable to common stockholders in the third quarter was 1 3 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to net loss of 1 5 million or 0 06 per share in the year ago quarter included in these results were noncash charges of 1 1 million and 504 000 in fiscal year 2019 and 18 respectively for the change in valuation of the stand alone bifurcated derivatives in our asia pacific convertible note both periods include 922 000 for dividends paid on our preferred stock for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 we generated free cash flow before fleet activity of 35 7 million compared to 32 2 million in the prior year period an increase of 11 now turning to our balance sheet at march 31 the company had a net leverage ratio of four times for the trailing 12 months an improvement from 4 6 times at june 30 2018 the reduction in leverage is due to a combination of factors including the forced conversion of the convertible note at royal wolf and our strong financial performance turning to our companywide outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 based on our year to date results we remain confident that consolidated revenues for the fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 370 million to 390 million and the consolidated adjusted ebitda will increase by 20 to 25 in fiscal year 19 from fiscal year 18 this outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 this now concludes our prepared comments and i would like to turn the call back to the operator for the question and answer session questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of brent thielman of d a davidson brent thielman d a davidson analyst on the outlook to get to the upper end of that ebitda guidance range you need to see a pretty sizable increase in ebitda from 3q to 4q can you get there even with the liquid containment business sort of sideways here jody miller president and chief executive officer i think a lot of it will depend on the energy side we had a little bit more of a hit we knew some of the challenges coming but through the consolidation and the pipeline issues and everything else it appears it s picking up i don t know if it ll pick up quite enough to make up the gap our core business in the u s as we stated on the call is doing exceptionally well with our containerized fleet growing at 29 for the year but it s probably not enough to make up the top of the range for the energy side and then the australian dollar s really hurting us at a 9 year over year as well so it ll be a little bit tough to get up to the top of the range charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer look brent as jody mentioned earlier on the call i mean it s we re still doing very well in the permian it s just not shooting at all levels it was early part of the year but we do still expect to have year over year growth in q4 so like anything else it s always at a point in time so we re still very very optimistic and on the future in that sector in our business in north america brent thielman d a davidson analyst sure and yes i mean jody it sounds like things are picking up i ll assume that means well but you ve seen some changes since the end of the quarter in that business out there jody miller president and chief executive officer yes correct brent thielman d a davidson analyst ok and then chuck were there additional costs that showed up in the interest line this quarter relative to the paydown at bison capital charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean that s very taking brent s side maybe didn t seem clearly but in the quarter we had about 1 2 million 1 3 million of a prepayment fee on the full repayment of the bison term note so that was the reason for the primary increase brent thielman d a davidson analyst and now it s ok got it got it ok then maybe just last question jody the business in australia i mean obviously doing really well it s evident in the numbers i guess i m just kind of curious what the boots on the ground are telling you just with all the noise around china obviously that has an impact on the economy there i guess what are you seeing from a demand perspective jody miller president and chief executive officer yes not much of a change to be honest the construction sector s still doing really well as we said before everything in australia is moved with containers right all the freight so our freight business is still very good they still got to get product in and out all the major cities the bnc and stackable solutions are getting more accepted and growing and that s still our fastest growing segment so all indications show that it s still going to be strong we got double digit growth in leasing which i think is exceptional we had a couple large sales that didn t repeat this year we also as you guys would probably remember we have a large majority of camps setting that are getting deployed currently there s a big chunk of them going to a project that will help as well so i think there s good optimism in this coming quarter operator our next question comes from the line of scott schneeberger of oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company inc analyst let s go back just following on a bunch of things that were just discussed in texas how would you classify your visibility there given the slightly changing dynamic with regard to volume and with regard to pricing jody miller president and chief executive officer yes so i don t think we ll see the pricing increases that we ve seen the first half of the year i think it s kind of flattened out the price of oil is still fine i think with the consolidation happening right now and some of that obviously they re not buying companies to taper that off long term but there s a little bit of a stall while they catch their breath the drill rigs are down slightly so completions and some of the other things are kind of catching their breath but i look for those to kind of stay stable and gradually pick back up so there s a little bit more happening then there was in the past don t have the crystal ball to say this is what it s going to be we had scheduled out three to six months on some of our customers and some of those are changing a little bit long term we think it ll work its way out and everything will be fine but i think there s just this the last three months and maybe now it seems to be kind of picking back up and being a little more positive than it has been the last three or four months scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company inc analyst right appreciate that it s helpful i want to go back to swing factors i was asking in the context of what how you could finish the fiscal year but just in that light but also in the quarter itself how much of an impact did the australian dollar have relative to what you were expecting at the start of the quarter i m just curious what kind of a swing factor that was in the quarter itself charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no we the australia dollar for the quarter pretty much performed what we had expected we were looking at around 0 71 and that s what it was going to q4 the australian dollar s dipped down a little bit i think it was below 0 70 so we re getting obviously some negative impact on the translation of the dollar not on the economics locally but for the quarter it was what we expected but 9 reduction compared to the prior year third quarter scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company inc analyst all right appreciate that color and then a last thing on pac van looking really good and hearing from some of your competitors recently the same the trends are what we re hearing there too so jody just how do you feel about visibility there and kind of the same question i was asking about texas lone star the pricing the volume and the sustainability there jody miller president and chief executive officer yes i think the core portable storage side is extremely strong i think still year to date it s 17 organic which i think is just awesome they re doing a great job there i think some of the new innovation national accounts and things that we have implemented i think will continue there and we see nothing but a positive forecast in our core business the tank or liquid storage side in texas and also on the pac van side pricing is doing very very well as well we re getting nice increases and continue to be very consistent on the lone star side as i said earlier i think pricing s kind of flattened out where we were raising prices the first half maybe not quite as much visibility into the short term future with some of the things that are happening with consolidation they re starting to get their pipeline challenges worked out so we still feel very optimistic about it but in the short term maybe not quite as clear as we ve seen the last year but still very optimistic in the long haul operator our next question comes from the line of luis hernandez an investor unknown speaker all right the first one on the refi of the bison loan that one was around 11 or 12 and right charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes 12 unknown speaker sorry go ahead charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no no 11 9 12 was the unknown speaker and the refinancing is what was at what rate roughly charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer it s with the deutsche bank rate so it s somewhere not quite the senior facility rates but around 6 level unknown speaker ok but i guess that s pretty good news there then on the on pac van which segments are you most more optimistic on over the next 12 18 months jody miller president and chief executive officer yes luis i think it s honestly across the board if we look at our growth we break it out by segment all segments are doing very well i think construction looks very positive i think our national accounts is probably the most optimistic opportunity for us some of our new product innovation is helping with all segments but it s really across the board i think we re outgrowing obviously the industry but i think everything looks very optimistic in the core business unknown speaker ok all right great then the other next question would be on do you expect a higher level of free cash flow on in q4 i mean these first nine months chuck you said 30 million 36 million roughly 35 7 million do you expect sort of a bump on q4 just maybe some coming from free from working capital or something charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i think luis just by the fact that on the refinance of bison capital we should get a nice pick up from there just some free cash flow and yes i do expect free cash flow to pick up unknown speaker ok all right and finally on pac van just to basic little details have you grown the fleet at all jody miller president and chief executive officer yes yes we re running about 80 utilization so obviously there s branches that are running short we continue to that s a big part of our organic number right so we re 17 organic so when you re running close to that 80 more we definitely have added to the fleet unknown speaker yes because you were roughly around 4 000 tanks just wanted to know if you had grown those kinds at all jody miller president and chief executive officer no it s all been core storage and glo our glo still leads our growth percentage and then storage containers are next those are two high growth products we have not really we ve not added anything on the tank side and very little in any other categories charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer so luis in north america last year at march 31 2018 we had about a total lease fleet including 4 000 something frac tanks about 43 000 in at the end of the march this current third quarter we re at 51 500 unknown speaker ok yes i when i asked the fleet i meant the tank fleet not jody miller president and chief executive officer tanks have not grown significant at all last march we had total tanks in north america 4 146 and we have 4 216 now unknown speaker ok so it s pretty much roughly the same slightly above all right that s good and then on the rates on the tanks versus 2014 we always check that number how is that the pickup or the relationship of that charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer the rates on which product are you unknown speaker on the tanks on the oil tanks charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and so last year third quarter average rate was about for the quarter was 805 versus a little over 900 this quarter this third quarter unknown speaker ok so 900 and then the versus 2014 rates charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer we re still well behind not even close to the peak of those rates i d have to look and see that i would state still 30 40 under what we were at that time unknown speaker right so maybe 70 of the rates ok jody miller president and chief executive officer yes or a little less operator our next question comes from the line of brian gagnon of gagnon securities brian gagnon gagnon securities analyst i m looking at the repayment of the bison note and you got hit with 1 2 million in q3 and it looks to me like your savings going forward is something on the order of 700 000 or 800 000 a quarter so can i think about the fourth quarter having an automatic 2 million increase versus where you were in q3 on interest charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i would think that s fair operator and there are no other questions at this time i would now like to turn the call over to mr jody miller president and ceo for closing remarks please go ahead mr miller jody miller president and chief executive officer thank you operator appreciate you joining us today and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter operator duration 31 minutes call participants charles barrantes

steve mnuchin us treasury secretary worrying about the national debt is so last decade image credit 2019 getty images amid all the talk of trade disputes and surprise tariff hikes this week markets paid little heed to something else going on something that hasn t happened since the dark days of 2009 something even more worrying that donald trump s tariff tweets subscribe to moneyweek subscribe

money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter don t miss the latest investment and personal finances news market analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter sign up a nasty surprise for us bond markets earlier this week the us treasury department sold 27bn worth of ten year treasury bonds at a bond auction what does that mean in english the us government said we need to borrow 27bn and we need to hang onto it for the next ten years investors then said we will lend you this money at x interest a year the us government took the best offers and gave the winners ious us government bonds also known as treasuries this happens all the time so what was significant about this particular auction well the issue is that on this occasion demand for the bonds was very low compared to usual people normally queue up to lend the us money because the us is such a good credit risk us treasuries are deemed to be pretty much the world s safest assets but this time the bid to cover ratio was extremely low at 2 17 that means that there was still twice as much demand for the bonds as there were bonds to go around but that s the lowest bid to cover since march 2009 reports bloomberg it could be a one off although it s worth noting that demand for 19bn worth of 30 year debt on thursday was also weak it could be that yields have fallen too low due to recent scares over trade and the global growth slowdown and simply weren t sufficiently attractive it could be to do with the cost of hedging foreign currency exposure put simply it no longer pays for overseas investors to buy treasuries because of the cost of protecting against moves in the dollar against their own currencies or and this is the big worry it could be that investors are starting to pay attention to the fact that the us s public finances look ugly and to the fact that no one has any intention of getting to grips with that indeed they are only going to get uglier over the foreseeable future why the frail us finances could mean a weaker us dollar the us national debt is high and rising it s more than doubled to over 22trn since before the financial crisis by the end of this quarter debt is expected to hit 108 of gdp which is chunky the uk by comparison is below 85 which in the days before the financial crisis would have been considered worrying that s the highest it s been since world war ii the thing is no one cares worrying about the national debt is so last decade if not last century why because we ve got central banks central banks can take care of anything indeed the hot new i say new because it s actually really pretty old idea in politics is that economies can print as much money as they want to fund spending and can therefore never go bust modern monetary theory mmt advocates do point out that inflation is the limiting factor here but most of them don t seem to view it as being a problem that can t be dealt with as and when it arises which strikes me as deliberately naive that said it is true that a country with its own currency and its own central bank does not have to ever default on its debts it can always repay them with printed money regardless of whether that printed money actually has any value or not the big but here is that the central bank has to be willing to fund this spending as of right now fed boss jerome powell simply doesn t seem to be all that keen to end quantitative tightening qt let alone restart quantitative easing qe or lower interest rates louis vincent gave at gavekal even suggests that this could be one reason for trump s trade tweets the us is set to go to market for another 1 3trn or more this year if bond markets are already choking on that issuance then you can start to see why trump is so keen for the fed to get out the printing press again as gave puts it america s financial state is so ugly that it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the fed will soon have to once again monetise us government spending for now it s clearly not a problem us yields are very low but as gave points out despite the current risk off mentality the us dollar has not strengthened greatly which is what normally happens is it possible that investors are starting to take note not only of america s ropey public finances but also of the fact that politicians of all stripes are promising to make them even worse if anything can undermine the dollar in the long run it s inflationary public policy combined with inflationary monetary policy it ll take a while to get there but once the story changes things could move fast we discussed the long term fragilities of the us dollar and what it could all mean for investors in a recent issue of moneyweek magazine if you re not already a subscriber get your first six

joining us today for our third quarter fiscal year 2019 conference call i will begin with a brief discussion of our operations then our cfo chuck barrantes will provide our financial overview and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year following his remarks we will open the call up for questions we continue to be extremely pleased with our solid operational and financial performance as all of our companies continue to perform at a high level the strong momentum we experienced in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter making the ninth consecutive quarter where we delivered year over year growth in adjusted ebitda our north american leasing operations continue to see strong demand across virtually of its end markets with total revenue in the third quarter increasing by 10 year over year and leasing revenues increased by 12 driven by an increase in unit growth higher average lease rates and higher fleet utilization across most of our product lines during the quarter we are very proud of these outstanding results our core portable storage business again continues to perform at the high end of our expectation driven by solid execution and broad based demand across the majority of the end markets ground level offices and storage containers continue to show very high demand as these two product lines generated a combination year over year rental revenue increase of 29 over which was organic growth taking into account all pac van product lines organic rental revenue growth was 15 for the quarter and 17 year to date our team continues to do a great job executing on a number of initiatives particularly our national account program and our recently introduced pv3 safety containers which together accounted for approximately 15 of the year over year growth in rental revenue pac van continues to be highly regarded by its customers and once again posted a world class net promoter score of 83 in the last 12 months in addition to organic growth we remain focused on building the pac van brand throughout north america by geographically expanding our portable storage container business during the quarter we completed one acquisition in fort worth texas increasing our presence in that dynamic state we also opened a greenfield location in panama city florida adding our 8th branch in the southeast region this week we completed an acquisition of a portable storage business in kentucky adding three locations to the three already in kentucky we continue to serve just over half of the top 100 msas in the u s including 39 of the top 50 and our acquisition pipeline remains healthy our liquid containment business in north america delivered slightly improved the year over year results as we have seen some moderation in leasing activity in texas while oil and gas production in both basins remain healthy we were impacted in the quarter by certain customers consolidating their field personnel due to recent acquisition activity as well as the normal seasonal slowdown combined with some pipeline availability challenges with some of our customers in the permian all indicators point to continued healthy production activity in both basins in the foreseeable future our overall business remains strong but it s not operating at the peak level we were experiencing last fall our north american manufacturing operations post a slightly positive adjusted ebitda during the quarter as sales to external customers declined from reduced sales of specialty tanks and chassis but we expect activity to increase in fourth quarter as the backlog is very strong now turning to our asia pacific region our asia pacific region continued its positive momentum by delivering third quarter growth in leasing revenues of 11 on a local currency basis up from 9 growth last quarter and marking its 10th year over year increase out of the last 11 quarters sales revenues were down year over year in local currency mostly due to one large sale that occurred last year in third quarter that wasn t repeated this year total reported revenues during the quarter in u s dollar were adversely impacted by an approximate 9 decline in average australian dollar exchange rate between periods the increase in royal wolf s leasing revenues was spread across almost all of the end markets with noticeable increases in transportation construction consumer and industrial sectors the growth has mainly been driven by increases in average units on lease combined with average lease rates our team remains focused on building upon its leading market position across the region through a combination of organic growth greenfield openings and the extent they become available accretive acquisitions to conclude we continue to see both organic growth and expansion opportunities in north america as well as ability to strengthen our market leadership in the asia pacific region as always we ll remain disciplined in our capital allocation our performance year to date positions us well to finish the year strong while also providing us with a solid foundation for continued growth in the fiscal year 2020 i ll now turn over the call to chuck barrantes for his financial review and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jody we intend on filing our annual report on form 10 q shortly at which time this document will be available on both the sec s edgar filing system and on our website and i encourage investors and other interested parties to read it as it contains a substantial amount of information about our company some of which we will discuss today turning to our fiscal third quarter financial results total revenues were 86 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 84 4 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 an increase of 2 leasing revenues were 59 6 million an increase of approximately 9 over the prior year s quarter and comprised 70 of total non manufacturing revenues for the quarter versus 67 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 non manufacturing sales revenues were 25 2 million in the quarter down from 27 3 million in the third quarter of the prior year in our north american leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totals 57 2 million compared with 51 8 million for the year ago period an increase of 10 increases occurred across most sectors but primarily in the construction commercial and oil and gas sectors revenues at our north american manufacturing operations for the third quarter were 27 point 2 7 million excuse me including intercompany sales of 1 3 million for our north american leasing operations this compares to 3 2 million of total sales for the year ago period including intercompany sales of 922 000 as jody mentioned our manufacturing operations experienced reduced demand for specialty tanks and other steel related products particularly chassis in our asia pacific leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totaled 27 6 million compared to 30 3 million for the year ago period a decrease of 9 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in utility sector as one large sale totaling 1 8 million which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was not repeated this year and as jody mentioned an approximate 9 decline in the australian dollar between the periods leasing revenues increased by approximately 1 on a year over year basis and 11 on a local currency basis driven mainly by increases in the transportation construction industrial and consumer sectors consolidated adjusted ebitda was 24 1 million in the quarter compared to 21 9 million in the prior year s quarter an increase of 10 and adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of total revenues was 28 up from 26 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as jody stated this was the ninth consecutive quarter of year over year adjusted ebitda growth in north america adjusted ebitda for our leasing operations was 17 3 million in the third quarter compared to 15 2 million for the year ago quarter an increase of 14 adjusted ebitda at pac van was 12 2 million up 20 year over year and lone star s adjusted ebitda was 5 1 million up 2 from the prior year for our manufacturing operations on a stand alone basis adjusted ebitda was 17 000 for the quarter compared to 111 000 in last year s third quarter asia pacific s adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was 8 1 million compared to 7 6 million in the year ago period an increase of approximately 7 on a local currency basis adjusted ebitda increased by approximately 17 interest expense for the third quarter was up 10 2 million an increase of 800 000 from the year ago period the increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense in the asia pacific area due to a 1 2 million fee on the prepayment of the bison capital term note which resulted in a higher weighted average interest rate of 13 7 versus 10 4 in the year ago period and was partially offset by lower average borrowings and a weaker australian dollar between the periods during the quarter we completed we completely repaid the over 60 million bison capital senior note in the asia pacific area replacing this higher cost debt with lower cost borrowings on an amended and expanded syndicated credit facility led by deutsche bank ag this move is expected to generate interest savings of over 3 million per year net loss attributable to common stockholders in the third quarter was 1 3 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to net loss of 1 5 million or 0 06 per share in the year ago quarter included in these results were noncash charges of 1 1 million and 504 000 in fiscal year 2019 and 18 respectively for the change in valuation of the stand alone bifurcated derivatives in our asia pacific convertible note both periods include 922 000 for dividends paid on our preferred stock for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 we generated free cash flow before fleet activity of 35 7 million compared to 32 2 million in the prior year period an increase of 11 now turning to our balance sheet at march 31 the company had a net leverage ratio of four times for the trailing 12 months an improvement from 4 6 times at june 30 2018 the reduction in leverage is due to a combination of factors including the forced conversion of the convertible note at royal wolf and our strong financial performance turning to our companywide outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 based on our year to date results we remain confident that consolidated revenues for the fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 370 million to 390 million and the consolidated adjusted ebitda will increase by 20 to 25 in fiscal year 19 from fiscal year 18 this outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 this now concludes our prepared comments and i would like to turn the call back to the operator for the question and answer session questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of brent thielman of d a davidson brent thielman d a davidson analyst on the outlook to get to the upper end of that ebitda guidance range you need to see a pretty sizable increase in ebitda from 3q to 4q can you get there even with the liquid containment business sort of sideways here jody miller president and chief executive officer i think a lot of it will depend on the energy side we had a little bit more of a hit we knew some of the challenges coming but through the consolidation and the pipeline issues and everything else it appears it s picking up i don t know if it ll pick up quite enough to make up the gap our core business in the u s as we stated on the call is doing exceptionally well with our containerized fleet growing at 29 for the year but it s probably not enough to make up the top of the range for the energy side and then the australian dollar s really hurting us at a 9 year over year as well so it ll be a little bit tough to get up to the top of the range charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer look brent as jody mentioned earlier on the call i mean it s we re still doing very well in the permian it s just not shooting at all levels it was early part of the year but we do still expect to have year over year growth in q4 so like anything else it s always at a point in time so we re still very very optimistic and on the future in that sector in our business in north america brent thielman d a davidson analyst sure and yes i mean jody it sounds like things are picking up i ll assume that means well but you ve seen some changes since the end of the quarter in that business out there jody miller president and chief executive officer yes correct brent thielman d a davidson analyst ok and then chuck were there additional costs that showed up in the interest line this quarter relative to the paydown at bison capital charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean that s very taking brent s side maybe didn t seem clearly but in the quarter we had about 1 2 million 1 3 million of a prepayment fee on the full repayment of the bison term note so that was the reason for the primary increase brent thielman d a davidson analyst and now it s ok got it got it ok then maybe just last question jody the business in australia i mean obviously doing really well it s evident in the numbers i guess i m just kind of curious what the boots on the ground are telling you just with all the noise around china obviously that has an impact on the economy there i guess what are you seeing from a demand perspective jody miller president and chief executive officer yes not much of a change to be honest the construction sector s still doing really well as we said before everything in australia is moved with containers right all the freight so our freight business is still very good they still got to get product in and out all the major cities the bnc and stackable solutions are getting more accepted and growing and that s still our fastest growing segment so all indications show that it s still going to be strong we got double digit growth in leasing which i think is exceptional we had a couple large sales that didn t repeat this year we also as you guys would probably remember we have a large majority of camps setting that are getting deployed currently there s a big chunk of them going to a project that will help as well so i think there s good optimism in this coming quarter operator our next question comes from the line of scott schneeberger of oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company inc analyst let s go back just following on a bunch of things that were just discussed in texas how would you classify your visibility there given the slightly changing dynamic with regard to volume and with regard to pricing jody miller president and chief executive officer yes so i don t think we ll see the pricing increases that we ve seen the first half of the year i think it s kind of flattened out the price of oil is still fine i think with the consolidation happening right now and some of that obviously they re not buying companies to taper that off long term but there s a little bit of a stall while they catch their breath the drill rigs are down slightly so completions and some of the other things are kind of catching their breath but i look for those to kind of stay stable and gradually pick back up so there s a little bit more happening then there was in the past don t have the crystal ball to say this is what it s going to be we had scheduled out three to six months on some of our customers and some of those are changing a little bit long term we think it ll work its way out and everything will be fine but i think there s just this the last three months and maybe now it seems to be kind of picking back up and being a little more positive than it has been the last three or four months scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company inc analyst right appreciate that it s helpful i want to go back to swing factors i was asking in the context of what how you could finish the fiscal year but just in that light but also in the quarter itself how much of an impact did the australian dollar have relative to what you were expecting at the start of the quarter i m just curious what kind of a swing factor that was in the quarter itself charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no we the australia dollar for the quarter pretty much performed what we had expected we were looking at around 0 71 and that s what it was going to q4 the australian dollar s dipped down a little bit i think it was below 0 70 so we re getting obviously some negative impact on the translation of the dollar not on the economics locally but for the quarter it was what we expected but 9 reduction compared to the prior year third quarter scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company inc analyst all right appreciate that color and then a last thing on pac van looking really good and hearing from some of your competitors recently the same the trends are what we re hearing there too so jody just how do you feel about visibility there and kind of the same question i was asking about texas lone star the pricing the volume and the sustainability there jody miller president and chief executive officer yes i think the core portable storage side is extremely strong i think still year to date it s 17 organic which i think is just awesome they re doing a great job there i think some of the new innovation national accounts and things that we have implemented i think will continue there and we see nothing but a positive forecast in our core business the tank or liquid storage side in texas and also on the pac van side pricing is doing very very well as well we re getting nice increases and continue to be very consistent on the lone star side as i said earlier i think pricing s kind of flattened out where we were raising prices the first half maybe not quite as much visibility into the short term future with some of the things that are happening with consolidation they re starting to get their pipeline challenges worked out so we still feel very optimistic about it but in the short term maybe not quite as clear as we ve seen the last year but still very optimistic in the long haul operator our next question comes from the line of luis hernandez an investor unknown speaker all right the first one on the refi of the bison loan that one was around 11 or 12 and right charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes 12 unknown speaker sorry go ahead charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no no 11 9 12 was the unknown speaker and the refinancing is what was at what rate roughly charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer it s with the deutsche bank rate so it s somewhere not quite the senior facility rates but around 6 level unknown speaker ok but i guess that s pretty good news there then on the on pac van which segments are you most more optimistic on over the next 12 18 months jody miller president and chief executive officer yes luis i think it s honestly across the board if we look at our growth we break it out by segment all segments are doing very well i think construction looks very positive i think our national accounts is probably the most optimistic opportunity for us some of our new product innovation is helping with all segments but it s really across the board i think we re outgrowing obviously the industry but i think everything looks very optimistic in the core business unknown speaker ok all right great then the other next question would be on do you expect a higher level of free cash flow on in q4 i mean these first nine months chuck you said 30 million 36 million roughly 35 7 million do you expect sort of a bump on q4 just maybe some coming from free from working capital or something charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i think luis just by the fact that on the refinance of bison capital we should get a nice pick up from there just some free cash flow and yes i do expect free cash flow to pick up unknown speaker ok all right and finally on pac van just to basic little details have you grown the fleet at all jody miller president and chief executive officer yes yes we re running about 80 utilization so obviously there s branches that are running short we continue to that s a big part of our organic number right so we re 17 organic so when you re running close to that 80 more we definitely have added to the fleet unknown speaker yes because you were roughly around 4 000 tanks just wanted to know if you had grown those kinds at all jody miller president and chief executive officer no it s all been core storage and glo our glo still leads our growth percentage and then storage containers are next those are two high growth products we have not really we ve not added anything on the tank side and very little in any other categories charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer so luis in north america last year at march 31 2018 we had about a total lease fleet including 4 000 something frac tanks about 43 000 in at the end of the march this current third quarter we re at 51 500 unknown speaker ok yes i when i asked the fleet i meant the tank fleet not jody miller president and chief executive officer tanks have not grown significant at all last march we had total tanks in north america 4 146 and we have 4 216 now unknown speaker ok so it s pretty much roughly the same slightly above all right that s good and then on the rates on the tanks versus 2014 we always check that number how is that the pickup or the relationship of that charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer the rates on which product are you unknown speaker on the tanks on the oil tanks charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and so last year third quarter average rate was about for the quarter was 805 versus a little over 900 this quarter this third quarter unknown speaker ok so 900 and then the versus 2014 rates charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer we re still well behind not even close to the peak of those rates i d have to look and see that i would state still 30 40 under what we were at that time unknown speaker right so maybe 70 of the rates ok jody miller president and chief executive officer yes or a little less operator our next question comes from the line of brian gagnon of gagnon securities brian gagnon gagnon securities analyst i m looking at the repayment of the bison note and you got hit with 1 2 million in q3 and it looks to me like your savings going forward is something on the order of 700 000 or 800 000 a quarter so can i think about the fourth quarter having an automatic 2 million increase versus where you were in q3 on interest charles barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i would think that s fair operator and there are no other questions at this time i would now like to turn the call over to mr jody miller president and ceo for closing remarks please go ahead mr miller jody miller president and chief executive officer thank you operator appreciate you joining us today and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter operator duration 31 minutes call participants charles barrantes

compounded by a 7 2 million decrease in revenue as a result of the gbp weakening against the usd when compared against the first quarter of 2018 declines to revenue attributable to key products during the quarter excluding the impact of foreign currency translation included a 1 6 million decrease from liothyronine sodium a 1 5 million decrease from carbimazole a 1 4 million decrease from cyclizine hydrochloride and a 1 4 million decrease from levothyroxine sodium these lower product volumes and revenues are primarily due to ongoing competitive market pressures resulting in market share erosion in the uk market these declines to revenue were partially offset by 1 0 million increase in revenue from fusidic acid as a result of product volume increases the remaining decrease was primarily due to general competitive market pressures across the segment s product portfolio north america segment advanz pharma north america segment revenue of 36 5 million for the quarter ended march 31 2019

result of lower product volumes in the first quarter of 2019 donnatal tablets continued to face pressure from two competitive products additionally the launch of additional non fda approved competitive products to donnatal elixir during the second quarter of 2018 has resulted in lower product volumes of the elixir in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the corresponding period in 2018 these declines in revenue were partially offset by a 3 2 million increase in revenue from kapvay due to higher volumes and lower medicaid utilization a 1 3 million increase in revenue from plaquenil

consolidated results of operations revenue for the first quarter ended march 31 2019 decreased by 16 6 million or 11 compared to the corresponding period in 2018 this decrease was due to lower sales from both segments combined with lower foreign exchange rates impacting translated revenues from the advanz pharma international segment gross profit for the first quarter ended march 31 2019 decreased by 10 0 million or 10 compared to the corresponding period in 2018 primarily due to the revenue declines on key products gross profit percentage for the first quarter of 2019 increased by 1

the 11th round of trade talks on monday us trade representative robert lighthizer confirmed to reporters that the 25 tariffs would go into effect on friday he also accused beijing of reneging on trade commitments over the course of the last week or so we have seen an erosion in commitments by china lighthizer said on monday really i would use the word reneging on prior commitments on tuesday afternoon china s ministry of commerce said in a statement that liu he the country s vice premier would still be heading to washington dc on may 9 and may 10 for the planned trade talks defying previous rumours that the trip might be cancelled state media xinhua said in an editorial piece on the same day that in terms of the china us trade war china has always been unwilling to fight not afraid to fight and will fight when it is absolutely necessary on wednesday reuters reported citing sources that china sent a diplomatic cable to the us last friday in which it deleted the parts about its commitments to change laws in order to resolve core us demands from all seven chapters of the draft deal on wednesday evening beijing time the office of the united states trade representative filed a draft plan with the federal register for increasing tariffs on thursday morning the chinese ministry of commerce said that china deeply regrets the us decision to increase the tariffs and will have to take necessary countermeasures if the tariffs went into effect on friday morning beijing time trump said he had received a beautiful letter from chinese president xi jinping the tariffs on 200bn of chinese goods were officially increased from 10 to 25 alongside the ongoing trade talks in washington dc soon after the chinese ministry of commerce issued a third statement confirming that it would take retaliatory measures china s fx reserves fell by 3 8bn to 3 1tr in april the first drop after six consecutive months of increase according to a tuesday statement by the state administration of foreign exchange safe wang chunying the spokesperson of safe attributed the decline to a stronger us dollar and the changes in global assets prices in april safe approved a total of

the international monetary fund china s exports contracted by 2 7 year on year in april in sharp contrast from march s 14 2 growth according to data published by the ministry of commerce on thursday imports grew 4 0 year on year a significant increase from the 7 5 contraction in march after four months of decline as a result china s trade surplus narrowed to 13 84bn in april from the previous month s 32 67bn both imports and exports from and to the us were weakened by the ongoing trade tensions china s exports to the us contracted by 13 1 year on year and imports from the us contracted by 25 7 in the same period given recent policies to stabilise infrastructure investment and support the private sector overall import demand may still pick up in the coming months on the back of higher domestic demand but a challenging global trade environment means overall import growth could remain modest in 2019 jingyang chen an economist at hsbc wrote in a wednesday note aggregate financing grew 10 4 year on year in april to rmb209 68tr down from the 10 7 growth in march according to data published by the people s bank of china pboc on thursday morning renminbi denominated loans reached rmb141 85tr a 13 5 year on year increase slightly down from the 13 8 year on year increase in march the volume of outstanding corporate bonds and local government special purpose bonds increased by 10 5 and 41 4 respectively weakness in april money and credit data is likely the result of an intentional change in policy stance toward a less supportive one as reflected in the less dovish monetary policy after activity growth as well as an inflation and equity market performance rebound in 1q yu song china economist at beijing gao hua securities wrote in a thursday note cpi was up 2 5 year on year reaching the highest level in six months the increase was led mostly by the 6 1 growth in food cpi according to data from the national bureau of statistics non food cpi rose 1 7 in april versus the 1 8 growth in march producer price index ppi was up 0 9 yoy up from 0 4 in march we believe the rise of cpi inflation to impose little pressure on the pboc s easing bias because annual cpi inflation could still be around 2 5 well below beijing s target of 3 0 and the rise of cpi inflation is being driven by a surge in pork prices as a result of a supply shock ting lu an economist at nomura wrote in a thursday note average daily trading volume of usd cnh futures on the hong kong exchange and clearing hkex reached 6 053 contracts in april a 31 5 drop from march s 8 835 contracts the exchange said in a monthly statement average daily trading volume of chinese bonds via the bond connect channel increased 6 1 month on month in april and by 33 2 to 0 7bn year on year according to

source xinhua 2019 05 10 17 51 36 editor yamei video player close by xinhua writers liu yanan ma qian new york may 9 xinhua amid rising protectionism in some major countries china is well prepared and well positioned to ward off adverse impacts of external risks and shocks including trade tensions experts said to xinhua in recent interviews this is because of china s effective control of capital accounts hefty reserves of foreign exchange forex capacity to avoid overshooting in the banking system resilient indigenous economy and significant progress made in deleveraging as well as ready policy tools at hand they said nimble government controllable debts china has a high savings rate and its debt is predominantly domestical and there s capital controls for outflows so money does not just fly out like that in russia or brazil said tao wang chief china economist and head of asia economic research with union bank of switzerland ubs on wednesday the chinese banking system is unlikely to overshoot in a financial crisis as it is strictly controlled and would not allow the situation getting worse like in the 2008 financial crisis said wang at a media panel discussion china has quite a nimble government which is improving the economy s adaptive capacity and china s leadership will continue to make course corrections when needed according to amy celico a principal of the consulting firm albright stonebridge group regarding the debt problem wang said that china has started to do deleveraging since 2016 and the share of debt to chinese gross domestic product gdp in 2018 declined from the level around 2015 to 2016 according to official data the chinese overall debt level in 2018 was 37 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year less than the record of 38 9 percent in 2015 china s debt ratio has long stayed lower than the 60 percent limit stipulated in the eu s stability and growth pact and far below the 115 1 percent level for the group of seven developed economies wang said china has done well in stabilizing growth and managing debts at the same time today the risk is substantially lower compared to 2016 because of what has already happened in china she said those deleveraging efforts mainly included tighter regulations on shadow banking restructuring of bad debts as well as a reduction of excess supply and excess capacity according to the economist tight control on capital account also helps china avoid a number of financial crises and china should not allow for free convertibility with a forex account said kai lin executive director of emerging market asia forex trading at standard chartered bank recently statistics show that china had 3 09 trillion u s dollars of forex reserves by the end of april 2019 with its holdings of forex remaining over 3 trillion dollars since 2011 increasing home growth momentum growth potentials and resilience of the chinese economy stem from a mixed combination of effective fiscal and monetary policies and the fact that the economy has become more consumption oriented and less export dependent said jorge o mariscal chief investment officer for emerging markets at ubs wealth management wang the ubs economist said she has noted the chinese economic recovery since the start of this year especially in the industrial and the property sector china s economy beat market expectations to advance 6 4 percent year on year in the first quarter according to data from the national bureau of statistics a slew of international research institutions have raised their forecasts on china s economic growth the international monetary fund revised its expectation for china s 2019 growth to 6 3 percent up 0 1 percentage point from its previous estimation in january ubs also adjusted up its forecast of chinese gdp growth from 6 percent to 6 4 percent for 2019 wang pointed out that china s growth has been more associated with domestic elements consumer sentiment is improving property is improving in addition the chinese government s policy composition was more focused on tax cuts and support for the private sector more of a domestic component wang noted referring to current u s china trade tension wang said if the additional tariff goes from 10 percent to 25 percent on 200 billion u s dollars of chinese goods china will still have a decent chance of getting growth above 6 percent this year china is expected to resort to fiscal and monetary policy promoting infrastructure and other fronts if trade tensions escalate further and it s unlikely to see the growth fall very sharply wang said celico said that her company s biggest practice is focused on china as american european and asian companies and non profit organizations want to participate in china because of the potential there she attributed china s growth potentials to its large population improving productivity technology innovation infrastructure and education development as well as untapped private sector
us president donald trump says he is in no hurry to sign a trade deal with china as washington imposed a new set of tariffs on chinese goods and negotiators began a second day of last ditch talks to try to salvage an agreement the united states early on friday increased its tariffs on us200 billion 286 billion in chinese goods to 25 per cent from 10 per cent rattling financial markets already worried the 10 month trade war between the world s two largest economies could spiral out of control the biggest chinese import sector affected by the rate hike is a us20 billion 28 billion category of internet modems routers and other data transmission devices followed by about us12 billion 17 billion worth of printed circuit boards used in a vast array of us made products furniture lighting products auto parts vacuum cleaners and building materials are also high on the list of products subject to the higher duties the move which is expected to lead to chinese retaliation went into effect just hours before us trade representative robert lighthizer us treasury secretary steven mnuchin and chinese vice premier liu he started a second day of talks in washington liu he leaves a meeting with top us and chinese negotiators as they try to salvage a deal with more talks scheduled for saturday photo aap mr liu was seen leaving the us trade representative s office near midday and it was not immediately clear if that signalled an end to the current round of negotiations in a series of morning tweets mr trump defended the tariff hike and said he was in absolutely no rush to finalise a deal adding that the us economy would gain more from the levies than any agreement tariffs will bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind mr trump said in one of the tweets talks with china continue in a very congenial manner there is absolutely no need to rush as tariffs are now being paid to the united states by china of 25 on 250 billion dollars worth of goods products these massive payments go directly to the treasury of the u s donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 10 2019 despite mr trump s insistence china will absorb the cost of the tariffs us businesses will pay them and likely pass them on to consumers consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of us economic activity global stocks which have fallen this week on the increased us china tensions came under renewed pressure on friday major us stock indexes were down more than 1 per cent and prices of us government debt rose the us dollar slipped against a basket of currencies mr trump who has adopted protectionist policies as part of his america first agenda and railed against china for trade practices he labels unfair said the trade talks originally due to end on friday could drag on beyond this week we will continue to negotiate with china in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal said trump who has accused beijing of reneging on commitments it made during months of negotiations tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker just sit back and watch in the meantime china should not renegotiate deals with the u s at the last minute this is not the obama administration or the administration of sleepy joe who let china get away with murder donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 10 2019 following the us tariff hike china s commerce ministry said it would take countermeasures but did not elaborate china responded to mr trump s tariffs last year with levies on a range of us goods including soybeans and pork which hurt us farmers at a time when their debt has spiked to its highest level in decades us agriculture secretary sonny perdue said on friday that mr trump asked him to create a plan to support the farmers the us department of agriculture already has rolled out up to us12 billion 17 billion to help offset farmers china related losses under the latest us action us customs and border protection imposed a 25 per cent duty on more than 5700 categories of products leaving china after 12 01am local time on friday seaborne cargoes shipped from china before midnight were not subject to the new tax as long as they arrived in the us prior to june 1 those cargoes will be charged the original 10 per cent rate china shipping company containers are stacked at a us terminal after president donald trump s latest tariff hike on chinese goods took effect friday photo aap this delay might create an unofficial window during which the us and china can continue to negotiate investment bank goldman sachs wrote in a note adding that it was a somewhat positive sign that talks were continuing the grace period was not applied to three previous rounds of tariffs imposed last year on chinese goods which had much longer notice periods of at least three weeks before the duties took effect investors worry the escalating trade war will further damage a slowing global economy the higher tariffs could reduce us gross domestic product by 0 3 per cent and china s by 0 8 per cent in 2020 consultancy oxford economics said chief executive of the consumer technology association gary shapiro said the tariffs would be paid by american consumers and businesses not china as mr trump claimed our industry supports more than 18 million us jobs but raising tariffs will be disastrous mr shapiro said the tariffs already in place have cost the american technology sector about 1 billion more a month since october that can be life or death for small businesses and startups that can t absorb the added costs

to earnings in q1 2018 reported net income this quarter reflected market related impacts which reduced earnings by 69 million after tax underlying earnings were 717 million down from 770 million in the prior year excluding the interest on par seed capital underlying earnings are up 9 or 11 on an earnings per share basis compared to prior year underlying earnings also included favorable experience items including investing activity gains mortality morbidity lapse in policyholder behavior and expense experience this was partially offset by unfavorable credit experience related to downgrades from indirect exposure to a single name in the u s utilities sector which i will discuss in a few minutes our underlying roe of 13 3 was within the target range for our medium term objective of 12 14 we maintained a strong capital position with a licat ratio of 145 for sun life financial inc or slf and 132 for sun life insurance company of canada the higher ratio at the slf level reflects the excess cash of 2 6 billion held by slf our leverage ratio of 21 1 remain below our long term target of 25 and is another potential source of capital for capital deployment on may

earnings in canada grew by 8 in the u s underlying net income was up 16 in the first quarter of 2018 reflecting favorable mortality morbidity and lapse in policyholder behavior experience partially offset by lower investing activity gains and unfavorable credit experience the prior year also benefited from 35 million of interest on par seed capital our group benefits after tax profit margin was 7 9 on a trailing 12 month basis in the quarter compared to 5 6 in the prior year driven by continued strong results in our stop loss business asset management underlying earnings were 227 million down slightly from the prior year the impact of lower average net assets at mfs primarily is a result of equity market decline from the fourth quarter of 2018 and was largely offset by favorable investment income including returns on seed capital mfs pre tax net operating profit margin was 38 in line with the prior year sun life investment management generated underlying net income of 4 million in asia underlying net income was down 6 million from last year with growth in our core asia businesses of 16 offset by weakness in our international results reflecting unfavorable credit and mortality experience and higher new business stream the next slide slide 8 we provide details on our sources of earnings presentation expected profit of 739 million was up 5 million from the same period last year with business growth in canada and in the u s stop loss business offset by the impact of lower average net assets at mfs excluding the impact of currency and the results of asset management expected profit grew by 2 over the prior year we had new business strain this quarter of 11 million reflecting higher strain in asia as a result of lower sales in our international business segments experience losses of 96 million for the quarter primarily reflected net unfavorable market impact driven by interest rate movements in the quarter and partially offset by equity market increases credit lapse in policyholder behavior and other experience also had an unfavorable impact which was partially offset by investment activity mortality morbidity and expense experience the unfavorable credit experience in the first quarter of 2019 includes 57 million after tax related to several renewable energy projects and our corporate loan portfolio related to private fixed income investments or pfis that have contracts to sell power to pacific gas electric pg e given the bankruptcy proceeding for pg e we downgraded these pfis these downgrades reduced canadian results by 29 million asia results by 19 million mostly in the international segment with the remainder of the impact in the u s the downgrades were on internal ratings we have on these pfi investments and were driven by their role as suppliers of power to pg e there has been no impact on cash flows for us on these investments assumption changes were moderately negative at 10 million in the quarter other in our sources of earnings which amounted to a loss of 29 million includes a fair value adjustment on mfs share based awards acquisition integration and restructuring cost and the impact of certain hedges in canada that do not quality for hedge accounting earnings on surplus of 125 million were 32 million lower than the first quarter last year reflecting lower realized gains our effective tax rate on reported net income for the quarter was 11 driven by a market movement on investments with lower tax rates on an underlying basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17 8 and in line with or expected range of 15 20 slide 9 shows sales results across our insurance and wealth businesses total insurance sales of 780 million were up 17 or 16 on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2018 insurance sales in canada were up 22 driven by large case sales in group benefits as well as higher individual insurance sales in the u s sales were up 11 in u s dollars as a result of higher sales and stop loss asia individual insurance sales excluding international were up 24 in constant currency with double digit growth in six of our seven markets sales in asia s international business segment were down from prior year reflecting changing product preferences total wealth sales of 36 billion were down 10 from the prior year or 13 on a constant currency basis wealth sales were primarily impacted by a weaker rsp season in canada institutional sales which were lower in a few of our businesses included mfs and defined benefit solutions in canada and in asia where we had lower money market sales in the philippines and lower sales in our india asset management business primarily driven by market volatility value of new business was up 14 to 382 million driven by strong insurance sales and improved pricing to conclude we had a good first quarter we saw strong growth in earnings an eps after reflecting the impact of interest on par seed capital strong growth in insurance and value of new business and a continuation of our strong capital generation with that i ll turn the call over to greg to begin the q a portion of the call gregory dilworth vice president of investor relations thanks kevin to help ensure that all of our participants have an opportunity to ask questions on today s call i would ask each of you to please limit yourself to one or two questions and then to requeue with any additional questions with that i d like to please poll the participants for questions questions and answers operator at this time i would like to inform everyone in order to ask a question press then the number 1 on your telephone keypad to withdraw your question press the key we will pause for a moment to compile the q a roster your profession comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey lee dowling partners analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking my question my first question is related to the favorable expense experience in a quarter and i was just wondering if kevin can provide some color in terms of was it a benefit of more disciplined expense management that you highlighted at the investor day or was it just the timing of expenses if you can elaborate a little bit on the level of expense gap in the quarter that would be helpful dean connor president and chief executive officer well thanks humphrey i ll start and kevin morrissey may add some comments as we talked about at investor day we ve been working hard across the organization on expenses and as we called it bending the cost curve and if you reflect the impact of currency take the impact of currency out of your flat year over year on expenses and for our controllable expenses we had a moderate increase of 1 at the same time as we were working hard on controlling our expenses we saw the business grow both on the new business side and in the in force which saw us adding allowables the combination of those higher allowables and good work on a managing the expenses resulted in the gain humphrey lee dowling partners analyst it sounds like it s more the expense management that you talked about as opposed to timing dean connor president and chief executive officer i think it is yeah you re seeing a lot of good impacts of the expense management coming through humphrey lee dowling partners analyst okay kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah humphrey it s kevin morrissey maybe i ll just add that you saw that we had 11 million after tax gain and in the expense line it is from the growth of the business and the expense management so both of those components we would expect to see those to be volatile moving forward quarter to quarter and our outlook on that would probably be more around zero but it was certainly a strong quarter humphrey lee dowling partners analyst got it and then shifting gears to u s group benefits i think when you look at the overall strong sales and in force premium growth in the business especially in stop loss i was just wondering from a perspective have you seen any kind of market expansion in the stop loss market or are you just simply you and maybe some other companies are taking market share daniel fishbein president of sun life financial united states humphrey this is dan fishbein the stop loss market continues to grow for a few different reasons first of all the size of stop loss premiums grow with medical cost trends so that s about 6 8 a year also more employers are self insuring in recent years we get about a 0 5 growth in the proportion of employers that are self insuring versus fully insured as a percentage of the total market each year and then we are also taking share there s no question we re taking share from competitors so our very good growth is fueled by all three of those factors humphrey lee dowling partners analyst at the same time you have very favorable underwriting results do you feel like that would potential lead to any kind of downward pressure on pricing or just the fact that the medical cost trend and the level of additional employers looking to self insure would more than offset that pressure daniel fishbein president of sun life financial united states well historically if you look back over the past 10 years or so the stop loss business has been somewhat cyclical there have been times of expanding margins and then increasing competition that s led to compressing margins we re not seeing that phenomenon right now although we ve been in the good part of the cycle for about two and a half years now from our own perspective what we can say is that we re still selling and renewing our business at or above our targeted pricing so at the moment we re not seeing irrational or aggressive market behavior humphrey lee dowling partners analyst thank you so much operator your next question comes how many meny grauman from cormark securities meny grauman cormark securities analyst hi good afternoon i just wanted to start with the asia segment it was noted that there was favorable joint venture experience in that segment so i m just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail what s driving that experience what geography is this is this primarily bank assurance driven thanks dean connor president and chief executive officer we ll ask claude accum to take that question claude accum president of sun life financial asia hey meny it s claude accum here i m not sure which particular item you re seeing i actually see joint venture experience going the other direction can you give me where you re getting your question from meny grauman cormark securities analyst in the md a i thought there was a reference to positive joint venture experience in asia but let me see kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer meny it s kevin we have two large joint ventures of course we have a joint venture in malaysia which we manage but that come through the joint venture piece which is india and china we did have some gains in china in that segment but overall i think claude is talking about you re focusing on one piece and claude is talking about the overall joint venture experience so the two do tie in but that s how they do meny grauman cormark securities analyst okay moving on just in terms of mfs i m just wondering about that institutional flow and if there s anything unusual there that you would highlight or are we just seeing the trends that we ve been talking about for a while just continuing or if there s anything that you would call out in the quarter in terms of influencing those flows michael roberge chief executive officer of mfs investment management good afternoon meny it s mike roberge yeah it really is the same things that we discussed de risking rebalancing it has not been performance related and so the same things that we ve talked about over a number of quarters were true in q1 as well meny grauman cormark securities analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from gabriel dechaine from national bank financial gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst good afternoon my first question is on the buybacks and yeah just trying to figure out what that says about your m a ambitions i know you re notionally looking at something in asia or bulking up the u s group business does the decision to upsize the buyback mean there s nothing really imminent on any of those files or is it really just an expression that overall you could do that plus accommodate more buyback dean connor president and chief executive officer gabriel it s dean it s the latter we have as you know a very strong balance sheet lots of excess cash at the hold co lots of leverage capability and so this extension of the buyback which is not big in dollar terms just gives us some more flexibility as we run through to the end of this particular ncib period we re pleased that we ve been able to fully execute on the previous ncib that we launched last august executed on that over the first nine months and this just gives us a little bit more flexibility as you know we re getting close to closing soon on the greenoak transaction that will be deployment around 200 million when that transaction closes we ve got the capital to do things like that to give us the flexibility to do more ncib but also to do acquisitions small medium and large kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer i might just add to that gabriel as we discussed at the investor day the company is generating after dividends 800 million in capital each year and we ve been running in the buyback close to 200 million a quarter which is kind of keeping us at the excess capital position we ve been at gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay and is there heat meter on the m a file that i see anywhere no i m joking but if you answer that that d be great my real second question now i tend to kind of disregard the macro factors i shouldn t probably but this quarter the interest rate impact is pretty large larger than what i did get to using your sensitivity guidance and i m just wondering if there s an element of the flat yield curve we saw during the quarter and inverted for a bit that may have been a factor there or perhaps maybe another explanation as to why it was large and if it s just gabe your math is wrong then that s fine kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary gabriel it s kevin morrissey thanks for the question no you are right it was larger than would be implied by our sensitivity which are very simple stylized sensitivities based on parallel movement in yield curves as you noted we had a bit of a flattening in the yield curve and for sun life that does cause us some larger losses probably about 60 of the incremental loss would have been from flattening of the yield curve we also had some losses related to derivatives that we use to hedge some of the interest rate risk and a market to implied volatility changed a bit which reduced the value of those derivatives that s something again that wouldn t be in the simple sensitivities we disclosed gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst what s that 60 of the deviation kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary if you look at the markets broadly they were down about 30 basis points so based on our sensitivity that would imply about a 60 million drop we saw about twice that so the variation would have been about 60 million incremental loss so 35 million ballpark additional loss from the flattening of the yield curve gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay great thanks a lot operator your next question comes from doug young from desjardins capital douglas young desjardins capital analyst good afternoon just maybe starting kevin with you on the lap side obviously you may have made some adjustments from the actuarial side recently but it keeps persistently being negative and just wanting to get an update what it was this quarter in what you re seeing kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary doug thanks it s kevin morrissey again what we did see in the quarter we saw a loss of 8 million it was from various sources across a number of business groups all quite small and i d say relatively benign so as you noted we had some historically large losses related to the u s in force business we took significant strengthening in q3 and we ve been pleased with the results that have been very small gains and losses since then so we re very satisfied with the action that we took relative to those historical losses and we see the results this quarter the small loss being in the range of normal volatility douglas young desjardins capital analyst you re not seeing any particular trend in any one business this seems to be a shotgun and your u s experience on the lap side seems to be normal is that fair kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary that s fair yes douglas young desjardins capital analyst okay i m actually going to go at the buyback a little differently you increased your buyback 4 million shares again it s 220 million if you re generating 800 million of capital excess capital a year and you re buying back 200 million you ve giving yourself another quarter of buyback why not increase it more why not double the buyback and give yourself more flexibility or am i doing the math wrong or missing something thanks dean connor president and chief executive officer no doug this is an amendment to our current ncib which would end in august and at that time we would look at whether we renewed or not this gave us the most flexibility douglas young desjardins capital analyst okay that s fine thank you operator your next question comes from sumit malhotra from scotiabank your line is open sumit malhotra from scotiabank your line is open sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst can you hear me dean connor president and chief executive officer yeah sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst hello dean connor president and chief executive officer yeah we can hear you sumit sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst oh ok good i was having some phone problems just making sure everything s ok just on a couple of the moving parts on the book value that are upcoming so this is likely for kevin strain you gave us or you reconfirmed your sensitivity and that would be i think you told us about 100 million if the 15 basis point reduction is enacted are you expecting that to be in the actuarial review in q3 kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah sumit this is kevin morrissey we are expecting that so as you re probably aware the actual standard board did release their initial standard and it is a 15 basis point reduction in the long term urr which is the one that we re sensitive to our estimate of that is 100 million after tax reduction we are planning to do that in q3 that s similar to what we had done the last time this came around in 2017 sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst okay we ll see that then and then as far as a greenoak is concerned when that transaction was announced in december it was stated that the impact on shareholders equity on merging the two entities greenoak and bentall kennedy would be 730 million is that kevin still a good accurate number and are we likely to see that before the end of june kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer well i ll let steve talk about the timing of the transaction but in terms of the accounting impact that s roughly what we re still expecting stephen peacher president of sun life investment management in terms of the timing of the transaction it s taken a while because we ve had to get regulatory approval in a number of jurisdictions those are going quite well in fact we just got one more approval today we would expect this to close right around the end of the quarter maybe july 1st as opposed to june 30th but we re on track for closing over the next couple of months sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst to the extent we talked about this transaction steve over the last few months a lot of it has been on the potential diversification for the business with respect to geography and frankly strategy in terms of how the respective real estate portfolios are managed it may be the right time to ask it in a quarter where sun life had positive expense experience for the first time in a few years at least the way you report it you re putting together two entities here that get you to close to 40 billion in assets is there anything we should expect from an expense synergies prospective or with this franchise being more in growth mode are expenses not really a big part of the story in the near term stephen peacher president of sun life investment management i think that as these two entities come together we re going to find some efficiencies from an operating standpoint that really was not the driver of the deal the driver of the deal as you mentioned was about an expanded range of capabilities on the real estate side which allows us there s a trend in the market of institutions wanting to reduce the number of real estate managers this gives us a broader platform with a high growth entity with exceptional return so the transaction was really about broadening our positioning i do expect to the margin we re going to find some efficiencies but it wasn t the driver of the transaction sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst last one for me i m going to say it s going to be kevin or claude i just wanted to circle back on asia i know obviously you ve got let s call it the credit provision in the quarter or the credit downgrade in the quarter that had an impact on the earnings and the segment but when we look at expected profit where i don t think that would have factored in the growth rate was about 2 kevin in your comments you seem to be distinguishing between what was happening in the core insurance and wealth part of the business and then international i feel like we haven t had to talk too much about the international piece of late maybe just a little bit of color from you to reiterate what exactly drove the contribution from the international piece down this quarter and are there factors that were one offish in nature or is this something where we should see a lower run rate from international in the near term kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll start and then maybe claude can jump in it s kevin strain on the international there were three big impacts to international international took almost the entire pg e impact that i talked about in asia so the downgrades to the investments the pfi s we had the second is international it s the first time this has happened in a long time and you do get some volatility here had bad mortality experience and then with the lower sales it had some more new business strain in international if you looked at the earnings impact to asia international was a significant piece of the decline in underlying earnings with each of those three components and in order that i mentioned the credit the mortality and then the new business strain if you looked at asia expected profit from the core seven local businesses as dean called them earlier we did see some the expected profit there grew but more moderately than you would expect there was an impact on our fee income from equity market declines in six of our seven markets in asia and that impacted the fee income there so you ve got the combination of a couple of different things happening in asia sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst just on the fee income piece i would think that that has a lot to do with where you started the quarter in terms of aum as opposed to where you ended it kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s right it s really to do with the equity market performance and where the quarter started and what happens you ve got a lot of impact in asia related to china and the china economy and those types of things as well sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst thanks for your time operator the next question comes from steve theriault from eight capital steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks very much to start if i could just follow up a bit on the asia international pg e i understand that was split across divisions but just going into the sales and probably for claude last quarter you talked about new product launches rate volatility extending the selling cycle and how sales are getting pushed into this year but the q1 sales were pretty modest can you update us on just the confidence level around getting sales back to the prior run rate and how quickly we should expect to see that claude accum president of sun life financial asia yes steve it s claude accum here and we ve seen this two quarters now starting in q4 we did see a shift in market preferences for certain products away from the traditional universal life product that has been very successful for us for the last decade as you pointed out that shift away from ul continued in q1 in the high net worth space so how we ve responded is we re focusing on products that operate better in a low interest rate environment and offer equity market participation so the two products we re focused on our indexed universal life and par whole life we ve actually already launched the indexed universal life high net worth product offshore and we ve also successfully launched a high net worth par product onshore in hong kong and that product is gaining quite a bit of traction and it s driving some of the strong sales that you re seeing in hong kong we re going to continue that progress and this week this month we re going to be launching a competitive high net worth par product into the offshore market so we ll have two products out there in this space and we re looking for that product to garner some good sales traction in the second half steve theriault eight capital analyst in the second half and then just one last thing on that as you re migrating away from that traditional ul product that was a good support item in the context of the strain line would these new products have will they have similar propensity to help that line item and the source of earnings dean connor president and chief executive officer this product would have similar strength of the ul product it s an interesting product in that it s the cycle ultimately it s a very low capital intensive product so we think that could be quite favorable steve theriault eight capital analyst okay the last thing for me was also in asia but on the wealth side i think kevin you mentioned in your opening remarks about was it philippines money market but the last few quarters the sales have been more like 2 billion versus 3 billion when you look back to prior run rates i think that s right anyway how much of that is that sort of money market noise that s not all that impactful to the margin how much of it is potentially just slower wealth sales that have been offset by some strong insurance sales over the last little bit claude accum president of sun life financial asia it s claude accum here i would be happy to go with that first as you point out wealth sales were down in q1 they re down by 1 9 billion about 1 3 billion of that is actually coming from india and about 300 million from the philippines in india what you re seeing is industry sales are actually down about 50 and that s similar to us and that s due to the indian markets where mid cap is down 3 small cap is down 14 and so that s impacting the india markets in the philippines the 300 million decrease was mainly in money market sales and that was more in the institutional space due to a large institutional sale in the prior year so that s not retail our wealth sales are basically following what s happening in the equity markets as kevin has indicated six of our eight countries are down significantly year over year but as the market rebounded and we saw that in q1 we did see an uptick in march and so we think our wealth sales will follow the equity market cycle steve theriault eight capital analyst okay thanks for that color operator your next question comes from tom mackinnon from bmo capital markets thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks i was wondering if you might be able to split out what the expected profit is in asia between asia proper i ll say and then international because it s kind of different stories one is a complete high net worth and another is a growth in the emerging middle class would you be able to share with us proportionately how the expected profit might split between those two dean connor president and chief executive officer we haven t separated those two out tom we can think about that going forward and how we want to disclose these but we ve included just the one item on the source of earnings i think if you thought about my broader comments you can think about the local markets in asia and focus on growth and getting the growth up and what really impacted them this time was the fee income on the markets in terms of the expected profit in international the sales don t have a significant impact on changing that that s over a longer term that that would impact those pieces but we haven t separated out the two thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst okay then if i go to the u s employee benefits or the u s group benefits the margin obviously better at 7 9 probably helped by the great mortality morbidity experience you had in the quarter in your 6 5 target are their policyholder experience gains mortality or morbidity gains in that 6 5 and if so how much do you need in order to hit that daniel fishbein president of sun life financial united states tom this is dan fishbein we recently updated our target to 7 plus and we don t assume explicit morbidity or mortality gains in order achieve that we price for the margins that we re seeking to achieve as i mentioned earlier in stop loss for example we ve been able to be very successful pricing for those margins the margin in the first quarter on a trailing 12 month basis was obviously very much benefited by favorable morbidity experience in the stop loss business thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst okay that s great you assume zero the final thing with respect to canada years ago we had a career sales force that was probably growing i don t know modestly and now if you look over the last several years this career sales force continues to decline strategically it used to be a good par sales and maybe a mutual fund sales machine strategically what s happening here with the sun life career sales force down 8 in 2017 8 in 2018 and then another 5 year over year jacques goulet president of sun life financial canada thanks for the question tom this is jacques you re right 5 this last time i ll take you back perhaps 18 months to 24 months because we changed our focus a little bit one from i would say just recruiting more advisors to one of improving the overall client and advisor experience right that s met a lot of changes in terms of the digital experience that we re delivering so that ultimately our advisors can work more effectively with their clients deliver a better quality product and so on the other thing i would say is it s not shown in a numbers but because of the increased focus on quality tom we ve been putting the bar higher on the number of recruits and so we re recruiting and quite a few less than we used to and those that we do it s the fail pass process in a way we tend to recognize faster if they re going to make it or not but if you d split the number of advisors into two buckets and let s say you define these buckets as more experienced advisors versus newer more developing advisors you d find that actually were kind of flat on the experienced advisors that support this a strategy that i was telling you about strategically speaking i ll remind you that we are focused on two different channels career sales force is very strategic for us but so is the third party the sales continue to be good if you go back seven or eight quarters we re either number one or number two we were number one for the full year 2018 when we look out we ve said that at investor day if you remember but we have a point of view generally that canadians are insufficiently insured so we think the model we have is a pretty good one and in terms of the csf as said very focused on digital and technology and bringing tools to our advisors it s stabilizing so we think that you ll see a decreasing numbers there in terms of headcount decrease thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst okay thanks for that operator our last question is from mario mendonca from td securities your line is open mario mendonca td securities analyst good afternoon can we just go back to the u s expected profit and let s exclude mfs for a moment it does look like on a u s dollar basis it was flat year over year and i m trying to piece together what we re seeing here because it doesn t look like it s a margin story necessarily it looks maybe like it s more around the asset growth side and the reason i m going at this is because what we are instead seeing instead of the expected profit growth we re seeing the experience gains emerge so strongly is that really where you d guide us that we really should be piecing those two together dean connor president and chief executive officer i might be able to start because i ve got the detail thing front of me and i ll give dan a chance to talk about the other piece but you have to remember mario there s a couple of other pieces inside of the u s including individual insurance which is a runoff business so you see an expected profit that ll come down a little bit over time and there was a small negative in business group capital it may be a little counterintuitive because it doesn t relate directly back to the group benefits piece on the group benefits piece we saw a growth in stop loss that really supported the overall growth in group benefits expected profit daniel fishbein president of sun life financial united states you ll see some additional growth and expected profit in the second quarter because the way we record this is in the quarter when business is effective it s recorded as new business gain and then it transitions over to expected profit in the subsequent quarters so with such large stop loss sales this past january 1st which was part of the first quarter you re seeing that phenomenon and then we ll see some of that switchover next quarter mario mendonca td securities analyst okay i think that s sort of clarifies it for me if we could think a little bit about experience then and just on the total company basis there were a few items there that threw me off first the other the minus 35 million i think last quarter you gave us a good understanding what was in the positive 38 million have you spoken yet to the minus 35 million i may have missed it i m not sure kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah mario this is kevin morrissey i ll talk a bit about the other we had losses this quarter of 18 million and so that s more in line with what we would expect on a going forward basis and that s similar to what i had said a couple quarters ago what we re seeing in that line are some of the shorter term strategy costs build out of our wealth strategy and digital projects in canada some of that in the u s is related to maxwell health and in the corporate line we also have some projects then related to the ifrs 17 project those totals of about minus 18 million that s more in line with what we d expect in a normal quarter mario mendonca td securities analyst those are minus 18 million so there was just other stuff going on that got you to minus 35 million then kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah mario mendonca td securities analyst sorry i just don t follow you were offering me an explanation of how it got to minus 18 million but the number is minus 35 million is there anything else you can offer kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer the minus 18 million is the after tax number mario mario mendonca td securities analyst i m sorry kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah minus 18 million is the after tax for the quarter mario mendonca td securities analyst i misunderstood kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah mario mendonca td securities analyst okay i totally understand now the investment activities were also very strong is this just a number that we ll see bounce around based on the opportunities to invest the proceeds of sales or new business essentially kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think that s the way to think about that mario that s a little higher than our typical run rate but we were able to deploy some pfi investments with higher spreads against some of our liability segments and that drove the gains kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary yeah and mario it s kevin morrissey i may just add to that you are right that it s going to bounce around a bit with the volume of new business sales as well and so where we have big annuity sales in the quarter you might expect to see that a little lighter in the in force but we continue to source good volumes with good spreads to put against the liabilities kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer if you looked at the total of experience notables 57 million in the quarter the last eight quarters have averaged around 42 million so it is a little higher in total despite the fact that we had the pg e impact in the quarter mario mendonca td securities analyst that s helpful thank you again operator your next question comes from darko mihelic from rbc capital markets darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst hi thank you i just wanted to look for a little more color on the indirect exposure to pg e it surprised me a little bit in the quarter and i guess what i mean by color is i don t really understand where you sit today in other words you downgraded some of these credits by how much what happens next quarter do they go up do they go back down again what is the prospect for more hits coming from this then i guess because i have to go back all the way to q1 2010 to find credit experience of this magnitude for sun life and so on a broader question i guess the question is should i be tracking bankruptcy s for further sort of downgrades and credit experience i guess essentially what i m asking is the upgrade to downgrade ratio that you had this quarter how far off from normal is it maybe i ll just stop talking there and you can provide us with a little more color on this so that i can better prepare for the future randolph brown chief investment officer sure it s randy thank you for the question we have as you know no direct exposure to pacific gas and electric but rather these indirect exposures in the corporate loan book these are renewable energy power agreements where they purchase the power coming off of these production units we downgraded them internally based upon the public bankruptcy of pacific gas and electric and the reason we do that is the rating methodology that we ve used is standard and it is a combination of expected loss and probability of default while we feel economically we have many levels of protection we d have to burn through because we are quite secured in these cash flows the probability of default rose which led to an internal downgrade and therefore strengthening of the reserve if you were to exclude this one name we actually had more upgrade than downgrade and had one of our best credit quarters in quite a long time it is fairly idiosyncratic in nature darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst given that there was a bankruptcy that caused this is this credit now considered also in default even though it s current is there a further downside possibility what happens next if they go through the bankruptcy proceedings does it come back to haunt you later on or does it actually get upgraded i m just curious on where we sit today with respect to this credit dean connor president and chief executive officer from where we sit today it s definitely a complicated workout which we think will take several years pg e is current in all their payments on these contracts and our holdings are all current so that s why you re seeing no impairments on these in terms of the future path as i said there are multiple layers of protection in a bankruptcy and in certain states in particular anything can happen but we think that the probable course is a fairly protracted workout where we think economically we should recover if that s the case you would see these being written up over time if for some reason things turn materially negative which again is not what we expect there is potentially downside on them remember they are producing energy and californians need energy so that s not going away they re producing renewable energy and california has mandated 33 of all of their energy in state will be provided by renewables by 2020 moving up to 100 by 2045 remember these are long dated project so they re not going away then the payments are being passed through to the cost to the ratepayers so it s a complicated situation but based on every piece of analysis we ve done to date we think that it should work out favorably kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer darko it s kevin i think it might help if kevin morrissey talks about how the downgrade impacts the liabilities because this ends up being a significant portion of the investment as well kevin morrissey senior vice president and chief actuary sure darko it s kevin morrissey here when the securities aren t downgraded the actual reserves pick up an increased risk margin in these provisions in the future as randy noted they re quite long term securities so the reserving impacts the present valuing of this extra risk margin over extended periods of time and so that s part of what s contributing to the severity of the impact in the quarter darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay but i guess i don t want to keep beating this dead horse too much longer but it was just a one notch downgrade i don t know this sounds like it must be a large exposure and i guess what s the ultimate worst case scenario randolph brown chief investment officer it s randy darko no internally we had a multiple notch downgrade that we did we have a standard methodology and that s what came out of the probability to default and the expected loss calculation there s a wide range of potential outcomes within any rating as we ve said so it s not that the position itself was in any way particularly outsized for our balance sheet it was the multiple notch downgrade given the duration and the reserving methodology darko mihelic rbc capital markets analyst okay that s very helpful that s what i was searching for great thank you very much operator your next question comes from tom mackinnon from bmo capital markets thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks just a quick follow up i think just to confirm i think you talked about a target licat at sla of 120 and maybe a leverage target of 25 and of the 2 5 billion at the hold co if you can confirm those and at the 2 5 billion at the hold co how much would you be prepared to take that down to 500 million at the lowest level thanks kevin strain executive vice president and chief financial officer tom it s kevin yeah we ve talked about a leverage target of 25 that s correct and we ve talked about keeping a 500 million cash buffer so that second part is also correct we haven t given our licat target ratio there are a lot of assumptions out there that i know different analysts have been making but we have not given a specific target around that but we have given the cash which is how we look at our capital position at the hold co we ve also talked at investor day how much additional cash we d get from going to our target of 25 leverage and then how much in addition to that we could get if we went up to 30 we have significant capital flexibility and the other thing we look at when we think about capital we look at our capital sensitivity and the strength of the capital in terms of sensitivities improve significantly with the movement to licat and that also gives us confidence in different scenarios i think the right way to look at it is that the cash of the hold co 2 5 million and thinking about 500 million to be held as a buffer and then the leverage position and we can move up on the cash thomas mackinnon bmo capital markets analyst okay thank you operator that was our last question at this time i will turn the call back over to greg dilworth for closing remarks gregory dilworth vice president of investor relations thanks mike i would like to thank all of our participants on the call and if there are any additional questions we will be available after the call should you wish to listen to the rebroadcast it will be available on our

amid rising protectionism in some major countries china is well prepared and well positioned to ward off adverse impacts of external risks and shocks including trade tensions experts said to xinhua in recent interviews this is because of china s effective control of capital accounts hefty reserves of foreign exchange forex capacity to avoid overshooting in the banking system resilient indigenous economy and significant progress made in deleveraging as well as ready policy tools at hand they said nimble government controllable debts china has a high savings rate and its debt is predominantly domestical and there s capital controls for outflows so money does not just fly out like that in russia or brazil said tao wang chief china economist and head of asia economic research with union bank of switzerland ubs on wednesday the chinese banking system is unlikely to overshoot in a financial crisis as it is strictly controlled and would not allow the situation getting worse like in the 2008 financial crisis said wang at a media panel discussion china has quite a nimble government which is improving the economy s adaptive capacity and china s leadership will continue to make course corrections when needed according to amy celico a principal of the consulting firm albright stonebridge group regarding the debt problem wang said that china has started to do deleveraging since 2016 and the share of debt to chinese gross domestic product gdp in 2018 declined from the level around 2015 to 2016 according to official data the chinese overall debt level in 2018 was 37 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year less than the record of 38 9 percent in 2015 china s debt ratio has long stayed lower than the 60 percent limit stipulated in the eu s stability and growth pact and far below the 115 1 percent level for the group of seven developed economies wang said china has done well in stabilizing growth and managing debts at the same time today the risk is substantially lower compared to 2016 because of what has already happened in china she said those deleveraging efforts mainly included tighter regulations on shadow banking restructuring of bad debts as well as a reduction of excess supply and excess capacity according to the economist tight control on capital account also helps china avoid a number of financial crises and china should not allow for free convertibility with a forex account said kai lin executive director of emerging market asia forex trading at standard chartered bank recently statistics show that china had 3 09 trillion u s dollars of forex reserves by the end of april 2019 with its holdings of forex remaining over 3 trillion dollars since 2011 increasing home growth momentum growth potentials and resilience of the chinese economy stem from a mixed combination of effective fiscal and monetary policies and the fact that the economy has become more consumption oriented and less export dependent said jorge o mariscal chief investment officer for emerging markets at ubs wealth management wang the ubs economist said she has noted the chinese economic recovery since the start of this year especially in the industrial and the property sector china s economy beat market expectations to advance 6 4 percent year on year in the first quarter according to data from the national bureau of statistics a slew of international research institutions have raised their forecasts on china s economic growth the international monetary fund revised its expectation for china s 2019 growth to 6 3 percent up 0 1 percentage point from its previous estimation in january ubs also adjusted up its forecast of chinese gdp growth from 6 percent to 6 4 percent for 2019 wang pointed out that china s growth has been more associated with domestic elements consumer sentiment is improving property is improving in addition the chinese government s policy composition was more focused on tax cuts and support for the private sector more of a domestic component wang noted referring to current u s china trade tension wang said if the additional tariff goes from 10 percent to 25 percent on 200 billion u s dollars of chinese goods china will still have a decent chance of getting growth above 6 percent this year china is expected to resort to fiscal and monetary policy promoting infrastructure and other fronts if trade tensions escalate further and it s unlikely to see the growth fall very sharply wang said celico said that her company s biggest practice is focused on china as american european and asian companies and non profit organizations want to participate in china because of the potential there she attributed china s growth potentials to its large population improving productivity technology innovation infrastructure and education development as well as untapped private sector
real world negotiation examples can help us learn from the past and avoid repeating others mistakes here s a recap of 10 real world negotiation examples across government and industry that provide negotiation lessons for all business negotiators 10 the mortgage foreclosure settlement in early february 2012 following months of difficult negotiations the attorneys general of 49 states and the obama administration reached a settlement agreement with five of the nation s largest banks aimed at stabilizing the u s housing market and punishing the banks for foreclosure abuses some analysts cheered the agreement as a positive sign that the country was moving on from the housing crisis while others criticized it for helping only a fraction of affected homeowners this reflects the difficulty of balancing multiple goals in complex multiparty negotiations a challenge that stronger communication and negotiation could help to resolve on october 30 2013 the walt disney company made a surprise announcement that it was acquiring lucasfilm home of the immensely successful star wars brand from its founder george lucas for 4 05 billion the acquisition bolstered disney s status as a leader in animation and superhero films and gave it the opportunity to reap huge earnings from the already lucrative star wars media and merchandising empire the deal attests to the importance of trust and relationship building in negotiation according to walt disney chairman robert iger he and lucas conducted the negotiations personally for more than two years 8 salary negotiation laws on august 1 2016 a new law was passed in massachusetts to prevent employers from asking prospective workers to provide their salary history the law also allows employees to discuss their salaries with their colleagues without facing retribution from their employers like similar laws recently passed in other states the measure marks a step toward more equitable and rational job negotiations 7 wins for u s women s hockey and soccer the u s national women s hockey and soccer teams convinced their sports governing federations to fundamentally restructure their labor contracts in 2017 the teams followed different playbooks in demonstrating characteristics of win win negotiation having historically worked for almost no pay the women s hockey team negotiated for a living wage and benefits by publicizing their treatment on social media and threatening to boycott their championship tournament meanwhile u s women s soccer team members took greater control over their negotiation and tried a more collaborative approach 6 amazon s hq2 stunt amazon drummed up plenty of pr when it enticed more than 200 north american cities and regions to compete to host its second headquarters dubbed hq2 but in november 2018 some of that pr turned negative when amazon revealed it had decided to split hq2 between new york city and arlington va where it already has a strong presence many called the auction a farce aimed at attracting privileged data from applicants and the 2 billion in tax breaks promised by new york and virginia also left local politicians and residents crying foul as the story shows negotiation stunts often backfire 5 the chaotic quest for ppe as covid 19 descended on the united states in 2020 state governors and congress urged the white house to put the federal emergency management agency in charge of securing and distributing much needed personal protective equipment ppe coronavirus tests and ventilators but then president donald trump encouraged the states to try to buy and distribute supplies themselves instead the quest for desperately needed supplies and equipment turned into a chaotic free for all a deadly and devastating illustration of destructive competition in negotiation 4 brexit finally in the final days of 2020 the european union and the united kingdom agreed to terms for a post brexit future after four years of bitter government negotiations and impasse to close the deal then u k prime minister boris johnson had to make significant concessions including on state aid to businesses and european fishing rights but the agreement brought widespread relief at the prospect of heading off a possible no deal brexit 3 rivals team up for vaccine production after pharmaceutical company merck failed to develop an effective covid 19 vaccine in early 2021 u s officials asked the company to help competitor johnson johnson bring its vaccine to the public merck agreed to take the plunge after the government offered more than 250 million toward the effort also in 2021 swiss pharmaceutical firm novartis and french drugmaker sanofi helped pfizer and biontech produce their highly effective covid 19 vaccine as these stories show crisis negotiations can harness rivals complementary capabilities 2 covid 19 and broken contracts as a result of the pandemic many deals in progress became inadvisable or impossible to carry out corporate buyout firm sycamore partners tried to renege on buying struggling lingerie brand victoria s secret the parties ultimately abandoned the acquisition and japanese conglomerate softbank pulled out of a deal to buy 3 billion of stock from investors and employees of wework whose office leasing business model disintegrated during the pandemic the crisis highlights the need to prepare for the worst when it s time to negotiate business contracts 1 the west unites on russia sanctions just days after russia attacked ukraine on february 24 2022 the european union canada the united kingdom and the united states announced they would unleash the most punishing sanctions package ever deployed against a single country the result of feverish negotiations that caused the russian ruble to collapse the determination and tenacity of the ukrainian people and their leader president volodymyr zelensky inspired parties in the west to come together what lessons have you learned from these and other real world negotiation examples

are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the company s core operating results and business outlook the non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools the company s non gaap financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the company s operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures further these non gaap measures may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including peer companies and therefore their comparability may be limited the company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non gaap financial measures to the nearest u s gaap performance measure all of which should be considered when evaluating performance the company encourages you to review the company s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure contacts investor relations

compromise national security probably gravest and unforgiving by abdul samad saleem courtesy ceylon today the 8 january 2015 will go down as a date that sri lanka changed forever a country with abundance of resources a multi billion dollar geographical location and unmatched human excellence was destined to become a graveyard sri lankans voted in this government expecting change a change that was perceived to be better promising the sun and the moon to the citizens of this country sadly it was a fabricated move by the so called joint opposition and certain media heavyweights of this country to destabilise and destroy a thriving country under a strong capable and efficient leadership none of the said things in the manifesto did make any sense then nor do they make any sense now what has made sense is that sri lankans were misled used and ultimately killed to fulfil the financial and power thirst of some greedy mudslinging classless politicians directed and driven by their imperialist masters the struggle and the result a complex and decisive election for the unp at the time meant that the party had to field in someone who would appeal to the masses and was worthy in the eyes of the people to be at the helm ranil wickremesinghe was never going to be that personality or man with his imperialist upbringing background and education he would never be able to adopt himself to be the heartbeat of the masses hence maithripala sirisena was chosen as the marketing tool to win the votes a successful strategy from its inception it has perceived to be a herculean task to make this government function polarised personalities views policies meant inefficiencies delays tireless bureaucracy handicapped public administration and national security it started off with a collapsing economy gdp growth which was at 6 7 dropped 3 bringing down the momentum coupled with increased interest rates resulted in a liquidity crunch not experienced in recent history an imf drilled fiscal policy agenda drove taxes higher burdening businesses halting expansion and growth resulting in a falling disgraceful equity market and no job creation making lives miserable for the youth of this country amidst this fall from grace the rupee devalued by about 25 resulting in spiralling inflation and unbearably high cost of living however sri lankans being nice and kind people by birth have tolerated this menace 21 04 2019 saw the darkest chapter in sri lanka s history when more than 250 people were killed and more than 500 shown the way to hospitals why an incapable inefficient and disastrous government did not act decisively on intelligence and compromised national security to the detriment of its citizens high literacy sri lanka has a proud rate of high literacy do sri lankans need a government that cannot protect them and make them live secure and comfortable lives it s beyond comprehension how the people of this country can be so tolerant administrative achievements in this paragraph i would briefly list down some of the key administrative achievements of this government during this time multiple changes in ministries and ministers so much so that it felt like musical chairs at times what promised to be a scientific approach to appointments turned out to be a national joke resulting in poor policy making and administration collapsing the system and the end result trying to push through a reconciliation process and implement a federal system that by no means is convincing or appealing to the masses of this country constitutional changes and the so called reconciliation agenda was made to look like more important than the economy and the general well being of the people once again a well choreographed event by the media and the administration making false announcements have been another trait of this administration the volkswagen factory investment announcement and most recently the oil refinery announcement have all proved to be marred by controversy or proven to be completely untrue or false over obsession to remain in power throughout the tenure of this government it has been a highlight the focus it has given on consolidating power it s rather unfortunate to say if it had concentrated on delivering results remaining in power would have been an automatic consequence mudslinging baselessly accusing prominent figures of the previous administration and in the process spending unaccountable millions and billions on legal infrastructure as of now there has not been a single verdict or desirable result which would have proved worthy of the cause api horu allannawa was the tagline during the presidential elections compromise of national security is probably the gravest and most unforgiving of crimes this administration has bestowed upon sri lankans it s my country my love and my peace that s been taken away by a bunch of incapable public administrators peace that was achieved after three decades of war unparalleled loss of life and mega sacrifices of the tri forces we have been set back by a decade economically and socially sri lanka s flourishing international image is back to doldrums a promise for a better tomorrow january 2020 will bring another opportunity for us to rise from the ashes a sense of new hope to elect someone truly capable to guide this country to its rightful place on the international stage both economically and socially leaving aside my political bias i would try to list out a few reasons why former defence secretary gotabaya rajapakse should be elected to the helm of sri lanka s public administration personality and strong leadership during his stint as the secretary of defence he proved his leadership with seamless integration of policy making and administrative excellence unprecedented infrastructure development and a robust well comprehended national security policy ensured a stable prosperous sri lanka an uncompromising personality and strong leadership with a vision were the cornerstones of this success no nonsense attitude and approach to decision making this is probably the most important trait the next leader of sri lanka needs to have it is precisely this approach that produced dynamic leadership and a result oriented work structure unconventional politician it s probably time that sri lankans take a stance against all conventional politicians and their petty politics their contribution to the country and society has been an absolute curse to say the least america is reaping the rewards of electing an unconventional president its economy is growing at a faster rate than ever millions of jobs are being created companies are starting to come back with billions to invest in manufacturing and knowledge based infrastructure france elected a rookie at the helm and is the second most stable economy after germany in europe decades old and much needed labour reforms are coming to facilitate companies to operate and flourish in a competitive environment close and healthy relationship with china the rajapaksa regime had a close knit and healthy relationship with china much was said about chinese debt which only constitutes less than 10 of sri lanka s total debt balance comprises of debt that came from imperialist institutes such as the imf world bank and adb they are collectively responsible for holding the country to ransom and influencing fiscal and monetary policy making life miserable for the citizens the 80 20 policy the major challenge for a leader is to ensure the majority of the people under him are happy and convinced this was much the case with the previous regime where some decisions taken in the best interest of the country were less appealing to some minorities what we as intellectuals have to realise is a leader s job is not to make or keep everyone happy if one needs to achieve that he or she can sell ice cream by the roadside what needs to be achieved is a framework where a majority of the people remain confident and satisfied the drawbacks like all leaders gotabaya rajapaksa also has certain flaws in his short political stint in its post independent history sri lanka has produced only two capable and result oriented leaders the late president ranasinghe premadasa and former president mahinda rajapaksa what distinguishes both these great leaders from gotabaya rajapaksa is their pro poor policies and their closeness to the masses if gotabaya aspires to be a successful and long term leader of sri lanka changes need to come in policy making and personality to appeal to the masses if people vote for him especially the masses it will not be for him but for mahinda rajapaksa who is pretty much still the people s president gota needs to build and operate on his own image for a successful career in public administration secularism prevails in his approach to politics as a person and writer who has closely followed him i can be rest assured mr gotabaya rajapaksa is not at all a racist in any form however certain elements close to him give such an impression to the minorities a carefully articulated practical policy with the right people in charge of implementation will ensure secularism could be used as a positive vibe as opposed to being viewed as negative for a certain section of society of course the perception among muslims is changing but needs to change faster a decision for the future we as sri lankans in january 2020 need to decide on our priorities do we need a democracy where there is no value for human life a democracy that does bring prosperity or security a democracy that divides citizens with race and religion a democracy that breeds corruption and inefficiencies in public administration the irony is this is exactly what we have today a regressive economy a media that s corrupt and politically financially motivated the interest of the country is the last priority is this what is expected from this government we as sri lankans are equally responsible for what s happening now and what will happen in the future it s our collective responsibility to elect someone who is capable and will deliver on his promises gotabaya rajapaksa seems to be the only public figure who can guide this country to its rightful place on the international stage readers might argue this might not be the best possible time to write an article of this nature but then what is a good a time as a person representing a minority of this country i assume it s my responsibility to bring the best of my knowledge and experience to my people
for more than a decade the hedge fund industry has been going through a major transition where increasingly defensive fund strategies and lower investor expectations have converged to support tremendous net asset inflows but superior returns can still be found by allocators who do their homework and aren t exclusively obsessed with brand name management the hedge fund industry has gone through seismic change due to institutionalization starting at the turn of the century it s hard to remember but before the tech meltdown of the early 00s hedge fund investing was dominated by high net worth individuals and family offices about 20 percent of hedge fund assets came from institutional investors like pension and sovereign wealth funds endowments foundations and funds of funds but in the past decade the sources of hedge fund money have changed dramatically as hedge fund assets have grown from 1 6 trillion in 2009 to 3 2 trillion in 2018 according to barclayhedge the percentage of institutional money has surged sandy kaul global head of business advisory services at citi says over two thirds of that 3 2 trillion now belong to institutional investors climate watch live techonomy climate 2024 april 3 years of technological business and funding efforts may still fall far short of arresting greenhouse emissions especially as we sail past 1 5 c global warming top visionaries discuss the new reality at the techonomy climate west 2024 where innovation meets urgency institutionalization has produced greater disclosure and discipline but for a large segment of the industry this change has significantly altered fund mandates several decades ago the majority of funds were largely characterized by an aggressive search for performance recalls jon hansen managing director at the investment firm cambridge associates since the financial crisis there s been increased emphasis on more risk averse asset management that prizes consistency and capital preservation this shift largely explains why the vast majority of funds have trailed the market over the past 10 years poor investing also hasn t helped matters but in slighting funds protracted underperformance since the financial crisis many industry observers are conflating the monolithic swashbuckling vision of managers past who were willing to make outsized bets on the british pound or distressed bank or sovereign debt with the majority of today s managers who instead are providing various strategy exposures to help investors diversify away from long equity books according to barclayhedge 16 of the 18 leading strategy categories lagged the market s 13 12 percent annualized returns over the last 10 years through 2018 and over the past five years all trailed the s p 500 s total annual returns of 8 49 percent with more than half these strategies having earned less than 3 percent a year over this time feeling challenged by the new normal since the financial crisis many managers have opted for more defensive postures that have collided with external variables including accommodative central bank policies they ve been fueling steady stock and bond rallies without serious correction and reducing equity and debt market volatility the vix in 2017 saw record low volatility nearly half its historical average then came 2018 and the return of volatility for which many managers had been clamoring the majority of strategies did outperform the market which lost 4 4 percent but when tallying the average return of each individual fund the industry still trailed the s p 500 by 75 basis points barclayhedge indices and averages ending december 2018 many managers could certainly be doing a better job and this is taking a toll on the number of active funds which according to preqin declined for the first time in 2018 since the financial crisis as liquidations exceeded launches at the same time the steady rise in hedge fund allocations slowed in 2018 for some allocators the hedge fund industry argument for diversification and uncorrelated market returns haven t been enough especially when managers are collecting healthy fees while passive stock exposure continues to rally and an increasing number of etfs are providing inexpensive market hedges arts culture miami s fusion of luxury art and innovation historic revival and contemporary opulence in the magic city it s our belief says cambridge associates hansen that only a very small number of funds offer the kind of risk adjusted returns that justify inclusion in most portfolios but that doesn t mean allocators should think of hedge funds as some bygone investment relic that largely provides fund managers a living hansen believes the right hedge funds can play an essential role to help balance and smooth portfolio performance over the long run one dramatic example the 1 4 billion alphaquest original systematic macro strategy over the last 10 years through 2018 it has generated annualized net gains of 3 67 percent exceeding global macro and systematic cta returns though still well behind the market s 13 12 percent but due to extraordinary outperformance during the tech crash and the financial crisis the strategy has doubled the returns of the s p 500 since its launch in 1999 aqo s returns over the last two decades explains rick weeks chief investment officer of 1 4 billion advisory vwg wealth management who has clients and his own money in the fund suggests long term performance is more geared to how assets perform during market shocks than how they fare during long term run ups opportunities despite what the industry s broad numbers are saying basic screening reveals a host of really good managers that have been excelling across a variety of strategies for many years with moderate volatility and limited drawdown they ve responded to the challenges of major government intervention crowded trades and limited dispersion of returns in a way that collectively speaks to the promise of hedge funds common traits of successful managers they are experienced astute observers of markets and investor behavior contrarian by nature willing to stick to their convictions and they manage shops whose operations and investor base support their style of investment another common feature is the size of the fund there are very good large funds that have delivered solid returns over many years including renaissance citadel and autonomy being smaller can also be an asset hunting in the sub billion dollar space can turn up unexpected quality with solid operational structure because it can be easier for these managers to excel in tracking a much wider universe of smaller investments in comanaging the 450 million hedged equity anson investments master fund amin nathoo explains we are able to more quickly respond and profit from opportunities across all segments of the market than much larger funds that can t establish sufficient exposure in smaller cap shares anson massively outpaced last year s down market returning more than 19 percent and since the fund s launch in july 2007 it s racked up net annualized gains of 11 8 percent even more telling the last three annual barron s 100 hedge fund surveys were topped by foreign based funds with an average asset size of 543 million citi s sandy kaul has observed rising family office interest in sub 500 million shops building general partnership stakes of up to 25 percent along with limited partnership exposure they are likely establishing these dual positions to tap into both sides of the hedge fund business explains kaul as well as to get a break on lp fees artificial intelligence overwhelmed job recruiters getting sloppy per survey a survey by harris poll and jobs marketplace indeed indicates that dwindling hiring departments are swamped and not very efficient indeed says its ai can help panayiotis lambropoulos a hedge fund portfolio manager at the 28 billion employees retirement system of texas believes in the merit of proven smaller institutional caliber managers to help potentially achieve long term investment goals ers has started a joint venture with paamco prisma to develop a farm system of emerging managers aiming for initial exposure of 250 million to 500 million in several emerging managers over the next three years we re hoping these managers will not only help enhance our performance through their current fund returns but by developing new distinct investment vehicles explains lambropoulos in the structured credit space the 814 million hildene opportunities fund ii comanaged by brett jefferson and dushyant mehra was up more than 9 percent last year and nearly 15 percent annually since its inception in august 2011 and it s achieved this with minimal volatility and drawdown both figures around 5 percent hildene targets value in domestically focused high yield credits of regional and community banks and financials corporate debt real estate and consumer and mortgage debt their complexity can give an edge to investors who can drill down and truly distinguish risk and opportunity explains mehra this is especially true for smaller segments of structured credits which larger firms avoid because there isn t sufficient scale to meet their needs the fund has achieved consistent performance by staying relatively small applying hedges seeking high current yield as ballast and being quick to adjust duration when structured credit markets change when there haven t been sufficient opportunities the fund has periodically closed to new investors and has returned over 150 million in capital another unique feature half the fund s performance fees are not paid to the manager until investors redeem after the financial crisis jefferson heard investor concerns about funds doing well one year crystalizing hefty performance fees then collapsing the next he believes deferring a portion of incentive fees better aligns us with what our investors are looking for attractive long term risk adjusted returns business finance how fair are the olympics economic impacts the olympics can be an economically crippling decision or not if you play your cards right france is sure it has some up its sleeve for paris 2024 one of the more unusual fixed income relative value funds is bob treue s 656 million barnegat fund which has racked up annualized returns of 15 62 percent since he started up in january 2001 like hildene he ll tell investors when he can t accept money because he doesn t see sufficient opportunities in which to deploy it and he s remarkably upfront about his fund s caveats sending an eight point brief to all prospective investors this includes admission that he has no ceilings or floors in using leverage he doesn t employ strict stop loss rules and redemption is done incrementally across nine months in taking the long view that rationality will ultimately close gaps between securities that should be trading in sync treue maintains a large amount of unencumbered cash to meet margin calls and to enable him to add to down positions and his stable investor base understands the process a current investment example in early march 30 year uk gilts were yielding 1 71 percent while an equivalently termed inflation swap was at 3 52 percent treasurys should always pay more than inflation swaps says treue gregg winter s 313 million w financial fund shows diversification is not always essential for solid steady performance launching his shop in july 2003 winter saw a low risk opportunity in timely lending of first lien bridge loans to qualified borrowers with quality new york city properties which banks were unable to address by lending amounts well below a property s market value and with loans being typically no longer than one year in duration the fund has chalked up annualized returns of 9 45 percent with virtually no volatility or drawdown and last year was pretty much the same with the fund up 8 33 percent looking beyond with the turbulence of last year s fourth quarter not far in the review mirror compounded by today s inverted yield curve which may portend recession hedge funds defensive posture may start paying off marc sbeghen head of hedge fund research at the geneva based iteram capital says the firm is becoming more risk averse it recommends reducing investments in directional strategies involving event driven and hedged equity exposure and to increase exposure to more global macro equity market neutral credit long short and fixed income arbitrage strategies in considering a similar pivot texas ers lambropoulos sees two systemic concerns we first saw how fear of geopolitical along with debt and equity market risks got quickly translated into a massive sell off with remarkable velocity during last year s fourth quarter lambropoulos says this year we saw concerns about the u s consumer manifested by the immediate effects of the government shutdown all this suggests greater vulnerability of retail oriented loan and housing markets than most of us realized climate engineering a way out of climate change is looking harder on climate and consumption we ve long thought that tech would let us have our cake and eat it too that s looking less certain many market observers believe the underlying strength of the u s economy and markets will endure for a while longer ca s jon hansen thinks 2018 s fourth quarter turbulence was largely technically driven rather than reflective of systemic threats to the present corporate and economic growth but lambropoulos is more skeptical believing broad market dynamics have broken down we ve seen an explosion of debt issuance and stretched equity valuations along with plenty of events to move prices but a surprising lack of dispersion among assets he notes there are a lot of things that worry autonomy capital s robert gibbins impact of the u s tax breaks will likely peter out after june chinese growth will slow as the country continues to deleverage and europe will continue to be weighed down by structural issues it fails to resolve gibbins says this didn t inhibit gibbin s 4 8 billion global macro fund from racking up tidy gains of nearly 17 percent last year more than 13 percent annualized since he launched in 2003 but these issues suggest a more challenging investment environment going forward his most compelling long term idea continuing reforms in argentina over the next decade could make the country a huge long term out performer climate private aviation aims to go green though berated for its climate impact the private aviation industry is pioneering technologies and programs to limit emissions all the way to zero but gibbins is unnerved by one risk climate change he fears the likely failure to effectively address increasingly destructive weather will fuel higher risk premiums across asset classes which markets are not considering the takeaway from this industry walkabout skillful diversification with disciplined seasoned managers large or small who have proven their ability to read markets well and invest shrewdly regardless of what stocks and bonds are doing will serve investors well but persistent monitoring is essential since past performance is just that eric uhlfelder created and wrote the financial times hedge fund review for four years and managed barron s top 100 hedge fund survey for the last 11 years upon the advent of the euro he authored the book investing in the new europe bloomberg press 2001
may 9 2019 a fresh bout of turbulence hit the ailing turkish economy may 6 when the higher election board quashed the opposition victory in the march 31 mayoral race in istanbul fueling fears that turkey s rulers are no longer committed to ceding power through elections the turbulence is likely to continue until and perhaps beyond the election rerun scheduled for june 23 a series of elections in recent years have increased the fragility of turkey s faltering economy which badly needs structural reform the presidential and parliamentary balloting in june 2018 and the local elections on march 31 however have led ankara to pursue populist measures instead of focusing on reform

financial results after prepared remarks we will open the call for q a i ll now turn the call over to jack fusco cheniere s president and ceo jack fusco president and chief executive officer thank you randy and good morning everyone i m happy to be here today to discuss our results from the first quarter which was another excellent quarter and one marked by a number of successes from continued unparalleled execution of our lng platform to a flawlessly executed maintenance turnaround at sabine pass and financial results in line with our previous forecast this enables me to reconfirm our full year 2019 financial guidance slide 5 presents a summary of key results from the first quarter advertisement advertisement we generated net income of 141 million consolidated adjusted ebitda of 650 million and distributable cash flow of over 200 million on revenue of almost 2 3 billion for the first quarter looking forward to the balance of 2019 today we are reconfirming our full year consolidated ebitda guidance of 2 9 billion to 3 2 billion and distributable cash flow guidance of 600 million to 800 million michael will cover our financial results and outlook in more detail later in the call in the first quarter we produced and exported 87 cargoes a record number and the quarter was highlighted by achieving substantial completion of corpus christi train 1 in late february and sabine pass train 5 in early march the achievement of substantial completion on two liquefaction trains only days apart at separate project sites and both ahead of schedule and on budget is one of the best examples yet of our relentless focus on execution we set the standard for execution in u s lng at sabine pass and we re proud that our reputation and track record are being reinforced as competitive advantages as we begin to bring lng capacity online at corpus christi we have now demonstrated that execution isn t site specific rather it s chenierewide i d like to recognize and congratulate the cheniere and bechtel teams at both project sites for their performance and contributions to the achievement of these milestones commissioning activities began earlier this year for train 2 at corpus christi and we expect to introduce feed gas in the coming weeks we continue to expect train 2 to be completed in the second half of this year ahead of schedule and within budget construction continues to progress very well on train 3 at corpus christi with the overall project about 52 complete as of the end of march during the first quarter we also issued full notice to proceed on the midship pipeline project after obtaining all required regulatory approval and closing the debt financing we entered into the credit facility with total commitments of up to approximately 680 million and expect that project to be completed and placed into service by the end of 2019 turn now to slide 6 where i ll update you on a few priorities as we look forward to the balance of 2019 entering 2019 one of my key priorities for the year was to place trains 1 and 2 at corpus christi and train 5 at sabine pass all into service safely ahead of schedule and on budget advertisement advertisement we re already two thirds of the way toward achieving that goal and as i just mentioned we are on track to achieve it when we place train 2 into service in a few months next we expect to reach a positive fid on train 6 at sabine pass in the first half of 2019 early engineering procurement and site works for train 6 continue to progress under limited notices to proceed to bechtel giving that project a head start in anticipation of fid while fixing the cost and construction schedules pile driving is complete with over 6 000 piles completed and bechtel is continuing foundation work and beginning structural steel erection we are concluding the financing process for train 6 and supporting infrastructure and expect to progress that project to fid in the near term next i d like to address the higher than normal maintenance at sabine pass we re managing this year as you may know we have recently completed a maintenance turnaround on trains 1 and 2 that i d like to highlight first my hats off to aaron stephenson and his staff since the turnaround was executed flawlessly over the course of approximately three weeks over 185 000 man hours were worked and over 1 000 work orders were completed across multiple equipment packages and processes throughout trains 1 and 2 not only was this work completed on schedule but more importantly all of this was completed with 0 safety incidents i d like to recognize the entire production team maintenance and operation teams and all those who helped manage a successful undertaking and for demonstrating that safety is one of cheniere s core values shifting to the next phase of our growth after sabine pass train 6 we re focused on corpus christi stage 3 a 9 5 million tonne per year expansion project in march we received a positive environmental assessment on stage 3 from ferc so that project is progressing through the regulatory process better than we expected we maintain our expectation at stage 3 while all the required regulatory approvals by the end of 2019 we are actively commercializing stage 3 and all is progressing well advertisement advertisement finally a brief update on the development of our capital allocation framework this effort is one of the highest priorities for michael and i and the rest of the executive team as well as our board we ve spent a significant amount of time and effort developing the framework that prioritizes growth investments in our lng platform ensures responsible leverage at our project entities and on a consolidated basis over the long term and provides for the return of excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful and flexible manner we expect to finalize and communicate this framework in the coming weeks in early june we plan to host meetings with the investment community to review these important strategic items we will be sending out more information very soon and we hope to see many of you there and now i ll turn the call over to anatol who will provide an update on the lng markets anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks jack and good morning everyone the lng market is currently undergoing a phase of strong growth as nearly 11 million tonnes of new lng supply was added year over year in the first quarter of 2019 this is the largest year over year quarterly increase since the first quarter of 2010 when qatar s megatrains were brought into service the supply growth followed an equally strong year on year increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 when five trains began production more than half of the total capacity that started up last year advertisement advertisement two of those trains were of course our trains sabine pass train 5 and corpus christi train 1 which reached substantial completion in the first quarter ahead of schedule and on budget the incremental supply volumes in q1 coincided with the reduced appetite for spot lng in asia as a result of warmer than normal winter temperatures and higher storage levels across the region which led to a flat year over year asian lng demand number in the first quarter of 2019 the combination of a temperature driven moderation in asian demand growth and strong global supply growth resulted in record flows into european regas terminals during the quarter q1 imports into europe reached 21 million tonnes more than double the level seen in the first quarter of 2018 resulting in higher storage level increased storage levels have led to lower spot gas prices but have underpinned an increase in gas fired power generation increasing carbon prices have also played a role in incentivizing higher gas fired power generation especially in countries such as germany where ample capacity exists to displace coal in the generation stack as you can see from the price chart on the bottom right and not surprisingly recent lng supply and demand dynamics have combined to shift global gas prices lower year to date however we ve already begun to see asian and european prices rebound as strong carbon prices have provided gas pricing support now please turn to slide 9 to look at some of the regional trends in more detail as i mentioned asian demand in the first quarter was flat through the first quarter of 2018 and decreased slightly from the fourth quarter of 2018 as mild weather and strong storage levels depressed import demand growth temperatures in north asia were approximately 1 degree celsius above normal in q1 resulting in a reduction in heating degree days of over 10 relative to the 30 year average imports from the established markets of japan and south korea decreased by 9 and 20 respectively compared to the first quarter of last year primarily due to ample storage levels achieved in q4 and greater nuclear power generation looking forward we see some positive signals for these markets in south korea 2 3 gigawatts of older coal fired power plants are set to shut down in the first half of 2019 while nuclear maintenance and a change in coal and lng taxes that incentivize coal to gas switching during the back half of the year could spur new lng demand the country decreased taxes on lng and raised them on coal starting april 1 as part of its efforts to curb air pollution in japan five new nuclear reactors totaling 5 6 gigawatts are expected to undergo scheduled maintenance between the second and third quarter advertisement advertisement another four reactors will have maintenance in the upcoming winter looking further out japan s new nuclear regulation authority recently announced news out retrofit extensions that could negatively affect 10 reactors six of which are currently online this increases the uncertainty around nuclear generation output during the early 2020s and could spur an increase in lng demand emerging lng markets in asia exhibited strong year over year demand growth in q1 and helped counterbalance the demand weakness in north asia china s imports were up 28 driven by continued economic growth continuing the significant multiyear growth trend in that country we spent a significant amount of time in china already this year further solidifying our relationships with key commercial decision makers of current and prospective counterparties we remain bullish on chinese lng demand growth and believe henry hub linked lng remains very attractive to chinese buyers especially relative to brent linked lng given current market prices and underweighting of henry hub linked lng into china elsewhere in emerging asian markets pakistan and thailand both recorded double digit growth percentages to support their growing economies and declining indigenous gas supply these countries along with other countries and regions throughout asia such as bangladesh india taiwan and others continue to add new lng regasification infrastructure to allow for larger lng import volumes in the future based on these regional dynamics we have seen jkm fall from around 13 of brent at the beginning of the year to lower end of the five year ranges of april strong supply growth has softened the market and pushed down spot prices we expect lower benchmark gas prices to stimulate a positive lng demand response in the due time to conclude solid supply growth over the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of this year exerted some downward pricing pressure on the spot market as it coincided with the mild winter temperatures and lower import needs from key asian buyers we expect supply to continue to trend upward this year and anticipate europe will absorb a significant portion of that supply growth however we expect the recent softening in spot lng prices to generate a demand response and incentivize gas and lng demand growth in europe and asia when storage levels normalize i ll now turn the call over to michael to review our financial results advertisement advertisement michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks anatol and good morning everyone turn now to slide 11 in the first quarter we generated net income of 141 million consolidated adjusted ebitda of 650 million and distributable available cash flow of over 200 million we exported 310 tbtu of lng from our liquefaction project during the first quarter of which 25 tbtu were commissioning volumes total volumes exported were 25 tbtu higher than exports in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to additional commissioning and post completion production volumes from sabine pass train 5 and corpus christi train 1 partially offset by the planned maintenance turnaround of trains 1 and 2 at sabine pass which began in march and a small impact from seasonal fog in the first quarter we recognized an income 282 tbtu of lng produced at our liquefaction project consisting of 284 tbtu loaded during the quarter plus 25 tbtu or seven cargoes loaded in the prior quarter but delivered and recognized in the current quarter plus 27 tbtu or seven cargoes on a delivered basis that were in transit as of the end of the first quarter we also recognized an income of 18 tbtu or five cargoes of lng that was sourced from third party approximately 80 of the 300 tbtu recognized an income during the quarter or 239 tbtu were sold under long term spas and the remaining 61 tbtu were sold by our marketing function under short and medium term contracts volume sold under long term spas increased from the prior quarter primarily due to increased volumes under certain spa filled by our marketing affiliates short term marketing volumes also increased due to increased production volumes primarily driven by sabine pass train 5 and corpus christi train 1 eight commissioning cargoes from sabine pass train 5 and corpus christi train 1 filling 28 tbtu of lng were recognized on our balance sheet as an offset of 202 million through lng terminal construction in process during the first quarter operating income for the first quarter was 606 million an increase of approximately 90 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 advertisement advertisement the increase in operating income was driven primarily by increased net gain from changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives lower pricing of natural gas feedstock and third party sourced lng and an increase in lng volume sold partially offset by increased volumes of natural gas feedstock lower lng market pricing and increased total operating costs and expenses as a result of additional trains in operation and increased service and maintenance costs from certain maintenance and related activities at sabine pass net income attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter was 141 million or 0 54 per share on a diluted basis an increase of more than 70 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in net income was primarily due to increased operating income and decreased derivative loss related to interest rate swaps partially offset by increases in interest expense and attributable to noncontrolling interest turn now to slide 12 jack mentioned our first quarter financial results were in line with our expectations and today we are reconfirming our full year consolidated adjusted ebitda guidance of 2 9 billion to 3 2 billion distributable cash flow guidance of 0 6 billion to 0 8 billion as we look toward the remainder of the year as anatol discussed we re seeing lower prices in the market and that is expected to impact the margin that impact is mitigated by an increase in our production forecast for the remainder of the year as a result of maintenance optimization and better than expected performance as jack mentioned earlier we have previously discussed developing and communicating a capital allocation framework within the first half of this year an effort that has been under way since last 2018 and continues to remain a high priority for myself and the cheniere team we re also focused on finalizing the financing for sabine pass train 6 and the continued development and commercialization of corpus christi stage 3 we plan to finalize the capital allocation framework in the coming weeks and we ll be hosting some investor meetings in early june to provide more information regarding capital allocation sabine pass train 6 corpus christi stage 3 and how these items impact our run rate guidance we ll have more detail for you regarding those meetings in the very near future that concludes our prepared remarks thank you for your time and your interest in cheniere operator we re ready to open the line for questions questions answers operator and we ll take our first question from jeremy tonet with j p morgan please go ahead jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst good morning there s been a lot of news out there with regards to china trade with the u s and i was just wondering if this uncertainty does this kind of impact the timing that you guys have had with your communication of the capital allocation policy or the spl six fid and if china trade issues are kind of lead to the lng market being at a point where it doesn t make sense to fid ccl three in the near term what would you do with extra cash at that point jack fusco president and chief executive officer so jeremy thanks and thanks for the question so yes i think i continue to look forward to a resolution right of the current trade tensions between the two countries i don t think the trade tensions or the i think that trade tensions and the tariffs are unproductive and create some added costs for our chinese consumers but as a company we are relatively insulated from the current future tariffs and we don t expect any material impacts it has had no impact on us at all on fid ing of train 6 or on capital allocation or any of that as you know out of the 18 foundation customers we were blessed that petrochina is one of them but there are 1 2 million tonnes so it s relatively small in the portfolio and we continue to deliver to that customer and they continue to pay us so it hasn t had an impact on us i don t expect it to have an impact on us either today or going forward jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst that s helpful thanks for that and just a quick one with regards to the cmi sensitivity that you guys have provided for is that still accurate at the 130 number or as the year progress that number is smaller and is 2020 a similar level of sensitivity or is it smaller because you have greater contracted capacity at that point michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer hey jeremy it s michael so yeah with regard to that obviously margin has been a pretty significant headwind for us this year so if you recall in november we said we had about 5 of margin in our plan for 2019 on our last call we said that was that it come down to probably 3 and today it s come down a little bit more it s probably more like 2 with q2 and q3 below that number and q4 probably above that number but averaging out at about 2 so that s the headwind as i mentioned in the remarks we ve had a pretty significant tailwind on the production side so we don t control margin we couldn t really presell these volumes because they were a lot tied to trains coming online which has been uncertain but we do control production and so we said we had about 6 million tonnes in the cmi book this year it looks like that number is probably more like eight and a half given where production forecast has gone for the balance of the year that s really coming from four areas we think corpus christi the first one corpus christi train 2 is looking like it s going to come in a little bit earlier relative to what we had in our plan that we laid out in november still a second half event but a little bit earlier that s driving some production second a couple of debottlenecking things we told you one was nameplate capacity we run corpus a little bit and now feel like that there are some nameplate gains that are going to be above 100 that we ve put in the plan for the balance of this year the third bucket driving production is maintenance optimization which has been one of our pieces of debottlenecking we ve talked about made some pretty significant strides in that area in terms of how we operate the plant which has taken out a lot of downtime days for the balance of the year end and for the rest of the life of the plant so that s driving increased production and then finally we ve seen as the fourth piece better ramp up at the two trains that came on earlier this year so train 5 at sabine and train 1 at corpus so both really hit their stride sooner than we thought so those four things are driving a big production tailwind for us which has made up for much of the a lot of the margin erosion not all of it that s allowed us to stay within our guidance range so really back to your question we said 1 move is a 130 million yes i would have expected that to erode over the year as we produced but since we ve added so much production for the balance of the year that number is still about the same maybe even a little bit higher given the production we ve guided so we re busily putting those volumes away in the market right now we expect that to erode from hereon out but it s still above for every dollar move from here probably plus or minus 140 million against ebitda and then you asked about 2020 don t know that i don t have that sensitivity in front of me i would expect volumes of course the marketing business to be significantly lower given the scds on trains 1 and 2 1 and 5 this year and train 2 next year so but we could probably get you that number later jeremy tonet j p morgan analyst wow that s great thank you operator we ll take our next question from christine cho with barclays please go ahead christine cho barclays analyst good morning everyone i wanted to start on the capital allocation policy maybe i know you re going to give some more color on the specifics but from a high level can you talk about how your thoughts on the priorities of reinvestment stock buyback debt pay down and dividends have changed with the kind of how shareholder preferences have changed the weaker spot market the number of projects that have fid ed in the u s and abroad versus what you may have thought a year ago jack fusco president and chief executive officer christine i ll start that this is jack and thank you and good morning so the capital allocation process as you know our first and foremost is to fund our growth we think we have some excellent growth opportunities and we need to fund that growth near time and hopefully we can continue to fund the growth for the long term but so growth is always our no 1 priority the next one would be our balance sheet i think it s imperative that we strengthen our balance sheet throughout the capital structure and then the last our last priority would be capital return we don t intend to hold the money we intend to give it back to our shareholders in the most tax efficient and effective way that we can and we re going to talk a lot more about our capital allocation strategy going forward in early june but i ll turn over to michael to see if he has anything to add michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer i guess the other part of your question i don t think market conditions have really changed our thoughts around this over the past year as jack said growth is no 1 we have stage 3 in our model that s happening sometime next year i think jeremy asked what happens if it doesn t happen next year what are you going to do with the money i think that s a decision s for next year but right now our plan is to continue investing and grow christine cho barclays analyst ok great and then we saw a period of time where the spot lng prices actually been maybe covered the variable costs of picking up lng from the u s and in the event that we have short periods of this kind of volatility over the near term can you just remind us how much in advance a customer has to let you know whether or not they re coming to pick up a cargo and what kind of penalties there are if they decide to cancel something that was scheduled jack fusco president and chief executive officer so just for clarity there hasn t been any spot cargoes that haven t cleared the u s and made a margin so i just want to make help alleviate that fear that was a fear that you all have had the spot prices have been extremely volatile but to answer the question about the customers and the spas it s a 60 day notice period but we don t anticipate ever having to use that option especially where our feed gas and our long term forecast for natural gas here in america seems to be fairly range bound in the mid to high twos christine cho barclays analyst ok so just to clarify you haven t seen any customers say not pickup cargoes or do any cancellation in the first quarter jack fusco president and chief executive officer no not at all no we wouldn t expect that at all which were they current gas prices are here in america christine cho barclays analyst ok and last one for me can you give us an idea of how much of the marketing portfolio is hedged over the next couple of years maybe how we should think about the cadence or a multi year average and then michael i think you have confirmed talked about this with jeremy s question but just to confirm we shouldn t think that any of the early cargoes are hedged right michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer what do you mean by early cargoes you should talk about christine cho barclays analyst so the cargoes that you guys are producing after it s been commissioned but before the customer contract start michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah right as i said those are hard to presell right because you re never exactly sure when the plant is going to come online we don t want to get caught really short in the rising market so yes those were are more driving our spot book right now we re putting those away now we actually had made a lot of progress on that and then we added a lot of production given the four things i talked about earlier so we re back in a long position as i said in the past i think we generally want to shy away from getting into the status of our book i will always give you guys sensitivities at high level but certainly not in the current year on the multiyear it s always cmi s goal is to ultimately term up and then regrow that book and term up so i guess that s all i d say on that christine cho barclays analyst is there may be like a target that you would like to be in michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer in terms of what contracting christine cho barclays analyst like percentage yes the percentage contracted michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer we ve said in the past 5 to 20 in the marketing book just given where we are on construction and the scds and all that so i think we ll continue to be in that range over time christine cho barclays analyst great thank you jack fusco president and chief executive officer yeah christine i think we ve been extremely successful at using those early marketing volumes to sign up long term contracts right i mean that led to a seven and a half million tonnes of long term contracts or deals last year and you should expect us to continue to do that and lock in those margins and i would expect that it s going to be a little rocky as far as the cmi volumes just because of the dfcds that are starting up and the fact that our construction team has done such a great job and has brought these trains in so early that we ve had all these cargoes to dispose of in the market but that s not the long term strategy for the company christine cho barclays analyst right right thank you operator we ll take our next question from michael webber with wells fargo michael webber wells fargo securities analyst hey good morning guys how are you jack fusco president and chief executive officer good morning michael michael webber wells fargo securities analyst jack i wanted to start first on china trade and tariffs and maybe kind of combining your answer to the first question with something michael referenced a bit earlier but it seems like the existing portfolio sabine 6 capital returns all obviously insulated from what s happening in china and if anything it seems like you have probably some business probably on the go and ready to go once that gets resumed but if we think about what may be what it could impact and just to be specific if i think about corpus stage 3 and then michael your answer about it being in your model for some time next year is it realistic to think i guess do you have enough non chinese based business that you could realistically greenlight stage 3 next year if i guess the current scenario just kind of sits through for the next 24 months are you going to stay with the status quo jack fusco president and chief executive officer yeah so michael i ll start first now china s demand for nat gas and for lng continues to grow significantly year over year they haven t even begun to pierce the power generation side of natural gas so as you and i talked about when we were in shanghai and i saw you on the hallway there their demand is going to continue to grow it s going to get filled by somebody right preferably it s coming from the u s if not it s going to come somewhere else but there s a whole other opportunity if that lng flows away from the rest of asia and europe for us to continue to commercialize i think we have the best commercial team in the industry and it s not going to slow us down on commercializing our stage 3 and i don t know anatol if you have anything else to add anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer sure jack well thanks clearly we ve said before that china is a focus for us it is as jack said a rapidly growing market and a market that is learning every day that its legacy brent linked contracts are less attractive than its potential henry hub linked contracts so we re not shying away from the opportunity that is china we continue to pursue that as you know but as jack said we have a robust level of engagement and we are comfortable that stage 3 is a 2020 event with or without china michael webber wells fargo securities analyst gotcha now that s helpful and just to remind us around stage 3 just given that its handling is going be a bit more flexible i guess than some of the previous trains in terms of i guess parcel size if you will what s the first realistic commercialization hurdle you have for greenlighting i guess part of stage 3 or would you just need to do it all at once jack fusco president and chief executive officer no we could do it in stages and in fact we re currently working with a couple of different epc contractors to see what the options are ultimately but the permit is for the entire project or at least the regulatory filings are for the entire project which is around nine and a half million tonnes michael webber wells fargo securities analyst got you then how should we think about i guess the first realistic commercialization hurdle even if it is just kind of a ballpark figure is it three is it five and a half six something of the order michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah michael it s michael still working through that and it s probably not one seventh it s probably more like half michael webber wells fargo securities analyst sure ok that s fair and just one more from me if you will just on the broader industry the equation in the u s it seems like there s a bit of a bifurcated market equation over the last couple of years where you ve had some buyers maybe kind of entertaining cheap or extremely low cost gas almost just kind of optionality and then you ve got buyers kind of willing to pay more for investment grade quality if you will i m just curious when you look at your mix of buyers over the last three to six months have you noticed any shifts with maybe not a flight to quality but maybe a bit of a shift from buyers that were willing to entertain that kind of extremely cheap optionality starting to dig in a bit deeper with you all or more established options jack fusco president and chief executive officer well ok so we had a shift in our strategy that i don t think many people picked up and that was that we started delivering directly to end use consumers so we noticed that the utilities the international utilities weren t being served directly and that s what led to cnpc or petrochina deals that s what led to cpc in taiwan that s what led to pgnig in poland is our ability to be a full service provider to those utilities needs and that s opened up a whole another opportunity for us as far as creditworthy customer base that are looking for a long term reliable affordable supply and i think so every u s lng either well there s not many of us in operations but every one that s being proposed has a different business model and our business model is to be flexible with what the customers needs are and get close to the customer and deliver whatever aspect they want and in most case here recently it s been the full service provider and i don t know anatol if you have anything to add to that if you re seeing a shift anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer just to build a little bit on what jack said on the quarter back in 1980s said there were only three ways to compete in the commodity market and that s low cost differentiation and niche niche is too small low cost is a business at this point that we re not pursuing and as jack said every one of our deals last year was differentiated you didn t see us do the same plain vanilla fob deal they had more than half had bridging volumes which we spoke to earlier out of the cmi portfolio more than half were on a delivered basis as jack said so deal had components that the team came up with that optimally met the customers needs and those are offerings that today nobody else can come to emulate so that has proved a very successful formula last year and we ll continue to innovate and be commercially accretive as we continue to grow michael webber wells fargo securities analyst gotcha that s helpful i will i ll save my any questions after the call i appreciate it guys anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks michael operator we ll now take our question from shneur gershuni with ubs please go ahead shneur gershuni ubs analyst hi good morning everyone a lot of my questions have been asked and answered but just a few questions here with respect to cmi a lot of focus seems to be on lng pricing anatol you gave a lot of great color about the market and so forth and it sort of seems that a lot of investor focus is there but should we not be thinking about it from net back perspective and i was wondering if you can sort of talk about how the net backs have changed relative to headline lng pricing globally michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer sure and it s michael my comments earlier were all netback based so yeah the 5 that we had in our plan for this year in november was a netback that was reflective of much higher lng prices high single digits probably 10 in the winters that netback has moved down for us the balance of the year to probably more like 2 which as i said is lower than that in the summer months and likely to be higher than that in the winter months so that s the terminology we use also shneur gershuni ubs analyst can you sort of discuss how it s changed relative to the headline price is it been shrinking faster than headline price or expanding faster during seasonal changes i m just wondering if is it a one for one change percentage wise or have you seen differentiations anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer no thanks shneur this is anatol no i mean it s the the big component in shipping as you probably know shipping went to 200 000 a day over the winter that was driven in part by the steep contango we saw in the fall and over 30 vessels that were used short term as floating storage that delivered their cargo and then came back to the market and in the shoulder we saw shipping rates drop down into the 30 000 range and they ve moved up somewhat from that point as michael said winter is on the forward curve are firmer as is shipping in the winter so those are the little two big components and add them up add a little bit of noise and that gives you the netback shneur gershuni ubs analyst ok fair enough jack fusco president and chief executive officer and henry hub has been relatively flat shneur gershuni ubs analyst right ok that makes sense and just in terms of your o m performance obviously that was related to the debottlenecking and some of the turnarounds and so forth do you have a sense of a schedule for turnarounds is it something that should happen every 18 months 36 months just kind of wondering how we should be thinking about them on a go forward basis michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is michael i mean they are planned many months if not years in advance so there was some commentary around us taking down one and two opportunistically that wasn t the case that turnaround had been planned when it happened for a long period of time so they re in varying degrees over time i think the majors are more like six years so we re not obviously not there yet the ones we just had are a little bit more significant but not a major turnaround relative to the 6 year schedule but yes they re scheduled long in advance and i don t think we ll get specific on when the plans are going to be going down we ll just build that into our guidance for you shneur gershuni ubs analyst great and just one final question there s likely going to be a large energy company exiting the s p 500 this year due to an acquisition in your opinion do you feel that lng hits all metric that s p requires to bring that conclusion anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer go ahead randy randy bhatia vice president of investor relations hey shneur this is randy yes i mean as we interpret the requirements for inclusion we do meet them all so it s in our view it s a matter of when not if but we don t control the timing so it will be up to the committee that makes those determinations shneur gershuni ubs analyst great thank you very much guys really appreciate the color today randy bhatia vice president of investor relations thanks operator we ll take our next question from craig shere with tuohy brothers please go ahead craig shere tuohy brothers analyst good morning and congratulations on the great quarter and the great color that you re providing so far michael how does the better operating results this year feed into the planned upsizing of legacy trains and the 300 a tonne cost to make that happen and can you specifically comment on what additional benefits we might see going into 2020 and may be the timing of that spend michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so we have we re out with a 4 4 to 4 9 range for the trains i think on the last call jack said we were aiming for the high end of that range i think the results today and what we talked about earlier show progress to the top end of that range we won t be there this year obviously so we re making good progress and would look to update this whole thing for you when we come out in june as i said earlier the two best parts of the debottlenecking are getting more out of the plant on a nameplate basis that s happening as i said it cost no money and just running the plant more which is what s really driving that upgraded numbers for this year and then finally as i said the third one involves capital we haven t have not seen results from that yet but we re getting some pretty good planning now for that to start to have an impact over the next year or two and so yes i think the number you quoted is still a good number for the investment side of it which will help us to climb higher and higher in that 4 4 to 4 9 so that s what i say now i think in a couple a few weeks when we re out we ll put some meat on that bone for you craig shere tuohy brothers analyst wonderful color and michael one more for you if i m doing the numbers right all the foundation customers were obviously the spls so we can kind of back in the 19 million of corpus christi equity cargo sales hitting the income statement in the quarter but lng c corp operating cash flow excluding cqp and working capital changes was a positive 100 million mind you that s a first positive number versus negative numbers 2q to 4q last year if i do the math that s five and a quarter an m in margin just dividing 100 by the 19 it just seems implausible that equity cargo margins of corpus christi are explaining that robust cash flow at the c corp and i guess i m thinking there s two other possible explanations which includes those third party sourced volume you mentioned or possibly advantaged feedstock pricing in southeast texas can you provide any more color michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer you lost me on some of those numbers i think i can confirm it it s none of those three things right clearly we didn t make five and a quarter at corpus but we did have some hedges on and all that but we didn t make those kind of margins third party wouldn t have done it either and i think anatol can talk about our sourcing margins but we didn t have any blowouts there on the positive so i think we have to go on the phone with randy afterwards and figure that out for you craig shere tuohy brothers analyst fair enough no other thoughts about the sourcing anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah we keep going back and forth on this there s nothing meaningfully different from our run rate we buy from over 100 producers we don t have spec pipeline capacity and we re pretty good about having a lot of resources we have a great team that balances the plants every day but as you know that is done at the project level and at ccl it was very early days a lot of volatility the market is volatile production is volatile so that was not a meaningful contribution on the ccl side but we do think that the tremendous effort we have on that side of the plant is a financial and a very important strategic advantage for us going forward but no we re not getting our hands on 9 and the whole waha molecules craig shere tuohy brothers analyst understood thanks anatol and congrats to the team anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks craig operator we ll take our next question from jean salisbury from bernstein please go ahead jean salisbury bernstein research analyst hey good morning it seems like recently fid ed lng projects i m kind of thinking golden pass and lng canada less has been definitively sold to real downstream buyers and more to portfolios or not yet sold i think that s raising some concerns among investors i talked to that this could drive lng overbuild in the next wave is that something that concerns you or do think it s the too early to say that that s the trend jack fusco president and chief executive officer well i think it s too early to say that s a trend i mean those are very specific sites and projects that have been either working or are in the hopper for an extremely long period of time lng canada it actually has off takers equity off takers that are real utilities associated with it there s a sliver there that s shell is hanging on to which is a portfolio sliver but not much of it and then golden pass with the qataris and exxon they could basically do whatever they want to do but that s a relatively small project right at that 14 million or 15 million tonnes in the grand scheme of things in the whole lng market worldwide but anatol i don t know if you have anything to add anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer well we are concerned it s a very competitive market as wood mackenzie says this lng market isn t getting any easier so that s why we continue to innovate continue to come up with solutions that allow us to maintain this very highly contracted posture we will not invest or grow our platform without it but we think we will have it and we ll continue to grow on that basis so we re not competing in the merchant lng space anytime soon jean salisbury bernstein research analyst and then as a follow up it seems like midship pipeline has been successful so far would cheniere have any interest in building or operating a pipe connecting the permian to the gulf coast lng demand or is there a turn on that just not competitive versus cheniere s other options michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s michael i mean we always look at that kind of stuff we have an active pipeline group but when there are 20 other people trying to do it we ll just focus on core business which is liquefaction i mean midship was a unique opportunity and it s a great project and it s well under way but we didn t see that same kind of opportunity coming out of permian we make a build or buy decision on all these things and right now it s much easier for us to just contract with kindreds of the world who do a fine job on that jean salisbury bernstein research analyst make sense that s all for me thank you michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator we ll take our next question from danilo juvane with bmo capital markets danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning and thank you one quick one for me with respect to capital allocation i appreciate that there are a few buckets that you re considering but did i get correctly that capital efficiency is what you re going to prioritize for the capital return buckets michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we said we re going to prioritize growth yeah danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst no i get that though but within with this capital return component was capital efficiency paramount with respect to the options confined to just shareholder returns michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer i m not sure i understood that danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst i m sorry was tax efficiency michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer oh tax efficiency yeah so in regard tax efficiency in regards to giving back to our shareholders on the shareholder return absolutely danilo juvane bmo capital markets analyst that s my only question thank you operator we ll take our next question from michael lapides with goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question just a follow up on capital allocation i went back and looked at your proxy and the reality is you guys probably don t really have true peers like if you look at the peer groups in your proxy it s got a mix of purely regulated utilities to pipeline companies that have gone to multiple years of kind of quasi force deleveraging how should investors as we walk into the june meeting think about how you and how the board are looking around and saying what are your real true peers from a leverage standpoint from a potential cash flow generating standpoint and from just a broader business structure standpoint jack fusco president and chief executive officer yeah so michael that s a good questions so when you say you have the frustration that i have is there s a couple of different peer groups so iss uses one peer group that is heavily loaded with regulated utilities glass lewis uses a different peer group and then we have our own peer group in our peer group and our proxy we try to get a lot of regulated utilities out of there because those aren t the folks that we re competing with day in and day out and it s not the way we compare ourselves to it so there aren t many true peers that have our long term contracts with creditworthy entities so when you look at midstream that s not quite a good fit with us in most cases and we tend to lean toward larger energy companies that we compete with day in and day out as our peer but i don t know michael do you have anything to add michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean it is difficult there s not we re not in anybody else s peer group by the way so it is something we struggle with the agencies are going to compare us to very high quality midstream and infrastructure companies so michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you guys much appreciate it michael wortley executive vice president and chief financial officer ok thanks michael operator we ll take our next question from fotis giannakoulis with morgan stanley fotis giannakoulis morgan stanley analyst yes hello and thank you for taking my question i would like to ask you about the competitive landscape particularly here in the u s we ve been hearing that some of the asian buyers they might be over contracted the henry hub volume and we see at the same time some of the newcomers in the space trying to position themselves offering index linked volume or brent linked volume can you give us comment about your potential interest in taking this type of contracts and if you can hedge these contracts and what kind of difficulty these parties that they offer these contracts which are not linked to henry hub they might have in getting financing for their projects jack fusco president and chief executive officer so i ll just tell you fotis i ll start and then i ll hand it over to anatol so i was in asia the last two weeks and traveling around asia visiting with real customers real utilities and i got to tell you it was pretty clear like anatol said in his comments that they appreciate now what the henry hub linked contract can deliver to them how gas prices in america and henry hub in particular are very flat and stable and could be hedged out for over 10 years in very liquid market and they re feeling the shock the oil shock and the oil linked shock of lng so i ve got a warm reception that is just the opposite of what you said that a lot of the asian buyers now are looking for henry hub linked product not the other way around but i ll let anatol handle the other indexes and what he sees in the marketplace anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah thanks fotis we ve always said that we re sort of the henry ford right you can have our lng very commercially creatively but it s always henry hub we ve also said that we re working on ways to change that the challenge is as you know is nobody can hedge both sides of that in size for term so you need to come up with a way to source based on the same index that you are then selling on so that s the challenge of course we re all well aware of the transactions that had been announced potential transactions that have been announced and we ll see if there is a path to find the other side of that fotis giannakoulis morgan stanley analyst and a follow up for me i would like to ask you about your volumes that have already presold i noticed that you reported 236 tbtu of long term agreements which is quite higher than the spa the 20 year spas that you have announced in detail can you give us some more color about your portfolio of contracts beyond the 20 year spas anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer well as michael said we do have a strategy to manage the risk that we re walking into for the year or two ahead as you know 19 is an exceptional year we always knew it would be an exceptional year with three trains starting up we ve talked a lot about what a great job the team did of bringing them online early that said the cmi portfolio and michael gave you the numbers of that incremental volume in the portfolio so whatever percentage we thought we had laid off going into the year clearly was much lower in reality because of the volumetric outperformance but we do have some midterm volumes and we do have some bridging volumes that are not part of the long term deals and those are starting to feed into the book that is outside of the long term spas so yes there are other components in there but they will be relatively lumpy and opportunistic again as we ve mentioned before more than half of our long term deals last year included these bridging volumes fotis giannakoulis morgan stanley analyst thank you very much anatol anatol feygin executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks fotis operator we ll take our last question from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning everyone jack fusco president and chief executive officer hi julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey i m just following up a couple of details quickly i know you already elaborated to a good extent on cmi marketing volumes for the year with respect to 2q just perhaps give a little bit of the puts and takes if you will i know you affirmed 19 but just how what should we be expecting here particularly given the depressed jkm and global trends we re talking about and then maybe if i can fill the second question and just for the sake of time very quickly jack you alluded to investment grade counterparties what kind of metrics are they looking from you now in turn as you shift your contracting focus here if you can elaborate a little bit jack fusco president and chief executive officer so first julien as you know we give you an annual number and then we give you our run rate numbers with our contracted portfolio as strong as it is we re not going to give you quarterly numbers so you all can do the math on a quarterly basis for guidance and then lastly as you know we re investment grade at sabine pass we feel very comfortable that corpus with train 2 that hopefully we will get to investment grade relatively quickly and that s where a lot of our trading happens either our long term contracting with the spas or our gas supplies done at that level i do think though it s imperative that we look forward as part of our capital allocation strategy and we look to strengthen our balance sheet throughout the rest of our capital structure and that s what michael intends to talk in detail about in june julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst well that s a great place to end it thank you jack fusco president and chief executive officer thanks julien operator at this time i d like to turn the conference back to our management for any additional or closing remarks jack fusco president and chief executive officer look everybody i m very appreciative of all the support that you ve given cheniere and thanks for your interest we look forward to talking to you again in early june operator duration 62 minutes call participants randy bhatia vice president of investor

begin our quarterly review adam adam david portnoy ceo president md director thanks tim and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 which ended on march 31 we reported adjusted net income of 8 2 million or 0 50 per share this quarter s operating results reflect the repositioning efforts we have helped facilitate at certain of our client companies over the last several months to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their operating results and future prospects we believe these efforts will have positive long term benefits for both our client companies and rmr but in the near term these efforts have created headwinds for our operating results even though some of our client companies stock prices were negatively affected during the quarter as a result of some of our repositioning efforts our client company operating fundamentals remained positive this quarter for example rmr ranged over 1 7 million square feet of leases on behalf of our client companies this past quarter these leases resulted in average rental rates of approximately 8 higher than prior rents for the same space and have an average term of eight years rmr also supervised approximately 20 million in capital improvements at our client companies during the quarter some of the more noteworthy highlights across our client companies include the following industrial logistics properties trust was especially busy this quarter as it recently closed on over 900 million in acquisitions and reported significant leasing activity ilpt s 900 million in acquisitions were the result of two portfolio deals that were more than 70 funded by recently entered into mortgage financing in hawaii that we discussed during our last earnings call as it relates to leasing ilpt announced 271 000 square feet of leasing activity this quarter which resulted in weighted average rental rates that were 15 8 higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average lease terms of over nine years ilpt completed rent resets for 483 000 square feet of hawaiian ground leases which resulted in weighted average rental rates that were 28 higher than prior rental rates these positive developments in ilpt continued to reinforce our belief that the ilpt story is one investors continue to underestimate office properties income trust continued moving forward on the strategic initiatives of de leveraging through asset sales and active property management this quarter since january 1 opi has closed on 268 5 million of property sales and entered into sales agreements representing over 28 million for another three properties in addition opi announced leasing activity of more than 825 000 square feet and weighted average rental rates that were 12 8 higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average lease terms of 7 5 years these de leveraging activities and leasing momentum should position opi well for future growth and the latter part of calendar year 2019 for the eighth year in a row hospitality properties trust raised its quarterly cash dividend by 0 01 to 0 54 per common share during the quarter hpt also acquired the 335 room hotel palomar in washington d c for approximately 142 million in april senior housing properties trust and five star senior living restructured their business arrangements to both maximize the value of snh senior living portfolio and stabilize five star snh s largest tenant as part of this restructuring snh agreed to convert its leased senior living portfolio into managed portfolio with five star and five star will issue about 85 ownership to snh shareholders as a result snh reduced its quarterly dividend and announced strategic dispositions of up to 900 million to reduce leverage when completed this new arrangement will ensure the long term financial health of snh and five star as well as allow snh and its shareholders to participate in five star s performance in the future completion of this transaction requires approval by five star shareowners the related parties and insiders currently own more than 50 of five star s outstanding shares at this time tremont mortgage trust has fully deployed its opi ipo proceeds and recently announced that their quarterly cash dividend would be raised by 0 11 to 0 22 per common share to ensure loan origination momentum rmr has recently increased our commitments to tremont s credit facility from 25 million to 50 million this credit facility is intended to be a bridge until additional equity capital can be raised this facility provides tremont with almost 200 million of investing capacity on a leverage basis and we ll provide tremont greater flexibility to execute their business strategy and keep its origination network engaged until additional capital can be raised tremont recently filed a registration statement with the sec to raise additional equity capital and any secondary offering remains subject to the sec s review and ultimately market conditions due to sec rules we are unable to comment further or take questions about any possible offering by tremont looking forward possible rmr growth strategies remain focused on three core areas first we are always focused on organic growth at our current client companies second we are continuing our efforts to diversify and grow new vehicles that will leverage private capital and third we hope to leverage our balance sheet to identify strategic acquisitions and seed new client companies on the private capital front starting in 2019 we officially launched our marketing effort for the rmr office real estate open end fund in conjunction with our third party sales team as i ve highlighted in previous calls this fundraising process will likely be lengthy and we don t expect to have any news around capital raising until later this year at the earliest nevertheless we have made contact or met with over 100 potential investors so far this year and believe we are making progress in our fundraising efforts depending on the pace of future acquisition opportunities we continue to expect rmr s 100 million commitment to the fund to be called in the later half of calendar year 2019 we ended the quarter with approximately 384 million in cash and no debt while i cannot speak to specific opportunities we continue to assess opportunities to possibly further diversify revenues and put our balance sheet to work management and our board of directors continues to believe that using our balance sheet to grow the organization with a longer term view remains a higher priority than other options such as using capital for special dividend or stock buybacks in terms of possible acquisition opportunities we continue to focus on growing our real estate securities management platform and we ve recently expanded our search to include real estate private equity firms i look forward to providing more details on future calls as this process evolves i ll now turn the call over to matt jordan our chief financial officer who will review our financial results for the quarter matthew p jordan cfo treasurer thanks adam good afternoon everyone management services revenues were 42 6 million this quarter which represents a 4 million decrease on a year over year basis primarily from lower base business management fees due to declines in the average market capitalization of opi and snh partially offset by acquisition related fee growth at ilpt on a sequential quarter basis management services revenues decreased almost 5 billion from lower base business management fees due to declines in the average market capitalization of opi declines in construction management fees tied to lower capital spend at the managed equity reits and lower ta non fuel revenues as a result of the sale of the convenience store business for the quarter ended march 31 2019 all our managed equity reit except for ilpt are currently paying monthly base business management fees on a market capitalization basis the impact of being on this lower measure for calculating our monthly base business management fees results in a lost revenue opportunity with revenues this quarter being approximately 7 million lower than they otherwise would have been on an invested capital basis turning to expenses for the quarter total compensation and benefits expense was 30 6 million which includes cash compensation of 29 million 1 2 million of non cash share based payments and 400 000 in separation costs cash compensation of 29 million is an increase of approximately 1 million both on a year over year and sequential quarter basis these increases are primarily attributable to overall headcount additions as well as standard wage and benefit inflation as it relates to cash compensation and reimbursements from our client companies our recovery rate remained at 43 this quarter looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2019 we expect normalized cash compensation to be approximately 29 million for the quarter and we are projecting 200 000 of severance costs next quarter related to retiring rmr executives g a expense this quarter was 7 1 million which we believe represents a normalized run rate so i d like to highlight our board of directors issued the annual share grants in april all of which vested immediately accordingly our third quarter results will include incremental g a costs of approximately 750 000 in closing i d like to reiterate that rmr and its client companies are now well positioned to benefit from the repositioning and restructuring actions we ve facilitated over the last six months in future periods we believe potential growth from the capture of lost revenue opportunities at our managed equity reits organic growth at our client companies and rmr s growth strategies should hopefully make this quarter s financial results a low watermark for rmr in other words we think there is more upside potential rather than downside risk to our operating performance going forward to that end we are projecting total management and advisory service revenues to be approximately 45 million for each of the next two fiscal quarters an increase of approximately 2 million from this quarter s results this projection takes into consideration the current share prices of our managed equity reits projections of when strategic disposition activity will occur projected capital spend at our managed equity reits and ilpt s recent acquisitions that concludes our formal remarks operator would you please open the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question today will come from mitch germain of jmp securities please go ahead mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst thank you adam i appreciate your thoughts about diversifying and growing the revenue stream i m curious you know your in office your in hospitality healthcare industrial are there any other asset classes that you think i mean given the bandwidth of the organization i can understand the hesitancy that maybe had for retail but are there any other asset classes that might make sense for you adam david portnoy ceo president md director hi mitch thanks for the question i think from an asset class the big one that we re obviously not in is multi family residential i mean you could make an argument that our senior living portfolio is related to multi family because people live there but it is different than traditional multifamily that s the obvious missing piece in terms of our assets under management you mentioned retail that s an area that we have some exposure to but i think could be an area for also expansion going forward you could do that through acquisitions and or lifting outlets say a team from another group so there s many ways we could think about getting into those sort of asset classes and we are thinking about that as we think about acquisitions and growth initiatives for the company mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst what about growing the amount that you managed property management obviously maybe looking more toward third party management for other landlords is that something that you ve considered adam david portnoy ceo president md director it is definitely something we have considered and thought a lot about i ll tell you that the property management business is typically not a very high margin business and it s large the people that have been successful with it have largely tied to business to leasing brokerage and sales brokerage business oftentimes the property management is a lost leader to get those other parts of the business and i think it continues to be an advantage for our client companies that we say we only do in our property management facilities management in and around clients of rmr that where our clients own real estate and i think that provides a tremendous amount of focus on the client companies and so i don t think we have definitely thought about it but i don t think it s an area that i m particularly focused on in terms of growth mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst great last one from me i might have missed it i do apologize but i was just curious about the fundraising initiatives with the third party capital initiatives with the office fund and how that s moving along and what about the deal pipeline there adam david portnoy ceo president md director so great question we did talk a little bit about it in our prepared remarks since the beginning of the year we have met with or made contact with over 100 potential investors several of those meetings and contacts are ongoing we this is a long sales cycle and it s our first fund focused on private investors it s a new market for us i continue to believe that we will be successful here and i continue to believe it will take us a while i don t certainly till the end of this year till i would expect us to have any news around meaningful additional investors but i think we re tracking toward our expectations that we originally outlined we originally outlined it was going to take us time but i think we re tracking to that and i also think we re working very hard in putting all our energy behind it and i think we ll be successful ultimately mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst and so that would be tied to any future growth is that the way to think about it adam david portnoy ceo president md director yes we think accessing private capital is a part of our future growth yes mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst so not much in terms of deal flow that we should expect from that entity until the third party capital is committed adam david portnoy ceo president md director no i understand your question better now okay yes we still believe that there will be there s still capacity just based on the commitments and leverage that we can put into the vehicle that i would round numbers at least 200 million maybe more buying power today in that vehicle absent any third party so yes i didn t understand the question before mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst no i appreciate it i didn t ask i asked it wrong the first time thanks i appreciate it operator our next question will come from bryan maher of b riley fbr please go ahead bryan maher b riley analyst yes good afternoon so it s a little frustrating as i m sure you well know where the shares are trading relative to what many of us believe is the underlying value is there anything that can be done with your increasingly large cash ph award the kind of throw down the gauntlet and kind of show investors that you really believe in names like opi and snh and kind of maybe buy shares into rmr i don t know if it s 1 million 2 million 3 million shares you re going to earn a great return in the meantime as if and when the shares recover and further align yourself with those entities have you guys given any thought to that matthew p jordan cfo treasurer short answer is we ve given a lot of thought to that but we have come to the conclusion certainly i don t think our thinking has changed i think our thinking has been consistent on it although we continue to think about it we continue to believe that the capital that rmr in the balance sheet of rmr is best used to think about diversifying and growing the client base rather than investing in current client client base your question is a good one it s something that we think about everyday but today there is no strategic shift we continue to be focused on using our balance sheet and cash to diversify revenues grow our client base and that s the focus bryan maher b riley analyst and when you think about the kind of challenging years that opi and snh have this year not so much from operationally challenged just a lot to do with the asset sales and in the case of snh switching kind of the structure and with five star which of those are going to be more time consuming for you a management company and which one do you think is going to be more heavy lifting and why adam david portnoy ceo president md director they re both they are all time consuming for the organization in organizations large enough that i think you can quite easily do it we re just as good at selling properties as we are buying properties and to be honest with you i don t see the sales at opi and their assets versus let s say the sales that snh and their type of assets being one being meaningfully different difficult i will tell you maybe with one exception and it s a small part with maybe within the snh portfolio and i m sure the management team at snh would agree with me the stand alone sniffs which we don t have a big portfolio of anything is heavily reliant on medicaid and we don t have a lot of those those are probably the hardest but everything else there is nothing particularly harder or easier about any of the other potential asset sales and the only thing i ll say about the stand alone sniffs is it s not a lot of dollars or a lot of communities it s a relatively small part but if you push me to say what s the hardest those are probably the hardest to sell bryan maher b riley analyst and so as all of us kind of finish earnings here and we ve listen to the calls particularly with opi and snh and we listen to the ceos and cfos talk about the prospective cap rates to which these assets are going to be sold and then when we look at the cap rate and the implied cap rate of where the shares are trading i know the goal is to de lever those entities but at what point do you say that the gap between where we re selling assets at 6 or 7 cap and our stock s trading at a double digit cap rate did not redeploy some of the proceeds to buy back some stock at these ridiculous level adam david portnoy ceo president md director yeah it s a tough situation because both the companies that are selling assets are focused on selling assets snh and opi they need to sell those assets to delever and maintain their investment grade rating i don t think those companies given where they are could afford to take any of that cash and not delever if they were to use that cash into continue to lever up in terms of taking out stock i think that would that s not something i think those two companies or the boards of those companies would be particularly favorable upon i mean i think the investment grade rating is incredibly important to both snh and opi and deleveraging those companies is the priority and so i don t see in i don t think the conversation around stock buybacks is really going to even be seriously debated until leverage is in check and we ve maintained and we ve got confirmation that the ratings are secure bryan maher b riley analyst and how long do you think that process plays out is it a back half late in 2019 scenario that you get that comfort adam david portnoy ceo president md director i think our goal is that all the disposition and deleveraging happens by the end of this year bryan maher b riley analyst okay thanks adam operator operator instructions our next question will come from owen lau of oppenheimer please go ahead kwun sum lau oppenheimer co inc research division analyst hi adam hi matt thank you for taking my questions could you please provide more color on the real estate private equity funds in your expanded search what is the strategic rationale of this type of fund what is the target size of this fund and any more color at this point would be very helpful thank you adam david portnoy ceo president md director sure so it s a good question what we re looking why we have expanded our searching in and around private real estate private equity funds is that we believe we will be successful in growing our own private fund capacity but there may be an opportunity to reprog or really turbocharge it if we could possibly partner up or acquire a fund shop to put round numbers around it i would say would need to be as shop that had meaningful assets under management i m not thinking this is not hundreds of millions of dollars that have to be billions of dollars under management in the space and it would really have to being something where let s say the private equity firm was there a stage in their growth where partnering with us would basically allow them to sort of turbocharge their growth meaning they might be of certain size but if they were to become part of let s say rmr and we re a 30 billion dollar organization in 35 offices around the country a large employee base focused on real estate that by partnering with us are working with us they would be able to sort of turbocharge their own capital raising and from our perspective it would sort of accelerate the growth of that part of our business for us so that would have to be the both parties what they would be getting out of it and again i think we would be thinking something meaningful if we did there not i don t think we would achieve what i m trying to articulate if it was a relatively small private equity shop it would have to be mid size what s mid size it s multi billion dollars in size and i think that s the way we re thinking about it and you know we having conversations with folks but you never know how these conversations will work out and of course there is a lot of social issues involved in those types of conversations and so we are hopeful that we can maybe do something there but i m not sure we will be able to kwun sum lau oppenheimer co inc research division analyst that s helpful and just to be clear you are looking for 100 equity stake instead of partial equity stake or even joint venture right i just want to make sure adam david portnoy ceo president md director i would inaudible our preferred structure is a 100 ownership i think we would accept a control stake so more than 50 we would if in the right circumstances but i do not think we are not interested in a minority position or necessarily just a joint venture it would be minimum a control stake kwun sum lau oppenheimer co inc research division analyst that s perfect finally a modeling question maybe for matt managed operator revenue it s a little bit light this quarter compared to last quarter and also same quarter last year what are the key drivers of that and also is this quarter a good run rate going forward thank you matthew p jordan cfo treasurer no it s a good question there is seasonality that plays in their own when i talk about the 45 million in projected revenues the next two quarters a chunk of the 2 million or so increased approximately 700 000 of that is the managed operators increased revenues the ta business tends to tends to pick up the next two quarters inaudible has had some renovation activity so you should definitely not model off solely this quarter s run rate kwun sum lau oppenheimer co inc research division analyst okay that s very helpful that s it from me thank you very much operator ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to adam portnoy for any closing remarks adam david portnoy ceo president md director thank you for joining us we will be at the b riley fbr conference in late may we also look forward to updating you on our progress during the fourth quarter conference call operator that

so you re on your own in the real world with the full time job and salary to match you ve got a decent credit history you re paying off your hecs debt and you want to know what else you can do to maximise your finances you re even starting to think about saving for retirement and maybe even buying a house one day but how do you actually do all of that at the same time here are some tips for setting yourself up for financial success make a debt repayment plan if you have any outstanding debts you ll need a plan to pay it back if you don t now is the time to get serious about it first don t be a money ostrich confront your debt figure out how much money you owe to what lenders and at what interest rate and write it down on one sheet of paper or in an excel sheet then sit down with your spouse or partner if you have one and determine what your financial priorities are you need to make sure you re on the same page when it comes to aggressively repaying debt or saving for something else concurrently then rank your debt in terms of interest rate credit card debt will likely have the highest rate and should therefore be your highest priority to pay off if you have credit card debt check your bank website for any tools that can help if you find yourself in debt on more than one account be strategic about the order you pay the accounts off says says john ganotis founder of creditcardinsider com you ll minimise the amount you pay in interest fees getting you out of debt faster if you pay off the account with the highest interest rate first if you have just student hecs debt consider what it would take to pay it off faster rather than leaving it to your tax return if you re racking up credit card debt see if you can transfer the balance to a card with a 0 per cent introductory rate and check all of your loan agreements to see if there s a penalty for prepayment which could negate the benefits of paying off your debt early you may also decide that you d rather tackle the smallest bill first regardless of interest rate to give yourself a confidence boost from having paid something off in full and that s fine as long as you have a plan and you know what your priorities are master these personal finance clichés there are a few personal finance standbys that you ll want to master the first automation automating your savings is the easiest way to make sure you re doing what you re supposed to do financially speaking humans are prone to error and short sightedness automating a deposit into your savings account each month is a simple and proven way to circumvent your instinct to spend money as soon as you get it you should also be minimising fees as much as possible automation incidentally can help you with avoiding late payment fees on various products but banking and investment fees are your biggest enemy here banking fees are simple enough to avoid but it can get more complicated with your investments roi tavor ceo of nummo com a financial management platform says to watch out for the following transaction fees the trading fees associated with buying and selling securities trailer fees an annual commission paid by the fund manager to the firm managing your money as an ongoing thank you for investing your assets in their fund order routing fees how a fund manager places trades has a cost impact while some routes are cheaper than others that cost might be charged back to you foreign exchange commissions charges that apply when you exchange dollars for another currency like euros or pounds mark ups the investment manager might round up the price of securities when trading making the trade more expensive than it should be account inactivity fee can apply if your account falls below a certain minimum balance account maintenance fees for services like tax reporting and recording contributions late fees can apply when payments are overdue front end load commission or sales charge that applies at initial purchase of an investment typically mutual funds exit costs charges that apply when closing an account you won t be able to avoid all of them but investments should have expense ratios of no more than 0 5 per cent many great funds are much cheaper than that next know your worth what you re earning now will influence what you earn for the rest of your career as money magazine notes the typical worker s wages grow the most between ages 25 and 35 according to research by the federal reserve bank of new york a pay boost of 5000 when you re 25 adds up to 600 000 more in lifetime earnings a study by researchers at temple and george mason universities found so if you re starting a new job ask for 5000 more than they offer you particularly if you re a woman if you ask in a respectful way they re not going to take the original offer away and you just might end up a lot richer in the long run it might be awkward but think about it an uncomfortable five minute conversation could net you over 600 000 it s definitely worth it and finally your lifestyle choices really will make a big difference on your bottom line sure a bigger starting salary will be much more helpful than cutting back on fancy coffee drinks but where you live what you buy and who you surround yourself with will also play major roles try your best to limit your impulse spending and be more deliberate with where your money goes get comfortable investing your money people in their 20s and 30s are holding too much cash according to a few recent surveys by financial firms but as i wrote in my money newsletter now s the time to embrace risk you re young enough to ride out any dips the market will take and the younger you are the further your money will go because your earnings will compound if you re just starting off that will mean adding voluntary contributions to your super for retirement experts recommend contributing 10 per cent or more to your retirement savings each month but if that s not realistic start saving what you can but commit to bump up your savings one per cent per year until you re contributing 10 to 15 per cent suggests joleen workman principal s vice president of retirement and income solutions here s more on committing to improve by one per cent candice sherman vp of product development at lexington law says to think of saving as another monthly bill that you need to pay something as small as 25 per month will exponentially grow over time and the sooner the better says sherman then steadily increase the amount every few months the longer you keep your retirement money invested the more it can grow with the magic of compound interest hey i just wrote about that when you re investing keep it simple and boring focus on minimising fees maximizing your contributions to the extent that you can and diversifying what you invest your money in low or no cost index funds will get the job done figure out your priorities it s time to get serious about your goals and financial stability that means beefing up your emergency fund and considering what your other priorities are do you want to own a home someday have children you d better start putting some money away for a down payment there will never be a right time to start saving so if you re waiting for that you ll be waiting an awfully long time says principal s workman life only gets busier and more complicated so take a little time to set yourself up for success again if you have a partner sit down together and decide what your priorities are maybe you want to pay down your own debt and then put any excess toward your retirement fund or a once in a lifetime vacation maybe you d prefer to forego the lavish wedding estimates on how much you should have put away at any one time vary and will be dependent of course on your income and personal situation i m not going to tell you to save double your income by the time you re 35 for example but a house retirement your kids schooling it s all going to cost something and the money isn t just going to appear in your bank account so sit down and take some time to figure out what you want out of life and how much it will all cost then start making a plan recognising that trade offs are going to occur you re going to give something up in order to get something else because for most of us the amount of money in our bank account is finite decide if buying a house is right for you you ve likely already considered this if you tackled the goal section above but for many people a house is the biggest purchase you ll ever make and has a serious impact on our lifestyles and well being it deserves extra scrutiny an expensive housing market has made owning a less attractive investment than it once was a slowdown in the housing market means homes aren t appreciating enough to beat or even keep up with inflation if your chief priority is wealth buying a house might not be the best available nvestment the stock market will provide much higher returns than your home based on historical data says oscar vives ortiz a certified financial planner and wealth strategist at pnc wealth management but if we look at it from a different perspective it s like forced savings the more money you have to pay toward your mortgage the more you re building in home equity it can be a good investment from a behavioural standpoint still a house isn t just about wealth accumulation for a lot of people many of us dream about the white picket fence expansive backyard and three bedroom home to raise our children in no matter how bleak the outlook is you ll have privacy stability and a place to call your own like so many other financial decisions buying a home isn t just about the bottom line nor should it be your home is for living and your investments are for saving for the future says holden lewis nerdwallet s housing expert if you have to choose between living in a home that makes you happy but has low investment potential or living in a home that you don t enjoy but is a great investment choose happiness your home isn t a means to an end it s an end unto itself so consider where will you want to live for the next decade or longer how much money do you need for a down payment and how can you save that much will you be able to keep up with the upkeep costs in retirement could renting in a more desirable location actually be a better investment additionally figure out how a home plays into your career and living aspirations if you settle down and buy a house that may limit the career opportunities available to you you re less likely to be willing or able to relocate for a job says ortiz if you re someone who knows where you want to live and are growing a family then it would make more sense to buy a house take bigger risks when you have a solid foundation once you ve built up your savings and your retirement investments you can start having some fun rodrigo guara ceo of co founder of stockpitch a value investing research tool says his best advice for younger investors is to go against their youthful tendency of only embracing risk stability is important sure you can take chances on innovative companies that are just entering the market that you believe will be here for a while but you should only really do so after you ve built a well diversified portfolio says guara this is why as boring as it sounds the way to go from being a young investor to a wealthy adult is to put most of your resources into stable vehicles that will grow slowly over time this might seem counterintuitive when you consider that many millennials are holding too much cash but what guara is saying is that you shouldn t take huge swings before you have a solid foundation for example you don t want to raid your savings to invest in your second cousin s hot real estate tip once you re making a decent salary and have put away a fair amount for a rainy day you can start playing around with investing in individual stocks and the like if that s something you re interested in don t try anything fancy he adds if you re not trying to outsmart everyone you re already ahead of most people create a financial plan for having kids the cost of raising a child from birth through age 17 is over 250 000 according to the this study having children isn t just a financial decision of course but you don t want to get started on a family without a plan if you can help it you ll also want to consider the costs of taking time off work to actually have the baby as your paid parental leave probably won t cover it and though it shouldn t be the case this matters more for women research indicates that women s salaries diverge significantly from men around the age of 32 coinciding with when many women leave the workforce to have children once you leave work to have a baby and maybe take some maternity leave or a few years off to care for your kid your earnings never recover that has profound effects not just on your annual income but on your retirement savings general investments and more childcare too is wildly expensive particularly if you re not getting a subsidiary this isn t to dissuade anyone from having a family and of course there s no magic number to hit financially speaking that will make having a child easy it s simply to encourage you to consider how a child will change your financial life learn to forgive yourself and move on everyone makes mistakes especially when it comes to money waiting to start investing digging ourselves into debt taking a job that pays us less than we re worth but if you don t show yourself compassion when you mess up you ll never get on the right track the truth is you can only plan for so much and even the most financially responsible and well off among us trip up given there are no do overs in life the best thing to do is acknowledge your mistake try to fix it and keep going if you re in your 30s with no retirement savings the best thing to do is still to get started now if your student loans fell into default the best thing to do is pay them off now and try to make your payments on time in the future if you overspent on something last month or sold an investment too early or had to pull money out of your emergency fund forgive yourself and move on

call but please join me in welcoming ronnie and congratulating him on his recent promotion moving on to our results this morning we announced our 33rd consecutive quarter of year over year revenue growth despite continued challenges with what is becoming a recurring negative weather pattern while the weather has a significant influence on our results i think there is more that we can do to improve our performance with our decision to moderate the pace of acquisitions in light of our leverage it has given us the opportunity to redirect our efforts and focus on process improvements and integration rationalization which will further improve our results these process improvement initiatives will help us leverage technology to fortify the strength of our market positions and improve our operating margins allowing us to be more agile in our operating response to short term pressures while positioning us to capitalize on the robust demand in all of our regions when we reported our year end 2018 results a few months ago we stated that our outlook and the overall fundamentals of the business were much stronger than some observers would have led you to believe although the financial markets particularly in our space have improved over the past several months we continue to believe the current market valuation of our business does not support the fundamental strength of our market position in each of our core markets nor our current position in the cycle there remains a solid runway of demand in all of our regions supported by an 8 1 million cubic yard backlog positive trends in the overall construction market historically low unemployment continued low interest rates and strong consumer sentiment we expect these fundamentals to remain in place throughout the remainder remainder of the year and into 2020 for the quarter we reported total revenue of 333 million up 1 6 over prior year with adjusted ebitda of 34 5 million during the first quarter of 2019 ready mix volumes of 2 1 million yards were down about 1 over the prior year quarter while our aggregate volumes of 2 5 million tons were up 17 over the prior year quarter despite the increment weather in the first quarter especially in california our adjusted gross profit was up 5 over the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margins expanded by 60 basis points a significant driver of the positive momentum in operating profit was the growth in our higher margin aggregate segment on the of the 2 5 million tons of aggregates sold during the quarter we generated adjusted ebitda of over 10 million for the segment more than double the prior year quarter and a record for aggregates in the first quarter polaris led the aggregate segment improvement with year over year increases in volume and adjusted ebitda of 25 and 106 respectively our u s virgin islands operations also showed meaningful improvement as the islands continue to recover from the 2017 hurricanes needless to say we remain extremely bullish on our continued growth in this segment and remain on track with our plans in polaris turning to our ready mix concrete results it was a challenging quarter for already mixed regions particularly in northern california where the weather related headwinds once again took their toll however despite the headwinds our volumes were relatively flat for the quarter while our overall average selling price increased 2 from 136 99 in the prior year quarter to 139 60 in the current quarter gross profit margins in the ready mix segment contracted for the quarter largely as a result of the inefficiencies caused by weather and time plant relocation expenses in new york overall our ongoing focus will be on our strategic initiatives our processes and our utilization of technology to more effectively manage and respond to the ever changing impacts of the weather labor and raw material inflation may have on our margins these initiatives have the attention of every manager in our organization and we are optimistic and excited about the potential they will have on increasing our profit and driving transformational change within our organization now i ll turn the call over to ronnie to discuss our regional operations ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer thank you bill i appreciate the kind introduction earlier and look forward to continuing to work with you to improve value for our shareholders in order to more effectively drive our strategic initiatives within the organization i recently reorganize our operations management team these changes will allow us to more effectively evaluate manage and drive our strategic initiatives within each region beyond organizational changes we ve been actively developing and implementing our proprietary software where is my concrete which will help manage multiple processes within our concrete business including customer and project level management truck tracking billing and overall data analytics the successful development and rollout of where is my concrete will allow customers to gain transparency around their deliveries and projects and will help improve our collective decision making throughout the entire manufacturing and delivery process as part of where s my concrete we have developed a proprietary customer relationship management tool that is focused on our needs as a concrete producer as well as those of our customers it is designed to enhance the customer experience and bring significant value to them by providing them with real time information as well as utilizing defined processes and key metrics internally to drive targeted margins on future work being quoted in all markets as we slowed the pace of acquisition activity we experienced over the last six years we are taking the opportunity to evaluate every aspect of our business and develop operational financial and technical initiatives within each region and segment of our business that will change the way we operate these initiatives will improve our operating leverage our customer service our business processes and most importantly improve our ability to operate more efficiently in our seasonal industry i would now like to take you through our regions and highlight some of the key areas that are driving our results our west region which consists of northern california ready mix operations as well as our polaris aggregates represented approximately 26 of our revenues this quarter demand remained strong in northern california markets across all sectors sb1 infrastructure projects continue to enhance the demand of our ready mix concrete and aggregate products as more new projects have begun we are seeing major construction projects in san jose the heart of our local operations san jose state recently broke ground on a 160 000 square foot science building and the city of san jose broke ground on 135 units affordable housing project additionally in the bay area our backlog includes google mountain view project inaudible linkedin south bay sfo terminal 1 and adobe north tower office building the performance of polaris continues to exceed expectations and determines the pace at which the business had ramped up volume and revenue for the first quarter were up 25 and 24 respectively and adjusted ebitda more than doubled from the prior year s first quarter we we re on track to hit our projections for polaris supported by the demand coming from northern california southern california and hawaii and also continue to entertain inquiries from china korea and more recently another pacific rim country we are pursuing increased permitting for our ship terminal and anticipate finalizing in the upcoming quarter the new permit will allow us to ship over 9 million tons of our current load out facility on vancouver island we also continuing to plans to develop the black bear quarry which will further increase our overall production capacity we remain confident with our projection to ship over 6 million tons of aggregates in the current year and continue to see further upside in this business our central region which includes all of our texas oklahoma and usvi represented 39 of our revenue this quarter dallas fort worth our largest market in this region continues to see significant population growth with a steady stream of corporate relocations to the area like toyota j p morgan chase and most recently allstate insurance recent estimates show that dfw led the nation in new residents from 2017 to 2018 with more than 30 000 homes constructed last year making dfw the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country and ranked by realtor com as the place with the most new home construction in the nation this will certainly affect commercial residential and infrastructure construction in the metroplex with nearly 2 000 dot projects planned and under way we continue to remain very confident with demand in this market the west texas ready mix markets also continue to be a significant contributor to our results supported by strong demand performance across all sectors commercial and residential construction is showing increased demand and adding to a healthy backlog infrastructure is also very active with major projects planned for the rest of the year the abilene school district anticipates spending 250 million on infrastructure through their fiscal year the permian basin rig count remains at elevated levels and our portable division has multiple project pipeline throughout the remainder of the year with further enhanced vertical integration from our recent acquisitions in the region we are growing stronger operationally and look forward to seeing this market thrive on the aggregate front in texas we successfully broke ground on our greenfield sand and gravel operation operation mw ranch located south of metroplex we anticipate being fully on line with the state of the art production facility in mid to late summer of 2019 we also will be enhancing our recently acquired sand and gravel operation operations in amarillo texas which will add needed capacity as well as lowering production costs in the east region which includes new york new jersey philadelphia and dc virginia represented 35 of our revenue this quarter new york governor andrew cuomo continued his support of local infrastructure spending by signing the 175 billion state budget that adds funds to the metropolitan transportation authority this represents another effort by the states to address their infrastructure investment needs another major win for infrastructure funding in the region came from american airlines and british airways who committed 344 million to expand the john f kennedy airport as part of a planned 13 billion redevelopment at jfk this relieves the port authority of new york and new jersey from having to fund the expansion and allows them to address other infrastructure needs in the region the real deal a publication focused on real estate news ran an article on the 10 largest towers under way in new york city and of the 10 listed u s concrete participated in eight of the 10 depicting a very strong franchise for the high profile private sector work in washington d c and northern virginia demand remained strong across all sectors with commercial residential and infrastructure projects all actively represented amazon hq2 is advancing as expected with the recent signing of the initial agreement by two major development sites with over 4 million square feet in the crystal city area as you can imagine this incredible addition to metro dc creates the need for appropriate infrastructure to support the 25 000 jobs that will be coming with hq2 earlier this year virginia approved 195 in funding for infrastructure projects with specific improvements plan to support the needs of hq2 in northern virginia loudoun county labeled the world s data center hub residents and the construction are equally benefiting from the data center boom which is driving economic growth the reduction in real estate tax rates and raises for county employees each of our markets present their own positive outlook for continued building and growth reaffirming our bullish outlook for our construction markets now i d like to turn the call over to john to discuss our financial results john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks ronnie as bill mentioned we generated year over year quarterly revenue growth for the 33rd consecutive quarter with total revenue of 333 million for the first quarter of 2019 adjusted ebitda of 34 5 million was down slightly from the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to weather related headwinds in our northern california market where the weather was most impactful during the quarter our adjusted ebitda was down 5 7 million from the prior year quarter in addition we incurred 850 000 of onetime costs associated with the relocation of two ready mix plants in brooklyn a new location that will be more cost effective and operationally efficient our adjustments for the quarter relate primarily to stock compensation acquisition related costs and the loss of trucks damaged in the fire for our ready mix business our material spread margin was 48 6 for the quarter and our material spread on dollar per cubic yard basis was 66 94 sg a was 9 6 of revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 9 8 in the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda excluding stock compensation and acquisition related costs was 9 1 of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 8 4 in the prior year quarter primarily reflecting the impact of increased marketing expenses severance and certain personnel related costs adjusted gross profit margin increased 60 basis points in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year quarter as our high margin aggregates business continues to become a larger part of our consolidated results in 2019 we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 27 for the full year and our interest expense is expected to be in the 45 million to 47 million range as of march 31st our total debt including current maturities was 709 million this included 608 million of senior unsecured notes due 2024 70 million outstanding on a revolving credit facility and approximately 93 million of other debt consisting mainly of equipment financing for new mixer trucks and mobile equipment net of 9 million in debt issuance cost in addition due to the implementation of a new lease accounting standard effective january 1st 2019 we reported 76 3 million in operating lease liabilities as of march 31st which are now on our balance sheet in accordance with the new terms of the accounting standard the implementation of the new standard had no impact on our first quarter cash flows as of march 31st we had total liquidity of 225 million including 24 million of cash and cash equivalents and 201 million of availability under our revolving credit facility at march 31st 2019 our net debt to adjusted ebitda was 3 6 times we remain focused on reducing our leverage in the coming quarters as we focus on managing our costs and using our excess cash to pay down debt we continue to have solid liquidity position and no near term maturities associated with our senior notes or abl facility moving onto our cash flow and balance sheet during the first quarter of 2019 we generated 21 9 million of cash provided by our operating activities as compared to the 25 9 million in the prior year quarter we generated 15 1 million of adjusted free cash flow compared to 19 5 million in the prior year quarter we will continue to focus on managing working capital and capital expenditures in the coming quarters to generate increased cash flow however i would like to remind you that in 2019 we expect to make approximately 17 million in contingent consideration payments associated with past acquisitions and an additional 23 million will be used for the expansion of reserve at one of our sand and gravel operation that is contingent on various permit approvals during the first quarter of 2019 we spent approximately 7 2 million on capital expenditures primarily related to our plants and machinery equipment to support the continued demands in our markets compared to approximately 8 4 million for the same period last year for the full year of 2019 we anticipate our capital expenditures to be in the range of 60 million to 70 million including equipment acquired through capital leases but excluding capital for the development of the texas aggregates quarry additionally we are still on track to receive reimbursement from the government in the second quarter for eminent domain costs associated with the relocation of our washington d c operations our cash flow from operating activity is expected to be in the range of 50 to 60 of adjusted ebitda we continue to see a robust demand environment as we head into the peak season of 2019 and anticipate continued solid cash flow generation along with sufficient liquidity to support our ongoing operational needs i ll now turn the call back over to bill william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer thank you john turning to our outlook for 2019 although our first quarter fell short of our expectations due to abnormally wet weather in california and some unforeseen onetime costs we are confident in the strong fundamentals solid backlog and overall demand environment in all of our regions as such we reaffirm our guidance for 2019 with total revenue of approximately 1 6 billion and adjusted ebitda in the range of 205 million to 225 million with a midpoint of 215 million we remain bullish on 2019 and are optimistic about the benefits we expect to see from our operational initiatives in a vibrant economy we believe our extremely talented employees equipped with high quality assets operating in well structured markets possessing close customer relationships all align to drive significant positive improvement in our operating model and performance metrics will result in increased shareholder value thank you for your u s for your interest in u s concrete we would now like to turn the call back over to the operator for the question and answer session questions and answers operator operator instructions your first response is from trey grooms of stephens trey grooms stephens inc analyst hey good morning everybody it s trey grooms william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer hey trey good morning ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer hey trey trey grooms stephens inc analyst so just kind of taking a step back on and looking at the margins here clearly kind of a tough quarter with from a weather standpoint and i understand that impacted but you had some other things going on but as we kind of look at input cost inflation and then also kind of the ready mix price outlook that you guys have in any other factor that are kind of moving around how should we be thinking about the material spread and margins on the ready mix business as we look through the rest of the year ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer hey trey this is ronnie thanks for the question i would say first let s start off with comparing to the producer price index for ready mix concrete across the entire country the producer price index was down 1 year over year our ready mix pricing was up 2 and so i think we re being able to pass along material cost i think where you re seeing and what we re noticing is why we have our operational initiatives are our ability to control the variable side and it is difficult with the weather that we did experience it is difficult with the driver situation that we face across the entire country with the guarantee pays that we have for our drivers and all those things that we talked about in the past but with these initiatives we are putting in place i mean we are going to really focus on three key areas so the first area will be labor one of our biggest input cost is labor and labor just doesn t impact these drivers it s labor cost for drivers mechanics back office employees and overall process side of it the other one is raw materials our ability to not only negotiate and maintain the spread that we get with our buying power which we continue to have but it s also the use of those raw materials and mix optimization and making sure that we are following the prescribed mixes and then the last one is on the commercial side is really pricing improvement and some of that just leadership in our markets and what we need to be doing blocking and tackling with the commercial side and the other is the improvement with our customers relationships management tool that we are currently in development of and that tool will give us a lot more insight into not only the things we are doing internally from an operational standpoint but also our customer behavior and trying to capture more value around how customers not only treat our equipment but the ordering behaviors their placement behaviors and all the things that influence our pricing so i think overall we re trying to get more control and appreciate your question trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right thanks for that ronnie and that kind of leads into my next one on the development and rollout of where is my concrete that you guys have been working on i guess last several months what s the timing as you kind of looking at the rollout there and what s the opportunity that you see with that ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer so timing wise we are fully online with where is my concrete as the dispatching system for the atlantic region then next one will be california and we will do that over the next three to five months california will be rolled out and then texas would be after california the crm it s separate but it s together but we are going to roll out the crm on a different schedule we rolled it out in d c and it s kind of a test it was a smaller market for us to do and then now we are rolling it fully into the atlantic region and then california would be next and timing wise california would it will probably go a little bit ahead of the dispatching system and then texas would be behind that as far as opportunity goes i mean when i talk about initiatives the initiatives are not around system but the systems are the tools to give us the analytics to measure the impact of our ability to successfully drive these initiatives so it is a tool for us to be better be smarter be more predictive and i really use the words in the ready mixed industry not just u s concrete the overall ready mixed industry were very reactive we react a lot we show up everywhere we react what we need to be is more predictive we need to be able to understand forward looking orders forward looking weather forward looking impacts of labor and that s what the tools going to give us is more predictive analytics around pricing decisions around labor around labor savings around how we schedule i mean all those things that we show up and do on a daily basis today we re just being more reactive and we need to be more predictive so i think that s the greatest opportunity it s going to be more controllable and allow us to capture more margin through those controls trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right thanks it sounds pretty exciting and then i guess the last one from me is just the mentioned 23 million potentially being spent pending i think approval expanding some reserves at one of your texas sand and gravel quarries any more data is that a new quarry or expanding existing any other detail you can give us on that maybe the timing of when you d expect something on the approval john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer so trey the 23 million is in relation to our quarry in new jersey and it s an existing one that it s new reserves that will be added through that one the mw ranch that i referred to in texas is a greenfield operation and we re under construction right now set to be in operation mid of late summer 2019 so those are two separate things the 23 million was only referring to pit reserves at quinton our sand and gravel operation in new jersey trey grooms stephens inc analyst okay thanks for clearing that up sorry i misunderstood well thanks for taking my questions i ll pass it on thanks and good luck john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you your next response is from scott schrier citi please go ahead scott evan schrier citigroup inc analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask a little more broadly speaking on all of these internal initiatives to improve your cost structure can you talk about what we re thinking in terms of cost to implement i know you talked about some of the timing but overall maybe some of the magnitude of the benefits you anticipate and perhaps how that incorporated into your guidance william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer so as far as cost to implement the initiatives it s all internal it s all internal staff we re not bringing in outside consultants to do this we ve got teams put in place in every region we ve got corporate representatives from corporate that are working directly with those teams so it s all internal as far as this systems goes we re developing that all internally our own internal it group is responsible for that so they re working hand in hand which is really what gives us the greatest level of confidence in what we re doing because we re developing this as a ready mixed company this is not something that we re just going and buying some off the wall off the shelf program and trying to make it fit ready mixed is what we ve done in the past and we re in so we re our ability to control that but the implementation cost is really just our internal efforts and it s our day in and day out people it s not we re not hiring new people to do that scott evan schrier citigroup inc analyst got it thanks and then as we think about the your previous answer to the material spread margin and the improvement can you speak to the cadence through the year we might see the improvement in the material spread and just walk us through mechanically is there a lag between the price increases by the aggregate producers and then your ability to put your prices through are those more tying with the cement price increases so if you could just walk me through well how maybe some of those lags might also have impacted the material spread margin and the timing in which we should see it improve john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer and so scott with respect to q1 we re seeing about a 0 60 improvement in our material spread on a 1 for cubic yard basis improvement i would expect to see that continue as we go throughout the year when you re looking on a margin basis we were down 20 basis points in q1 i would expect that to be slightly flattish maybe down but as ronnie mentioned with respect to our initiatives we re going to offset a lot of that material margin and to shift some of that material margin is mix as well so those two should certainly offset it and as you look at our guidance for the remainder of the year versus where we were last year you re going to see improvement in each of the coming quarters over prior year results so you re going to see an overall improvement in our bottom line ebitda margin numbers william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer and scott one other things that i d like to add to that is the fairly flattish material margin spread in first quarter was actually a good outcome when you think of the shift of the mix shift of volume from our highest material spread area california to one of our lower ones or lowest in texas so that mix shift for us to overcome that and stay relatively flat was a good outcome just because of the math trey grooms stephens inc analyst thanks for that bill that s helpful and one more from me on the comments on slowing the acquisition strategy which you ve obviously done over the past several quarters with leverage where it s at are you thinking about is there a level of leverage that you ve got to and then you start to maybe look for more acquisitions or are we sort of slowing down for this cycle and going to focus this free cash flow that you generate on perhaps some of these internal initiative that you spoke about quarry expansions and more organic opportunities instead of going back out into the acquisition market thank you john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer sure scott and that s a good question obviously we are focusing internally now as ronnie had mentioned these are fairly low cost there is very limited incremental costs associated with that with those self help programs as far as slowing down the acquisition pace in our target leverage we ve always wanted to be in the mid two s we re working our way slowly down that way i think we came down from a 3 9 to 3 6 on our leverage this quarter we do look at the cycle but the interesting problem right now or conundrum is that they re still remains a big disconnect between public and private valuations that when ready mixed producers or even private quarry producers are making more ebitda than they have for sure in the last 10 years some more than they ve made in their entire life they don t want to hear that they re value has been significantly diminished as the stock market has diminished our value as well so it s very difficult to meet seller s expectations in the new valuation world so that s one problem of getting good deals out there and we are obviously always aware of where we are in the cycle our leverage relative to that but we re not going to say we re stopping if we find compelling one off deals and we try to find deals that don t attract an option do not attract strategic investors that are accretive and additive to our strong regional positions we will still selectively do small bolt ons that will be very accretive but we are aware of our leverage and where we are in the cycle for sure trey grooms stephens inc analyst great thanks a lot for that bill and good luck gentlemen william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer sure scott thank you operator thank you your next response is from craig bill of cjs securities please go ahead craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst hi guys so could you talk about you have the internal focus on improving margins with greater efficiency it sounded like most of those initiatives are directed toward kind of gross margin how long does this play out and how high is up william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer as far as how long does it take to implement or are you telling me how long they better be everlasting craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst how long does it take to implement and are we talking about like a plus a 100 basis points or plus 50 or john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would say it s probably going to be in a 150 range 150 basis points to 200 basis point range we think there is that amount of opportunity there overall and it ll take more than the next four quarters we re talking 12 of the potentially 24 months would ultimately play out we see a lot of opportunity when all the things that ronnie mentioned out there as far as actions that we can take and just improvements on the things that we have seen in the past year which we think are low hanging fruits that should allow us to achieve these results so it s the initiatives are near term but as ronnie said it s going to be a continuous improvement environment where we re not going to stop we think there is a pretty steep slope going upwards in the coming quarters but we ll continue to push even after that as well william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer and craig i d add to john s comments on some of these initiatives that we re talking about especially with technology being the tool are really transformation and we re talking about changing not only people s behaviors but the way they think in the concrete industry because at the end of the day our process is the way we price the way we deliver all these things are going to be looked at and the amount of data that we have today and then we will be gathering in the future to make it smarter that s good but if we don t make better decisions with it and really is meaningless so that s really where when john talks about the timing of this it s really transformational and so it s not something that you snap your fingers and all of our people wake up overnight and make these decisions because we re really changing the way we look at every aspect of our jobs craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst and do any of your competitors have anything like where is my concrete john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer two other dispatch systems out there we believe where is my concrete gives us a distinct advantage because of it being developed by a concrete and us being able to drive the changes the growth of it the modifications to it and really drilling down into things that drive our business so embedding our own kpis with our own goals within a system that helps us make better decisions we think is key there is other job that they are developing their own portal systems their own customer relationship tools but they re more tied mainly to raw materials and not specifically the concrete so we think we have a very distinct advantage around the technology that we re developing craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst okay so you have a new the greenfield scene in gravel plant and outside of dallas it s going to open this summer at some point that s going to take your percentage of internally sourced sand and gravel from what to what john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer the immediate impact isn t going to be that significant in the current year because we re going to be balancing some of the sand and gravel that we have from other internal sources so our internal consumption is still going to be in that 30 to 40 range over longer term you ll see some improvement of it but i wouldn t say there is going to be that much in 19 craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst okay and then inaudible where he had raised prices for ready mixed in dallas in april is that sticking and are you guys getting acceleration in price in q2 william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer as far as ready mixed pricing craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst yeah john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i would and craig you re familiar with how that works and so i would say we ve got good momentum going with project by project market by market and that s our focus as to where it s ready mixed is so much different then cement and aggregates we don t it s not one price in this date everything happens at once so we re our intentions are every single project every opportunity we re looking at raising prices and that s where we re going to continue to focus on craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst and then rephrase within do you have more momentum in q2 than q1 john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer i think momentum will be there yes craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst okay great and then lastly it wasn t that long ago they were spending a lot of time talking about very tight situation for truck drivers where does that stand now or is it smoothed out john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer it continues that problem or that it s not even a problem now it s just part of our lives i don t foresee that ever going away truck drivers are always going to be in demand and we continue to have strong programs around recruitment strong programs around training strong programs around retention so we re focused on all areas of it i think we re doing an excellent job and our hr group is focused on that we just had a driver symposium two weeks ago just focused on the next generation of drivers and things we can do to attract them and so it s always going to be a focus craig and that problems never going to go away craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst okay great all right thanks a lot william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you your next response is from adam thalhimer of thompson davis please go ahead adam thalhimer thompson davis and company analyst hey good morning guys and ronnie welcome to the call hey i wanted to start with just a decision to maintain the annual guidance can you maybe talk about what you saw in april where would the other trends out there that you re seeing that encourage you to keep the guidance where it was john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean when you look at q1 and the impact that the weather had in northern california we ve already seen that begin to turn in northern california so we would expect a rebound there is some pent up demand that we feel that we ll be able to satisfy in q2 so i look at the sequencing especially of the expectations out there obviously we re going to make some of that up so it ll be a slight upward revision i would expect by some of the analysts to cover it but our guidance of 215 we still very feel very confident in and being able to achieve for the full year so even as i look at the numbers what i said back in february with respect to the guide the initial guidance that we gave q2 be the tightest which is i think what is out there with analyst expectations and then q3 and q4 we would expect to see some meaningful improvement so we re comfortable with the full year guidance we don t see any need to change it the near term look that we have suggest that we should be able to make it up and we didn t see a need to revise or to change the direction at all adam thalhimer thompson davis and company analyst all right that s helpful john and then i wanted to ask about the ready mix pricing which was up nicely year over year sequentially despite weather in california high priced market for you guys how do you expect the price per cubic yard to trend through the year john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer i would say we would continue on that trend i mean we re again in each market with different reasons for it for seeing momentum in all of our markets for pricing and like i said we look at every single project every opportunity and focus on both overall price but also the margins that provides and so it s a mix when it comes to what bill talked about earlier with the success of us being able to overcome the lack of volume in california because of weather and still overcome that with lower priced markets in texas but i would say that momentum is going to continue william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer and adam i would like to add one point to that is you have to understand it that we ve built this company differently than other ready mix producers in the country either private or publicly traded we specifically chose the markets we are in and we specifically chose our acquisition strategy to structure those markets in our best interests not only for pricing but also for raw material purchasing and this is where that strategy will play out in this environment john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would say we re going to be in that low single digit range so that 2 range plus or minus is probably right for each of the coming quarters adam thalhimer thompson davis and company analyst okay perfect thanks operator thank you your next response is from brent thielman of d a davidson please go ahead brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst thanks good morning william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer good morning brent brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst the 11 improvement in aggregate price it sounds like the west texas region with a nice contributor this quarter and i assume that dilutes the absolute asp a bit can you just give us a sense for pricing i guess sort of change by region particularly california and kind of what you are seeing tax rate there john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean california both northern and southern we saw good momentum in pricing and a lot of our consumptions there is internal and we also have external sales in southern california and in hawaii and some other markets we saw the pricing momentum there and most of that stock and texas we do have a lot of aggregate operations in west texas than we have somewhere around the metroplex that are internal consuming aggregate plants but we also sell external customers as well and i think the same thing we saw very good momentum in pricing and so as we look at our internal consumption we go through an exercise of really analyzing the market and seeing what the next best opportunity is and seeing what are the markets are doing and so we believe that those price is stock and the same thing in the north east there is a little bit of lag there because of coming out of the winter and then volumes are ramping up so fast so i think we will see even that momentum in the north east gain even more traction moving forward brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst that s great and then bill i think about your comments just around private expectations and at one point you guys have had talked about interest in building a platform in southern california you have obviously got the terminal and expanding capacity i mean is the lack of not having a ready mix position in that market impacted your ability at all kind of find a helm to the product john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer no not at all in fact that product is in such high demand we we may even relook our plans to vertically integrate there as we sell multiple concrete suppliers at a very nice margin so we are very happy with being a distributor stone into that market or being accelerator stone into that market at this point and with the gaaps and evaluation that s our best strategic decision in the short term brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst got it ok and then the backlog looks i mean roughly light year on year but is it up more materially in one region versus another or stable across the board william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer i would say it s pretty stable across the board i haven t noticed really any meaningful change between the regions you get puts and takes in each region overall but pretty consistent between years john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer and brent to highlight that when you fly into any of these major metropolitan areas specifically in our footprint whether it be la san francisco the dfw new york philadelphia washington dc the amount of tower cranes still in each one of those markets is exceptional and proportional to the size of each of those markets so i don t see any softness in any of our markets brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst great now i hear you there the other question i had just on the dc market i know it s smaller in scale but it sounds like some pretty considerable opportunities coming to hq2 and all that could that become a more meaningful piece of the pie or is it simply sort of constrained by just the size of operation out there ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer i mean it s a very meaningful piece of the pie and strategically we re looking at many opportunities in that region and evaluating as bill said with the difference between the multiples between private and doesn t make sense to buy does it make sense in greenfield but we will be that is a very important market to us it does have a lot of opportunities and it s similar to other markets where the growth is just continue to expand outward from the center and so we re going to have to capture that with opportunities that we will be looking at or we are currently looking at now for either greenfield or acquisition yes brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst okay ronnie thanks all appreciate it ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer you re welcome brent operator thank you your next response is from stanley elliot of stifel please go ahead stanley elliott stifel nicolaus and company analyst good morning guys thank you for taking the question and ronnie welcome to the call on the new system we re talking about transformational i mean and then there s some discussion around better in terms of pricing is pricing going to move to more central location or kind of help us frame that out if you will ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer yes so i would say the central location would be more system driven and instead of i m not envisioning a central spot that prices everything for the country but it s more of the ability for us through our own crm to control not only the expectations and the targets we want for not just margins but all the way through and controlling our delivery costs and looking at fuel increases and predicting fuel and predicting labor and all those things and just being smarter in the way that we can set targets in each region independently of each other because each region has its own drivers but our ability to control that so that when cells people and professionals that we have or quoting work that they really have a very good insight on not what s just today but what s coming over the next six months i mean a lot of the things we ve told you in the past is we quote these jobs and then they get delayed and then six months later we re stuck with this price and that s what we want better intelligence into predicting that and being able to drive better value for those forward looking jobs that today we re pricing at a point in time that we want to get smarter on stanley elliott stifel nicolaus and company analyst and so it is fair to assume that you had some of these sorts of systems in place to help you on the pricing side i mean just trying to kind of get a sense for kind of the magnitude of change here william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer yeah we ve had cell systems that had targeted margins and things like that really were focused on raw material and deliveries but with what we re doing now we re actually going to capture customer by customer the customers behavior how the customer orders when the customer cancels what rates they pour at i mean those things impact every single part of our business and when i start talking about labor it s a tremendous impact on how each customer could be different and how they place actually place concrete and we can capture all that history with customers to say this is why they deserve what they deserve because they re really good or maybe they re not very good and we re not capturing the margin because we re just looking at a point in time and treating all customers the same and we have to be better at understanding the impact all the way through our system and that s what these tools will allow us to do stanley elliott stifel nicolaus and company analyst great very helpful and could you remind us again kind of expectations for aggregate pricing in the coming year and then will the dallas fort worth quarry coming online and i think you said third quarter will they have a meaningful impact in terms of the volume shift william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer no when you look at pricing let s not about pricing first we would still expect to see price improvement as we go through the remainder of the year we re obviously up over 10 in the first quarter i would not expect it to continue at that rate in the coming quarters so i would say that mid single digit is probably the right average for the remains of the year there ll be some stress between the quarters as far as the volumes what we said is we would still expect to see meaningful improvement of volumes what we had said is with polaris on there at 6 million tons or in our operation of 6 million tons we would expect to see double digit improvement in volumes i would expect to see double digit improvement in volumes in the remaining quarters as we go through the remainder of the year as well stanley elliott stifel nicolaus and company analyst great guys thanks for taking the questions william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer sure operator operator instructions your next responses from julio romero of sidoti and company please go ahead julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst hi good morning william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer good morning julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst i wanted to ask about operating cash flows believe the last two years sort of seen as a sequential decrease in cash flow going from q1 to q2 should we kind of expect a similar cadence for cash flows as we go into q2 and also throughout the back half of 2019 william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer yes so there s a few things in there obviously q2 is our one of our stronger quarters q2 and q3 are one of our stronger quarters so you do have some consumption of working capital needs in q2 if you re looking at it just on a true cash flow perspective and modeling what i d like to point out as well is that with respect to our contingent consideration payments that we were alluding to earlier we referred about 40 million for the year i would say i know we made an 8 million payment in april on one of the acquisitions so that occurred in april the 23 million with the sand and gravel quarry that is a late q2 early q3 potential payment so just depending upon the timing of that and the offset of that would be any cash received for eminent domain cost that we recover from the government in q2 so you have a lot of puts and takes in there for the quarter in when you re scheduling out or looking at leverage and cash flow in total or an aggregate to determine your debt levels for the company you should consider those as well julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst okay that s helpful and then just wanted to drill down a bit further on freight i appreciate your earlier comments about the availability of drivers still impacting yourselves and every one of the industry how have freight cost per ton trended recently can you just talk about some of the puts and takes there william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer i m sorry i wasn t clear on the question julio you re saying our pricing per ton in aggregates is that what you re looking at julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst correct yeah i just saw it versus beat the volume can you talk about that william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer yeah so our pricing what we said was we re over 10 on our asp for aggregates for q1 i wouldn t expect that double digit improvement to continue but we re talking high single digits certainly for the remainder of the quarters it s kind of vary a little bit between each quarters but i think on average you should see a mid to high single digit price improvement julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst okay helpful thanks very much william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer sure john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks julio operator i am showing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to bill sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer thanks tamara and thank you everyone for participating in the call this morning and

former newspaperman gordon eliot white wrote me a smart email a few weeks back responding to my column about how to make your retirement savings last the rest of your life white had a lot to say about how to save on a relatively small salary his peak was 42 000 what to invest in and what not to invest in and how to make 30 years of retirement healthy and fun i was a saver not a spender said white who approached saving and investing with an entrepreneur s flair aside from a few years in the early 1970s i have been a buy and hold investor the 85 year old former print guy works hard at retirement he lives on a creek in southeast virginia near the chesapeake bay he relaxes by sailing a half century old sailboat he keeps docked at the edge of his yard he also likes to travel recently splurging on a 10 day trip with a grandchild to paris and london advertisement white walks two miles a day four or five times a week he has written a monthly column for an antique car magazine for 25 years he still drives his antique racing car in vintage events and has nine books to his credit he is writing a history for his church and chairs middlesex county s economic development agency i certainly do not lack for things to keep me active and engaged white said i act as harbor master of moores creek and keep up with a new wife 12 years my junior i will be happy if i make it to 85 with all my marbles white and his wife live comfortably yet modestly on his 750 a month pension small potatoes his 19 000 a year from social security and the income from more maybe way more than 1 million in taxable and tax deferred investments that he has accumulated advertisement he was involuntarily retired at 55 in 1988 when his newspaper s circulation dropped by half one reason i have survived financially after being early retired is that i have no need for luxury said white who drives a 1985 honda crx with 247 000 miles comfort yes but not luxury my wife still ribs me about the black two door five speed honda civic with the roll down windows that was the heathmobile for a dozen years we have since gone upscale with a new subaru forester i gagged on the 30 000 price tag white gets it he understands the investing thesis that if you buy and own stuff and limit mistakes by not pursuing the quick return your wealth will grow you don t have to earn a big salary to get in on america s prosperity like me he gets jazzed from earning dividends on stocks and bonds advertisement like me he keeps his investing expenses low doesn t trade stocks often limits his tax exposure and sticks with blue chip stocks rather than trying to play a highflying ipo such as uber white and his wife live mostly on the dividends from 62 blue chip companies including coca cola bristol myers ford verizon caterpillar american electric power duke energy baxter labs johnson johnson and ppg industries he also owns a couple of exchange traded funds etfs he said all the holdings have appreciated a lot but he doesn t plan to sell any because a he doesn t need the money and b selling would create a sizable tax bill he hates the required minimum distribution that he must take on his tax deferred retirement accounts because they raise his taxes white is fortunate in one respect his father who was an engineer with new york telephone gave him early training in investing and taught him the value of owning shares in good companies it took me until i was 40 in 1952 when i was 19 he gave me a few hundred dollars worth of stock and set me up with a bache co account white said he said his father s stock trades made the family comfortable but never really wealthy advertisement he fell in love with newspapers at the age of 7 when his parents took him to see a movie version of the play the front page in 1940 he graduated from cornell university where he worked on the cornell daily sun in 1955 and tackled the first of several newspaper reporting jobs which included a stint at the chicago american a hearst tabloid he arrived in washington in 1958 and spent most of the next four decades here i am one of those people fortunate enough to have been able to spend his career doing what he wanted to do almost as far back as he can remember white said i always thought i d be a reporter until i dropped share this article share he has been a mostly conservative investor but he went off the rails for a few years in the 1970s the experiments included investments in gold annuities oil wells not worth the complications of doing the taxes convertible debentures whatever those are junk bonds and pork bellies he even bet on horses white bought a couple thousand dollars worth of gold and then found it was expensive to store and did not earn interest or pay a dividend and you had to pay a transaction fee to buy or sell it advertisement i tried all kinds of things some of which were stupid white said i have probably made every investing mistake it is possible to make though with only relatively small amounts some early investments in homes paid off he bought a small house from college pal phil merrill who founded washingtonian magazine he used the rental income to buy another house in alexandria va and then another in mclean va the money he made from those properties though not huge was the seed money for future investments he won big on the sale of his alexandria home in 1989 the house cost 50 000 in 1972 and sold for 650 000 it is now assessed at 2 5 million the key to white s comfortable life in his ninth decade is his abiding belief in living beneath your means and saving when the 401 k retirement savings accounts started in 1978 white stashed every cent he could in an account he did the same with his individual retirement account i am a big believer in tax deferred retirement accounts advertisement i saved what i didn t spend he said and i made sure i didn t spend all that came in any freelancing money like a 100 monthly payment from an amateur radio magazine went to investment accounts for his three children when they graduated from college they had 18 000 each to make a start in life white wrote several books on auto racing that have kept him sharp and engaged the books have covered their expenses with a wee bit to spare he is still on the rolls as the smithsonian s auto race adviser he moved from alexandria to middlesex county in 1996 saving on real estate taxes and housing costs but retirement was not as inexpensive as he thought we travel more white said what we save on work clothing is peanuts food is the same utilities if anything are more we drive more advertisement his investment portfolio including ira 401 k and taxable accounts has changed over the years in 1989 he was 40 percent invested in virginia municipal bonds and 55 percent in index funds mutual funds and individual stocks today i am 2 percent cash 56 percent equities and 42 percent munis he said you got to have equities to guard against inflation he calls the municipal bonds my salvation because they pay 4 percent interest and are not taxed he stays away from mutual funds because of fees and taxes the biggest retirement shock was that medicare isn t free i thought i had already paid for medicare over all the years when medicare taxes were being deducted from my wages but when my social security check arrived smaller than i thought they said mr white we deduct your medicare premiums from your check advertisement his biggest regret is not putting retirement money in roth iras with a roth you don t get an immediate tax deduction the way you do with a normal ira but you can leave the money in as long as you like and never pay taxes on it again i could have afforded to forgo the tax deduction during my working years in order not to pay ordinary income rates on 50 and more years of appreciation on my investments right now his goal is preserving his capital so he can enjoy his 30 year and counting retirement

replay of this call will be available at the atlantica yield corporate website atlantica will be making forward looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risk and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from our forward looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect are because of other factors discussed in today s earnings presentation or the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors sections of the accompanying presentation on our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commissions of each of which can be found on our website atlantica yield does not undertake any duty to update any forward looking statements joining us for today s conference call is atlantica s ceo santiago seage and cfo francisco martinez davis as usual at the end of the conference call we will open the line for the q a session i will now pass you over to mr seage please go ahead sir santiago seage chief executive officer and director good morning and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 conference call if we start on page 3 with the key messages in today s call we re going to spend some time reviewing what we believe is a very strong value proposition focused on sustainable infrastructure additionally we will be sharing with you the significant progress we have made in the first quarter of 2019 toward our financial optimization that creates value in first place we have successfully refinanced our existing 2019 notes but most importantly we have refinanced this piece of corporate debt with improved terms and with flexibility in second place we now have several levers in place that should allow us to achieve our cafd guidance even if distributions from mojave were delayed additionally we have signed an enhanced collaboration agreement with our main shareholder and partner algonquin aimed at accelerating atlantica s growth in the u s i will provide further details in a few minutes also in relation with our accretive growth history we are pleased to announce today our first investment in electric battery storage we ve acquired a 30 stake in a 140 megawatt gas fired facility with electric battery storage what we consider are attractive and accretive numbers regarding the operating performance of our asset portfolio it has continued to be a strong quarter we have achieved growth in terms of revenue further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates and cafd and finally our board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of 0 39 per share representing 22 increase versus the same quarter last year and a 5 increase versus the previous quarter proving that the board and management remains fully committed to dividend growth if we turn to the next page we can see on the slide 5 that our focus is clearly on sustainable infrastructure specifically around renewable energy and water there is no question that renewable energy is a high growth and attractive market but it is also very clear that the transition toward a sustainable power mix requires the support of natural gas power storage and transmission lines these are the trends and these are our markets renewable energy and the three technologies to make it happen in fact wind and solar energy are a reality and offered to date lower cost than conventional power in many regions around the world and in many states in the u s and i respect it to be present in most markets the majority of new investments in the power sector around 50 of the world s power generation by 2050 is expected to come from renewable sources with some countries and regions at a much higher percentage than that this indicates that renewable energy is mainstream today but at this point in time power storage and natural gas are and will continue to be in key enablers in the power sector to support wind and solar going forward in addition water is going to be the next frontier in a transition toward a more sustainable world new sources of water are needed worldwide and water desalination and water transportation infrastructure should help make that possible in summary we believe that we are positioned at the center of the sustainable power and water revolutions in the next slide i will try to summarize why atlantica is well positioned in that market and we ll be able to capitalize on the growing transition toward sustainability first of all on page 6 we have expensive experience in our industry and we have proven our ability to grow accretively within that industry with more than 330 million in equity investments announced in the last six months more or less in second place our footprint and diversification we believe is unique and position us very well in both wind solar and some of our other core sectors with a strong focus in north america and the americas in general third atlantica s corporate structure has always been designed and continues to be designed to maximize value creation with low general expenses favorable tax structure no idrs and the majority of our board of directors being independent and finally we have a strong strategic long term partner algonquin that supports our sustainability strategy and provides access to new growth sources and improved our access to capital as we have demonstrated on the next page 7 we can see why atlantica is a sustainable business with a very attractive cash generation profile in the first place our portfolio of assets is underpinned by a long term high quality set of contracts all of our assets have contracted or regulated revenue with a weighted average remaining contract life of around 18 years with fixed or hedged interest rates and virtually no commodity exposure in fact as i mentioned we have a very strong long term cash flow visibility with organic growth opportunities and cash generation tails in most of our assets once the non recourse debt is paid for before the expiration of our contracts and finally atlantica is a diversified company both by geography and by sector with a clear focus in the americas and renewable energy but most importantly we have very low dependence on natural resources as many of you know large percentage of our revenue is based on availability and not only on power generation we therefore depend less than others on the wind or the sun shining in fact more than 60 of our cafd will come from non resource dependent payments or what we call availability based payments if we move to slide 8 our high quality portfolio our efficient corporate structure our prudent financing policy combined with our ability to grow accretively make atlantica we believe a very attractive total return opportunity with our current dividend yield of more than 7 and an attractive midterm dividend per share growth target this we believe places us among the most appealing companies in the industry turning to page number 9 another important aspect of atlantica is our strong commitment to esg and sustainability in fact a few months ago we were rated by sustainalytics as the top company within renewables the second within the broader utilities sector in the top 3 of the global ratings universe atlantica has been of the core of the renewable energy transformation and we intend to continue playing that role we are also a member of the united nations global compact and our renewable energy assets have helped to avoid around 5 million tons of co2 emissions since they are in operation it is therefore very clear that our focus is clean energy but it is also important to mention that we manage our company with a very strong focus on health and safety and on social and corporate responsibility now if you move to slide number 10 i ll talk about the significant progress achieved in our strategic priorities to create value in first place we are committed to achieving our cafd guidance irrespective of pg e s exposure thanks to several initiatives that should compensate the mojave distribution in case that it was delayed due to the situation of the offtaker additionally we have refinanced the 2019 notes as i mentioned before with improved terms and flexibility furthermore more we intend to explore options to divest some assets and reinvest accretively to show value accretion and finally although non company related we believe that the results of the elections in spain are favorable with regards to the upcoming determination of the rate of return for renewables starting in 2020 regarding our accretive growth strategy we are happy to announce today a new investment i mentioned before at attractive returns and also we are happy to announce that the proposal led by our partner aages achieved the first position in a bidding process for a new transmission line in uruguay that asset includes two transmission lines with a total of around 50 miles and a substation contracted under 30 and 20 year agreements in u s dollar and we are going to be owning a 25 of that project and we will have or we have a rofo right over the rest of the investment so good news our rofo partner aages winning a new asset that will flow to us additionally in order to accelerate our growth in the u s we have signed an enhanced collaboration agreement with algonquin and finally the strategic review committee that was created a few months ago is working on the analysis of different strategical alternatives to optimize atlantica s value as you can see we have started 2019 with a significant number of initiatives that should translate into long term value creation for our shareholders now if you move to slide 11 francisco will go over the announcement we made earlier this week about the successful refinancing of our corporate bonds with improved terms francisco martinez davis chief financial officer thank you santiago we are very satisfied with the new financing signs since it really bears significant improvement for the company atlantica has entered into a senior unsecured note facility with a group of funds for a total amount of the euro equivalent of 300 million we will fully hedged the notes with an interest rate swap of not less than three years resulting in an interest rate significantly lower than the one we re paying the tenor notes is six years and we expect them to be issued in the second quarter of 2019 the proceeds will be used to redeem in full atlantica s existing 7 senior notes maturing on november 15 2019 and for other general corporate purposes we will achieve several improvements with this corporate finance refinancing first of all the new financing has a longer tenor compared with the existing notes second and most important we will achieve a 4 million cost improvement per annum expected starting in the year 2020 third we will obtain a natural hedge for our cafd generated in euro given that the facility is denominated in euro and finally but also very important the new facility allows us to capitalize interest on the notes issued for a period up to two years at atlantica s discretion this will equal to approximately 14 million per year and if we choose to defer the interest payment it was helped to partially offset the potential cafd impact in case the mojave distribution was delayed this is a significant aspect since there was no additional cost it will allow us to partially bridge our pg e exposure needed for two years but let me go on to further details on that please turn to the next slide i would like to discuss why we are saying today that we could currently expect to achieve our cafd guidance in 2019 even in their hypothetical case the mojave distribution to us were delayed as a result of the pg e situation as we have already communicated in the previous earnings call we only have exposure at pg e in one of our assets mojave and our 2019 cafd guidance includes 30 million to 35 million distribution from mojave which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 pg e has continued paying invoice according to the ppa and the plant is operating normally for us it is business as usual but even though pg e continues to honor the contracts and we do not expect distribution for the assets until the fourth quarter we don t have certainty that the 2019 distribution for mojave will not get delayed for that reason we have worked to ensure that our cafd guidance is achieved even if mojave s distribution was delayed in the first place as i have already explained we have the option to capitalize approximately 14 million per year of interest payments in the new note issuance for a period of two years in order to partially bridge our 30 million to 35 million pg e exposure for two years if needed and at no additional cost in second place we expect to release restricted cash accounts in certain assets that will compensate potential delays in mojave if any in summary with these two levers we believe that we will be able to compensate 2019 and 2020 mojave distributions in case they were delayed due to due to the current situation of pg e we therefore remain committed to cafd and dividend growths and now in relation to our growth strategy i will turn the call back to santiago who will provide further details on the asset investment that we announced earlier today santiago seage chief executive officer and director thank you francisco if we turn to page 13 we have signed an agreement to acquire a 30 stake in monterrey a 140 megawatt gas fired facility in operation in mexico which includes 12 megawatt of electric battery storage the investment represents around 42 million in equity value at an estimated nine times ev ebitda additionally it should be a very accretive transaction monterrey has been in operation since 2018 and represents our first investment in electric batteries we have u s dollar denominated 20 year ppa with two large international corporations the ppa includes price escalation factors and has no commodity risk closing at this point in time is subject to customary condition specific additionally we have signed a rofo agreement with the seller for the remaining stake in the asset additionally on moving to page number 14 we have signed a new enhanced partnership agreement with algonquin that should allow us to accelerate our growth in the u s the new agreement has three main pillars in first place atlantica has an option to acquire stakes or make investments in two algonquin assets in the u s for a total equity value of up to 100 million in 2019 subject to the parties acting reasonably in good pace and agreeing terms that can be mutually beneficial the second pillar atlantica and algonquin have agreed to analyze jointly during the next six months algonquin s contracted assets in the u s and canada with the final objective of identifying assets where a drop down could add value for both parties according to each company s key metrics and finally in third place the existing shareholders agreement has been modified to allow algonquin to increase its shareholding in atlantica up to a 48 5 without any change in corporate governance algonquin s voting rights and the rights to appoint directors will be limited to a 41 5 through the ownership they have today and the additional 7 will be voted replicating non algonquin shareholders vote therefore maintaining our current corporate governance part of this investment in atlantica shares will be done by algonquin by subscribing around 30 million in new shares to be issued by atlantica at a price of 21 67 per share that represents a 6 premium with respect to yesterday s closing price we believe that this premium versus the market price highlights the confidence of our main shareholder and partner in atlantica we can say that this is an enhanced partnership that should help to accelerate our growth in the u s and to create long term value for our shareholders and now to finish their strategic update on page 15 you have an updated overview of our growth pipeline this is a chart we shared already in late 2018 and as you can see here we have a significant pipeline that should allow us to invest equity at least between 200 million and 300 million per year through the different buckets and partnerships we have with algonquin with aages with third parties and through acquisitions we have demonstrated we believe that we can grow accretively and we are confident that this will continue in the following years in fact our pipeline at this point in time looks very helpful if we move to page 17 we are going to be looking at our quarterly results and as you can see revenues in the first quarter of 2019 reached 222 million a 2 decrease versus the first quarter of 2018 mainly due to currency translation effects on a constant currency basis revenues increased by 4 further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates increased by 1 up 281 million or 7 on a constant currency basis and cafd in the first quarter increased by 5 year on year to 45 million in line with our expectations for the year once again the solid operating performance of atlantica in the first quarter demonstrates the advantage of having a diversified portfolio where a significant percentage of our revenue is based on availability and not only on generation if we move to the next page we can see that overall our portfolio of assets delivered a solid performance in the first quarter both by segment and by region north america with a 2 growth in terms of revenues and a decrease in ebitda mainly due to 8 million one off recorded in the first quarter of 2018 in south america both revenues and ebitda increased thanks to the solid performance of the assets and the contribution of new assets acquired last quarter in emea the revenue decrease was mainly due to the currency translation effect in fact our kaxu solar asset delivered a very strong operating performance with a record quarter and a capacity factor over 48 in spain generation also increased significantly due to higher solar regulation in the same quarter last year and a strong operating performance if we look at the results by business sector the conclusion is very similar renewable energy revenues and ebitda decreased by 6 but they increased by 2 on a constant currency basis efficient natural gas very solid performance transmission lines very strong performance water showing the strong ebitda levels of most quarters if we now move to page 19 we can see that electricity produced by our renewable assets reached over 580 gigawatt hours a 15 increase compared with q1 overall a strong performance in the first quarter if we look at our availability based contracts act as mentioned before very solid performance this quarter we had the scheduled major overhaul in one of the two turbines everything happened as expected and we are now in the second quarter performing the same task in the second turbine this explains the lower availability and production levels nevertheless as the overhaul was as scheduled this have no impact on revenues finally regarding transmission lines and water again very high availabilities i will now turn the call over to francisco who will take us through the financial figures francisco martinez davis chief financial officer thank you santiago let s move on to slide 20 to walk you through our cash flow for the first quarter of 2019 our operating cash flow reached 96 9 million compared to 130 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 which included approximately 17 million corresponding to one off payments received in solana with no corresponding amount in the first quarter of 2019 which explains most of the decrease additionally we had a property tax payment in the quarter corresponding to previous years net cash used in investment activities was 22 3 million and corresponding mainly to the investments and new assets net cash used in financing activities in the first quarter of 2019 amounted to 44 5 million and corresponding principally the project debt scheduled repayments all in all the net change in consolidated cash for the first quarter of 2019 was an increase of 30 million on the next slide number 21 we would like to review our net debt position our consolidated net debt as of march 31 2019 is similar to that at the close of 2018 we closed the first quarter with net corporate debt of 589 7 million with this our net corporate debt to cafd pre corporate debt service ratio stood at 2 5 times the lower internal target of three times on the other hand net project debt as of march 31 2019 was 4 530 million 37 million lower than at the closing of 2018 then finally on slide 22 i would like to review how we are delivering on our commitment to grow dividends our board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of 0 39 per share for the first quarter of 2019 or a 1 56 annualized this represents an increase of 22 compared with the first quarter of 2018 and an increase of 5 compared with the last quarterly distribution this shows our continued confidence in the business and our prospects thank you for your attention and now we will open the line for questions operator we re ready for q a at this stage questions and answers operator operator instructions and we do have questions coming through the first question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith from bank of america your line is open please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning team santiago seage chief executive officer and director good morning julien francisco martinez davis chief financial officer can you hear me julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent alright just a few different questions here first with respect to the 30 million from algonquin can you elaborate what s the thought process on the timing and reason for the issuance here just want to understand perhaps the broader thought process around raising capital for drop downs given the current valuation and then maybe perhaps very much related what is the current status of strategic review under way and what is the potential paths from here particularly in light of the latest equity raise santiago seage chief executive officer and director so the reasoning for the 30 million equity raise are the opportunities that as we explained today and as you probably saw the investment opportunities that we are going to be analyzing working on them closing with them so this is an agreement where we are going to be able to make investments in drop downs coming from them and smaller part of those investments are going to be financed with this new capital and the remainder will be financed with the other resources that we have available in terms of the strategic review committee as i mentioned the committee continues doing its work and analyzing a number of options going forward i will not be able to be obviously specific regarding what the committee is doing but as you can imagine we have been spending a lot of time on some of the shorter term initiatives that we announced today and on analyzing longer term potential initiatives julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst why raise the cash now for algonquin just understand it relative to the cash on hand and leverage capacity just to understand that piece and then secondly to come back to the wider 7 increase in algonquin can you comment a little bit more about the timeline here i mean is the 7 designed to be fully in equity raise at the ay level or is this more about a secondary market transaction potentially santiago seage chief executive officer and director so starting with your second question what we have agreed with algonquin is that they can increase their ownership by a 7 how and when is up to them in the context of let s say the enhanced collaboration agreement what we re doing here is enhancing our partnership with them through several pieces one of those pieces would be a higher participation in us as i mentioned before without any changes in corporate governance and this if you want is a package where both partners are recognizing that we have been working very well in the past but we can do more and doing more is about us being able to invest in some of their assets and then increasing the stake they are helping us because they believe that we can create value for them obviously julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst do you mind elaborating then a little bit more on just the liquidity position then as it stands today and the need for the cash raise at present and liquidity as well as leverage capacity to that you ve talked about against target santiago seage chief executive officer and director so as you know and as i mentioned before our pipeline we showed it in today s presentation we have a very significant pipeline and we are working on a significant number of very attractive accretive opportunities today we have announced an acquisition we have announced a new line that has been recently won where we are going to be investing so in general what we see is a situation where we have significant opportunities for our growth and we recognize that we have an important financing capacity but as part of these agreement with algonquin we decided that it was good to do a small capital increase in order to reinvest it in some of the assets that we are going to be acquiring for them from them the way we would we view this julien is number one lots of growth opportunities with good numbers and as you have seen in the past the investment we have been making have been made a very attractive with very attractive numbers and that will continue to be the case so the good news is we see a very strong set of opportunities and as part of the overall agreement with algonquin one of the pieces were these let s call it a smaller capital increase at the premium versus the market price showing the confidence that algonquin has in the business while being able to raise some funds that we will be investing in the very short term in some of those investments julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it one last thing if i can just with respect to the issuance you call it small issuing at a discount to nav has perhaps unusual among your peers how do you think about using external equity on a go forward basis you ve got the 7 arrangement is it your expectation today that you would indeed be pursuing external capital or is this really truly one off for whatever reason tied to show demonstrating you can raise external capital i just want to make sure i understand sort of the messaging here santiago seage chief executive officer and director so the messaging if you want is we are doing a small capital raise in the context i described and you summarized and the expectation is not to be requiring needing or making capital increase the 7 agreement the only component of that 7 agreement of new shares at this point in time the only one we expect is the one we are doing so we don t know what will algonquin decide but in terms of new shares this is the only component in terms of new shares julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst i leave it there thank you santiago seage chief executive officer and director thank you julien operator thank you the next question comes from the line of abe azar from deutsche bank your line is open please go ahead abe azar deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning congratulations santiago seage chief executive officer and director thank you francisco martinez davis chief financial officer thank you abe azar deutsche bank analyst on the 100 million of investment into the algonquin assets is this an option you have is this a contract that you committed to and then maybe you could talk about the return expectation on those santiago seage chief executive officer and director so what we have here is an initial agreement regarding two a specific assets the terms need to be negotiated by both parties so we are going to be spending the next weeks working on both to a specific situations and we believe we are going to be able to find reasonable terms for both parties but we need to go through that exercise abe azar deutsche bank analyst okay and this is in addition to the one in illinois that you did earlier this year right santiago seage chief executive officer and director it is it is in addition to the one we announced the wind assets we announced in illinois and on top of that as i mentioned during the presentation additionally to this to a specific assets let s say by name we have agreed to review jointly and analyze other options for drop downs because obviously algonquins and our perspective here is that given the fact that our key metrics are very different there should be opportunities to create value to certain drop downs and situations where given the fact that let s say the metrics they are focused on and the metrics we are focused on are different we believe that there will be opportunities for accretive drop downs for us abe azar deutsche bank analyst okay and then when you look out over the pipeline the next few years it looks like you have line of sight on a good bit of new growth capital do you anticipate funding that with issuance to algonquin or is that you have other sources of funding or is that still tbd santiago seage chief executive officer and director so i think in general these two tbd we do have significant let s say capacity at this point in time obviously it depends on how quickly opportunities materialize and most of let s say financing should be happening with some of the means we have today the fact that we have refinanced our bonds and we refinanced earlier this year or later last year the rcf helps as well the good thing is we have a shareholder who can complement if in the future we need it for example this 30 million we have been able to do it at a premium to the market because we have a sponsor and shareholder it s a very small amount obviously but if one day we needed a small amount we can see if we can have a original agreement with our shareholder or we could look at the markets if needed abe azar deutsche bank analyst all right do you anticipate algonquin will be in the market purchasing shares to get up to that 48 or close to it santiago seage chief executive officer and director i mean again this is up to them so you should ask this question to them we have given them permission if you want now they will do whatever they believe is right for them abe azar deutsche bank analyst okay got it that s all i had today great update santiago seage chief executive officer and director thanks abe operator thank you ladies and gentlemen the next question comes from the line of praful mehta from citigroup your line is open please go ahead praful mehta citigroup analyst thanks so much and sorry i m going to come back to the equity raise just to clarify and i guess the setup right you re saying you re doing a strategic review stock is undervalued you also said you have debt capacity so i m trying to figure out is the equity raise driven by algonquin s need to increase their ownership so that they re comfortable with the drops i m just again i m unable to reconcile these points so that s why i m trying to understand why go to algonquin when you know that the stock is undervalued and you re publicly talking about that so anymore color would be helpful santiago seage chief executive officer and director sure so what we are trying what we have done we believe is a very good deal in terms of a very good agreement with algonquin that we believe is very positive for atlantica meaning that we will have thanks to these agreement access to assets in the u s and we will be able to make investments in the u s in reasonable terms in value creating terms and as part of that agreement what we are doing is we are raising a small amount of capital that will finance part of those investments obviously given the fact that it will be a small part of the financing of the investments the investments are the accretion is going to be there and the value creation is going to be there so it s only a component of our larger agreement would we be doing a significant capital raise no we are doing a small capital raise at the premium to the market in the context of what we believe is an attractive partnership agreement with algonquin praful mehta citigroup analyst got it thank you i guess moving to slide 13 where you have the asset acquisition just wanted to understand the investment 42 million and the ebitda multiple looks attractive from a cafd perspective versus the ebitda is there any maintenance capex or anything else we should be thinking about in terms of what cafd this asset generates santiago seage chief executive officer and director no so there is nothing extraordinary there in terms of cafd in terms of irr the numbers are very attractive so there is no there is nothing going on in capex or anything anywhere else the numbers for the acquisition we believe are good praful mehta citigroup analyst okay great thanks and then on slide 12 this is for the pg e situation just wanted to understand your kind of thinking about the situation and you re solving for really a delay it sounds like in any situation you re saying hey we have the ability and the flexibility to wait till the pg e situation is sorted out in case it isn t sorted out and in that remote instance that pg e does have to reject ppas is that creating some pressure on the system because now you have drawn down 14 million more and effectively you re going to have to pay that back at least the interest on that back incrementally so does that put more pressure if there is a rejection or how do you think about that scenario santiago seage chief executive officer and director so in first place what we believe and obviously each one can have a different a point of view here but what we believe is that the likelihood of that happening is very low based on our knowledge of the situation and in this scenario where we could have delays as francisco explained we cannot obviously guarantee that we are going to be receiving distribution from mojave when we expect them so the good news is if there were delays we are going to be able to compensate for those delays and for the next for 2019 and 2020 we believe that we have the tools in place to be able to compensate for that without any problem now if your scenario which we believe is very unlikely ended up happening the amounts we are talking about are very limited so we don t believe we are putting any extra pressure on the system as you describe it we would have a problem obviously because mojave last year was up 13 of our numbers if you want but we would not be putting more pressure by doing this i think that what we are doing today is telling you that we have found over the last few months a way to very prudently navigates through potential delays without paying significant costs to anybody here so the way we see it is as a very positive step to be able to maintain our cafds on our dividend payout ratios over the next couple of years praful mehta citigroup analyst very helpful thank you so much guys santiago seage chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of bryan fast from raymond james your line is open please go ahead bryan fast raymond james analyst yes thanks for taking my call here just regarding the monterrey gas assets could you discuss what the deciding factor will be relating to the additional 70 stake santiago seage chief executive officer and director sorry so regarding monterrey what we have is a rofo agreement and like in any rofo agreement obviously will depend on when the partner offer us the stake and the conditions we can negotiate in principle we are very interested as of today but whenever that asset is offered in couple of years from now or whenever that happens we will need to look at the specific conditions we believe the asset is very attractive for a number of reasons but usually like any other investment it will depend on conditions bryan fast raymond james analyst okay thanks and then just regarding the uruguay transmission line asset any color on the bidding for this project did you find it very competitive and then maybe what are your thoughts on potential returns there santiago seage chief executive officer and director so i think it s very good news but aages has this new asset and like every process obviously there was competition uruguay is a market we know very well as you know it s an asset in dollars so from our point of view we find this very attractive and therefore we are very happy for ages and we are very happy for ourselves and as i mentioned before we have a smaller stake at this point in time and hoping for the line to be built so that we can exercise our rofo in the future bryan fast raymond james analyst okay thanks that s it from me santiago seage chief executive officer and director thank you operator operator instructions the next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith from bank of america your line is open please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys sorry to come back so i just wanted to clarify couple of things very quickly can you elaborate a little bit more on asset sales i know you commented at the start or a limited amount on the strategic review but where do you stand with respect to asset sales and narrowing down the portfolio and then secondly can you clarify a little bit more around mojave and any potential waiver particularly as negotiations inaudible given does position in this all just how does doe being involved differentiate this specific project perhaps it s a better way to ask that santiago seage chief executive officer and director so starting with the second one with mojave and as you know we don t expect a distribution until the last part of the year so we obviously talk a lot with our lender with the doe but there is not much to report on that front it s still early and we will continue working with them as you know we have significant experience and they have a significant experience with us so we will keep you updated but at this point in time there is not much to report on what i m saying we think they will be supportive like they ve been in the past but i cannot be i cannot give you more light regarding that your first question was regarding asset sales there as i mentioned during the call our intention is to demonstrate value by divesting stakes or assets if it is done at the right price to demonstrate value in our portfolio so we do believe that the value of many of our assets is higher than what the market is giving to aid for and therefore we will be spending some time seeing if there are potential interested parties for some of them at the right price and i m here i m talking about a very narrow set of situations julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst but to clarify on the asset sales the narrow set that s a geographic region or is that specific to value against the current share price or just if you can elaborate santiago seage chief executive officer and director so i cannot elaborate much julien we are working on that at this point in time so i wouldn t want to be more specific at this point in time i can tell you that that s a lever that we believe we should use but forgive me i cannot be more specific julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst last question when would you contemplate buybacks relative to drop downs like how do you think about that conceptually because obviously you re accentuating the drop down piece of the equation at this point santiago seage chief executive officer and director yes at this point in time we believe that in the acquisition on the drop down we are being able and we will continue to be able to do them in accretive terms obviously whenever we consider our investment opportunity we compare it versus investing in our own shares so that s always part of the analysis we conduct and as you can imagine whenever you approve an investment at the board we compare it with other available options including the one you mentioned julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you very much for your patience santiago seage chief executive officer and director thank you julien francisco martinez davis chief financial officer thank you operator thank you operator instructions as we have no further questions at this time i would like to hand the call back to mr seage for closing remarks santiago seage chief executive officer and director great thank you very much to everybody for attending the call today thanks operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference for today thank you all for participating you may now disconnect duration 57 minutes call participants santiago seage chief executive officer and director francisco martinez davis chief

9 million up 74 2 we had favorable working conditions throughout our markets during the quarter we also grew our backlog to 584 8 million at march 31 2019 with approximately 380 million of that amount to be completed during our current fiscal year advertisement advertisement project opportunities remained strong across our markets and we continue to pursue additional opportunities that can be completed both in the current fiscal year and beyond we earned approximately 40 of our annual revenue though during the first half of the fiscal year this was in line with our traditional seasonal pattern we typically benefit in the second half of our fiscal year from more favorable working conditions due to normal weather patterns longer working days and other factors in late february we announced two strategic acquisitions a liquid asphalt terminal in panama city florida and asphalt production and paving company in south central florida these two companies are now fully integrated the liquid asphalt terminal was part of our vertical integration strategy and allows us to supply liquid asphalt to a number of our plants in the southern portion of our geographic footprint including florida alabama and georgia we began shipments from the terminal in march the asphalt company we acquired in okeechobee florida extends our ability to service new markets and florida through an expansion geographic presence in the state and as we have discussed before we drive growth through three primary levers in our business model doing more work in our current market through strategic acquisitions and through greenfield expansions in which we establish a new plant to service a particular market currently project demand remains favorable in our markets and state funding continues to grow to support infrastructure projects in march alabama lawmakers approved an increase in the state s gas tax this is the first increase in alabama s gas tax since 1992 and is expected to generate approximately 320 million in additional annual funding when fully implemented this increase would be phased in over three years starting in october 2019 lastly i d like to welcome our new board of director noreen skelly we are very pleased to have noreen joined the board of directors and chair of the audit committee before turning the call over to ned i d like to take a moment to reflect on our recent one year anniversary as a public company over the past year we have completed three acquisitions and continued to grow in our existing markets as a result revenue has increased 18 3 for the six months ended march 31 2019 over the same period last year prior to our ipo i would especially like to thank our senior management team for their leadership and our more than 2 100 employees for their dedication and hard work and that enables us to execute our strategy advertisement advertisement now i d like to turn the call over to ned fleming our executive chairman for a few additional comments ned ned n fleming executive chairman of the board thank you charles and good morning to everyone as the chairman of the board and behalf of all the directors i too would like to welcome noreen skelly to our board to recognize that she had leadership strength financial acumen and diversity to our board and we are all looking forward to her participation and input i d like to reiterate some of charles s comment this quarter s performance is a direct result of the efficiency experience and hard work of each employee at cpi they are doing an excellent job on a daily basis executing the strategy charles allen and the entire leadership team has driven throughout the entire organization the company is strategically positioned in all our markets to compound double digits top line growth generate excellent margins in the industry and with a strong balance sheet is prepared to execute acquisitions this business is geographically located to benefit from operating in the fast growing southeastern states where both the demand for ongoing road repair projects is coupled with increased public funding to pay for the work this demand and funding continue to grow in our markets as evidenced by the alabama s recent gas tax increase advertisement advertisement with strong demand and solid funding coupled with a track record of results in a strong growth outlook we believe construction partners represents a compelling investment as our team continues to consistently execute we believe it will be apparent to the market that cpi represents a unique model for public infrastructure companies the nature of our recurring publicly funded maintenance projects with shorter duration and lower volatility risk from input costs distinguishes our business model through the leadership of our highly experienced team both here in dothan and throughout our platform companies construction partners is well positioned to execute our plan and grow the business one of the most compelling aspects of cpi is its consistency we ve seen it over the past 20 years as we continue to meet with investors and tell our story we believe the market will appreciate the opportunity that cpi represents i believe we are well positioned for continued growth in 2019 and beyond and with that i d like to turn the call over to our cfo alan palmer alan alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you ned and good morning everyone i want to start by quickly highlighting our key metric performance in the second quarter from a financial standpoint as we ve discussed favorable working conditions in the quarter improved compared to the first fiscal quarter and led to increase this year over year for our second fiscal quarter revenue for the quarter increased 45 4 million over the same quarter last year revenue attributable to scruggs which we acquired subsequent to march 31 2018 was 18 3 million and we were also able to complete work on our projects that were delayed in our first quarter into december 31 2018 gross profit increased approximately 6 1 million primarily due to higher revenue the higher gross profit percentage of revenue was a result of increased hma production and equipment utilization resulting in an increase of fixed cost absorption during the quarter net income was 4 2 million down from the same period last year however excluding the impact of a non recurring after tax settlement of 10 6 million in the second quarter of 2018 net income was up 3 7 million earnings per share were 0 08 down from 0 27 which was also impacted by the legal settlement last year adjusted ebitda was 5 9 million resulting in an adjusted ebitda margin of 8 5 compared to 6 7 for the same period in the prior year the higher adjusted ebitda margin was a combination of a higher gross profit margin and a lower general and administrative expense percentage looking at our input cost we have seen some recent increase in asphalt cement pricing but currently we do not anticipate changes to have a significant impact in 2019 in late march we began shipments from our newly acquired liquid asphalt terminal in florida we believe over the coming year that we can achieve between 20 and 30 basis points in margin improvement through the use of this terminal g a expenses in the quarter were consistent with our expectations and included an increase of 800 000 due to scruggs and 700 000 due to public company costs that we did not have in the same quarter last year the increase was partially offset by 600 000 decrease in equity based compensation expense we will continue to diligently manage margin to do this we must also be active in understanding exactly what we are seeing in our markets our business is very competitive and as with most industries hot spots of competition can move around we continue to successfully navigate the competitive environment maintaining our market position while also steering revenues to stronger markets as opportunities present themselves strategically our organization maximizes efficiencies through scale and flexibility to move crews and equipment to take advantage of favorable margins and to maintain ebitda advertisement advertisement backlog provides cpi with significant visibility into the next 12 to 18 months we define backlog as projects for which we either have an executed contract or currently working on that contract where we are the low better on a public project and we have commitment from the customer but not an executed contract backlog does not include any future external sales of hot mix asphalt or aggregates in march 31 2019 backlog was 584 8 million of this amount 65 approximately 380 8 million is expected to be completed during the 2019 fiscal year in addition as charles mentioned opportunities for future projects in our markets remains favorable as we will be at on a number of construction projects that we would expect to complete both during the current fiscal year and beyond turning now to the balance sheet at march 31 2019 we had 61 9 million of cash and 14 3 million of availability under our 30 million revolving credit facility after deducting outstanding letters of credit our debt to trailing 12 months ebitda ratio was less than 1 time at 0 88 we have a very strong balance sheet to support the growth opportunities we re seeing cash provided by operating activities was 5 3 million for the six months ended march 31 2019 compared to 28 1 million for the six months ended march 31 2018 this decreases is due to higher accounts receivable and work in progress balances of significantly higher quarterly revenue and a 4 6 million increase in inventory related to the operation of our new liquid asphalt terminal capex in the second quarter was 12 4 million compared to 12 5 million in the same quarter last year for fiscal 2019 we expect our capital expenditures to be in the range of 38 million to 42 million which compares to 42 8 million in fiscal 2018 before we turn the call over for your questions i d like to review our financial outlook for the full fiscal year 2019 which ends september 30 2019 we have raised the outlook with regard to revenue net income and adjusted ebitda our 2019 outlook now calls for revenue in the range of 790 million to 810 million compared to 680 1 million in fiscal 2018 net income in the range of 40 75 million to 44 million compared to 50 8 million in fiscal 2018 as a reminder net income in fiscal 2018 included a non recurring 10 6 million after tax settlement adjusted ebitda in the range of 88 9 million to 92 5 million compared to 75 5 million in fiscal 2018 advertisement advertisement and finally our fiscal year 2019 outlook does not take into account any future acquisitions or greenfield expansions that may occur during the remainder of the year the outlook also does not include the potential impact of any new federal or state infrastructure or highway related legislation that could be passed in 2019 for modeling perspective i d also like to mention that our effective tax rate in 2019 will be approximately 25 compared to 17 2 in our prior fiscal year with that we will now take questions operator questions and answers operator thank you we ll now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of trey grooms with stephens please proceed with your question advertisement advertisement trey grooms stephens analyst hi good morning gentlemen charles e owens president and chief executive officer good morning trey grooms stephens analyst so i ve got a couple of questions here first where were you guys seeing the upside in the quarter any specific geography or geographic markets that stand out to you versus kind of your expectations going into the quarter charles e owens president and chief executive officer no we didn t have any markets that in particular they where all they re favorable working conditions and our team just got out and performed trey grooms stephens analyst and on the public side that clearly looks pretty good but what are you guys seeing right now on the private side of the business and remind us is that still about 30 of the business alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it is and we re still seeing from a backlog standpoint very good backlog in private work primarily commercial we ve lowered our residential portion of our private work on purpose but we still have a very strong commercial product work backlog trey grooms stephens analyst and so when you say commercial can you give us some examples on the private side are these large kind of projects on non res side or more some of the commercial that follows residential what do you guys generally see on the private side what type of work you do in there charles e owens president and chief executive officer some of it could be the schools is being built and then we have different shopping areas this being built and office complexes and developments like that trey grooms stephens analyst i ve got you ok and with your public business so can you help us kind of dissect that piece just a little bit i know most of what you guys do on the public side is i guess would be considered more maintenance but can you kind of give us that breakdown in what you re seeing on the more maintenance side of things versus what you would be seeing on maybe lane expansions or something like that that would be considered maybe new public construction alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer there is not really much of a change in that we participate in the larger projects when they re in our market and we have an opportunity but our core businesses are those maintenance type projects that just continued to reoccur and we ve seen with the increased tax revenue that s come into the states they re really trying to make sure that they get those roads that are in poor repair back in good condition so not really much a change there there are no big large projects that we ve added to backlog that would skew it different from what we ve had in the past trey grooms stephens analyst okay and last one for me is just around some of the costs there what are you guys seeing or maybe your outlook for labor and freight costs from where we stand today alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean our labor cost is pretty steady i think i ve shared before generally we make payroll adjustments annually so throughout the year we don t have swings in our labor cost typically we ve got a very stable workforce and we re employing people that are in these markets and they re always in those markets so we re not seeing much of a change there that s been built in to our bids and our cost so not any real fluctuation there we do put certain percentage of our own trucking so that helps us to mitigate any things that are happening out in the market but clearly trucking is type but being in these local markets where we ve got a steady revenue and a steady utilization of outside truckers we don t see any big problem there that we ve not priced into our bids operator our next question comes from the line of andrew wittmann with robert w baird and company please proceed with your question andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst great good morning i guess i had some questions here on maybe i guess you called the guidance just doing some math and wanted to get your thoughts alan on this one but it looks like organic growth here in the march quarter was around 20 given that you gave the scruggs information there which is obviously very good and it looks like the growth rate for the back end of the year is pretty high maybe not quite that high but something probably in the teens growth rate the backlogs it s up but it s not up that much i guess the question for you is that the level of visibility that you have into the work that you need to book in the year that s going to be burned for the year and it looks like there s about 100 million delta between what you mentioned is already booked in which you still need to book to get there that s a long way of saying is how much how does the 100 million that you still need to book for this year compared to the past and how confident are you in capturing that work level alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah good question i mean first we re very confident because actually our contract backlog that is booked compared to what we have to complete is very comparable to what we normally see at march the difference between what we still have to do and contract backlog is about 40 of the number you mentioned so that remaining 100 million is the typical fob that we would have for our hot mix asphalt and things like that so that contract backlog is more in the 40 million to 50 million range not the 100 million range and that s very comparable percentage wise to what it s been in prior years andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst super helpful on that one my next question has to do around kind of the opportunities that you re seeing in your markets for future growth specifically where you could put some capital to work either through acquisition or greenfield how are those opportunities trending charles as you re looking around there do you feel like there is an opportunity to plant another greenfield here this fiscal year still or tuck in another acquisition just kind of want to get your latest on that charles e owens president and chief executive officer yeah we re seeing quite a bit of activity and it would been real selective on making sure that it s strategic for us and the culture and the management team that we re looking at and what we obviously see in a little bit of pickup of movements going around and we would hope to get the right candidate and get another one under our belt would be nice andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst okay and then i think my last question s going to be for ned ned during the quarter there was an announcement from the company where a number of the class b shares were converted into class a shares and i just wanted to get your perspective on the rationale and the reasoning behind that so that at least we as investors know why that happened certainly i think there was at least a couple of calls that we took that suggested like asking if there was some potential shareholders there that were looking on selling or if there s any other ramifications that might be applicable to your desired or ability to be included in various indices ned n fleming executive chairman of the board andy thank you for that question first and foremost we thought it was there and continue to believe it s in the best interest of the company and all the stakeholders for us to convert enough shares that as a result of doing that the company will qualify for several key indexes as well as some other smaller indexes we believe and we think it s important in today s market to be qualified for those indexes those were the really that s really the key reason andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst so basically there are some threshold there s something that you need to have a certain what voting power or something available to public market investors to be able to be included into those indices is that what you are saying ned n fleming executive chairman of the board correct so there are certain vendors to be included in those indices and as we took a step back and reviewed and tried to figure out from a capital structure standpoint what was in the best interests of the company to move forward and you see how many companies and how many shares on a daily basis trade as a result of the indexes we wanted to make sure that this was a company that was qualified for as many indexes as we can be qualified for andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst okay that makes sense i m going to leave it there thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of brent thielman with d a davidson please proceed with your question brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey thanks good morning great quarter alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning brent brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey maybe first one is for alan just kind of clarification looks like the dso is prepped up a little higher than usual this quarter anything to be aware of there just sort of timing of collections alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer no they really haven t what happens is that the timing of when we get our revenue is really the driver of that and our march revenue was significantly higher than january and february so when you look at it on a comparison of the accounts receivable to the revenue the most recent revenue it s right in line but what happens is when you measure that at the end of the receivables at the end of the quarter or last quarter our december sales were way down so our receivables at that moment because generally we collect the majority of our receivables within the 30 days other than the retainage which is included in those receivables but we ve not had any decline in the length average length of receivables but when you have a high revenue month then the receivables if that happens to be the last month of the quarter it s going to look like it s been an increase in the average days of sales and that same thing flows over to the cash flow statement when you look at the timing within the quarter of when that revenue is you can when our revenue ramps up naturally our receivables ramp up in that month and because we had such a strong second quarter especially the march period which is kind of the beginning of our heavy season then that s what you get with that brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay that s helpful alan i appreciate that i guess the next one be for any and all of you the balance sheet is in great shape i guess just sort of considering the need to maintain a little liquidity from working capital perspective and then i guess also bonding capacity perspectives can you just update us some what sort of dry powder you think you have to do with transaction or transactions right now alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ve said before that our debt ratio could go as high as 2 0 to ebitda so that we are below 1 now we re 0 88 so we could easily incur another 50 million 60 million worth of debt and still be below that two threshold and then as far as the cash on the balance sheet we re entering the period of the year where that will begin to grow again because we d kind of hit that ball which i just mentioned with march in that ramp up of the receivables so but even without that we would have probably about 50 million there so easily 100 million would be available if we were to deploy that in the need to deploy that for acquisitions and we are a positive generator of cash over the course of the year and we also have the flexibility we ve not in the last 18 months financed any of our capital expenditures but we also have that ability and then we ve got the money available under our line of credit so substantial dry powder brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay great and my last one actually two parts but one it sounds like alabama being nice opportunity as that funding starts slowing but are there other kind of state legislative initiatives you re tracking right now and some of your key markets that could be meaningful and then i guess as the dialogue goes on in washington around federal funding for infrastructure and who knows what ultimately happens there i guess i m curious between the markets you play and how dependent are they now on federal dollars versus the state initiatives for infrastructure spending that have moved forward in recent years alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah well first all of the states that we re operating in within the last three or four years have passed tax increases or other funding increases and several of those are just like alabama are being phased in over a period of time so we re seeing even though there s no new legislation in those other states the program that they put in place in the last three or four years has built in step ups in that over the next three or four years and so you ve got that several of them are also tied to population and inflation so they ve got built in escalators and we see that increase in those states continuing for several more years the percentage of work that we do that s tied to federal dollars has decreased over the years just because the states have stepped up and taken more of a lead if the federal program were to be enhanced then the states that we re in are in great shape to be able to take a federal dollar and turn it into 10 because they only have to provide a percentage of small percentage of the matching and so they have their matching funds available and so if something is done at the federal level a lot of other states will have to be scrambling to pass legislation to increase their funding in order to get those federal dollars or else they get reallocated to the five states we re in so there s a lot of strong positive things whether the federal does anything or not and historically we ve seen that as a minimum they maintain the current levels brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay i ll leave it there thank you alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of josh wilson with raymond james please proceed with your question josh wilson raymond james analyst thanks good morning and congratulations on the quarter alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning josh wilson raymond james analyst could you talk about what the average size of the projects are in your backlog in terms of is it still around that 1 million to 2 million alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t have exactly what it is but that would be fairly certain that it has not moved partly at all from that because we ve not booked any mega projects so we re still seeing that in the acquisitions that we made in the last two years that are construction related they have had similar revenue characteristics to ours but it s a mix of 200 000 million to 35 million 40 million all throughout that brand where that s not really changed josh wilson raymond james analyst got it and then regarding the acquisitions what was the impact of the acquired sales on gross margin in the quarter and what s the timing of getting through backlog that maybe has lower margins than you normally would operate at alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer if you re talking about the two recent acquisitions to the terminal does not have contract revenue and primarily all of those sales will be internal to us so it had no backlog and had very minimal impact almost negligible because it s we didn t get the tanks filled until the last week of march and just began shipping the acquisition in central florida in okeechobee it had a very negligible because just due to the size of it and then of course we gave the scruggs information its sales this quarter was 18 3 million and then had zero last same quarter last year because we ve not acquired so very negligible impact on revenue or margin josh wilson raymond james analyst i was trying to get at is there any margin impact from scruggs that maybe a backlog that can eventually roll through higher margins alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer there would be some impact but it s fairly small when it s about 10 of the total revenue in those jobs that we acquired there have performed at or better slightly better than what we ve had on the backlog because of some of the initiatives that we implemented with being able to get daily data out to the operations and also we re seeing good results from it josh wilson raymond james analyst good that s good to hear and then last one for me that you ve mentioned a step up in inventory related to the asphalt terminal are there any further ramp ups in inventory or have we reached sort of a new normal with the asphalt terminal in your business alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer in the most of the year this would be probably the majority of the impact one of the benefits of the terminal is having storage capacity to be able to fill the tanks in the winter when generally the cost of asphalt demand is lower than in the prime market times so in the winter we could actually put 2 times of that amount of inventory or even more into those tanks if the pricing is favorable for doing that so you could see that in the winter months december january february along and there we could have 10 million or 12 million worth of inventory stored because we can buy them at a very favorable price but other than that typically we would have at any one time 4 million to 6 million of inventory in those tanks the good thing is as soon as we sell it we ve collected the money because we re selling it to our sales josh wilson raymond james analyst great good luck for the next quarter alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen there are no further questions at this time and i would like to turn the floor back over to management for

thank you bob good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us i m pleased to report that the company s operating and financial performance continued to improve through the first quarter of this year with a 12 increase in volume 7 5 growth in revenue and improvement in operating and net income when excluding the alternative fuel tax credit from last year and the non cash adjustments from 2019 also importantly the initiatives that we began over a year ago to strengthen our balance sheet continue to pay off as we ended the quarter again with cash and investments exceeding debt our volume grew over 10 million gallons quarter over quarter as we delivered a total of 95 2 million gallons with our redeem renewable natural gas making up over half of that volume increase our core business of refuse and transit saw growth as did our subsidiary ng advantage and we re optimistic that the heavy duty trucking market will contribute to that growth later this year through our zero now financing program i know there s been a lot of interest in this program i m pleased to report that we ve begun to sign up fleets that are taking advantage of the offer to lease or purchase heavy duty trucks these trucks are equipped with the latest natural gas engine technology for the same price as a diesel truck and operate it with a fuel that is renewable and significantly cleaner but comes at a lower cost as i explained on our last call unlike what you hear from others we re engaged with fleets that are ready to take delivery of trucks which is different than simply putting down a deposit for a concept truck that won t be ready for delivery for years through our zero now program we have agreements with multiple firms which are leasing or purchasing new trucks equipped with the cummins westport 12 liter ultra low nox engine and will be fueling at our existing network of stations with redeem renewable natural gas these companies include tradelink transport and supra national express which operate in the ports of los angeles and long beach where the latest clean air plan continues to be implemented orders for new trucks were also placed through the zero now program by the largest bulk carrier kenan advantage group freight line express will be taking delivery of new trucks in northern california and after testing beta versions of the new cwi engine ttsi has placed an order for an additional 40 trucks to operate in southern california in addition to these companies we re in advanced negotiations with several dozen other fleets which represent the potential of orders for hundreds of new natural gas trucks the media limelight is currently placed on other alternatives like electric and fuel cells including at the recent act expo but i d like to quote one savvy analyst who has paid very close attention to this industry for many years in his report after visiting the floor of the expo he wrote quote natural gas is the clear cut leader in the clubhouse and what other technologies aspire to be end quote the trucking companies we have been speaking to are under pressure to meet lower emissions targets today while maintaining the performance of diesel and the only solution available is natural gas trucks they have seen the stories about recent roll outs of electric buses by a few transit agencies that have encountered serious operational issues like the lack of battery range charging times and ability to climb hills albuquerque transit agency s experience was such a disaster it sent back all the electric buses to the manufacturer scrapped the program and are in the process of ordering new natural gas buses transit agencies can easily experiment with electric buses because the federal government foots the bill for the almost the entire cost but trucking fleets don t have the luxury of the government covering such costly experiments so while others are grabbing easy headlines with big promises of the fuel of the future with very few details we are signing on trucking firms to a solution that tackles air quality and long term greenhouse gas issues today while giving them the performance they expect at a cost that is less than diesel as i mentioned earlier our core business continues to grow at a nice pace during the first quarter of this year we signed agreements with a number of transit agencies including bc transit serving the vancouver canada area which will be introducing 60 new cng buses that are expected to consume 720 000 gallons of fuel a year we have built and maintained three stations for bc transit the city of fresno renewed a contract for the delivery of an anticipated 6 million gallons of redeem to fuel 118 buses the city of santa clarita signed for an estimated 1 9 million annual gallons for 126 buses the port of seattle signed a contract that includes an estimated 400 000 gallons of cng for airport shuttle buses lax airport contracted for redeem to power 31 shuttle buses sun metro in el paso is adding 40 cng buses that we will fuel the los angeles metro signed with us to provide an expected 4 8 million gallons of redeem to power 41 new municipal buses over their life and the county of sacramento contracted for redeem to operate a fleet of school buses and airport vehicles and finally the county of orange public works department signed a five year fuel deal for an estimated 750 000 gallons of rng on the refuse side we signed agreements for fuel and services in the first quarter with livermore sanitation in california city of tacoma washington alameda county california usa hauling recycling in waterbury connecticut the city of philadelphia burrtec waste industries the city of redlands california and the city of sacramento california all in all the first quarter of 2019 was very productive and reinforces our optimism about the future of clean energy and natural gas fueling our financial performance and balance sheet continues to improve the acceptance of redeem is accelerating with existing customers switching from conventional natural gas and new customers are signing up for a renewable fuel that far exceeds climate change goals versus other alternatives our core business continues to grow and the heavy duty trucking market which has been a tough nut to crack in the past has begun to show signs of real progress looming stricter emission standards higher diesel prices and now a way ph for heavy duty truck fleets to get into a new natural gas fleet for the same price is catching a lot of notice from fleets that were previously reluctant and with that i will hand the call over to bob robert vreeland chief financial officer thank you andrew our financial results for the first quarter of 2019 were in line with our expectations and we maintain our financial outlook for the full year 2019 which we provided during our year end 2018 earnings call our volume growth in the first quarter of 12 above last year came from cng and lng both benefiting from incremental redeem gallons related to our expanded bp relationship cng volume also increased as a result of growth at ng advantage and from our refuse and transit sectors lng also increased due to greater bulk fuel deliveries compared to a year ago redeem volume grew 87 in the first quarter to 34 6 million gallons versus 18 5 million gallons a year ago our revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was 77 7 million which included a 5 million non cash loss on our zero now fuel hedge last year first quarter revenue of 102 4 million included 25 5 million in alternative fuel tax credits related to the calendar year 2017 the alternative fuel tax credits expired at the end of 2017 excluding the non cash zero now fuel hedge loss in 2019 and the alternative fuel tax credit revenue in 2018 total revenue increased 7 5 which reflects greater volumes at higher effective prices per gallon driven by rin and lcfs prices as well as retail pump prices our overall gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2019 was 18 9 million which was reduced by 5 million from the non cash zero now fuel hedge loss gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 47 6 million which was increased by the 25 5 million in alternative fuel tax credits exclusive of the 5 million reduction from zero now fuel hedge loss and the 25 million increase 25 5 million increase from the alternative fuel tax credit our 2019 gross profit margin increased by 1 7 million or 8 from a year ago due to increased volumes offset partially by a decline in station project margins our effective margin per gallon was 0 26 per gallon for the first quarter of 2019 consistent with a year ago and within our guidance range of 0 24 to 0 28 per gallon the first quarter of 2019 benefited primarily from higher redeem renewable natural gas sales and the related rin and lcfs credit revenue compared to 2018 our sg a in the first quarter of 2019 was 18 4 million versus 18 9 million a year ago looking forward we see some increases in quarterly sg a spending but for the year we still anticipate being within our expected range of 73 million to 79 million we also recognized a 2 7 million gain related to the sale of station assets this was part of an eminent domain process to accommodate improvements being made near one of our airport stations our gaap net loss for the first quarter of 2019 was 10 9 million compared to gaap net income of 12 2 million a year ago although last year included the favorable impact of 25 5 million in alternative fuel tax credit income while 2019 was negatively impacted by non cash losses of 6 6 million related to the zero now fuel hedge plus the change in fair value of stock warrants of ng advantage we saw the benefits of our lower debt balances in 2019 with interest expense declining by 2 6 million for the quarter compared to a year ago going from 4 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 to 1 9 million in the first quarter of 2019 our adjusted net loss for the first quarter of 2019 was 2 7 million compared to adjusted net income of 15 6 million in 2018 and our adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2019 was 11 2 million compared to 32 4 million in 2018 noting again that 2018 included 25 5 million in alternative fuel tax credit income we ended the first quarter of 2019 with 94 million in cash and investments which was essentially the same amount of cash and investments we had at the beginning of the quarter cash used in operations in the first quarter of 2019 of 8 2 million was offset with 5 1 million in cash received from our second year of a five year earn out from bp and 4 4 million in proceeds received from the station asset sale noted previously in addition ng advantage received 3 4 million in proceeds from equipment financing which we view as an offset against purchases of property and equipment our convertible debt due in june 2020 is unchanged at 50 million and our equipment and facility financing debt principally held at ng advantage is at 36 million as we see growth in our zero now truck program and expansions at ng advantage to support increased gas flow capabilities we ll likely see an increase in our debt balances during 2019 keeping in mind this debt will be directly attributed to contracted volume growth and with that operator we ll now open the call to questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions the first question is from eric stine craig hallum please go ahead sir aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst hi good afternoon it s aaron spychalla on for eric thanks for taking the questions andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer hi aaron robert vreeland chief financial officer hi aaron aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst maybe first on the zero now pipeline good to see and hear some of the recent traction there can you just maybe give a little bit more color on maybe what some of the gating factors that you re looking for before some of those fleets move forward with some of the larger purchases and then maybe just talk a little bit about your outlook to get to that we ve kind of been thinking that as around maybe a 2 500 truck program to start and maybe the potential to grow beyond that andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer right aaron i m still the we came up with that 2 500 number because that was just doing math of about 40 000 per truck and our friends at total had helped us with a debt for about 100 million but i still think it s a good number and it s one that we re shooting for we ve been at it here for a while started in late summer last year it took us a while what the gating factors are it took us a while to basically reeducate fleets kind of if you think with me on that what happened was you have to go back a couple of years to the collapse oil price with really the previous heavy duty engines some of which were the early earlier engines and some of the experience was we had some of the early adopter problems with some of those engines this of course is now is a new day with the new 12 liter low nox engine and of course today we have the renewable natural gas and so when we came out with the zero now financing we needed to go back and really educate fleets about the current state of play the current engine technology what was different this time we had to explain the zero now financing and why they could now move into a natural gas truck at essentially the same price as diesel explain the hedge which is very attractive as we ve discussed before on this call we re able to lock our customers into a fuel deal at a depending on where they operate as much as dollar a gallon fixed to the eia index for the length of that lease in many cases four to five years it s very attractive this though takes a while and before we can end up signing the deals we take it takes several steps and then they have to order the trucks right and sign a fuel contract with us which is new and so i d like to say there really aren t any showstoppers here it s really one of education and it s one that we ve continued to do we ve continued to increase the pipeline so i m feeling good about that i monitor it regularly with our vice president of sales and the pipeline continues to grow that is the numbers of fleets that are entertaining purchases of trucks but then we have to move through the process so that release a couple days ago got you to kind of where we are today and what i mentioned today is we ve got more that we re in the negotiation process with negotiation and contracting phase today so i m feeling pretty good about the way that s going but it s but this is buying a real truck for 125 000 committing to five years worth of fuel even though it s at a discount this isn t putting down an order this is or a reservation this is buying stuff and so in many cases when we re talking 20 or 30 trucks you re into millions and millions of dollars so these guys take it seriously they are faced with a higher diesel price today and i note that today diesel in the port of la is 4 09 so we have a very competitive price so i hope that maybe helps we still i think that 25 number 2 500 truck number is a good number though it ll take us the entire year to get to that number and of course you won t see all those volumes this year but you ll begin to see it in the next year aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst right understood yeah thanks thanks for the color there maybe second can you just give an update on some of the programs down there in california whether it s at the ports or with the sip or in the south coast maybe kind of what you re looking for there kind of near term as far as any kind of funding dollars or truck deployments that would be great andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer well there s a lot of pieces to all that but those for those on the call that maybe aren t quite as familiar as you are aaron there s of course there s a thing called the state implementation program a lot of states have this that are not in compliance certainly the southern california still has the dirtiest air quality in the nation we have a plan that we have to get into compliance i think it s by 2023 and we re way short the inventory of emissions and what we would need to do to get in compliance to theoretically continue our federal funding and all that kind of thing is we ve got a lot of work to do in fact at its highest level i think that the plan would say that you ve got to get 70 000 heavy duty trucks to like a zero like a low nox truck and 150 000 medium duty trucks now i don t see any rules or funding or anything in place right now that gets you there but that just tells me that there are going to be other emissions requirements and other and continued grant funding because 70 of the problem that we have in southern california is nox and that s coming from these heavy duty vehicles all right so now then if you look at the clean air action plan which governs the it s been adopted by the port of los angeles and jointly by the port of long beach those two ports sit side by side there they adopted a plan that had stuff on ships and yard hustling equipment and also of course trucks and this was kind of phase 2 of the plan because 10 years ago they cleaned up some of the diesel trucks and introduced natural gas trucks that still is in place that plan essentially says that by 2020 the business as we see it today is not the way it could go that in order to comply in 2020 you re going to have to either buy a natural near zero natural gas truck or an electric truck and if you continue you can continue to operate a diesel truck but they are now working on what the fee will be associated to operate that diesel truck they re doing some economic analysis to see how high that fee needs to be and what make sure they don t destabilize the competitiveness of the port i think that s all kind of rocking along there s a lot of tension there between people that don t want to do things and people that would rather slow this down i m betting that it s going to continue to be in place we see a lot of grants from the state of california and even locally to assist in this transition i think there s close to 400 trucks that have already been granted money that could participate and will participate in this program a lot of those contracts are in the process in the next month now so i m guessing by the latter part of this year we could see a couple of hundred to 300 350 natural gas trucks in the port these will be early adopters as the rules won t have gone into effect but i think it ll be a very nice by the end of the year if i m right you ll have 300 there s about 50 down there right now so you ll have close to 400 trucks operating showing what s viable today and why it works and these trucks will be saving money versus the prospect of maybe waiting another five years for an electric truck so i think all of that s going to happen in the future in the port of la is if the fee goes in as we expect that there s probably somewhere north of 10 000 trucks over the next couple or three years that will have to be retired we saw the fee last time around switched the fleet pretty quickly because the walmarts of the world don t want to pay a fee they want to hire somebody that s in compliance so we re very optimistic we have as you know the fueling down on the port we have the product today we have some grants in place so i think you re going to see this as the beachhead for a lot of movement on the and we also run kind of a modified zero now program for the port too aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst understood andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer that was a lot i hope that answered your question aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst no no that s really the color we ve been kind of hearing some of the same stuff there so thanks for the detail and then maybe last just kind of on the model a little bit on the station construction line can you just talk about how you think that trends the rest of the year and kind of the outlook the mix there between new stations and upgrades robert vreeland chief financial officer yeah it generally trends up as we move through the year we were we kind of guided to the 25 million 30 million range and we still believe we ll get inside that range it s just it gets it can be a little lumpy but generally speaking the activity picks up as we move through the year andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer i know aaron right now there s about i was talking to our people ph in charge of this earlier this morning you have about 22 stations that are currently in process and there will be more i think there were two more added just in the last day or two our fellows were at the waste the big waste convention and usually they come back with some of those so it seems to me that the station construction line is a little lighter than we ve seen it before and i think we ve kind of guided to that it s still robust but it s not as high as we ve seen maybe a couple of years ago i imagine when you shake it all out it ll be somewhere and i m not talking about millions i m talking about projects now it ll be in the 30 we ll have 30 projects or so under way here by the in the third quarter fourth quarter aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst all right thanks for taking the questions and congrats on another good quarter of volume growth andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer thank you robert vreeland chief financial officer thanks operator the next question is from rob brown lake street capital markets please go ahead sir rob brown lake street partners llc analyst good afternoon robert vreeland chief financial officer hey rob andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer hi rob rob brown lake street partners llc analyst i just want to touch on redeem and the that market how is the volume supply in that market are you seeing any constraints there as you grow or do you feel like you ve got the capacity or contracts in place to fulfill the demand andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer i think we re in general balanced right now we re seeing volume more supply coming into the market which is a good thing because we re getting more customers to come to the party if you kind of look back over the last couple of years one point we re a little short on supply and then there s been more supply coming to the market we work with our friends at bp for instance and we re constantly looking at showing them the our demand forecast and they re constantly looking at more supply the market is responding in terms of supply and we re doing our part on the demand side of the equation we have a lot of customers in areas of the country where we re not using rng yet so we can use more supply and the good news is that supply is coming i think we re going to be in general supply balanced for the for this year and then a bunch of more supply shows up which will be timely because we re going to need it rob brown lake street partners llc analyst okay great and then in terms of cost structure you ve done a good job of taking it down do you feel like you re at a level here that s that where you want to be or do you see it where do you see it going andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer well i think what bob gets worried when you start doing the modeling i think this is generally this level of sga is about right it s down a little bit this quarter it may pop up just a little bit but it s in this range this just feels comfortable for us we re growing we re building more stations we re put more customers in the program and yet we ve been able to kind of hold the line we re trying to do some things though on the marketing side which will add some a little bit of cost that you ll see probably here this next quarter as we promote with shippers and others on the zero now program but i d say this is generally about the right about we ve got it about just as high as can get it on the sga line and i think that s a pretty good number don t you bob robert vreeland chief financial officer yeah i think it s we re good right now and we constantly kind of look at that and what we think we need to do to support the business and grow the business so that s why i commented we may not see as low a quarter as we go forward a little bit because we still have work to do on promoting zero now and other programs it takes a lot of effort to be out there promoting what we do

the past week as investors looked to hedge against the uncertainty of the us china trade negotiations over the last week the japanese yen and gold have underperformed the us dollar benefiting from

increase awaiting a reaction from china confirmation bias economists are still divided as to whether the rba has shifted its bias with many reading the central bank s statement on monetary policy as conveying very different messages taken together with tuesday s post meeting statement it doesn t sound like the rba have moved to an easing bias said cba s kristina clifton who is yet to forecast rate cuts this year amp s mark roberts read it differently we read the rba s commentary as having an implicit easing bias given that their forecasts assume two rate cuts which is still not enough to get underlying inflation significantly higher from here he said

finally alan will review our financial results and discuss our outlook we are pleased with our performance during the second fiscal quarter revenue for the quarter was 164 3 million up 38 3 compared to last year gross profit and adjusted ebitda were both up compared to the second quarter last year with gross profit of 19 8 million up 44 and adjusted ebitda of 13 9 million up 74 2 we had favorable working conditions throughout our markets during the quarter we also grew our backlog to 584 8 million at march 31 2019 with approximately 380 million of that amount to be completed during our current fiscal year project opportunities remained strong across our markets and we continue to pursue additional opportunities that can be completed both in the current fiscal year and beyond we earned approximately 40 of our annual revenue though during the first half of the fiscal year this was in line with our traditional seasonal pattern we typically benefit in the second half of our fiscal year from more favorable working conditions due to normal weather patterns longer working days and other factors in late february we announced two strategic acquisitions a liquid asphalt terminal in panama city florida and asphalt production and paving company in south central florida these two companies are now fully integrated the liquid asphalt terminal was part of our vertical integration strategy and allows us to supply liquid asphalt to a number of our plants in the southern portion of our geographic footprint including florida alabama and georgia we began shipments from the terminal in march the asphalt company we acquired in okeechobee florida extends our ability to service new markets and florida through an expansion geographic presence in the state and as we have discussed before we drive growth through three primary levers in our business model doing more work in our current market through strategic acquisitions and through greenfield expansions in which we establish a new plant to service a particular market currently project demand remains favorable in our markets and state funding continues to grow to support infrastructure projects in march alabama lawmakers approved an increase in the state s gas tax this is the first increase in alabama s gas tax since 1992 and is expected to generate approximately 320 million in additional annual funding when fully implemented this increase would be phased in over three years starting in october 2019 lastly i d like to welcome our new board of director noreen skelly we are very pleased to have noreen joined the board of directors and chair of the audit committee before turning the call over to ned i d like to take a moment to reflect on our recent one year anniversary as a public company over the past year we have completed three acquisitions and continued to grow in our existing markets as a result revenue has increased 18 3 for the six months ended march 31 2019 over the same period last year prior to our ipo i would especially like to thank our senior management team for their leadership and our more than 2 100 employees for their dedication and hard work and that enables us to execute our strategy now i d like to turn the call over to ned fleming our executive chairman for a few additional comments ned ned n fleming executive chairman of the board thank you charles and good morning to everyone as the chairman of the board and behalf of all the directors i too would like to welcome noreen skelly to our board to recognize that she had leadership strength financial acumen and diversity to our board and we are all looking forward to her participation and input i d like to reiterate some of charles s comment this quarter s performance is a direct result of the efficiency experience and hard work of each employee at cpi they are doing an excellent job on a daily basis executing the strategy charles allen and the entire leadership team has driven throughout the entire organization the company is strategically positioned in all our markets to compound double digits top line growth generate excellent margins in the industry and with a strong balance sheet is prepared to execute acquisitions this business is geographically located to benefit from operating in the fast growing southeastern states where both the demand for ongoing road repair projects is coupled with increased public funding to pay for the work this demand and funding continue to grow in our markets as evidenced by the alabama s recent gas tax increase with strong demand and solid funding coupled with a track record of results in a strong growth outlook we believe construction partners represents a compelling investment as our team continues to consistently execute we believe it will be apparent to the market that cpi represents a unique model for public infrastructure companies the nature of our recurring publicly funded maintenance projects with shorter duration and lower volatility risk from input costs distinguishes our business model through the leadership of our highly experienced team both here in dothan and throughout our platform companies construction partners is well positioned to execute our plan and grow the business one of the most compelling aspects of cpi is its consistency we ve seen it over the past 20 years as we continue to meet with investors and tell our story we believe the market will appreciate the opportunity that cpi represents i believe we are well positioned for continued growth in 2019 and beyond and with that i d like to turn the call over to our cfo alan palmer alan alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you ned and good morning everyone i want to start by quickly highlighting our key metric performance in the second quarter from a financial standpoint as we ve discussed favorable working conditions in the quarter improved compared to the first fiscal quarter and led to increase this year over year for our second fiscal quarter revenue for the quarter increased 45 4 million over the same quarter last year revenue attributable to scruggs which we acquired subsequent to march 31 2018 was 18 3 million and we were also able to complete work on our projects that were delayed in our first quarter into december 31 2018 gross profit increased approximately 6 1 million primarily due to higher revenue the higher gross profit percentage of revenue was a result of increased hma production and equipment utilization resulting in an increase of fixed cost absorption during the quarter net income was 4 2 million down from the same period last year however excluding the impact of a non recurring after tax settlement of 10 6 million in the second quarter of 2018 net income was up 3 7 million earnings per share were 0 08 down from 0 27 which was also impacted by the legal settlement last year adjusted ebitda was 5 9 million resulting in an adjusted ebitda margin of 8 5 compared to 6 7 for the same period in the prior year the higher adjusted ebitda margin was a combination of a higher gross profit margin and a lower general and administrative expense percentage looking at our input cost we have seen some recent increase in asphalt cement pricing but currently we do not anticipate changes to have a significant impact in 2019 in late march we began shipments from our newly acquired liquid asphalt terminal in florida we believe over the coming year that we can achieve between 20 and 30 basis points in margin improvement through the use of this terminal g a expenses in the quarter were consistent with our expectations and included an increase of 800 000 due to scruggs and 700 000 due to public company costs that we did not have in the same quarter last year the increase was partially offset by 600 000 decrease in equity based compensation expense we will continue to diligently manage margin to do this we must also be active in understanding exactly what we are seeing in our markets our business is very competitive and as with most industries hot spots of competition can move around we continue to successfully navigate the competitive environment maintaining our market position while also steering revenues to stronger markets as opportunities present themselves strategically our organization maximizes efficiencies through scale and flexibility to move crews and equipment to take advantage of favorable margins and to maintain ebitda backlog provides cpi with significant visibility into the next 12 to 18 months we define backlog as projects for which we either have an executed contract or currently working on that contract where we are the low better on a public project and we have commitment from the customer but not an executed contract backlog does not include any future external sales of hot mix asphalt or aggregates in march 31 2019 backlog was 584 8 million of this amount 65 approximately 380 8 million is expected to be completed during the 2019 fiscal year in addition as charles mentioned opportunities for future projects in our markets remains favorable as we will be at on a number of construction projects that we would expect to complete both during the current fiscal year and beyond turning now to the balance sheet at march 31 2019 we had 61 9 million of cash and 14 3 million of availability under our 30 million revolving credit facility after deducting outstanding letters of credit our debt to trailing 12 months ebitda ratio was less than 1 time at 0 88 we have a very strong balance sheet to support the growth opportunities we re seeing cash provided by operating activities was 5 3 million for the six months ended march 31 2019 compared to 28 1 million for the six months ended march 31 2018 this decreases is due to higher accounts receivable and work in progress balances of significantly higher quarterly revenue and a 4 6 million increase in inventory related to the operation of our new liquid asphalt terminal capex in the second quarter was 12 4 million compared to 12 5 million in the same quarter last year for fiscal 2019 we expect our capital expenditures to be in the range of 38 million to 42 million which compares to 42 8 million in fiscal 2018 before we turn the call over for your questions i d like to review our financial outlook for the full fiscal year 2019 which ends september 30 2019 we have raised the outlook with regard to revenue net income and adjusted ebitda our 2019 outlook now calls for revenue in the range of 790 million to 810 million compared to 680 1 million in fiscal 2018 net income in the range of 40 75 million to 44 million compared to 50 8 million in fiscal 2018 as a reminder net income in fiscal 2018 included a non recurring 10 6 million after tax settlement adjusted ebitda in the range of 88 9 million to 92 5 million compared to 75 5 million in fiscal 2018 and finally our fiscal year 2019 outlook does not take into account any future acquisitions or greenfield expansions that may occur during the remainder of the year the outlook also does not include the potential impact of any new federal or state infrastructure or highway related legislation that could be passed in 2019 for modeling perspective i d also like to mention that our effective tax rate in 2019 will be approximately 25 compared to 17 2 in our prior fiscal year with that we will now take questions operator questions and answers operator thank you we ll now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of trey grooms with stephens please proceed with your question trey grooms stephens analyst hi good morning gentlemen charles e owens president and chief executive officer good morning trey grooms stephens analyst so i ve got a couple of questions here first where were you guys seeing the upside in the quarter any specific geography or geographic markets that stand out to you versus kind of your expectations going into the quarter charles e owens president and chief executive officer no we didn t have any markets that in particular they where all they re favorable working conditions and our team just got out and performed trey grooms stephens analyst and on the public side that clearly looks pretty good but what are you guys seeing right now on the private side of the business and remind us is that still about 30 of the business alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it is and we re still seeing from a backlog standpoint very good backlog in private work primarily commercial we ve lowered our residential portion of our private work on purpose but we still have a very strong commercial product work backlog trey grooms stephens analyst and so when you say commercial can you give us some examples on the private side are these large kind of projects on non res side or more some of the commercial that follows residential what do you guys generally see on the private side what type of work you do in there charles e owens president and chief executive officer some of it could be the schools is being built and then we have different shopping areas this being built and office complexes and developments like that trey grooms stephens analyst i ve got you ok and with your public business so can you help us kind of dissect that piece just a little bit i know most of what you guys do on the public side is i guess would be considered more maintenance but can you kind of give us that breakdown in what you re seeing on the more maintenance side of things versus what you would be seeing on maybe lane expansions or something like that that would be considered maybe new public construction alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer there is not really much of a change in that we participate in the larger projects when they re in our market and we have an opportunity but our core businesses are those maintenance type projects that just continued to reoccur and we ve seen with the increased tax revenue that s come into the states they re really trying to make sure that they get those roads that are in poor repair back in good condition so not really much a change there there are no big large projects that we ve added to backlog that would skew it different from what we ve had in the past trey grooms stephens analyst okay and last one for me is just around some of the costs there what are you guys seeing or maybe your outlook for labor and freight costs from where we stand today alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean our labor cost is pretty steady i think i ve shared before generally we make payroll adjustments annually so throughout the year we don t have swings in our labor cost typically we ve got a very stable workforce and we re employing people that are in these markets and they re always in those markets so we re not seeing much of a change there that s been built in to our bids and our cost so not any real fluctuation there we do put certain percentage of our own trucking so that helps us to mitigate any things that are happening out in the market but clearly trucking is type but being in these local markets where we ve got a steady revenue and a steady utilization of outside truckers we don t see any big problem there that we ve not priced into our bids operator our next question comes from the line of andrew wittmann with robert w baird and company please proceed with your question andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst great good morning i guess i had some questions here on maybe i guess you called the guidance just doing some math and wanted to get your thoughts alan on this one but it looks like organic growth here in the march quarter was around 20 given that you gave the scruggs information there which is obviously very good and it looks like the growth rate for the back end of the year is pretty high maybe not quite that high but something probably in the teens growth rate the backlogs it s up but it s not up that much i guess the question for you is that the level of visibility that you have into the work that you need to book in the year that s going to be burned for the year and it looks like there s about 100 million delta between what you mentioned is already booked in which you still need to book to get there that s a long way of saying is how much how does the 100 million that you still need to book for this year compared to the past and how confident are you in capturing that work level alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah good question i mean first we re very confident because actually our contract backlog that is booked compared to what we have to complete is very comparable to what we normally see at march the difference between what we still have to do and contract backlog is about 40 of the number you mentioned so that remaining 100 million is the typical fob that we would have for our hot mix asphalt and things like that so that contract backlog is more in the 40 million to 50 million range not the 100 million range and that s very comparable percentage wise to what it s been in prior years andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst super helpful on that one my next question has to do around kind of the opportunities that you re seeing in your markets for future growth specifically where you could put some capital to work either through acquisition or greenfield how are those opportunities trending charles as you re looking around there do you feel like there is an opportunity to plant another greenfield here this fiscal year still or tuck in another acquisition just kind of want to get your latest on that charles e owens president and chief executive officer yeah we re seeing quite a bit of activity and it would been real selective on making sure that it s strategic for us and the culture and the management team that we re looking at and what we obviously see in a little bit of pickup of movements going around and we would hope to get the right candidate and get another one under our belt would be nice andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst okay and then i think my last question s going to be for ned ned during the quarter there was an announcement from the company where a number of the class b shares were converted into class a shares and i just wanted to get your perspective on the rationale and the reasoning behind that so that at least we as investors know why that happened certainly i think there was at least a couple of calls that we took that suggested like asking if there was some potential shareholders there that were looking on selling or if there s any other ramifications that might be applicable to your desired or ability to be included in various indices ned n fleming executive chairman of the board andy thank you for that question first and foremost we thought it was there and continue to believe it s in the best interest of the company and all the stakeholders for us to convert enough shares that as a result of doing that the company will qualify for several key indexes as well as some other smaller indexes we believe and we think it s important in today s market to be qualified for those indexes those were the really that s really the key reason andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst so basically there are some threshold there s something that you need to have a certain what voting power or something available to public market investors to be able to be included into those indices is that what you are saying ned n fleming executive chairman of the board correct so there are certain vendors to be included in those indices and as we took a step back and reviewed and tried to figure out from a capital structure standpoint what was in the best interests of the company to move forward and you see how many companies and how many shares on a daily basis trade as a result of the indexes we wanted to make sure that this was a company that was qualified for as many indexes as we can be qualified for andrew wittmann robert w baird and company analyst okay that makes sense i m going to leave it there thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of brent thielman with d a davidson please proceed with your question brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey thanks good morning great quarter alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning brent brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey maybe first one is for alan just kind of clarification looks like the dso is prepped up a little higher than usual this quarter anything to be aware of there just sort of timing of collections alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer no they really haven t what happens is that the timing of when we get our revenue is really the driver of that and our march revenue was significantly higher than january and february so when you look at it on a comparison of the accounts receivable to the revenue the most recent revenue it s right in line but what happens is when you measure that at the end of the receivables at the end of the quarter or last quarter our december sales were way down so our receivables at that moment because generally we collect the majority of our receivables within the 30 days other than the retainage which is included in those receivables but we ve not had any decline in the length average length of receivables but when you have a high revenue month then the receivables if that happens to be the last month of the quarter it s going to look like it s been an increase in the average days of sales and that same thing flows over to the cash flow statement when you look at the timing within the quarter of when that revenue is you can when our revenue ramps up naturally our receivables ramp up in that month and because we had such a strong second quarter especially the march period which is kind of the beginning of our heavy season then that s what you get with that brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay that s helpful alan i appreciate that i guess the next one be for any and all of you the balance sheet is in great shape i guess just sort of considering the need to maintain a little liquidity from working capital perspective and then i guess also bonding capacity perspectives can you just update us some what sort of dry powder you think you have to do with transaction or transactions right now alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ve said before that our debt ratio could go as high as 2 0 to ebitda so that we are below 1 now we re 0 88 so we could easily incur another 50 million 60 million worth of debt and still be below that two threshold and then as far as the cash on the balance sheet we re entering the period of the year where that will begin to grow again because we d kind of hit that ball which i just mentioned with march in that ramp up of the receivables so but even without that we would have probably about 50 million there so easily 100 million would be available if we were to deploy that in the need to deploy that for acquisitions and we are a positive generator of cash over the course of the year and we also have the flexibility we ve not in the last 18 months financed any of our capital expenditures but we also have that ability and then we ve got the money available under our line of credit so substantial dry powder brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay great and my last one actually two parts but one it sounds like alabama being nice opportunity as that funding starts slowing but are there other kind of state legislative initiatives you re tracking right now and some of your key markets that could be meaningful and then i guess as the dialogue goes on in washington around federal funding for infrastructure and who knows what ultimately happens there i guess i m curious between the markets you play and how dependent are they now on federal dollars versus the state initiatives for infrastructure spending that have moved forward in recent years alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah well first all of the states that we re operating in within the last three or four years have passed tax increases or other funding increases and several of those are just like alabama are being phased in over a period of time so we re seeing even though there s no new legislation in those other states the program that they put in place in the last three or four years has built in step ups in that over the next three or four years and so you ve got that several of them are also tied to population and inflation so they ve got built in escalators and we see that increase in those states continuing for several more years the percentage of work that we do that s tied to federal dollars has decreased over the years just because the states have stepped up and taken more of a lead if the federal program were to be enhanced then the states that we re in are in great shape to be able to take a federal dollar and turn it into 10 because they only have to provide a percentage of small percentage of the matching and so they have their matching funds available and so if something is done at the federal level a lot of other states will have to be scrambling to pass legislation to increase their funding in order to get those federal dollars or else they get reallocated to the five states we re in so there s a lot of strong positive things whether the federal does anything or not and historically we ve seen that as a minimum they maintain the current levels brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay i ll leave it there thank you alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of josh wilson with raymond james please proceed with your question josh wilson raymond james analyst thanks good morning and congratulations on the quarter alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning josh wilson raymond james analyst could you talk about what the average size of the projects are in your backlog in terms of is it still around that 1 million to 2 million alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t have exactly what it is but that would be fairly certain that it has not moved partly at all from that because we ve not booked any mega projects so we re still seeing that in the acquisitions that we made in the last two years that are construction related they have had similar revenue characteristics to ours but it s a mix of 200 000 million to 35 million 40 million all throughout that brand where that s not really changed josh wilson raymond james analyst got it and then regarding the acquisitions what was the impact of the acquired sales on gross margin in the quarter and what s the timing of getting through backlog that maybe has lower margins than you normally would operate at alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer if you re talking about the two recent acquisitions to the terminal does not have contract revenue and primarily all of those sales will be internal to us so it had no backlog and had very minimal impact almost negligible because it s we didn t get the tanks filled until the last week of march and just began shipping the acquisition in central florida in okeechobee it had a very negligible because just due to the size of it and then of course we gave the scruggs information its sales this quarter was 18 3 million and then had zero last same quarter last year because we ve not acquired so very negligible impact on revenue or margin josh wilson raymond james analyst i was trying to get at is there any margin impact from scruggs that maybe a backlog that can eventually roll through higher margins alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer there would be some impact but it s fairly small when it s about 10 of the total revenue in those jobs that we acquired there have performed at or better slightly better than what we ve had on the backlog because of some of the initiatives that we implemented with being able to get daily data out to the operations and also we re seeing good results from it josh wilson raymond james analyst good that s good to hear and then last one for me that you ve mentioned a step up in inventory related to the asphalt terminal are there any further ramp ups in inventory or have we reached sort of a new normal with the asphalt terminal in your business alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer in the most of the year this would be probably the majority of the impact one of the benefits of the terminal is having storage capacity to be able to fill the tanks in the winter when generally the cost of asphalt demand is lower than in the prime market times so in the winter we could actually put 2 times of that amount of inventory or even more into those tanks if the pricing is favorable for doing that so you could see that in the winter months december january february along and there we could have 10 million or 12 million worth of inventory stored because we can buy them at a very favorable price but other than that typically we would have at any one time 4 million to 6 million of inventory in those tanks the good thing is as soon as we sell it we ve collected the money because we re selling it to our sales josh wilson raymond james analyst great good luck for the next quarter alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen there are no further questions at this time and i would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments charles e owens president and chief executive officer okay thank you and this is charles and i just want to thank everyone for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you on

thank you to the banque de france for giving me the opportunity to speak at this conference both as chair of the bank for international settlements committee on payments and market infrastructures cpmi and as member of the executive board of the european central bank since my remarks dwell on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures i would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to alberto giovannini who passed away two weeks ago alberto combined theoretical insight with a deep understanding of how financial markets work his 2001 and 2003 reports on cross border clearing and settlement arrangements in the eu have shaped the discussion on european post market activities he would have encouraged us to start our discussion from first principles and recognise cyber resilience for what it is a global public good the financial system is changing fast digitalisation has led to improvements in access to services as well as in their quality and convenience in the field of payments services are increasingly instant 24 7 and globally available non bank participants meanwhile are disrupting traditional intermediation artificial intelligence and machine learning are just two of the innovations promising to revolutionise financial services but revolution and evolution typically come with new risks while not eliminating all the old ones criminals for example have always exploited technology in 1973 the chief teller at a branch of the union dime savings bank in new york used the recently introduced computers to steal 1 5 million dollars from hundreds of accounts the largest recorded theft from a savings bank at the time identity theft fraud and robbery are as old as human society yet today thieves fraud and robbers can leverage financial systems which are digital and global making the threat remarkably larger cyber criminals often target the weakest entry points and exploit these vulnerabilities to penetrate the global financial network the hackers who stole 81 million dollars from bangladesh bank s account in new york in 2016 most probably did so from the other side of the world state actors with no financial motivation and an ability to cause even greater destruction are also lurking and even more worryingly we are seeing a new form of organised crime the dark web is home to a number of networks where access credentials and penetration tools are sold hacking jobs are allocated to the lowest bidder and proceeds are laundered using cryptocurrencies the implications for policymakers are clear because cyber risks are borderless they can only be tackled jointly at the global level i commend the banque de france for devoting an entire panel to this topic at this timely conference in my remarks today i will first describe what international cooperation currently looks like in this area before sharing some thoughts on how this cooperation can work both from the top down and from the bottom up my remarks should be considered through the lens of both the policy and implementation work of the cpmi and the work of the ecb together with other european institutions to put into practice at european level the internationally agreed rules protecting the core and securing the periphery the cpmi as the global standard setter for payments clearing and settlement naturally plays a key role in the global governance of issues related to cybersecurity together with the work of the g7 cyber expert group the financial stability board and other international standard setting bodies such as the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs and the international organization of securities commissions iosco the work of the cpmi provides the necessary basis for authorities around the world to help protect the financial system against cyber fraud the cpmi s overarching strategy is in a nutshell to secure the periphery and protect the core by the periphery we mean the outer layers of the financial system the endpoints and networks through which financial institutions connect to systemically important wholesale or interbank payment systems that is those endpoints exploited by the hackers to steal funds from bangladesh bank to minimise such risks last year we published a report that sets out a flexible way for both public and private stakeholders to prevent detect respond to and communicate about fraudulent payments and payment requests the other half of our strategy relates to the core of the financial system the critical payment systems and financial market infrastructures fmis that ensure the smooth functioning of our financial system the backbone or the plumbing to protect this core three years ago the cpmi together with our colleagues at iosco published a report on cyber resilience for fmis this was the first internationally agreed guidance on cyber security for the financial industry today it still provides a coherent approach that requires strong governance and oversight of all aspects of prudent cyber risk management at fmis including robust testing situational awareness and continued learning and our approach is not just for fmis it can be applied to almost any financial or non financial company indeed one of the findings in the recent bcbs report on cyber practices is that the cpmi iosco guidance is one of the three standards currently used by banking supervisors implementation is crucial but challenging of course the proof of the pudding is in the eating the value of the work of standard setting bodies lies in its implementation cpmi and iosco authorities have been working closely with fmis in their respective jurisdictions on the implementation of the cpmi iosco guidance i will expand in a moment on what the ecb has done in this respect at the international level we plan to begin more detailed implementation monitoring this year our wholesale payments strategy meanwhile has been endorsed by all bis governors who are committed to implementing it in due course to promote the widest possible application of the strategy and achieve global cohesion in standards i together with mark carney governor of the bank of england and chair of two bis central bank groups recently addressed around 100 other central bank governors encouraging them to commit to the strategy and providing details about how we can help each other learn and evolve many have already taken us up on our offer of support beyond this we are coordinating with industry stakeholders to develop best practices to prevent wholesale payment fraud across the ecosystem and sharing these best practices through our outreach efforts last september i co chaired here at the banque de france the first roundtable among ceos of the 22 largest global and regional fmis and their supervisors the meeting explored how we collectively fmis and supervisors could strengthen cyber resilience to defend against a common threat we identified three areas where the challenges require us to work closely together to find solutions i data integrity ii information sharing and iii third party service providers data integrity is a broad concept but a lot of our discussion today focuses on the two hour recovery time objective the cpmi iosco principles for financial market infrastructures require fmis to be able to recover from an operational outage within two hours at first many dismissed this target as illusory but technological progress has since made it universally achievable for most advanced and systemically important fmis yet there remains a critical risk that a rush for recovery after a cyber outage may be counterproductive in the event that the underlying data have been corrupted rebooting a system with corrupt data that break every participant s reconciliation tools and sow further market discord would to put it bluntly be a disaster how to tackle this issue is one of the topics that the industry is discussing in three international working groups that emerged from the ceo roundtable there are a number of possible avenues to explore including contingent arrangements segregated ledgers and frequent reconciliations the cpmi and iosco will act as catalysts for these groups as needed and we will keep up to date with their progress similar groups are planned to explore open issues related to the two other areas i mentioned before information sharing and third party service provision for information sharing common protocols exist to share financial events but for operational incidents these protocols have so far been segregated by type of fmi market and jurisdiction a common international protocol for operational incidents could enable faster and better informed responses for third party service provision such as cloud services cooperation among fmis can improve safety arrangements by providing a clearer view of common service providers risk management practices common action also has the potential to improve efficiency by avoiding the duplication of third party risk assessments the eurosystem s cyber resilience strategy taken together the work of the cpmi and other standard setting bodies has provided fmis and other entities with a rich and diverse environment in which to learn how to effectively fend off cyber incidents which are becoming more frequent and increasingly sophisticated work by other institutions supports these efforts at various levels at a global level for example work by the g7 cyber expert group sets out fundamental elements for risk management and simulates the impact of major cross border cyber incidents involving g7 financial authorities work at regional level can feed into and inform such global initiatives the ecb is a good example of both bottom up and top down international cooperation on the one hand the ecb has taken the lead in implementing the cpmi iosco guidance in recent years the governing council quickly approved the eurosystem cyber resilience strategy for fmis which looks to operationalise the cpmi iosco cyber guidance in the 19 euro area countries in march 2017 at the same time the ecb has also made an important contribution to establishing international best practices and building cyber resilience capacities in developing countries and emerging market economies more specifically the eurosystem cyber strategy is built on three core pillars i fmi resilience ii sector resilience and iii strategic industry regulator dialogue let me briefly explain the key initiatives under each pillar under the first pillar fmi resilience in december 2018 the ecb published its cyber resilience oversight expectations croe a tool for both fmis and overseers these expectations contain detailed best practices for operationalising the cpmi iosco guidance the eurosystem is currently repeating a cyber survey among 76 fmis to evaluate the extent to which the sector has improved in terms of cyber maturity and to assess the macro vulnerabilities of the sector more broadly last year the eurosystem also developed the european framework for threat intelligence based ethical red teaming tiber eu red teaming helps institutions to assess by means of controlled ethical hacking if and how an entity is capable of withstanding a cyber attack and because tiber eu involves high end testing on live production systems we are currently reflecting on how to foster an accreditation and certification capability in the eu this would allow cybersecurity service providers to raise standards around threat intelligence and red team testing and to have their capabilities in this field validated both the croe and tiber eu are tools that could eventually be used around the world in fact i am pleased to announce that the croe has recently been embraced by the world bank with a view to promoting global harmonisation and enhancing the cyber resilience of fmis in developing and emerging countries under its mandate and since its publication tiber eu has been adopted by the ecb and a number of european countries the ecb is also in close dialogue with other jurisdictions that are considering tiber eu as a tool for their respective financial sectors under the second pillar of the eurosystem s cyber strategy sector resilience we recognise the strong interconnectedness of the financial ecosystem and the potential of a coordinated cyber attack to trigger a broad contagion effect which may have an impact on the financial sector as a whole in june 2018 the ecb hosted unitas a market wide crisis communication exercise which facilitated discussion among fmis active at the pan european level these discussions focused on the scenario of a cyber attack on financial infrastructures that resulted in a loss of data integrity and broader knock on effects the exercise revealed that there were weaknesses at the european level which are now being followed up on through the euro cyber resilience board for pan european financial infrastructures ecrb which is a key element of the third pillar of the eurosystem s cyber strategy a strategic industry regulator dialogue like the cpmi s ceo roundtable the ecrb was established last year to facilitate a strategic cyber dialogue between pan european fmis and european authorities it is not a classic dialogue between regulators and industry as one member put it we are all victims and we have to address the cyber challenge together based on the results of the first round of our cyber survey and on the unitas exercise the ecrb is focusing on five key areas i information sharing ii european crisis management iii training and awareness iv ecosystem recovery and coordinated reconciliation and v third party risk the work on information sharing can feed directly into the global discussion held at cpmi iosco level the ecrb has established a working group with the market to design the building blocks for effective information sharing which we will operationalise by the end of 2019 on pan european crisis management a working group will determine what is considered to be a crisis the key stakeholders that should be involved in crisis situations and when such crisis management arrangements should be triggered the ambition is to have a range of playbook scenarios that will be regularly tested at a collective level on training and awareness the ecrb will also host an industry workshop in the second half of 2019 exchanging best practices to raise general cyber awareness among staff at all levels in order to change their behaviour in the light of the actual and perceived cyber threats finally also in the second half of 2019 the ecrb will echo similar initiatives at the cpmi iosco level and turn its attention to ecosystem recovery and coordinated reconciliation and third party risk in other words it will focus on how to respond to a major cyber incident or prevent an incident stemming from our ever expanding supply chain this work is now led by my colleague sabine lautenschläger who has taken over the responsibility for payments and market infrastructure oversight in the ecb executive board conclusion much progress has been made in recent years in strengthening cyber resilience thanks in large part to the smooth interplay between global standard setting bodies regional authorities and industry stakeholders but because the nature of the threat landscape is changing constantly the risk of a major cyber incident remains real and is in all likelihood rising failure to adequately protect against cyber attacks may dent confidence in the stability of the financial system and have more far reaching repercussions on the broader economy to avert these risks and to stay ahead of those trying to damage our financial system we need to leverage the tools and best practices that already exist and strengthen multilateral cooperation to promote innovative ideas practical solutions and experience sharing in doing so we need to find solutions to the issues related to privacy data protection and reputational concerns so we can keep our financial system safe thank you

bloomberg opinion think about extravagant campaign promises and the words policy review don t exactly leap to mind and yet in the steady as she goes world of central bankers olli rehn s call for a comprehensive rethink of the european central bank s objectives has galvanized the race to succeed mario draghi the ecb president steps down at the end of october and rehn governor of the bank of finland is a contender to replace him the list also includes jens weidmann president of germany s bundesbank and the banque de france s francois villeroy de galhau who s just become favorite according to a bloomberg poll of economists rehn hasn t confirmed that he s running for the job but his call for a policy review including a possible rethink of the ecb s target of having inflation below but close to 2 has a distinct whiff of the electoral hustings the finn knows plenty about politics he has been a lawmaker and finance minister at home and a two time european commissioner including during the euro zone debt crisis when he was in charge of economic and monetary affairs putting campaigning to one side asking whether the ecb should revamp its targets and operations is an interesting question albeit a tricky one it will certainly be raised when political leaders meet to discuss draghi s replacement peter praet the ecb s departing chief economist warned this week that the bank s officials shouldn t launch a review lightly when you announce it in public it can be misread he said at a financial times event in frankfurt investors might try to second guess what result the ecb has in mind such thinking goes and that would impact the currency and bond markets nevertheless this might indeed be the moment for the euro zone s central bank to reexamine its objectives for a start it s 20 years since the launch of the single currency and 16 years since the ecb last updated its strategy long enough to consider a fresh approach the u s federal reserve has just embarked on a similar exercise which will report back in the first half of 2020 the fed is still the most important central bank in the world so it makes sense for the ecb to make a move after its sees what the americans choose to do unlike the ecb whose mandate is primarily to maintain price stability the fed has dual objectives that also include the delivery of maximum employment these are set by the u s congress and as such are excluded from the review but the fed may decide there are better ways to meet its 2 inflation target including changing the way it communicates its thinking regardless of what the fed does a policy change might help the ecb to answer those critics who say it has run out of weapons to fight the next recession these fears are largely misplaced the biggest risk is that the bank s next president is unwilling to use the available tools but in the past five years the ecb has often undershot its slightly less than 2 inflation target despite releasing a deluge of cheap money it makes sense to look for a more effective way to promote growth indeed there s a straightforward change that the ecb should start with setting the inflation target at a hard 2 so that there s no deflationary bias in it this change would bring the bank closer to other major monetary institutions including the fed and the bank of england and remove a degree of arbitrariness from the actions of the next president the current below but close to 2 formulation can mean anything from 1 6 to 1 9 implying different paths for monetary policy a firm 2 target would also show that the ecb cares more than it has done so far about periods of slow price growth even such a minor looking tweak would be hard to shepherd in politically and could incense the inflation hawks at germany s bundesbank and elsewhere the change might not be enough by itself to boost inflation and growth after all saying you re aiming for 2 doesn t mean you ll get there but if the ecb is to conduct a policy review this would be a useful shift in direction whomever succeeds draghi whether that s rehn or someone else would be wise to consider it

press release which has been furnished to the sec on form 8 k today with that i will turn the call over to our president and chief executive officer andrew littlefair andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer thank you bob good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us i m pleased to report that the company s operating and financial performance continued to improve through the first quarter of this year with a 12 increase in volume 7 5 growth in revenue and improvement in operating and net income when excluding the alternative fuel tax credit from last year and the non cash adjustments from 2019 also importantly the initiatives that we began over a year ago to strengthen our balance sheet continue to pay off as we ended the quarter again with cash and investments exceeding debt our volume grew over 10 million gallons quarter over quarter as we delivered a total of 95 2 million gallons with our redeem renewable natural gas making up over half of that volume increase our core business of refuse and transit saw growth as did our subsidiary ng advantage and we re optimistic that the heavy duty trucking market will contribute to that growth later this year through our zero now financing program i know there s been a lot of interest in this program i m pleased to report that we ve begun to sign up fleets that are taking advantage of the offer to lease or purchase heavy duty trucks these trucks are equipped with the latest natural gas engine technology for the same price as a diesel truck and operate it with a fuel that is renewable and significantly cleaner but comes at a lower cost as i explained on our last call unlike what you hear from others we re engaged with fleets that are ready to take delivery of trucks which is different than simply putting down a deposit for a concept truck that won t be ready for delivery for years through our zero now program we have agreements with multiple firms which are leasing or purchasing new trucks equipped with the cummins westport 12 liter ultra low nox engine and will be fueling at our existing network of stations with redeem renewable natural gas these companies include tradelink transport and supra national express which operate in the ports of los angeles and long beach where the latest clean air plan continues to be implemented orders for new trucks were also placed through the zero now program by the largest bulk carrier kenan advantage group freight line express will be taking delivery of new trucks in northern california and after testing beta versions of the new cwi engine ttsi has placed an order for an additional 40 trucks to operate in southern california in addition to these companies we re in advanced negotiations with several dozen other fleets which represent the potential of orders for hundreds of new natural gas trucks the media limelight is currently placed on other alternatives like electric and fuel cells including at the recent act expo but i d like to quote one savvy analyst who has paid very close attention to this industry for many years in his report after visiting the floor of the expo he wrote quote natural gas is the clear cut leader in the clubhouse and what other technologies aspire to be end quote the trucking companies we have been speaking to are under pressure to meet lower emissions targets today while maintaining the performance of diesel and the only solution available is natural gas trucks they have seen the stories about recent roll outs of electric buses by a few transit agencies that have encountered serious operational issues like the lack of battery range charging times and ability to climb hills albuquerque transit agency s experience was such a disaster it sent back all the electric buses to the manufacturer scrapped the program and are in the process of ordering new natural gas buses transit agencies can easily experiment with electric buses because the federal government foots the bill for the almost the entire cost but trucking fleets don t have the luxury of the government covering such costly experiments so while others are grabbing easy headlines with big promises of the fuel of the future with very few details we are signing on trucking firms to a solution that tackles air quality and long term greenhouse gas issues today while giving them the performance they expect at a cost that is less than diesel as i mentioned earlier our core business continues to grow at a nice pace during the first quarter of this year we signed agreements with a number of transit agencies including bc transit serving the vancouver canada area which will be introducing 60 new cng buses that are expected to consume 720 000 gallons of fuel a year we have built and maintained three stations for bc transit the city of fresno renewed a contract for the delivery of an anticipated 6 million gallons of redeem to fuel 118 buses the city of santa clarita signed for an estimated 1 9 million annual gallons for 126 buses the port of seattle signed a contract that includes an estimated 400 000 gallons of cng for airport shuttle buses lax airport contracted for redeem to power 31 shuttle buses sun metro in el paso is adding 40 cng buses that we will fuel the los angeles metro signed with us to provide an expected 4 8 million gallons of redeem to power 41 new municipal buses over their life and the county of sacramento contracted for redeem to operate a fleet of school buses and airport vehicles and finally the county of orange public works department signed a five year fuel deal for an estimated 750 000 gallons of rng on the refuse side we signed agreements for fuel and services in the first quarter with livermore sanitation in california city of tacoma washington alameda county california usa hauling recycling in waterbury connecticut the city of philadelphia burrtec waste industries the city of redlands california and the city of sacramento california all in all the first quarter of 2019 was very productive and reinforces our optimism about the future of clean energy and natural gas fueling our financial performance and balance sheet continues to improve the acceptance of redeem is accelerating with existing customers switching from conventional natural gas and new customers are signing up for a renewable fuel that far exceeds climate change goals versus other alternatives our core business continues to grow and the heavy duty trucking market which has been a tough nut to crack in the past has begun to show signs of real progress looming stricter emission standards higher diesel prices and now a way ph for heavy duty truck fleets to get into a new natural gas fleet for the same price is catching a lot of notice from fleets that were previously reluctant and with that i will hand the call over to bob robert vreeland chief financial officer thank you andrew our financial results for the first quarter of 2019 were in line with our expectations and we maintain our financial outlook for the full year 2019 which we provided during our year end 2018 earnings call our volume growth in the first quarter of 12 above last year came from cng and lng both benefiting from incremental redeem gallons related to our expanded bp relationship cng volume also increased as a result of growth at ng advantage and from our refuse and transit sectors lng also increased due to greater bulk fuel deliveries compared to a year ago redeem volume grew 87 in the first quarter to 34 6 million gallons versus 18 5 million gallons a year ago our revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was 77 7 million which included a 5 million non cash loss on our zero now fuel hedge last year first quarter revenue of 102 4 million included 25 5 million in alternative fuel tax credits related to the calendar year 2017 the alternative fuel tax credits expired at the end of 2017 excluding the non cash zero now fuel hedge loss in 2019 and the alternative fuel tax credit revenue in 2018 total revenue increased 7 5 which reflects greater volumes at higher effective prices per gallon driven by rin and lcfs prices as well as retail pump prices our overall gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2019 was 18 9 million which was reduced by 5 million from the non cash zero now fuel hedge loss gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 47 6 million which was increased by the 25 5 million in alternative fuel tax credits exclusive of the 5 million reduction from zero now fuel hedge loss and the 25 million increase 25 5 million increase from the alternative fuel tax credit our 2019 gross profit margin increased by 1 7 million or 8 from a year ago due to increased volumes offset partially by a decline in station project margins our effective margin per gallon was 0 26 per gallon for the first quarter of 2019 consistent with a year ago and within our guidance range of 0 24 to 0 28 per gallon the first quarter of 2019 benefited primarily from higher redeem renewable natural gas sales and the related rin and lcfs credit revenue compared to 2018 our sg a in the first quarter of 2019 was 18 4 million versus 18 9 million a year ago looking forward we see some increases in quarterly sg a spending but for the year we still anticipate being within our expected range of 73 million to 79 million we also recognized a 2 7 million gain related to the sale of station assets this was part of an eminent domain process to accommodate improvements being made near one of our airport stations our gaap net loss for the first quarter of 2019 was 10 9 million compared to gaap net income of 12 2 million a year ago although last year included the favorable impact of 25 5 million in alternative fuel tax credit income while 2019 was negatively impacted by non cash losses of 6 6 million related to the zero now fuel hedge plus the change in fair value of stock warrants of ng advantage we saw the benefits of our lower debt balances in 2019 with interest expense declining by 2 6 million for the quarter compared to a year ago going from 4 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 to 1 9 million in the first quarter of 2019 our adjusted net loss for the first quarter of 2019 was 2 7 million compared to adjusted net income of 15 6 million in 2018 and our adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2019 was 11 2 million compared to 32 4 million in 2018 noting again that 2018 included 25 5 million in alternative fuel tax credit income we ended the first quarter of 2019 with 94 million in cash and investments which was essentially the same amount of cash and investments we had at the beginning of the quarter cash used in operations in the first quarter of 2019 of 8 2 million was offset with 5 1 million in cash received from our second year of a five year earn out from bp and 4 4 million in proceeds received from the station asset sale noted previously in addition ng advantage received 3 4 million in proceeds from equipment financing which we view as an offset against purchases of property and equipment our convertible debt due in june 2020 is unchanged at 50 million and our equipment and facility financing debt principally held at ng advantage is at 36 million as we see growth in our zero now truck program and expansions at ng advantage to support increased gas flow capabilities we ll likely see an increase in our debt balances during 2019 keeping in mind this debt will be directly attributed to contracted volume growth and with that operator we ll now open the call to questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions the first question is from eric stine craig hallum please go ahead sir aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst hi good afternoon it s aaron spychalla on for eric thanks for taking the questions andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer hi aaron robert vreeland chief financial officer hi aaron aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst maybe first on the zero now pipeline good to see and hear some of the recent traction there can you just maybe give a little bit more color on maybe what some of the gating factors that you re looking for before some of those fleets move forward with some of the larger purchases and then maybe just talk a little bit about your outlook to get to that we ve kind of been thinking that as around maybe a 2 500 truck program to start and maybe the potential to grow beyond that andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer right aaron i m still the we came up with that 2 500 number because that was just doing math of about 40 000 per truck and our friends at total had helped us with a debt for about 100 million but i still think it s a good number and it s one that we re shooting for we ve been at it here for a while started in late summer last year it took us a while what the gating factors are it took us a while to basically reeducate fleets kind of if you think with me on that what happened was you have to go back a couple of years to the collapse oil price with really the previous heavy duty engines some of which were the early earlier engines and some of the experience was we had some of the early adopter problems with some of those engines this of course is now is a new day with the new 12 liter low nox engine and of course today we have the renewable natural gas and so when we came out with the zero now financing we needed to go back and really educate fleets about the current state of play the current engine technology what was different this time we had to explain the zero now financing and why they could now move into a natural gas truck at essentially the same price as diesel explain the hedge which is very attractive as we ve discussed before on this call we re able to lock our customers into a fuel deal at a depending on where they operate as much as dollar a gallon fixed to the eia index for the length of that lease in many cases four to five years it s very attractive this though takes a while and before we can end up signing the deals we take it takes several steps and then they have to order the trucks right and sign a fuel contract with us which is new and so i d like to say there really aren t any showstoppers here it s really one of education and it s one that we ve continued to do we ve continued to increase the pipeline so i m feeling good about that i monitor it regularly with our vice president of sales and the pipeline continues to grow that is the numbers of fleets that are entertaining purchases of trucks but then we have to move through the process so that release a couple days ago got you to kind of where we are today and what i mentioned today is we ve got more that we re in the negotiation process with negotiation and contracting phase today so i m feeling pretty good about the way that s going but it s but this is buying a real truck for 125 000 committing to five years worth of fuel even though it s at a discount this isn t putting down an order this is or a reservation this is buying stuff and so in many cases when we re talking 20 or 30 trucks you re into millions and millions of dollars so these guys take it seriously they are faced with a higher diesel price today and i note that today diesel in the port of la is 4 09 so we have a very competitive price so i hope that maybe helps we still i think that 25 number 2 500 truck number is a good number though it ll take us the entire year to get to that number and of course you won t see all those volumes this year but you ll begin to see it in the next year aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst right understood yeah thanks thanks for the color there maybe second can you just give an update on some of the programs down there in california whether it s at the ports or with the sip or in the south coast maybe kind of what you re looking for there kind of near term as far as any kind of funding dollars or truck deployments that would be great andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer well there s a lot of pieces to all that but those for those on the call that maybe aren t quite as familiar as you are aaron there s of course there s a thing called the state implementation program a lot of states have this that are not in compliance certainly the southern california still has the dirtiest air quality in the nation we have a plan that we have to get into compliance i think it s by 2023 and we re way short the inventory of emissions and what we would need to do to get in compliance to theoretically continue our federal funding and all that kind of thing is we ve got a lot of work to do in fact at its highest level i think that the plan would say that you ve got to get 70 000 heavy duty trucks to like a zero like a low nox truck and 150 000 medium duty trucks now i don t see any rules or funding or anything in place right now that gets you there but that just tells me that there are going to be other emissions requirements and other and continued grant funding because 70 of the problem that we have in southern california is nox and that s coming from these heavy duty vehicles all right so now then if you look at the clean air action plan which governs the it s been adopted by the port of los angeles and jointly by the port of long beach those two ports sit side by side there they adopted a plan that had stuff on ships and yard hustling equipment and also of course trucks and this was kind of phase 2 of the plan because 10 years ago they cleaned up some of the diesel trucks and introduced natural gas trucks that still is in place that plan essentially says that by 2020 the business as we see it today is not the way it could go that in order to comply in 2020 you re going to have to either buy a natural near zero natural gas truck or an electric truck and if you continue you can continue to operate a diesel truck but they are now working on what the fee will be associated to operate that diesel truck they re doing some economic analysis to see how high that fee needs to be and what make sure they don t destabilize the competitiveness of the port i think that s all kind of rocking along there s a lot of tension there between people that don t want to do things and people that would rather slow this down i m betting that it s going to continue to be in place we see a lot of grants from the state of california and even locally to assist in this transition i think there s close to 400 trucks that have already been granted money that could participate and will participate in this program a lot of those contracts are in the process in the next month now so i m guessing by the latter part of this year we could see a couple of hundred to 300 350 natural gas trucks in the port these will be early adopters as the rules won t have gone into effect but i think it ll be a very nice by the end of the year if i m right you ll have 300 there s about 50 down there right now so you ll have close to 400 trucks operating showing what s viable today and why it works and these trucks will be saving money versus the prospect of maybe waiting another five years for an electric truck so i think all of that s going to happen in the future in the port of la is if the fee goes in as we expect that there s probably somewhere north of 10 000 trucks over the next couple or three years that will have to be retired we saw the fee last time around switched the fleet pretty quickly because the walmarts of the world don t want to pay a fee they want to hire somebody that s in compliance so we re very optimistic we have as you know the fueling down on the port we have the product today we have some grants in place so i think you re going to see this as the beachhead for a lot of movement on the and we also run kind of a modified zero now program for the port too aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst understood andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer that was a lot i hope that answered your question aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst no no that s really the color we ve been kind of hearing some of the same stuff there so thanks for the detail and then maybe last just kind of on the model a little bit on the station construction line can you just talk about how you think that trends the rest of the year and kind of the outlook the mix there between new stations and upgrades robert vreeland chief financial officer yeah it generally trends up as we move through the year we were we kind of guided to the 25 million 30 million range and we still believe we ll get inside that range it s just it gets it can be a little lumpy but generally speaking the activity picks up as we move through the year andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer i know aaron right now there s about i was talking to our people ph in charge of this earlier this morning you have about 22 stations that are currently in process and there will be more i think there were two more added just in the last day or two our fellows were at the waste the big waste convention and usually they come back with some of those so it seems to me that the station construction line is a little lighter than we ve seen it before and i think we ve kind of guided to that it s still robust but it s not as high as we ve seen maybe a couple of years ago i imagine when you shake it all out it ll be somewhere and i m not talking about millions i m talking about projects now it ll be in the 30 we ll have 30 projects or so under way here by the in the third quarter fourth quarter aaron spychalla craig hallum capital group llc analyst all right thanks for taking the questions and congrats on another good quarter of volume growth andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer thank you robert vreeland chief financial officer thanks operator the next question is from rob brown lake street capital markets please go ahead sir rob brown lake street partners llc analyst good afternoon robert vreeland chief financial officer hey rob andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer hi rob rob brown lake street partners llc analyst i just want to touch on redeem and the that market how is the volume supply in that market are you seeing any constraints there as you grow or do you feel like you ve got the capacity or contracts in place to fulfill the demand andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer i think we re in general balanced right now we re seeing volume more supply coming into the market which is a good thing because we re getting more customers to come to the party if you kind of look back over the last couple of years one point we re a little short on supply and then there s been more supply coming to the market we work with our friends at bp for instance and we re constantly looking at showing them the our demand forecast and they re constantly looking at more supply the market is responding in terms of supply and we re doing our part on the demand side of the equation we have a lot of customers in areas of the country where we re not using rng yet so we can use more supply and the good news is that supply is coming i think we re going to be in general supply balanced for the for this year and then a bunch of more supply shows up which will be timely because we re going to need it rob brown lake street partners llc analyst okay great and then in terms of cost structure you ve done a good job of taking it down do you feel like you re at a level here that s that where you want to be or do you see it where do you see it going andrew j littlefair president and chief executive officer well i think what bob gets worried when you start doing the modeling i think this is generally this level of sga is about right it s down a little bit this quarter it may pop up just a little bit but it s in this range this just feels comfortable for us we re growing we re building more stations we re put more customers in the program and yet we ve been able to kind of hold the line we re trying to do some things though on the marketing side which will add some a little bit of cost that you ll see probably here this next quarter as we promote with shippers and others on the zero now program but i d say this is generally about the right about we ve got it about just as high as can get it on the sga line and i think that s a pretty good number don t you bob robert vreeland chief financial officer yeah i think it s we re good right now and we constantly kind of look at that and what we think we need to do to support the business and grow the business so that s why i commented we may not see as low a quarter as we go forward a little bit because we still have work to do on promoting zero now and other programs it takes a lot of effort to be out there promoting what we do rob brown lake street partners llc analyst great thank you i ll turn it over operator there are no further questions at this time i d like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks

in welcoming ronnie and congratulating him on his recent promotion moving on to our results this morning we announced our 33rd consecutive quarter of year over year revenue growth despite continued challenges with what is becoming a recurring negative weather pattern while the weather has a significant influence on our results i think there is more that we can do to improve our performance with our decision to moderate the pace of acquisitions in light of our leverage it has given us the opportunity to redirect our efforts and focus on process improvements and integration rationalization which will further improve our results these process improvement initiatives will help us leverage technology to fortify the strength of our market positions and improve our operating margins allowing us to be more agile in our operating response to short term pressures while positioning us to capitalize on the robust demand in all of our regions when we reported our year end 2018 results a few months ago we stated that our outlook and the overall fundamentals of the business were much stronger than some observers would have led you to believe although the financial markets particularly in our space have improved over the past several months we continue to believe the current market valuation of our business does not support the fundamental strength of our market position in each of our core markets nor our current position in the cycle there remains a solid runway of demand in all of our regions supported by an 8 1 million cubic yard backlog positive trends in the overall construction market historically low unemployment continued low interest rates and strong consumer sentiment we expect these fundamentals to remain in place throughout the remainder remainder of the year and into 2020 for the quarter we reported total revenue of 333 million up 1 6 over prior year with adjusted ebitda of 34 5 million during the first quarter of 2019 ready mix volumes of 2 1 million yards were down about 1 over the prior year quarter while our aggregate volumes of 2 5 million tons were up 17 over the prior year quarter despite the increment weather in the first quarter especially in california our adjusted gross profit was up 5 over the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margins expanded by 60 basis points a significant driver of the positive momentum in operating profit was the growth in our higher margin aggregate segment on the of the 2 5 million tons of aggregates sold during the quarter we generated adjusted ebitda of over 10 million for the segment more than double the prior year quarter and a record for aggregates in the first quarter polaris led the aggregate segment improvement with year over year increases in volume and adjusted ebitda of 25 and 106 respectively our u s virgin islands operations also showed meaningful improvement as the islands continue to recover from the 2017 hurricanes needless to say we remain extremely bullish on our continued growth in this segment and remain on track with our plans in polaris turning to our ready mix concrete results it was a challenging quarter for already mixed regions particularly in northern california where the weather related headwinds once again took their toll however despite the headwinds our volumes were relatively flat for the quarter while our overall average selling price increased 2 from 136 99 in the prior year quarter to 139 60 in the current quarter gross profit margins in the ready mix segment contracted for the quarter largely as a result of the inefficiencies caused by weather and time plant relocation expenses in new york overall our ongoing focus will be on our strategic initiatives our processes and our utilization of technology to more effectively manage and respond to the ever changing impacts of the weather labor and raw material inflation may have on our margins these initiatives have the attention of every manager in our organization and we are optimistic and excited about the potential they will have on increasing our profit and driving transformational change within our organization now i ll turn the call over to ronnie to discuss our regional operations ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer thank you bill i appreciate the kind introduction earlier and look forward to continuing to work with you to improve value for our shareholders in order to more effectively drive our strategic initiatives within the organization i recently reorganize our operations management team these changes will allow us to more effectively evaluate manage and drive our strategic initiatives within each region beyond organizational changes we ve been actively developing and implementing our proprietary software where is my concrete which will help manage multiple processes within our concrete business including customer and project level management truck tracking billing and overall data analytics the successful development and rollout of where is my concrete will allow customers to gain transparency around their deliveries and projects and will help improve our collective decision making throughout the entire manufacturing and delivery process as part of where s my concrete we have developed a proprietary customer relationship management tool that is focused on our needs as a concrete producer as well as those of our customers it is designed to enhance the customer experience and bring significant value to them by providing them with real time information as well as utilizing defined processes and key metrics internally to drive targeted margins on future work being quoted in all markets as we slowed the pace of acquisition activity we experienced over the last six years we are taking the opportunity to evaluate every aspect of our business and develop operational financial and technical initiatives within each region and segment of our business that will change the way we operate these initiatives will improve our operating leverage our customer service our business processes and most importantly improve our ability to operate more efficiently in our seasonal industry i would now like to take you through our regions and highlight some of the key areas that are driving our results our west region which consists of northern california ready mix operations as well as our polaris aggregates represented approximately 26 of our revenues this quarter demand remained strong in northern california markets across all sectors sb1 infrastructure projects continue to enhance the demand of our ready mix concrete and aggregate products as more new projects have begun we are seeing major construction projects in san jose the heart of our local operations san jose state recently broke ground on a 160 000 square foot science building and the city of san jose broke ground on 135 units affordable housing project additionally in the bay area our backlog includes google mountain view project inaudible linkedin south bay sfo terminal 1 and adobe north tower office building the performance of polaris continues to exceed expectations and determines the pace at which the business had ramped up volume and revenue for the first quarter were up 25 and 24 respectively and adjusted ebitda more than doubled from the prior year s first quarter we we re on track to hit our projections for polaris supported by the demand coming from northern california southern california and hawaii and also continue to entertain inquiries from china korea and more recently another pacific rim country we are pursuing increased permitting for our ship terminal and anticipate finalizing in the upcoming quarter the new permit will allow us to ship over 9 million tons of our current load out facility on vancouver island we also continuing to plans to develop the black bear quarry which will further increase our overall production capacity we remain confident with our projection to ship over 6 million tons of aggregates in the current year and continue to see further upside in this business our central region which includes all of our texas oklahoma and usvi represented 39 of our revenue this quarter dallas fort worth our largest market in this region continues to see significant population growth with a steady stream of corporate relocations to the area like toyota j p morgan chase and most recently allstate insurance recent estimates show that dfw led the nation in new residents from 2017 to 2018 with more than 30 000 homes constructed last year making dfw the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country and ranked by realtor com as the place with the most new home construction in the nation this will certainly affect commercial residential and infrastructure construction in the metroplex with nearly 2 000 dot projects planned and under way we continue to remain very confident with demand in this market the west texas ready mix markets also continue to be a significant contributor to our results supported by strong demand performance across all sectors commercial and residential construction is showing increased demand and adding to a healthy backlog infrastructure is also very active with major projects planned for the rest of the year the abilene school district anticipates spending 250 million on infrastructure through their fiscal year the permian basin rig count remains at elevated levels and our portable division has multiple project pipeline throughout the remainder of the year with further enhanced vertical integration from our recent acquisitions in the region we are growing stronger operationally and look forward to seeing this market thrive on the aggregate front in texas we successfully broke ground on our greenfield sand and gravel operation operation mw ranch located south of metroplex we anticipate being fully on line with the state of the art production facility in mid to late summer of 2019 we also will be enhancing our recently acquired sand and gravel operation operations in amarillo texas which will add needed capacity as well as lowering production costs in the east region which includes new york new jersey philadelphia and dc virginia represented 35 of our revenue this quarter new york governor andrew cuomo continued his support of local infrastructure spending by signing the 175 billion state budget that adds funds to the metropolitan transportation authority this represents another effort by the states to address their infrastructure investment needs another major win for infrastructure funding in the region came from american airlines and british airways who committed 344 million to expand the john f kennedy airport as part of a planned 13 billion redevelopment at jfk this relieves the port authority of new york and new jersey from having to fund the expansion and allows them to address other infrastructure needs in the region the real deal a publication focused on real estate news ran an article on the 10 largest towers under way in new york city and of the 10 listed u s concrete participated in eight of the 10 depicting a very strong franchise for the high profile private sector work in washington d c and northern virginia demand remained strong across all sectors with commercial residential and infrastructure projects all actively represented amazon hq2 is advancing as expected with the recent signing of the initial agreement by two major development sites with over 4 million square feet in the crystal city area as you can imagine this incredible addition to metro dc creates the need for appropriate infrastructure to support the 25 000 jobs that will be coming with hq2 earlier this year virginia approved 195 in funding for infrastructure projects with specific improvements plan to support the needs of hq2 in northern virginia loudoun county labeled the world s data center hub residents and the construction are equally benefiting from the data center boom which is driving economic growth the reduction in real estate tax rates and raises for county employees each of our markets present their own positive outlook for continued building and growth reaffirming our bullish outlook for our construction markets now i d like to turn the call over to john to discuss our financial results john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks ronnie as bill mentioned we generated year over year quarterly revenue growth for the 33rd consecutive quarter with total revenue of 333 million for the first quarter of 2019 adjusted ebitda of 34 5 million was down slightly from the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to weather related headwinds in our northern california market where the weather was most impactful during the quarter our adjusted ebitda was down 5 7 million from the prior year quarter in addition we incurred 850 000 of onetime costs associated with the relocation of two ready mix plants in brooklyn a new location that will be more cost effective and operationally efficient our adjustments for the quarter relate primarily to stock compensation acquisition related costs and the loss of trucks damaged in the fire for our ready mix business our material spread margin was 48 6 for the quarter and our material spread on dollar per cubic yard basis was 66 94 sg a was 9 6 of revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 9 8 in the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda excluding stock compensation and acquisition related costs was 9 1 of revenue in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 8 4 in the prior year quarter primarily reflecting the impact of increased marketing expenses severance and certain personnel related costs adjusted gross profit margin increased 60 basis points in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year quarter as our high margin aggregates business continues to become a larger part of our consolidated results in 2019 we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 27 for the full year and our interest expense is expected to be in the 45 million to 47 million range as of march 31st our total debt including current maturities was 709 million this included 608 million of senior unsecured notes due 2024 70 million outstanding on a revolving credit facility and approximately 93 million of other debt consisting mainly of equipment financing for new mixer trucks and mobile equipment net of 9 million in debt issuance cost in addition due to the implementation of a new lease accounting standard effective january 1st 2019 we reported 76 3 million in operating lease liabilities as of march 31st which are now on our balance sheet in accordance with the new terms of the accounting standard the implementation of the new standard had no impact on our first quarter cash flows as of march 31st we had total liquidity of 225 million including 24 million of cash and cash equivalents and 201 million of availability under our revolving credit facility at march 31st 2019 our net debt to adjusted ebitda was 3 6 times we remain focused on reducing our leverage in the coming quarters as we focus on managing our costs and using our excess cash to pay down debt we continue to have solid liquidity position and no near term maturities associated with our senior notes or abl facility moving onto our cash flow and balance sheet during the first quarter of 2019 we generated 21 9 million of cash provided by our operating activities as compared to the 25 9 million in the prior year quarter we generated 15 1 million of adjusted free cash flow compared to 19 5 million in the prior year quarter we will continue to focus on managing working capital and capital expenditures in the coming quarters to generate increased cash flow however i would like to remind you that in 2019 we expect to make approximately 17 million in contingent consideration payments associated with past acquisitions and an additional 23 million will be used for the expansion of reserve at one of our sand and gravel operation that is contingent on various permit approvals during the first quarter of 2019 we spent approximately 7 2 million on capital expenditures primarily related to our plants and machinery equipment to support the continued demands in our markets compared to approximately 8 4 million for the same period last year for the full year of 2019 we anticipate our capital expenditures to be in the range of 60 million to 70 million including equipment acquired through capital leases but excluding capital for the development of the texas aggregates quarry additionally we are still on track to receive reimbursement from the government in the second quarter for eminent domain costs associated with the relocation of our washington d c operations our cash flow from operating activity is expected to be in the range of 50 to 60 of adjusted ebitda we continue to see a robust demand environment as we head into the peak season of 2019 and anticipate continued solid cash flow generation along with sufficient liquidity to support our ongoing operational needs i ll now turn the call back over to bill william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer thank you john turning to our outlook for 2019 although our first quarter fell short of our expectations due to abnormally wet weather in california and some unforeseen onetime costs we are confident in the strong fundamentals solid backlog and overall demand environment in all of our regions as such we reaffirm our guidance for 2019 with total revenue of approximately 1 6 billion and adjusted ebitda in the range of 205 million to 225 million with a midpoint of 215 million we remain bullish on 2019 and are optimistic about the benefits we expect to see from our operational initiatives in a vibrant economy we believe our extremely talented employees equipped with high quality assets operating in well structured markets possessing close customer relationships all align to drive significant positive improvement in our operating model and performance metrics will result in increased shareholder value thank you for your u s for your interest in u s concrete we would now like to turn the call back over to the operator for the question and answer session questions and answers operator operator instructions your first response is from trey grooms of stephens trey grooms stephens inc analyst hey good morning everybody it s trey grooms william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer hey trey good morning ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer hey trey trey grooms stephens inc analyst so just kind of taking a step back on and looking at the margins here clearly kind of a tough quarter with from a weather standpoint and i understand that impacted but you had some other things going on but as we kind of look at input cost inflation and then also kind of the ready mix price outlook that you guys have in any other factor that are kind of moving around how should we be thinking about the material spread and margins on the ready mix business as we look through the rest of the year ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer hey trey this is ronnie thanks for the question i would say first let s start off with comparing to the producer price index for ready mix concrete across the entire country the producer price index was down 1 year over year our ready mix pricing was up 2 and so i think we re being able to pass along material cost i think where you re seeing and what we re noticing is why we have our operational initiatives are our ability to control the variable side and it is difficult with the weather that we did experience it is difficult with the driver situation that we face across the entire country with the guarantee pays that we have for our drivers and all those things that we talked about in the past but with these initiatives we are putting in place i mean we are going to really focus on three key areas so the first area will be labor one of our biggest input cost is labor and labor just doesn t impact these drivers it s labor cost for drivers mechanics back office employees and overall process side of it the other one is raw materials our ability to not only negotiate and maintain the spread that we get with our buying power which we continue to have but it s also the use of those raw materials and mix optimization and making sure that we are following the prescribed mixes and then the last one is on the commercial side is really pricing improvement and some of that just leadership in our markets and what we need to be doing blocking and tackling with the commercial side and the other is the improvement with our customers relationships management tool that we are currently in development of and that tool will give us a lot more insight into not only the things we are doing internally from an operational standpoint but also our customer behavior and trying to capture more value around how customers not only treat our equipment but the ordering behaviors their placement behaviors and all the things that influence our pricing so i think overall we re trying to get more control and appreciate your question trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right thanks for that ronnie and that kind of leads into my next one on the development and rollout of where is my concrete that you guys have been working on i guess last several months what s the timing as you kind of looking at the rollout there and what s the opportunity that you see with that ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer so timing wise we are fully online with where is my concrete as the dispatching system for the atlantic region then next one will be california and we will do that over the next three to five months california will be rolled out and then texas would be after california the crm it s separate but it s together but we are going to roll out the crm on a different schedule we rolled it out in d c and it s kind of a test it was a smaller market for us to do and then now we are rolling it fully into the atlantic region and then california would be next and timing wise california would it will probably go a little bit ahead of the dispatching system and then texas would be behind that as far as opportunity goes i mean when i talk about initiatives the initiatives are not around system but the systems are the tools to give us the analytics to measure the impact of our ability to successfully drive these initiatives so it is a tool for us to be better be smarter be more predictive and i really use the words in the ready mixed industry not just u s concrete the overall ready mixed industry were very reactive we react a lot we show up everywhere we react what we need to be is more predictive we need to be able to understand forward looking orders forward looking weather forward looking impacts of labor and that s what the tools going to give us is more predictive analytics around pricing decisions around labor around labor savings around how we schedule i mean all those things that we show up and do on a daily basis today we re just being more reactive and we need to be more predictive so i think that s the greatest opportunity it s going to be more controllable and allow us to capture more margin through those controls trey grooms stephens inc analyst all right thanks it sounds pretty exciting and then i guess the last one from me is just the mentioned 23 million potentially being spent pending i think approval expanding some reserves at one of your texas sand and gravel quarries any more data is that a new quarry or expanding existing any other detail you can give us on that maybe the timing of when you d expect something on the approval john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer so trey the 23 million is in relation to our quarry in new jersey and it s an existing one that it s new reserves that will be added through that one the mw ranch that i referred to in texas is a greenfield operation and we re under construction right now set to be in operation mid of late summer 2019 so those are two separate things the 23 million was only referring to pit reserves at quinton our sand and gravel operation in new jersey trey grooms stephens inc analyst okay thanks for clearing that up sorry i misunderstood well thanks for taking my questions i ll pass it on thanks and good luck john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you your next response is from scott schrier citi please go ahead scott evan schrier citigroup inc analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask a little more broadly speaking on all of these internal initiatives to improve your cost structure can you talk about what we re thinking in terms of cost to implement i know you talked about some of the timing but overall maybe some of the magnitude of the benefits you anticipate and perhaps how that incorporated into your guidance william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer so as far as cost to implement the initiatives it s all internal it s all internal staff we re not bringing in outside consultants to do this we ve got teams put in place in every region we ve got corporate representatives from corporate that are working directly with those teams so it s all internal as far as this systems goes we re developing that all internally our own internal it group is responsible for that so they re working hand in hand which is really what gives us the greatest level of confidence in what we re doing because we re developing this as a ready mixed company this is not something that we re just going and buying some off the wall off the shelf program and trying to make it fit ready mixed is what we ve done in the past and we re in so we re our ability to control that but the implementation cost is really just our internal efforts and it s our day in and day out people it s not we re not hiring new people to do that scott evan schrier citigroup inc analyst got it thanks and then as we think about the your previous answer to the material spread margin and the improvement can you speak to the cadence through the year we might see the improvement in the material spread and just walk us through mechanically is there a lag between the price increases by the aggregate producers and then your ability to put your prices through are those more tying with the cement price increases so if you could just walk me through well how maybe some of those lags might also have impacted the material spread margin and the timing in which we should see it improve john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer and so scott with respect to q1 we re seeing about a 0 60 improvement in our material spread on a 1 for cubic yard basis improvement i would expect to see that continue as we go throughout the year when you re looking on a margin basis we were down 20 basis points in q1 i would expect that to be slightly flattish maybe down but as ronnie mentioned with respect to our initiatives we re going to offset a lot of that material margin and to shift some of that material margin is mix as well so those two should certainly offset it and as you look at our guidance for the remainder of the year versus where we were last year you re going to see improvement in each of the coming quarters over prior year results so you re going to see an overall improvement in our bottom line ebitda margin numbers william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer and scott one other things that i d like to add to that is the fairly flattish material margin spread in first quarter was actually a good outcome when you think of the shift of the mix shift of volume from our highest material spread area california to one of our lower ones or lowest in texas so that mix shift for us to overcome that and stay relatively flat was a good outcome just because of the math trey grooms stephens inc analyst thanks for that bill that s helpful and one more from me on the comments on slowing the acquisition strategy which you ve obviously done over the past several quarters with leverage where it s at are you thinking about is there a level of leverage that you ve got to and then you start to maybe look for more acquisitions or are we sort of slowing down for this cycle and going to focus this free cash flow that you generate on perhaps some of these internal initiative that you spoke about quarry expansions and more organic opportunities instead of going back out into the acquisition market thank you john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer sure scott and that s a good question obviously we are focusing internally now as ronnie had mentioned these are fairly low cost there is very limited incremental costs associated with that with those self help programs as far as slowing down the acquisition pace in our target leverage we ve always wanted to be in the mid two s we re working our way slowly down that way i think we came down from a 3 9 to 3 6 on our leverage this quarter we do look at the cycle but the interesting problem right now or conundrum is that they re still remains a big disconnect between public and private valuations that when ready mixed producers or even private quarry producers are making more ebitda than they have for sure in the last 10 years some more than they ve made in their entire life they don t want to hear that they re value has been significantly diminished as the stock market has diminished our value as well so it s very difficult to meet seller s expectations in the new valuation world so that s one problem of getting good deals out there and we are obviously always aware of where we are in the cycle our leverage relative to that but we re not going to say we re stopping if we find compelling one off deals and we try to find deals that don t attract an option do not attract strategic investors that are accretive and additive to our strong regional positions we will still selectively do small bolt ons that will be very accretive but we are aware of our leverage and where we are in the cycle for sure trey grooms stephens inc analyst great thanks a lot for that bill and good luck gentlemen william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer sure scott thank you operator thank you your next response is from craig bill of cjs securities please go ahead craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst hi guys so could you talk about you have the internal focus on improving margins with greater efficiency it sounded like most of those initiatives are directed toward kind of gross margin how long does this play out and how high is up william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer as far as how long does it take to implement or are you telling me how long they better be everlasting craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst how long does it take to implement and are we talking about like a plus a 100 basis points or plus 50 or john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would say it s probably going to be in a 150 range 150 basis points to 200 basis point range we think there is that amount of opportunity there overall and it ll take more than the next four quarters we re talking 12 of the potentially 24 months would ultimately play out we see a lot of opportunity when all the things that ronnie mentioned out there as far as actions that we can take and just improvements on the things that we have seen in the past year which we think are low hanging fruits that should allow us to achieve these results so it s the initiatives are near term but as ronnie said it s going to be a continuous improvement environment where we re not going to stop we think there is a pretty steep slope going upwards in the coming quarters but we ll continue to push even after that as well william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer and craig i d add to john s comments on some of these initiatives that we re talking about especially with technology being the tool are really transformation and we re talking about changing not only people s behaviors but the way they think in the concrete industry because at the end of the day our process is the way we price the way we deliver all these things are going to be looked at and the amount of data that we have today and then we will be gathering in the future to make it smarter that s good but if we don t make better decisions with it and really is meaningless so that s really where when john talks about the timing of this it s really transformational and so it s not something that you snap your fingers and all of our people wake up overnight and make these decisions because we re really changing the way we look at every aspect of our jobs craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst and do any of your competitors have anything like where is my concrete john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer two other dispatch systems out there we believe where is my concrete gives us a distinct advantage because of it being developed by a concrete and us being able to drive the changes the growth of it the modifications to it and really drilling down into things that drive our business so embedding our own kpis with our own goals within a system that helps us make better decisions we think is key there is other job that they are developing their own portal systems their own customer relationship tools but they re more tied mainly to raw materials and not specifically the concrete so we think we have a very distinct advantage around the technology that we re developing craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst okay so you have a new the greenfield scene in gravel plant and outside of dallas it s going to open this summer at some point that s going to take your percentage of internally sourced sand and gravel from what to what john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer the immediate impact isn t going to be that significant in the current year because we re going to be balancing some of the sand and gravel that we have from other internal sources so our internal consumption is still going to be in that 30 to 40 range over longer term you ll see some improvement of it but i wouldn t say there is going to be that much in 19 craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst okay and then inaudible where he had raised prices for ready mixed in dallas in april is that sticking and are you guys getting acceleration in price in q2 william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer as far as ready mixed pricing craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst yeah john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i would and craig you re familiar with how that works and so i would say we ve got good momentum going with project by project market by market and that s our focus as to where it s ready mixed is so much different then cement and aggregates we don t it s not one price in this date everything happens at once so we re our intentions are every single project every opportunity we re looking at raising prices and that s where we re going to continue to focus on craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst and then rephrase within do you have more momentum in q2 than q1 john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer i think momentum will be there yes craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst okay great and then lastly it wasn t that long ago they were spending a lot of time talking about very tight situation for truck drivers where does that stand now or is it smoothed out john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer it continues that problem or that it s not even a problem now it s just part of our lives i don t foresee that ever going away truck drivers are always going to be in demand and we continue to have strong programs around recruitment strong programs around training strong programs around retention so we re focused on all areas of it i think we re doing an excellent job and our hr group is focused on that we just had a driver symposium two weeks ago just focused on the next generation of drivers and things we can do to attract them and so it s always going to be a focus craig and that problems never going to go away craig martin bibb cjs securities analyst okay great all right thanks a lot william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you your next response is from adam thalhimer of thompson davis please go ahead adam thalhimer thompson davis and company analyst hey good morning guys and ronnie welcome to the call hey i wanted to start with just a decision to maintain the annual guidance can you maybe talk about what you saw in april where would the other trends out there that you re seeing that encourage you to keep the guidance where it was john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean when you look at q1 and the impact that the weather had in northern california we ve already seen that begin to turn in northern california so we would expect a rebound there is some pent up demand that we feel that we ll be able to satisfy in q2 so i look at the sequencing especially of the expectations out there obviously we re going to make some of that up so it ll be a slight upward revision i would expect by some of the analysts to cover it but our guidance of 215 we still very feel very confident in and being able to achieve for the full year so even as i look at the numbers what i said back in february with respect to the guide the initial guidance that we gave q2 be the tightest which is i think what is out there with analyst expectations and then q3 and q4 we would expect to see some meaningful improvement so we re comfortable with the full year guidance we don t see any need to change it the near term look that we have suggest that we should be able to make it up and we didn t see a need to revise or to change the direction at all adam thalhimer thompson davis and company analyst all right that s helpful john and then i wanted to ask about the ready mix pricing which was up nicely year over year sequentially despite weather in california high priced market for you guys how do you expect the price per cubic yard to trend through the year john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer i would say we would continue on that trend i mean we re again in each market with different reasons for it for seeing momentum in all of our markets for pricing and like i said we look at every single project every opportunity and focus on both overall price but also the margins that provides and so it s a mix when it comes to what bill talked about earlier with the success of us being able to overcome the lack of volume in california because of weather and still overcome that with lower priced markets in texas but i would say that momentum is going to continue william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer and adam i would like to add one point to that is you have to understand it that we ve built this company differently than other ready mix producers in the country either private or publicly traded we specifically chose the markets we are in and we specifically chose our acquisition strategy to structure those markets in our best interests not only for pricing but also for raw material purchasing and this is where that strategy will play out in this environment john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would say we re going to be in that low single digit range so that 2 range plus or minus is probably right for each of the coming quarters adam thalhimer thompson davis and company analyst okay perfect thanks operator thank you your next response is from brent thielman of d a davidson please go ahead brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst thanks good morning william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer good morning brent brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst the 11 improvement in aggregate price it sounds like the west texas region with a nice contributor this quarter and i assume that dilutes the absolute asp a bit can you just give us a sense for pricing i guess sort of change by region particularly california and kind of what you are seeing tax rate there john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean california both northern and southern we saw good momentum in pricing and a lot of our consumptions there is internal and we also have external sales in southern california and in hawaii and some other markets we saw the pricing momentum there and most of that stock and texas we do have a lot of aggregate operations in west texas than we have somewhere around the metroplex that are internal consuming aggregate plants but we also sell external customers as well and i think the same thing we saw very good momentum in pricing and so as we look at our internal consumption we go through an exercise of really analyzing the market and seeing what the next best opportunity is and seeing what are the markets are doing and so we believe that those price is stock and the same thing in the north east there is a little bit of lag there because of coming out of the winter and then volumes are ramping up so fast so i think we will see even that momentum in the north east gain even more traction moving forward brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst that s great and then bill i think about your comments just around private expectations and at one point you guys have had talked about interest in building a platform in southern california you have obviously got the terminal and expanding capacity i mean is the lack of not having a ready mix position in that market impacted your ability at all kind of find a helm to the product john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer no not at all in fact that product is in such high demand we we may even relook our plans to vertically integrate there as we sell multiple concrete suppliers at a very nice margin so we are very happy with being a distributor stone into that market or being accelerator stone into that market at this point and with the gaaps and evaluation that s our best strategic decision in the short term brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst got it ok and then the backlog looks i mean roughly light year on year but is it up more materially in one region versus another or stable across the board william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer i would say it s pretty stable across the board i haven t noticed really any meaningful change between the regions you get puts and takes in each region overall but pretty consistent between years john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer and brent to highlight that when you fly into any of these major metropolitan areas specifically in our footprint whether it be la san francisco the dfw new york philadelphia washington dc the amount of tower cranes still in each one of those markets is exceptional and proportional to the size of each of those markets so i don t see any softness in any of our markets brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst great now i hear you there the other question i had just on the dc market i know it s smaller in scale but it sounds like some pretty considerable opportunities coming to hq2 and all that could that become a more meaningful piece of the pie or is it simply sort of constrained by just the size of operation out there ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer i mean it s a very meaningful piece of the pie and strategically we re looking at many opportunities in that region and evaluating as bill said with the difference between the multiples between private and doesn t make sense to buy does it make sense in greenfield but we will be that is a very important market to us it does have a lot of opportunities and it s similar to other markets where the growth is just continue to expand outward from the center and so we re going to have to capture that with opportunities that we will be looking at or we are currently looking at now for either greenfield or acquisition yes brent thielman d a davidson and company analyst okay ronnie thanks all appreciate it ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer you re welcome brent operator thank you your next response is from stanley elliot of stifel please go ahead stanley elliott stifel nicolaus and company analyst good morning guys thank you for taking the question and ronnie welcome to the call on the new system we re talking about transformational i mean and then there s some discussion around better in terms of pricing is pricing going to move to more central location or kind of help us frame that out if you will ronnie pruitt president and chief operating officer yes so i would say the central location would be more system driven and instead of i m not envisioning a central spot that prices everything for the country but it s more of the ability for us through our own crm to control not only the expectations and the targets we want for not just margins but all the way through and controlling our delivery costs and looking at fuel increases and predicting fuel and predicting labor and all those things and just being smarter in the way that we can set targets in each region independently of each other because each region has its own drivers but our ability to control that so that when cells people and professionals that we have or quoting work that they really have a very good insight on not what s just today but what s coming over the next six months i mean a lot of the things we ve told you in the past is we quote these jobs and then they get delayed and then six months later we re stuck with this price and that s what we want better intelligence into predicting that and being able to drive better value for those forward looking jobs that today we re pricing at a point in time that we want to get smarter on stanley elliott stifel nicolaus and company analyst and so it is fair to assume that you had some of these sorts of systems in place to help you on the pricing side i mean just trying to kind of get a sense for kind of the magnitude of change here william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer yeah we ve had cell systems that had targeted margins and things like that really were focused on raw material and deliveries but with what we re doing now we re actually going to capture customer by customer the customers behavior how the customer orders when the customer cancels what rates they pour at i mean those things impact every single part of our business and when i start talking about labor it s a tremendous impact on how each customer could be different and how they place actually place concrete and we can capture all that history with customers to say this is why they deserve what they deserve because they re really good or maybe they re not very good and we re not capturing the margin because we re just looking at a point in time and treating all customers the same and we have to be better at understanding the impact all the way through our system and that s what these tools will allow us to do stanley elliott stifel nicolaus and company analyst great very helpful and could you remind us again kind of expectations for aggregate pricing in the coming year and then will the dallas fort worth quarry coming online and i think you said third quarter will they have a meaningful impact in terms of the volume shift william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer no when you look at pricing let s not about pricing first we would still expect to see price improvement as we go through the remainder of the year we re obviously up over 10 in the first quarter i would not expect it to continue at that rate in the coming quarters so i would say that mid single digit is probably the right average for the remains of the year there ll be some stress between the quarters as far as the volumes what we said is we would still expect to see meaningful improvement of volumes what we had said is with polaris on there at 6 million tons or in our operation of 6 million tons we would expect to see double digit improvement in volumes i would expect to see double digit improvement in volumes in the remaining quarters as we go through the remainder of the year as well stanley elliott stifel nicolaus and company analyst great guys thanks for taking the questions william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer sure operator operator instructions your next responses from julio romero of sidoti and company please go ahead julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst hi good morning william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer good morning julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst i wanted to ask about operating cash flows believe the last two years sort of seen as a sequential decrease in cash flow going from q1 to q2 should we kind of expect a similar cadence for cash flows as we go into q2 and also throughout the back half of 2019 william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer yes so there s a few things in there obviously q2 is our one of our stronger quarters q2 and q3 are one of our stronger quarters so you do have some consumption of working capital needs in q2 if you re looking at it just on a true cash flow perspective and modeling what i d like to point out as well is that with respect to our contingent consideration payments that we were alluding to earlier we referred about 40 million for the year i would say i know we made an 8 million payment in april on one of the acquisitions so that occurred in april the 23 million with the sand and gravel quarry that is a late q2 early q3 potential payment so just depending upon the timing of that and the offset of that would be any cash received for eminent domain cost that we recover from the government in q2 so you have a lot of puts and takes in there for the quarter in when you re scheduling out or looking at leverage and cash flow in total or an aggregate to determine your debt levels for the company you should consider those as well julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst okay that s helpful and then just wanted to drill down a bit further on freight i appreciate your earlier comments about the availability of drivers still impacting yourselves and every one of the industry how have freight cost per ton trended recently can you just talk about some of the puts and takes there william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer i m sorry i wasn t clear on the question julio you re saying our pricing per ton in aggregates is that what you re looking at julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst correct yeah i just saw it versus beat the volume can you talk about that william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer yeah so our pricing what we said was we re over 10 on our asp for aggregates for q1 i wouldn t expect that double digit improvement to continue but we re talking high single digits certainly for the remainder of the quarters it s kind of vary a little bit between each quarters but i think on average you should see a mid to high single digit price improvement julio romero sidoti and compnay analyst okay helpful thanks very much william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer sure john e kunz senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks julio operator i am showing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to bill sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer william j sandbrook chairman and chief executive officer thanks tamara and thank you everyone for participating in the call this morning and

begin our quarterly review adam adam david portnoy ceo president md director thanks tim and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 which ended on march 31 we reported adjusted net income of 8 2 million or 0 50 per share this quarter s operating results reflect the repositioning efforts we have helped facilitate at certain of our client companies over the last several months to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their operating results and future prospects we believe these efforts will have positive long term benefits for both our client companies and rmr but in the near term these efforts have created headwinds for our operating results even though some of our client companies stock prices were negatively affected during the quarter as a result of some of our repositioning efforts our client company operating fundamentals remained positive this quarter for example rmr ranged over 1 7 million square feet of leases on behalf of our client companies this past quarter these leases resulted in average rental rates of approximately 8 higher than prior rents for the same space and have an average term of eight years rmr also supervised approximately 20 million in capital improvements at our client companies during the quarter some of the more noteworthy highlights across our client companies include the following industrial logistics properties trust was especially busy this quarter as it recently closed on over 900 million in acquisitions and reported significant leasing activity ilpt s 900 million in acquisitions were the result of two portfolio deals that were more than 70 funded by recently entered into mortgage financing in hawaii that we discussed during our last earnings call as it relates to leasing ilpt announced 271 000 square feet of leasing activity this quarter which resulted in weighted average rental rates that were 15 8 higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average lease terms of over nine years ilpt completed rent resets for 483 000 square feet of hawaiian ground leases which resulted in weighted average rental rates that were 28 higher than prior rental rates these positive developments in ilpt continued to reinforce our belief that the ilpt story is one investors continue to underestimate office properties income trust continued moving forward on the strategic initiatives of de leveraging through asset sales and active property management this quarter since january 1 opi has closed on 268 5 million of property sales and entered into sales agreements representing over 28 million for another three properties in addition opi announced leasing activity of more than 825 000 square feet and weighted average rental rates that were 12 8 higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average lease terms of 7 5 years these de leveraging activities and leasing momentum should position opi well for future growth and the latter part of calendar year 2019 for the eighth year in a row hospitality properties trust raised its quarterly cash dividend by 0 01 to 0 54 per common share during the quarter hpt also acquired the 335 room hotel palomar in washington d c for approximately 142 million in april senior housing properties trust and five star senior living restructured their business arrangements to both maximize the value of snh senior living portfolio and stabilize five star snh s largest tenant as part of this restructuring snh agreed to convert its leased senior living portfolio into managed portfolio with five star and five star will issue about 85 ownership to snh shareholders as a result snh reduced its quarterly dividend and announced strategic dispositions of up to 900 million to reduce leverage when completed this new arrangement will ensure the long term financial health of snh and five star as well as allow snh and its shareholders to participate in five star s performance in the future completion of this transaction requires approval by five star shareowners the related parties and insiders currently own more than 50 of five star s outstanding shares at this time tremont mortgage trust has fully deployed its opi ipo proceeds and recently announced that their quarterly cash dividend would be raised by 0 11 to 0 22 per common share to ensure loan origination momentum rmr has recently increased our commitments to tremont s credit facility from 25 million to 50 million this credit facility is intended to be a bridge until additional equity capital can be raised this facility provides tremont with almost 200 million of investing capacity on a leverage basis and we ll provide tremont greater flexibility to execute their business strategy and keep its origination network engaged until additional capital can be raised tremont recently filed a registration statement with the sec to raise additional equity capital and any secondary offering remains subject to the sec s review and ultimately market conditions due to sec rules we are unable to comment further or take questions about any possible offering by tremont looking forward possible rmr growth strategies remain focused on three core areas first we are always focused on organic growth at our current client companies second we are continuing our efforts to diversify and grow new vehicles that will leverage private capital and third we hope to leverage our balance sheet to identify strategic acquisitions and seed new client companies on the private capital front starting in 2019 we officially launched our marketing effort for the rmr office real estate open end fund in conjunction with our third party sales team as i ve highlighted in previous calls this fundraising process will likely be lengthy and we don t expect to have any news around capital raising until later this year at the earliest nevertheless we have made contact or met with over 100 potential investors so far this year and believe we are making progress in our fundraising efforts depending on the pace of future acquisition opportunities we continue to expect rmr s 100 million commitment to the fund to be called in the later half of calendar year 2019 we ended the quarter with approximately 384 million in cash and no debt while i cannot speak to specific opportunities we continue to assess opportunities to possibly further diversify revenues and put our balance sheet to work management and our board of directors continues to believe that using our balance sheet to grow the organization with a longer term view remains a higher priority than other options such as using capital for special dividend or stock buybacks in terms of possible acquisition opportunities we continue to focus on growing our real estate securities management platform and we ve recently expanded our search to include real estate private equity firms i look forward to providing more details on future calls as this process evolves i ll now turn the call over to matt jordan our chief financial officer who will review our financial results for the quarter matthew p jordan cfo treasurer thanks adam good afternoon everyone management services revenues were 42 6 million this quarter which represents a 4 million decrease on a year over year basis primarily from lower base business management fees due to declines in the average market capitalization of opi and snh partially offset by acquisition related fee growth at ilpt on a sequential quarter basis management services revenues decreased almost 5 billion from lower base business management fees due to declines in the average market capitalization of opi declines in construction management fees tied to lower capital spend at the managed equity reits and lower ta non fuel revenues as a result of the sale of the convenience store business for the quarter ended march 31 2019 all our managed equity reit except for ilpt are currently paying monthly base business management fees on a market capitalization basis the impact of being on this lower measure for calculating our monthly base business management fees results in a lost revenue opportunity with revenues this quarter being approximately 7 million lower than they otherwise would have been on an invested capital basis turning to expenses for the quarter total compensation and benefits expense was 30 6 million which includes cash compensation of 29 million 1 2 million of non cash share based payments and 400 000 in separation costs cash compensation of 29 million is an increase of approximately 1 million both on a year over year and sequential quarter basis these increases are primarily attributable to overall headcount additions as well as standard wage and benefit inflation as it relates to cash compensation and reimbursements from our client companies our recovery rate remained at 43 this quarter looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2019 we expect normalized cash compensation to be approximately 29 million for the quarter and we are projecting 200 000 of severance costs next quarter related to retiring rmr executives g a expense this quarter was 7 1 million which we believe represents a normalized run rate so i d like to highlight our board of directors issued the annual share grants in april all of which vested immediately accordingly our third quarter results will include incremental g a costs of approximately 750 000 in closing i d like to reiterate that rmr and its client companies are now well positioned to benefit from the repositioning and restructuring actions we ve facilitated over the last six months in future periods we believe potential growth from the capture of lost revenue opportunities at our managed equity reits organic growth at our client companies and rmr s growth strategies should hopefully make this quarter s financial results a low watermark for rmr in other words we think there is more upside potential rather than downside risk to our operating performance going forward to that end we are projecting total management and advisory service revenues to be approximately 45 million for each of the next two fiscal quarters an increase of approximately 2 million from this quarter s results this projection takes into consideration the current share prices of our managed equity reits projections of when strategic disposition activity will occur projected capital spend at our managed equity reits and ilpt s recent acquisitions that concludes our formal remarks operator would you please open the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question today will come from mitch germain of jmp securities please go ahead mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst thank you adam i appreciate your thoughts about diversifying and growing the revenue stream i m curious you know your in office your in hospitality healthcare industrial are there any other asset classes that you think i mean given the bandwidth of the organization i can understand the hesitancy that maybe had for retail but are there any other asset classes that might make sense for you adam david portnoy ceo president md director hi mitch thanks for the question i think from an asset class the big one that we re obviously not in is multi family residential i mean you could make an argument that our senior living portfolio is related to multi family because people live there but it is different than traditional multifamily that s the obvious missing piece in terms of our assets under management you mentioned retail that s an area that we have some exposure to but i think could be an area for also expansion going forward you could do that through acquisitions and or lifting outlets say a team from another group so there s many ways we could think about getting into those sort of asset classes and we are thinking about that as we think about acquisitions and growth initiatives for the company mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst what about growing the amount that you managed property management obviously maybe looking more toward third party management for other landlords is that something that you ve considered adam david portnoy ceo president md director it is definitely something we have considered and thought a lot about i ll tell you that the property management business is typically not a very high margin business and it s large the people that have been successful with it have largely tied to business to leasing brokerage and sales brokerage business oftentimes the property management is a lost leader to get those other parts of the business and i think it continues to be an advantage for our client companies that we say we only do in our property management facilities management in and around clients of rmr that where our clients own real estate and i think that provides a tremendous amount of focus on the client companies and so i don t think we have definitely thought about it but i don t think it s an area that i m particularly focused on in terms of growth mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst great last one from me i might have missed it i do apologize but i was just curious about the fundraising initiatives with the third party capital initiatives with the office fund and how that s moving along and what about the deal pipeline there adam david portnoy ceo president md director so great question we did talk a little bit about it in our prepared remarks since the beginning of the year we have met with or made contact with over 100 potential investors several of those meetings and contacts are ongoing we this is a long sales cycle and it s our first fund focused on private investors it s a new market for us i continue to believe that we will be successful here and i continue to believe it will take us a while i don t certainly till the end of this year till i would expect us to have any news around meaningful additional investors but i think we re tracking toward our expectations that we originally outlined we originally outlined it was going to take us time but i think we re tracking to that and i also think we re working very hard in putting all our energy behind it and i think we ll be successful ultimately mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst and so that would be tied to any future growth is that the way to think about it adam david portnoy ceo president md director yes we think accessing private capital is a part of our future growth yes mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst so not much in terms of deal flow that we should expect from that entity until the third party capital is committed adam david portnoy ceo president md director no i understand your question better now okay yes we still believe that there will be there s still capacity just based on the commitments and leverage that we can put into the vehicle that i would round numbers at least 200 million maybe more buying power today in that vehicle absent any third party so yes i didn t understand the question before mitchell bradley germain jmp securities llc research division analyst no i appreciate it i didn t ask i asked it wrong the first time thanks i appreciate it operator our next question will come from bryan maher of b riley fbr please go ahead bryan maher b riley analyst yes good afternoon so it s a little frustrating as i m sure you well know where the shares are trading relative to what many of us believe is the underlying value is there anything that can be done with your increasingly large cash ph award the kind of throw down the gauntlet and kind of show investors that you really believe in names like opi and snh and kind of maybe buy shares into rmr i don t know if it s 1 million 2 million 3 million shares you re going to earn a great return in the meantime as if and when the shares recover and further align yourself with those entities have you guys given any thought to that matthew p jordan cfo treasurer short answer is we ve given a lot of thought to that but we have come to the conclusion certainly i don t think our thinking has changed i think our thinking has been consistent on it although we continue to think about it we continue to believe that the capital that rmr in the balance sheet of rmr is best used to think about diversifying and growing the client base rather than investing in current client client base your question is a good one it s something that we think about everyday but today there is no strategic shift we continue to be focused on using our balance sheet and cash to diversify revenues grow our client base and that s the focus bryan maher b riley analyst and when you think about the kind of challenging years that opi and snh have this year not so much from operationally challenged just a lot to do with the asset sales and in the case of snh switching kind of the structure and with five star which of those are going to be more time consuming for you a management company and which one do you think is going to be more heavy lifting and why adam david portnoy ceo president md director they re both they are all time consuming for the organization in organizations large enough that i think you can quite easily do it we re just as good at selling properties as we are buying properties and to be honest with you i don t see the sales at opi and their assets versus let s say the sales that snh and their type of assets being one being meaningfully different difficult i will tell you maybe with one exception and it s a small part with maybe within the snh portfolio and i m sure the management team at snh would agree with me the stand alone sniffs which we don t have a big portfolio of anything is heavily reliant on medicaid and we don t have a lot of those those are probably the hardest but everything else there is nothing particularly harder or easier about any of the other potential asset sales and the only thing i ll say about the stand alone sniffs is it s not a lot of dollars or a lot of communities it s a relatively small part but if you push me to say what s the hardest those are probably the hardest to sell bryan maher b riley analyst and so as all of us kind of finish earnings here and we ve listen to the calls particularly with opi and snh and we listen to the ceos and cfos talk about the prospective cap rates to which these assets are going to be sold and then when we look at the cap rate and the implied cap rate of where the shares are trading i know the goal is to de lever those entities but at what point do you say that the gap between where we re selling assets at 6 or 7 cap and our stock s trading at a double digit cap rate did not redeploy some of the proceeds to buy back some stock at these ridiculous level adam david portnoy ceo president md director yeah it s a tough situation because both the companies that are selling assets are focused on selling assets snh and opi they need to sell those assets to delever and maintain their investment grade rating i don t think those companies given where they are could afford to take any of that cash and not delever if they were to use that cash into continue to lever up in terms of taking out stock i think that would that s not something i think those two companies or the boards of those companies would be particularly favorable upon i mean i think the investment grade rating is incredibly important to both snh and opi and deleveraging those companies is the priority and so i don t see in i don t think the conversation around stock buybacks is really going to even be seriously debated until leverage is in check and we ve maintained and we ve got confirmation that the ratings are secure bryan maher b riley analyst and how long do you think that process plays out is it a back half late in 2019 scenario that you get that comfort adam david portnoy ceo president md director i think our goal is that all the disposition and deleveraging happens by the end of this year bryan maher b riley analyst okay thanks adam operator operator instructions our next question will come from owen lau of oppenheimer please go ahead kwun sum lau oppenheimer co inc research division analyst hi adam hi matt thank you for taking my questions could you please provide more color on the real estate private equity funds in your expanded search what is the strategic rationale of this type of fund what is the target size of this fund and any more color at this point would be very helpful thank you adam david portnoy ceo president md director sure so it s a good question what we re looking why we have expanded our searching in and around private real estate private equity funds is that we believe we will be successful in growing our own private fund capacity but there may be an opportunity to reprog or really turbocharge it if we could possibly partner up or acquire a fund shop to put round numbers around it i would say would need to be as shop that had meaningful assets under management i m not thinking this is not hundreds of millions of dollars that have to be billions of dollars under management in the space and it would really have to being something where let s say the private equity firm was there a stage in their growth where partnering with us would basically allow them to sort of turbocharge their growth meaning they might be of certain size but if they were to become part of let s say rmr and we re a 30 billion dollar organization in 35 offices around the country a large employee base focused on real estate that by partnering with us are working with us they would be able to sort of turbocharge their own capital raising and from our perspective it would sort of accelerate the growth of that part of our business for us so that would have to be the both parties what they would be getting out of it and again i think we would be thinking something meaningful if we did there not i don t think we would achieve what i m trying to articulate if it was a relatively small private equity shop it would have to be mid size what s mid size it s multi billion dollars in size and i think that s the way we re thinking about it and you know we having conversations with folks but you never know how these conversations will work out and of course there is a lot of social issues involved in those types of conversations and so we are hopeful that we can maybe do something there but i m not sure we will be able to kwun sum lau oppenheimer co inc research division analyst that s helpful and just to be clear you are looking for 100 equity stake instead of partial equity stake or even joint venture right i just want to make sure adam david portnoy ceo president md director i would inaudible our preferred structure is a 100 ownership i think we would accept a control stake so more than 50 we would if in the right circumstances but i do not think we are not interested in a minority position or necessarily just a joint venture it would be minimum a control stake kwun sum lau oppenheimer co inc research division analyst that s perfect finally a modeling question maybe for matt managed operator revenue it s a little bit light this quarter compared to last quarter and also same quarter last year what are the key drivers of that and also is this quarter a good run rate going forward thank you matthew p jordan cfo treasurer no it s a good question there is seasonality that plays in their own when i talk about the 45 million in projected revenues the next two quarters a chunk of the 2 million or so increased approximately 700 000 of that is the managed operators increased revenues the ta business tends to tends to pick up the next two quarters inaudible has had some renovation activity so you should definitely not model off solely this quarter s run rate kwun sum lau oppenheimer co inc research division analyst okay that s very helpful that s it from me thank you very much operator ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to adam portnoy for any closing remarks adam david portnoy ceo president md director thank you for joining us we will be at the b riley fbr conference in late may we also look forward to updating you on our progress during the fourth quarter conference call operator that
