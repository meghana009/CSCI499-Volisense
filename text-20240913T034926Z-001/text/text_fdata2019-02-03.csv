zimbabwe capitalist crisis ultra neoliberal policy mugabesque authoritarianism economy international relations february 3 2019 patrick bond once again a formidable burst of state brutality against zimbabwe s citizenry has left at least a dozen corpses scores of serious injuries mass arrests internet suspension and a furious citizenry the 14 17 january nationwide protests were called by trade unions against an unprecedented fuel price hike leading to repression reminiscent of former leader robert mugabe s iron fist most of the country s economy ground to a halt for more than a week the cities remained ghost towns as army troops continued attacking even ordinary civilians who are desperate to earn a living in what often seems to be the country s main occupation these days street vending of cheap imported commodities a national strike of 500 000 civil service workers has been called most essential commodities are now vastly overpriced or in very short supply this is what a full on capitalist crisis looks like the stresses are obvious within elite politics for as ever in harare rumours of political upheaval abound but whatever happens to the ruling party s leadership a more brutal fiscal policy plus an even tighter state squeeze on hard currency appear to be the new constants the stubbornness of president emmerson mnangagwa s leadership is partly due to the ideological fervour of his finance minister mthuli ncube an academic economist with a dubious practical track record and fast fading international credibility as cnn interviewers now openly laugh at answers to questions ncube argues that zimbabwe s problems boil down to loan repayment arrears to international creditors a high state budget deficit and a trade deficit in addition to ultra neoliberal macroeconomics mnangagwa depends on vice president constantino chiwenga s renewed authoritarian tendencies the country s crony capitalist system is being shaken by its own contradictions even more profoundly than in the darkest days before rhodesian colonizers finally gave up power in 1980 when the third world debt crisis hit hard in 1984 when deindustrialization began with a homegrown i e world bank transmitted structural adjustment programme in 1991 when foreign debt defaults began in 1998 in the lead up to several hotly contested elections especially 2000 2002 2005 and 2008 and when the local currency crashed to its death in 2009 postcoup return of the imf riot the protest was sparked by a 150 per cent overnight price increase in petrol announced on saturday 12 january at 3 31 litre this makes it the world s most expensive retail fuel with hong kong second at 2 05 litre the next day mnangagwa and a plane load of colleagues departed for russia belarus azerbaijan and kazakhstan in search of mineral investors energy deals and what the president called moscow s state of the art albeit unaffordable military equipment indeed mnangagwa was meant to continue to davos for the world economic forum but was persuaded that the country and his own leadership were in peril so instead headed home mnangagwa s first tweet after arriving back in harare was in defence of the fuel price hike not a decision we took lightly but it was the right thing to do what followed was regrettable and tragic he promised to look into army and police thuggery but hopes for a reckoning are in vain since his own background is littered with the country s most extreme post liberation repression he managed the 1980s gukurahundi massacres of more than 20 000 ndebele people and since his own spokesman inherited from mugabe told the press that the recent army attacks which included numerous rapes were a foretaste of things to come at this writing army repression continues and leading activists remain behind bars including five members of parliament the term that veteran zimbabwean social justice activist elinor sisulu uses to describe mnangagwa s dictatorial tendencies mugabesque is now very hard to refute in spite of ncube s surreal whitewash attempts in davos last week recall that mugabe had run zimbabwe since 1980 after leading the armed liberation struggle against the white racist rhodesian regime of ian smith twenty years on he was threatened with probable electoral defeat so his belated urgent and chaotic land reform against a few thousand mainly reactionary white settlers who for a century had controlled nearly all zimbabwe s good farmland gained him permanent hatred from the western establishment though land redistribution was justifiably popular in some circles mnangagwa last year admitted that the acquisitions had robbed the country of its breadbasket status given how much of the staple maize needed to be imported even while tobacco production hit record highs as a result land acquisition was now a thing of the past the new president promised riddled with corruption and dictatorial tendencies mugabe s ruling party the zimbabwe african national union patriotic front zanu pf had meanwhile become widely hated in the cities which were mainly governed by the liberal opposition party the movement for democratic change mdc whose constituents gave mnangagwa s 2017 coup their immediate joyful approval but the celebration was brief and the hangover long for mdc founding leader morgan tsvangirai died of cancer early last year and the mid 2018 national election witnessed mnangagwa victory s one that his mdc successor nelson chamisa considered to be rigged mnangagwa came to power in november 2017 assisted by then army commander chiwenga after a relatively non violent and then very popular weeklong coup against mugabe one re labelled a military assisted transition by opportunistic diplomats in order to avoid the legal consequences although mugabe was often abused by chiwenga and mnangagwa in prior years according to his private secretary the father of the nation was useful to the junta and he was compelled to remain in office by chiwenga after losing the first round of the 2008 election to tsvangirai in lieu of turning over power to the mdc from the plotters standpoint the crucial mistake made by the 93 year old leader in late 2017 was the excessively rapid elevation of his four decade younger wife grace mugabe she was briefly considered to be his likely successor once she managed to get mnangagwa fired as vice president a week prior to the coup the mugabes now live in politically uncomfortable and apparently careless luxury akin to house arrest despising the coup makers and endorsing last year s electoral opponent but also under their thumb the 2017 coup relied on chiwenga s joint operation command an army junta that was already controlling much of zimbabwe behind the scenes partly funded by diamond mining arranged through chinese mining joint ventures given how erratic mugabe had become how his policies discouraged investment and how he turned against the chinese firms allied with chiwenga in 2016 due to their prolific diamond looting former allies in beijing welcomed the change in power pretoria johannesburg elites and western powers especially britain were also upbeat however aside from adopting much more pro business rhetoric and initially liberalizing politics to an unprecedented degree mnangagwa and chiwenga didn t lose their taste for repression according to the progressive coalition known as crisis in zimbabwe the last week has witnessed mass trials fast tracked trials routine denial of bail routine dismissal of preliminary applications refusal of access to medical treatment and trial and detention of juveniles for nearly a week disconnections of social media and the internet were also added to the toolbox until a 21 january court order catalysed by human rights lawyers reversed the state s ether clampdown in davos last week ncube defended the chiwenga s internet disconnection as just a temporary and tactical strategy to try to manage the situation managing insurrection and managing information and dissemination speaking to cnn he bizarrely blamed last week s protests on a pre planned conspiracy and not his petrol price hike these are the facts anger at the petrol price was added on and he defended army intervention what you saw in the streets is actually a sign that the government is open democratic spaces are open two leading opposition politicians were scathing welshman ncube no relation called him a political moron for these remarks and former mdc finance minister tendai biti from 2009 13 labels ncube a fraud as if to prove it in another interview ncube said of his davos trip things are going well the theme is globalization 4 0 it resonates with what zimbabwe s trying to do in terms of global financial re engagement raising capital pushing our mantra that zimbabwe s open for business it really resonates zimbabwe is the best buy in africa under ncube much more explicitly neoliberal anti poor fiscal monetary policies prevail with no end in sight the new regime has been unable to make structural changes to an impoverished economy dependent upon primary resource exports in a time of still low world commodity prices since last september when ncube was appointed budget cutbacks and desperation currency manipulation have logically followed the society knows this feeling of despondency it appears often as a so called imf riot i e when people revolt immediately after a neoliberal shock sometimes ordered by the international monetary fund such as overnight removal of food or petrol subsidies zimbabwe s prior imf riots were caused by severe shocks in 1998 when the currency fell 74 per cent in four hours and in 1999 when mugabe felt the need to default on foreign debt in 2005 06 when mugabe authorized repayment of 200 million worth of imf loans the reserve bank officials gathered up all the hard currency they could find on the black market sparking a wicked upsurge of inflation and another set of imf riots as for the class character of last week s anger two progressive researchers from the institute for public affairs in zimbabwe tamuka chirimambowa and tinashe chimedza explain that the protests were intense in specific geographies associated with the urban poor and the barely working class is a direct consequence of the existing political economy that is systemically unequal the riotous protests were found and concentrated south of samora machel avenue contrasted to the affluent suburbs north of samora machel harare north which enjoyed a peaceful stay away in bulawayo they were concentrated in the western suburbs in mutare and masvingo in the southern suburbs the elite hob knobbed on social media or their usual social spaces with very limited threats to their security and their only major outcry was the closure of shops and the internet shutdown the protests were predictable enough and mnangagwa and ncube imposed the petrol price hike and immediately left town scheduled meetings with vladimir putin with leaders of three other repressive eastern european and central asian countries and with the world economic forum took precedent ncube s vain arrears ambitions pay won t pay or can t pay and can t get new loans zimbabwe s notorious shortage of hard currency was the proximate cause of the fuel price hike followed by rapid price increases in anything requiring transport including the staple maize in turn this squeeze reflects the priorities of a new finance minister the academic economist ncube who is considered the most neoliberal in modern zimbabwe s history exhibiting a sometimes startling self confidence and entirely comfortable within the circuits of world elites ncube is smooth and at first blush persuasive but his three most spectacular prior mistakes were first founding and chairing the harare barbican bank which launched in mid 2003 but then failed to meet obligations to the country s clearance system within seven months leading to expulsion two months later it was declared insolvent as its regulator at the reserve bank of zimbabwe explained due to serious liquidity problems as a result of imprudent banking behaviour questionable cross border foreign exchange activities which are yet to be cleared to the satisfaction of all parties a second mistake was serving as a top official well into 2018 at corruption riddled financier quantum global which ripped off angola s citizenry during his tenure there third as chief economist at the western dominated african development bank afdb in 2011 at the height of africa rising hype he declared the existence of a new african middle class of more than 330 million people hey you know what the world please wake up this is a phenomenon in africa that we ve not spent a lot of time thinking about oddly ncube included in the middle class category people who barely survive on 2 4 day a group of more than 200 million his smooth optimistic talk notwithstanding ncube s finance minister role since last september has been rocky interviewed last 3 december by richard quest on cnn ncube argued that the most serious economic problem he believes the country faces is foreign debt repayment arrears of 5 6 billion most of which date back 20 years the arrears include 1 3 billion owed to the world bank 680 million to the afdb 308 million to the european investment bank 2 8 billion to the paris club and at least 500 million to non western lenders and firms especially the chinese state and south african corporations said ncube the budget recognises that we have a twin deficit challenge which is that we have a fiscal deficit as well as a current account deficit but also we need to deal with our debt arrears in terms of debt restructuring so two things that are confounded or rather magnified by the arrears ncube then promoted his homegrown structural adjustment programme the transition stabilisation programme bragging that international financial institutions ifis just gave the plan a warm endorsement we ve sold it internationally and then we re willing to move to the next step which is to clear the debt arrears with the afdb and the world bank which is what you call the preferred creditor ifis we re determined in the next 12 months that is done and then we move on the second the third phase which is the paris club negotiations with the bilateral creditors finally he offered this extraordinary claim zimbabwe is indeed the biggest buy in africa right now on any asset you talk about the rule of law let me tell you this is about property rights at the end day property rights are secure in zimbabwe clearly zimbabwe is the biggest buy in africa right now ncube then tweeted proudly about this biggest buy status a claim he just repeated in davos but the gap between zimbabwe s local soft currency a combination of a local bond note bill and electronic payments and the main currency used in zimbabwe since 2009 the u s dollar has remained in the range of 3 5 4 times even though they are pegged as equal inflation soared to 42 per cent in december with a black market raging and only 400 million of paper u s dollars circulating in the banking system due to the physical shortage of u s notes for more than a year day long waits in bank queues to withdraw 20 has been the norm ncube has promised to introduce a proper local currency within a year but claims he must first clear arrears and end deficit spending so as to restore confidence yet with a stiff upper lip ncube appeared in davos at the world economic forum last week announcing to cnn his intention to continue upping the economic pressure including not just more fiscal discipline externally making sure we can begin to address our arrears in terms of what we owe to other nations the bretton woods institutions included but fiscal discipline is key and if you noticed what has been happening since october 2018 the premiums in the parallel market have stabilized and this is because of fiscal discipline ncube utterly overstates budget cutbacks as a solution to all problems asked by bloomberg about roaring inflation he offered a simplistic incorrect cause and solution it s being driven by the parallel market in terms of pricing that s what has pushed up the prices people speculating what we re doing about it is to just make sure that on the fiscal front we continue to make sure there is fiscal discipline cutting back on government expenditure ncube s no gain without pain logic in one of the most abused societies in africa failed to win zimbabweans confidence he erred last october when establishing foreign currency accounts within the predatory banking system in the process wiping out large amounts of savings which devalued by two thirds to black market rates instead he could have taken a predecessor s advice biti advocated ring fencing the bank accounts against their devaluation last month complained biti for the first time in modern zimbabwe history a finance minister prioritized a new york trip instead of debating his budget as scheduled in parliament in a prior parliamentary appearance last october biti asked ncube you seem to suggest that you are going to find money to clear the arrears and my question is what country is going to give you the almost 2 billion that you would require to pay off the arrears you are going to try and clear the arrears that zimbabwe has at the world bank and afdb i am saying given the quantum of that debt and given the fragility of our own situation now which country is prepared to lend us the money that zimbabwe has to use to clear in spite of ncube s regular assurances of new credit lines based on his stellar rolodex of banking contacts he answered nebulously on the issue of debt clearance and which countries are going to help us at the stage of clearing the afdb and world bank balances of course we will negotiate with the various countries who are shareholders in those institutions and of course the paris club countries we will negotiate with them the g7 there are other members of european union and in europe who are willing to talk to us about this we have had a conversation with them already so we will continue to explore with them as to whether they can give us relief but there are countries that we are speaking to but no details are ever forthcoming on the promised bailout return of the imf the most crucial bailout lender is still the much feared imf to which mugabe s regime questionably repaid all arrears in late 2016 a series of self delegitimising 21st century leaders have helped reduce its reputation rodrigo rato jailed last october for bank fraud dominique strauss kahn resigned in disgrace but demanded imf support for his 2011 rape trial and still today after a guilty verdict in 2016 for corruption negligence in france christine lagarde nevertheless the institution remains the global policeman for the entire financial world and since 1984 it has pummelled zimbabwe into austerity and structural adjustment in early 2018 imf spokesperson gerry rice endorsed the neoliberal path mnangagwa had chosen the authorities are cognizant of these challenges that they face and the economy is facing and they ve expressed their determination to address them the 2018 budget which they presented on 7 december so about a month ago stresses the government s intentions to re impose budget discipline reform and open the economy and engage with the broader international community which is on going and important in terms of arrears clearance for budget shrinkage he specifically recommended more agricultural subsidy cuts again last september as pro imf finance minister ncube took office rice made clear that his staff stand ready to help the authorities design a reform package that can help facilitate the clearance of external payment arrears to international development banks and bilateral official creditors and that they would open the way for fresh financing from the internal community including potentially the imf but again just to stress as we said before potential financial support from the fund is conditional on the clearance of those arrears to the world bank the afdb and financing assurances from bilateral official creditors we are working with the zimbabwean authorities in the meantime to provide policy advice and technical assistance that might help could help move that process forward in december rice reiterated imf support for ncube the policies of the new administration under the zimbabwe transition and stabilization programme do constitute a comprehensive stabilization and reform effort in order to address zimbabwe s macroeconomic situation and just as full reports of the most recent imf riot and army repression were filed on 17 january this year rice repeated his institution s demands in terms of the imf zimbabwe has in fact cleared its arrears to us to the fund but our rules preclude lending to a country that is still in or under arrears to other international financial situations so until that particular situation is resolved we would not be moving forward with a financial support for zimbabwe i said here the last time that the authority s economic policies we felt were headed in the right direction broadly in terms of addressing the fiscal deficit and monetary policy and so on i won t repeat what i said the last time but that s where we are on zimbabwe clearly the system needs a jolt to get out of the rut who can provide it enter biggish brother talk left about sanctions lend right about 7 million the next door neighbour south africa offers the most logical crutch a desperation visit by leading harare officials to pretoria the day after christmas last year included a request for a loan to clear the other arrears the lead treasury bureaucrat turned them down initially they wanted money 1 2 billion we don t have 1 2 billion but what we have is the will to assist them our engagements are across the system assisting from a budgeting implementation point of view and reprioritizing of public expenditure including on their behalf engaging multilateral development institutions which we have started a year ago the same official prepared the 2018 19 south african budget cutting social programmes and municipal infrastructure support to such an extent that even neoliberal business day newspaper termed it savage while allowing an extra 5 per cent of all local institutional investor wealth around 36 billion to escape the country via exchange control liberalization with this mentality prevailing in pretoria s treasury it is no wonder that at the very high point of the state s repression last week south africa s neoliberal finance minister tito mboweni endorsed ncube i think the idea of using a new currency in zimbabwe is a good one i think our colleagues there are on a good wicket when it comes to that space we are working together very well but at the end of the day it is zimbabweans who need to fix their country zimbabweans can recount a long history of the south african ruling party propping up its liberation era allies zanu pf when the latter turn most repressive this occurred most regularly when thabo mbeki was president from 1999 2008 laments veteran south african business journalist barney mthombothi what still sticks in the craw for many zimbabweans is the arrangement concocted by mbeki ten years ago to keep mugabe in power despite the fact that he had been defeated by morgan tsvangirai adding insult to injury even while activists remained in appalling prison conditions on 20 january pretoria s foreign minister lindiwe sisulu intoned protests in zimbabwe have calmed down and life in the streets of zimbabwe is returning to normal when it comes to money however the south african finance minister reverts to type a scrooge according to mboweni the existing south africa zimbabwe credit facility of a measly 7 million was in any case backed by harare s collateral in the form of its holding of sa land bank bills the extension of this facility depended on zimbabwe being able to provide further collateral the potential low level debt relief he implied would be a tokenistic sop to elite solidarity and would do nothing to change the structural economic power and financial deficits that zimbabwe faces in the region and the world however if more south africa credit materialises it is also likely that mboweni would try to get a higher repayment prioritization for south african firms more than just fraternal ideology there is also blatant national capitalist self interest at work as the sunday times reported at least 15 major south african linked companies with operations in zimbabwe were struggling to repatriate funds these include delta beverages 40 per cent owned by ab inbev multichoice owned by naspers tongaat hulett ppc and zimplats owned by impala platinum other firms such as edcon pick n pay sanlam tiger brands nedbank and alexander forbes either have units in zimbabwe or are invested in locally owned business mboweni s south african national budget will be tabled in parliament in one month s time it must make gestures to reducing parastatal agencies outsized debt so in talks with ncube he may even demand that the first repayment of arrears goes to pretoria s bankrupt national airline south african airways that firm is owed an estimated 60 million in ticket sale revenues on the vital harare johannesburg route funds which zimbabwe has lacked sufficient hard currency to repay early this month the airline s spokesperson claimed that ncube had begun to settle those arrears but provided no details there are other solidarities as well including ordinary south africans working closely with zimbabwean organizations in networks such as the united front johannesburg and the sporadic anti xenophobia movement with zimbabwe s capitalist crisis worsening from the late 1990s south africa began to host a vast immigrant pool who were not only political but also economic refugees with many more expected in coming weeks and months hence anti xenophobia politics remain crucial as an angry south african working class often takes out its frustrations on those they consider competitors for scarce jobs housing and township retail trade the two biggest potential sources of bottom up zimbabwe solidarity are the leftist economic freedom fighters eff which polls around 10 per cent of the vote and the largest trade union the national union of metalworkers of south africa numsa with 350 000 members however in neither case has a concrete strategy emerged on 23 january in contrast to the ruling party s nurturing of the neighbour s oppressors eff leader julius malema emphatically criticised zimbabwe s leaders calling mnangagwa a backward fool his behaviour is tyrannical and barbaric how do you switch off internet and kill people in 2019 we do not support brutal dictatorship mnangagwa must beware of that chiwenga is a former military general who wants to bring military dictatorship in zimbabwe but on the question of how to aid zimbabwe malema had a mixed message insofar as financing support was required at a time the xenophobia threat again looms south africa must contribute to the bailout of zimbabwe anyone who refuses that is dumb if you won t help zimbabweans the border will be flooded by them anyone who is going to block them from coming into south africa we re going to fight with that person you re always complaining that there re zimbabweans here the only way not to have them here is by helping them in their own country zimbabwe must be helped southern african development community countries need to come together we need to close ranks we must give a conditional grant dedicated to developmental programmes which will help zimbabwe to stand on its own but unasked and unanswered is the question who exactly will deliver a genuine development programme certainly not the mnangagwa chiwenga ncube regime on 25 january numsa s leader irvin jim issued a statement we salute the masses for acting with courage and for rejecting the austerity measures which have been imposed on them by the zanu pf government it is clear to them that the removal of former president robert mugabe did not result in an improvement of their conditions we stand in solidarity with the zimbabwean people and the working class majority and the poor in particular we support the demands made by workers in the public sector we are calling on all our comrades locally on the continent and around the globe to support zimbabwe in its hour of need but again the central question is how to support zimbabwe another form of south african zimbabwean elite solidarity comes from endorsing the red herring of u s and european sanctions mnangagwa claimed to sputnik during last week s moscow visit that those sanctions were able to collapse our own currency the same line of argument was taken up by mboweni interviewed by daily maverick e zine s peter fabricius politically there were two key issues to be resolved by zimbabwe mboweni said the first was for the political leadership to work hard for the lifting of the remaining international sanctions against zimbabwe while the second was to re introduce its own currency a process at least a year away consistent with pretoria s unwillingness to send material support to harare fabricius observed the idea of zimbabwe adopting the rand is clearly not on the table in the current discussions between the finance ministers and officials mboweni tweeted a news report that ncube had said that zimbabwe would not adopt the rand as it did not have adequate resources to do so does african advocacy against the u s and european sanctions against zimbabwe s elites make any difference fabricius provided a reality check though south africa and zimbabwe s other regional allies have often called on western countries to lift the few remaining sanctions against zimbabwe these countries are reluctant to do so mainly because of political considerations when zimbabwean soldiers used live ammunition on zimbabwean opposition supporters protesting against the results of the july elections western sources said mnangagwa had already blown his chances of sanctions being lifted can t borrow either thanks to u s sanctions western sanctions against zimbabwe s ruling elite have essentially been limited to financial and travel bans on individuals and their closely held firms trivially the european sanctions affect only seven elites and mnangagwa was already removed from that list in 2016 likewise a u s law the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act of 2001 zidera specifies measures against individuals responsible for the deliberate breakdown of the rule of law politically motivated violence and intimidation in zimbabwe zidera instructs the u s treasury to identify assets of those individuals held outside zimbabwe implement travel and economic sanctions against those individuals and their associates and families there are 141 people on the list at present including mugabe mnangagwa chiwenga and their cronies setting aside the zanu pf elites desires to lubricate their overseas financial holdings zidera has other features worthy of debate according to two critics in zimbabwe tendai murisa and shantha bloem first they write it also enshrined into law the u s stance that funding from the likes of the imf and world bank could not be reinstated until the act was lifted but as noted this has not been a consideration at all given that the bank has not been repaid its 1 3 billion in dubious mugabe era loans when making his general pitch for debt relief in an article last september ncube did not even bother mentioning zidera as a factor second murisa and bloem argue last july u s congress introduced an amended version of it passed just days before zimbabwe s first ever elections without mugabe this renewed act included the extra demand that the vote be free and fair it is debatable whether zimbabwe s 30 july elections passed that test in addition zidera was amended to support a few of zimbabwe s white farmers who in a regional court won a case for property reimbursement after their land was dispossessed more than 15 years ago do zidera s provisions prevent ncube from repaying arrears nearly impossible as that appears and then acquiring new loans from the imf and other multilateral financiers where the u s has influence apparently not in ncube s view as they were not raised even in passing last september in his own detailed article zimbabwe s options for sovereign debt relief indeed zidera has a provision that would actually help ncube two sectors of financial support for the zimbabwean economy under the imposed sanctions 1 bilateral debt relief restructuring rescheduling or eliminating the sovereign debt of zimbabwe held by any agency of the u s government and 2 multilateral debt relief and other financial assistance a review of the feasibility of restructuring rescheduling or eliminating the sovereign debt of zimbabwe as well as to instruct the u s executive director of international financial organizations to which the u s is a member to proposition financial and technical support for zimbabwe and do sanctions prevent zimbabwe from receiving donor aid in spite of mugabe s degenerate rule since 2010 zimbabwe has received far more western organization for economic cooperation and development donor grants than it ever did prior to 2010 in the 650mn 800mn year range of that more than a quarter comes from the usa from obama to trump there was a minor decline in 2017 18 but 194 million was given last year mostly in the form of aids medicines and strengthening private sector services of course much northern aid is a self serving sham remaining in multinational corporate or ngo home country accounts much of the funding that does reach zimbabwe is hijacked by the ruling party a crucial question is whether such funding plus large inflows of remittances from migrant often politically exiled zimbabweans then circulates locally relieving the cash shortage but as you would expect from u s dollars they leak out of the country quite rapidly given this is still the global currency and can readily be slipped into socks or underpants before traveling over the border unlike a local soft currency which typically requires capital control vetting before it can be changed into a hard currency but zimbabwe s underlying financial dilemma is two fold not only its inability to pay the 5 6 billion in arrears but whether payment is even appropriate given how badly the lenders performed when putting zimbabwe into debt this was the subject of my phd and a 1998 book uneven zimbabwe a study of finance development and underdevelopment when repaying arrears first emerged as a possibility during the period of joint zanu pf mdc rule from 2009 13 at a time foreign aid inflows soared advocacy groups including the zimbabwe coalition on debt and development and the african forum on debt and development demanded a debt audit a repayment moratorium and indeed full cancellation as reuters reported in 2009 at a time tsvangirai was in a government of national unity with mugabe his minister of state gordon moyo said it would be immoral for zimbabwe to pay off its debts to the imf world bank and afdb when it could not pay teachers again in 2017 when it appeared that one of the world s most notorious corporations amsterdam based trafigura would lend mugabe s regime 1 billion reportedly at usurious interest rates biti complained that will not help much or anything at all in reality the biggest challenges facing zimbabwe cannot and will not be addressed by paying off arrears on which we defaulted almost 20 years ago what really needs to be addressed are structural economic issues de industrialization and unemployment that money could be better used to fund industry revival to create jobs and boost production as well as increase exports and improve liquidity indeed none of the prior arrears repayment efforts worked but not because they were immoral or a waste of money but because the funding always fell through and yet today arrears repayment is the choice and first priority of neoliberal authoritarians damn the consequences where to zimbabwe s progressive forces have mainly been located in trade unions urban civic groups feminist and youth organizations rural social movements and a small but impressive intelligentsia at the time of writing we have heard only sporadic appeals for popular solidarity some of which were answered in once off protests by small solidarity groups against zimbabwe high commission offices in the main south african cities zambia s capital of lusaka and london the lesson is that capitalism cannot be reformed tweaked or improved it is a brutal system which creates inequality and poverty numsa s irvin jim argues for a much more ambitious political agenda there are major lessons to be learned in zimbabwe south africa and all over the globe the removal of mugabe did not solve the crisis which has paralysed the economy just like the removal of jacob zuma did nothing to improve the suffering of the working class in south africa instead conditions worsened and they continue to deteriorate the lesson is that capitalism cannot be reformed tweaked or improved it is a brutal system which creates inequality and poverty as the working class we must unite across borders to destroy it and replace it with a genuine democratic socialist state under the leadership and control of the working class jim is correct insofar as in various ways zimbabwe has served as the world s lead canary in the capitalist crisis coal mine for around three decades a variety of neo colonial strategies were deployed to displace inherited structural problems which include 1970s era overproduction extreme inequality and highly concentrated crony state corporate relations by the early 1990s as assimilation of a few black elites into white capital exhausted the potential for further accumulation within a closed economy washington consensus structural adjustment was introduced what with zimbabwe s small production lines due to the limited middle class base trade liberalization soon deindustrialized what was once africa s most balanced economy then came hyperinflationary reserve bank responses during the 2000s with the second highest price increases in modern human history after post war hungary wiping out a generation of savings and terminating the local currency after the turn to the u s dollar from 2009 the regime more recently tried providing liquidity through a supposedly cashless society with electronic transactions augmented by faux currency bond notes which soon rapidly devalued thus today the crisis is unfolding with one fatal overarching characteristic a lack of hard currency in the system the military men in charge are now a big part of that problem having dominated the lucrative diamond trade with chinese partners followed by close relations with trafigura when illicitly managing the supply of oil but the systematic looting by the military politicians and corporations under conditions of structural underdevelopment has nearly exhausted itself short of displacement of this elite through a revolution which appears a long way off on the horizon given chiwenga s military prowess and the troops continuing loyalty the strategic options for a beleaguered human rights and economic justice network are limited at the least such strategies should bolster the popular critique of any re legitimation of zimbabwe s neoliberal authoritarians such as the process south africa s ruling party is half heartedly attempting but beyond that the zimbabwean masses are way overdue in re gathering the spirit so evident exactly two decades ago at the january 1999 working people s convention held in a distant harare township chitungwiza while the convention s programme itself included social democratic bandaids at that point a new party was mandated to serve poor and working people s interests workers built the mdc throughout 1999 although it was soon thereafter hijacked by middle class elements adopting what its leader tsvangirai termeda spaghetti ideology contrary to the vision of the working people s convention an untouchable ruling elite was formed at cost of the party detaching itself from the mass according to a critique by the zimbabwe national student union in 2011 the mdc a party supposedly a movement for social democracy seems to be under a deadly and toxic siege from a capital centred clique inspired by the ever approaching prospects of economic as well as individual political gains these individuals some of whom have hands which can extend to reach to the party s top leadership clandestinely steered the party into abandoning its founding documents in a rush to reach to the feeding trough with the hitherto enemy nevertheless 1999 was a leap forward consolidating the aching demands of a society that had already suffered nearly a decade of neoliberalism such front building organization is lacking today even if the masses militancy is even higher in the aftermath of the state s recent show of force but unity of the oppressed always lurks as a potential and has more of a chance of re emerging in 2019 than do the efforts of mnangagwa chiwenga ncube have a hope of succeeding with neoliberal authoritarianism if they continue imposing such extreme economic pain expect more political shake ups as zimbabwean capitalism continues to implode this

greyerz questions whether the us has any gold left ahead of global financial collapse and monetary reset as the world edges closer to the next crisis today the man who has become legendary for his predictions on qe and historic moves in currencies told king world news that the us may not have any gold left on the cusp of a global financial collapse and monetary reset the value of the dollar has no guarantee whatsoever february 3 king world news egon von greyerz the value of the dollar has no guarantee whatsoever this statement is of course totally accurate for a country running budget and trade deficits for over half a century with a total debt including unfunded liabilities in the hundreds of trillions of dollars it could have been said today but it actually dates back to august 1971 when the people s daily in china declared the beginning of the end for the monetary system of the capitalist world listen to the greatest egon von greyerz audio interview ever by clicking here or on the image below sponsored egon von greyerz continues this prescient statement certainly has cassandra characteristics cassandra was the princess of troy who was given the gift to make prophecies that were true but no one believed the chinese government already knew 48 years ago that nixon s decision to end the gold backing of the dollar would be the end of the dollar and the western monetary system no one believed their prophecy at the time but they are being proven right starting my working life in a swiss bank in geneva two years before nixon s fatal decision i have direct experience of that fall of the dollar that the chinese predicted in 1970 there were 4 30 swiss francs to the dollar today you get just under one franc for one us that is a catastrophic collapse of 77 of the world s reserve currency in almost 50 years if we look at the graph of the dollar vs the swiss franc below we can see that this currency pair has been in a long consolidation at the bottom since 1987 massive collapse of the us dollar the next leg down in the dollar is not far away and the target over the next few years could be anywhere between 0 40 and 0 00 swiss francs this means a further fall of 60 to 100 could take place making the dollar worthless this confirms voltaire s statement that all currencies eventually reach their intrinsic value of zero we know that this move to zero is virtually guaranteed measured against gold but more surprising is that it could also happen to the swiss currency the swiss banking system and the swiss national bank also have serious problems so eventually the franc is likely to reach almost zero vs gold but the dollar will win that race the people s daily is the most influential and authoritative newspaper in china it has been the official voice of the central government of the people s republic of china for the last 71 years the paper declared in 1971 when nixon closed the gold window these unpopular measures reflect the seriousness of the us economic crisis and the decay and decline of the entire capitalist system the paper further stated that the measures mark the the collapse of capitalist monetary system with the us dollar as its prop and that nixon s new economic policy cannot extricate the us from financial and economic crisis the article predicted that the measures would intensify the crisis nixon declared in 1971 the time has now come for a new economic policy in the united states its targets are unemployment inflation and international speculation and this is how we are going to attack those targets the time has come for decisive action action that will break the vicious circle of spiraling prices and costs the chinese understood in 1971 that nixon s decision would have disastrous consequences contrary to what nixon promised so here we are today with galloping inflation including asset prices collapsing currencies and exploding debts all the things that nixon said he would prevent nixon stated further in his speech we must protect the position of the american dollar as a pillar of monetary stability around the world i am determined that the american dollar must never again be a hostage in the hands of international speculators little did president nixon understand that his decision would have the opposite effect without gold backing the dollar was not in the hands of speculators but instead in the hands of the us government and the federal reserve and that is why the dollar has since 1971 lost 97 against real money which is gold the dollar has also lost 57 of its value vs the dmark euro and 77 vs the swiss franc the wise chinese predicted all of this 48 years ago virtually no one in the west had a clue that nixon s catastrophic decision would be the beginning of the end for the us western economies and currencies alike as well as eventually creating the mother of all bubbles the 1971 article in the people s daily also saw the consequences of the us actions for the rest of the world the policy is meant to fleece the american working people and to shift the worsening of the us financial and monetary as economic crisis onto other countries this is of course what has happened the disastrous us monetary policies has spread like a cancer to most countries in the world with exploding debts falling currencies and massive inflation the united states has forced other countries into accepting the primacy of the dollar and used power politics to maintain its privileged position said the people s daily in 1971 in the meantime the dollar s real value has been undermined by the erosion of us gold reserves brought on by the us imperialist policy of aggression and war is there any us gold left to suspend the convertibility will eventually bring unprecedented destructive blows to the faith in the dollar because this is tantamount to an open admission by the us government to the whole world that the value of the dollar has no guarantee whatsoever there we have it china s ability to analyze the world around them and the weakness of the us and western policies has enabled them to create the second biggest economy in the world or on a purchasing power parity ppp the number one economy in the world china s gdp was 100 billion in 1971 but today it is over 12 trillion or on a ppp basis 23 trillion but this rapid growth has not happened without major risk today china is in a precarious position with total debt having grown from 2 trillion to 40 trillion since the year 2000 as long as china can avoid a disorderly debt collapse and a revolution it is likely to be the number one economy in the world on any measure in coming years but the next few years will be tumultuous for both china the us and the rest of the world as the world economy suffers from the coming economic downturn and collapse markets my views on long term market developments in the next few years have not altered for a very long time we will see a much lower dollar collapsing stock and bond markets and much higher gold and silver prices it won t all happen at once bonds could easily pause their long term uptrend for a while before moving up strongly again short term the dollar looks weak and will soon resume its strong long term downtrend so time to get out of dollars before the dollar falls dramatically and the us implements exchange controls us stocks are now at a decision point by far the most likely outcome is that the downtrend which started in the autumn of 2018 will soon resume in earnest with a big drop the much less likely alternative is a final hurrah to new highs before the collapse other stock markets will follow the same pattern gold and the other precious metals are on the way to new all time highs there are two different paths for gold one which is favored by some market experts is a reset orchestrated by the imf and the world bank leading to a gold backed sdr that would involve gold trading to cease for a limited time after being halted over the weekend when the market opens again gold will be revalued to a much higher level which in us dollar terms could be 5 000 10 000 or higher the other alternative is that market demand and pressures make gold rise very quickly to new all time highs and well beyond in the next few years this would be a disorderly reset since i would have no faith in the first official reset which will be fake and not solve any of the world s problems we are likely to see the second reset in any case at that point the paper gold market will go to zero and the physical gold market to unthinkable heights in either case the last chance of acquiring gold at low prices or at all is now gold is unlikely to wait for a larger number of investors to get in at these prices so now is the time to get on the gold wagon before it is too late but remember that gold is acquired for wealth preservation purposes and not for quick gains thus it must be held in physical form and stored in safe jurisdictions outside of the financial system personally i think confiscation is less likely this time with high taxation of the assets of the wealthy much more likely but if any country would confiscate gold the us has done it recently and could do it again when roosevelt confiscated gold from us citizens in 1933 gold held by americans outside of the us was not confiscated as i have shown recently gold is now as cheap as it was in 1970 or 2000 so today is a unique opportunity to acquire gold at a price that is unlikely to ever be seen again for those who would like to read more of egon von greyerz s fantastic

who could have imagined former vice president dick cheney as the patron saint of today s new progressives as more progressive candidates enter next year s presidential sweepstakes there s an emerging agenda costing tens of trillions of dollars medicare for all free college a guaranteed minimum income a federal jobs guarantee infrastructure investments and green climate change projects at issue is whether such enormous spending is practical and affordable given 1 trillion annual budget deficits and a national debt approaching 22 trillion republican objections citing fiscal responsibility ring hollow and will provoke two questions 1 what about trump s tax cut that increased the deficit by 1 9 trillion over 10 years and 2 don t you remember dick cheney said that ronald reagan proved deficits don t matter there s an effort underway to reframe the fiscal policy debate about whether large growing annual deficits matter and whether our national debt is too big this effort is not accidental the jan 19 economist published a full page article explaining that some economists are rethinking how much governments can borrow these economists note a 40 year real interest rate decline and conclude citing former imf economist olivier blanchard that it s relatively easy to manage the national debt when the average annual growth rate of nominal gdp exceeds the average nominal interest rate on one year u s government debt assuming low interest rates economic growth solves everything the latest issue of the council on foreign relations foreign affairs features an article by two prominent democrat affiliated economists jason furman who ran president obama s council of economic advisers and larry summers president clinton s treasury secretary and head of obama s national economic council their essay who s afraid of budget deficits how washington should end its debt obsession suggests the country prioritize spending on urgent social problems given the ong term structural declines in interest rates while the authors include caveats about creating too much debt too quickly they strongly endorse more spending now low interest rates mean that governments can sustain higher levels of debt cutting deficits now they contend would be far more harmful than adding more debt why are these arguments suddenly appearing now the operating assumption between 2012 and 2016 was that hillary clinton would become president and pursue an income inequality agenda left unfinished by obama many private foundations think tanks and academic economists remember the swooning over thomas piketty s book on 21st century capitalism began laying the groundwork for this new progressive agenda but instead of hillary clinton and policies to divide the national pie we got donald trump s tax cut and deregulation agenda designed to grow the national pie democrats are now lurching leftwards the days of clinton style triangulating or even biden style centrism are over instead the party is embracing a massive pent up spending agenda that can only be funded by large annual deficits that increase an already sizeable national debt some progressives are even embracing what is being called a new modern monetary theory bolstering dick cheney s claim that offers a more sophisticated rationale to legitimize massive new spending previous gop apostasy on deficits and debt makes it difficult to challenge this emerging orthodoxy economists sometimes employ assumptions that don t pan out remember the great recession wall street s financial engineering relied on underlying algorithms that assumed steadily rising home prices the nationwide subprime mortgage crisis resulted when housing prices fell dramatically and the global financial system nearly collapsed the economic models never saw it coming because of mistaken housing price assumptions we ve experienced the second longest economic recovery on record primarily because the federal reserve kept the overnight federal funds interest rate near zero for almost a decade and flooded the world with dollar liquidity through three rounds of quantitative easing markets are now watching closely the fed s promised quantitative tightening designed to reduce gradually its 4 5 trillion balance sheet while slowly raising interest rates the fed s loose monetary policy has impeded real price discovery and say observers like former omb director david stockman created equity and housing asset bubbles furman and summers contend that he economics of deficits have changed and that financial markets give immediate feedback about the seriousness of the budget deficit both claims are wrong economists often argue that this time is different it isn t financial markets and most economists missed the great recession and nations like individuals cannot live beyond their means forever america s domestic and international profligacy has been enabled by the exorbitant privilege of borrowing in u s dollars which remain the world s principal reserve currency many years ago the british pound sterling played a similar role great britain abused that privilege with catastrophic results the u s is no different charles kolb served as deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy in the bush white house from 1990 92 the views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author

market movers ahead in the us the flow of economic data releases begins again after the shutdown with trade data and the ism non manufacturing index keep an eye on fomc speeches for hints on the future pace of the fed s balance sheet reduction brexit negotiations will still be in focus as prime minister theresa may battles for concessions from the eu we do not expect the bank of england to change its policy before november a further pickup in japanese cash earnings will be a key ingredient for the inflation outlook to brighten swedish december industrial production is heading for a drop while norwegian gdp growth should have accelerated in q4 18 danmarks nationalbank s currency reserves data for january will be scrutinised for further fx interventions weekly wrap up the jury is out on the global economy after a dismal end to 2018 the fomc struck a more cautious tone causing usd to weaken and boosting risk sentiment in markets the brexit drama continues relentlessly as pm may heads back to brussels china and the us have laid the groundwork for a trade deal in h1 19 market movers global in the us the flow of economic data releases begins again after postponements due to the shutdown given the recession fears we are looking forward to data again that said we do not have a complete overview of which data we will get one important report is the trade data for november which is due out on wednesday besides official data we also look forward to the ism non manufacturing index due out on tuesday we also have a few fomc speeches next week while the fed has said very explicitly it is on hold for now we will monitor any insights the speeches might give on how the fed will tweak the balance sheet reduction which powell talked about during his press conference see fomc review all we need is just a little patience 30 january no euro area market movers this week in the uk we will monitor whether there is any development in the brexit negotiations or not pm theresa may has won support for her deal if she gets concessions on the backstop the eu27 however has rejected this see brexit monitor may has two and half weeks to renegotiate the backstop 30 january for more details we do not expect the bank of england to change its policy on thursday it is super thursday so we also get an updated inflation report including updated projections it seems likely the growth and inflation paths will be revised down a couple of weeks ago we changed our boe call and now expect the next hike to arrive in november instead of may in terms of economic data releases the pmi services index for january is due out on tuesday which we think will be broadly unchanged around 51 2 in japan we get december cash earnings on friday the bonus season started strongly in november leaving real cash earnings at 0 9 y y the first time it has been above zero since july cash earnings are key for the inflation outlook to brighten and bank of japan governor kuroda has highlighted that the bank will follow wage developments closely in order to spot future tendencies in inflation it will be interesting to see if the tight labour market has caused a further pickup in december there are no market movers next week in china as everyone is off for the week to celebrate the chinese new year and spring festival scandi in denmark the coming week is packed with interesting data starting with nationalbank s currency reserves data for january on monday the central bank offloaded dkk12bn worth of currency in december and the krone was at similarly weaker levels at the beginning of january the market will therefore be keeping an eye on whether the bank continued to intervene we still do not expect any unilateral rate increases in denmark this year partly because we expect the krone to continue to rally in the coming months and partly because nationalbank has ample reserves to burn dkk40 50bn before a rate hike becomes necessary wednesday brings statistics denmark s housing prices for november it will be interesting to see whether apartment prices continue to stagnate or maybe even fall as they have not risen since march 2018 house prices on the other hand have continued to creep up wednesday also brings bankruptcies and repossessions for january while december industrial production follows on thursday rounding off the week on friday are foreign trade figures for december to complete the picture for last year going into 2018 exports had disappointed for some time this was perplexing given that denmark s most important export markets had been performing well exports continued to disappoint at the beginning of the year but began to regain some of their lost form as soon as things began to take a turn for the worse abroad this may seem odd but exports had a lot of ground to make up and a not insubstantial share of danish exports such as pharmaceuticals and wind turbines are not that sensitive to activity levels abroad in sweden there will be the new composite pmi for january next week we would be surprised if it did not fall given weak readings from the eurozone the focus however should be on december private business production and especially on the industrial production component we have seen german eurozone industrial production plunging and sweden should follow with a one month lag the outcome is important in the sense that it will be one of the most important final pieces for q4 gdp monthly data currently suggest that gdp growth has fallen below 1 y y which would be equivalent to a q q print being negative again as in q3 if so from a technical point of view sweden would be in recession that said the word recession is really something which we would use as an expression for a situation when the labour market deteriorates sharply something we do not see at this instance in norway we expect the q4 gdp figures to confirm our assumption that the slowdown in q3 was only temporary despite weak consumption we expect mainland gdp to grow 0 9 q q in q4 driven by increases in oil investment mainland investment government investment and to a degree housing investment all recent news and data including confidence surveys and anecdotal information support our expectation of a relatively strong upswing in industrial production despite the downturn in the global manufacturing climate the investment surveys for both the business and government sectors show considerable infrastructure investments on the way if we are right in our forecast growth will be above trend in an economy already hitting full capacity utilisation it will also be somewhat higher than norges bank projected in the december monetary policy report 0 7 and so would point clearly to a further rate increase in march in other news we expect housing prices to be more or less unchanged in january after the surprise increase in december with a strong supply side keeping prices in check weekly wrap up central banks respond to growth slowdown main macro themes fomc struck a more cautious tone at this week s meeting as widely expected at the meeting the fed did not raise its target range which remains at 2 25 2 50 the fomc now states that it can afford to be patient in raising rates the fed is waiting to see better global data a robust improvement in risk sentiment and higher inflation based on our positive macro outlook for the us and the global economy and hence markets we still expect the fed to hike this year but it is no longer a given that the first would come as early as june which is our current base case the jury is out on the global economy after the dismal end to 2018 in europe q4 gdp numbers at 0 2 q q confirmed a lacklustre growth finish to 2018 and macro data continues to point to a tough start for the euro area economy in 2019 see also research germany the epicentre of the euro area slowdown in china however the official pmi increased slightly to 49 5 notably the export component of the official pmi manufacturing survey rose the level for the pmi still points to weak growth in china in q1 but we see some tentative signs of stabilisation the brexit drama continues relentlessly on tuesday the house of common passed the brady amendment replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements against our expectation pm theresa may needs to go back to the eu27 leaders who may be more willing to listen now that may has found a majority time is short as may has promised another vote in two weeks about a new deal with the eu or if she does not get a new deal about what to do next uncertainty remains high but overall yesterday s vote supports our base case that may s deal or something very similar will pass eventually 40 chance for more details see brexit monitor may has two and half weeks to renegotiate the backstop china and the us carried out high level trade discussions a high level delegation from china visited washington to lay the groundwork for a deal ahead of the 90 day deadline at end february signals from the discussions were positive but difficult structural issues need to be tackled such as protection of intellectual property rights forced technology transfer and non tariff barriers as well as enforcement of the deal our base case remains that the two sides will agree on a trade deal assigning a probability of 75 on a trade deal by the end of q2 financial market developments in fx markets the usd weakened on the back of the softer fed messages with jumping above the 1 15 mark in our view the more fed on hold signal for now is important to the fx market as this means that usd carry momentum is fading however in order to see a sustained move higher from the recent range around 1 15 we believe the euro zone cyclical outlook has to improve and this is not likely until late h1 furthermore the british pound came under pressure amid renewed uncertainty about the final outcome of the brexit discussions more broadly risk sentiment was boosted by the dovish signals from the fed with us equity markets now out of correction territory at the same time us yields declined while euro yields increased given the stronger global risk sentiment scandi update denmark businesses still downbeat statistics denmark published business confidence data for january during the week manufacturing sentiment fell sharply in december and remained pessimistic in january this mirrors the pattern we are seeing elsewhere in the world at the moment with the chinese slowdown problems in the german motor industry and uncertainty about trade wars and brexit pulling confidence down danish manufacturers have long been reporting growing labour shortages but this changed abruptly at the beginning of 2019 with the share of firms reporting labour shortages falling from 13 to 8 meanwhile the week s jobless figures showed a modest decrease of 700 people in december unemployment has thus fallen for nine consecutive months together with a downward revision to the november figures this means that the unemployment rate the number of people out of work relative to the labour force fell from 3 9 to 3 8 in both november and december its lowest level since february 2009 sweden another batch of weak data the december trade balance went clearly into the red again showing a deficit of sek4 7bn it seems weakening european manufacturing is gradually eating into swedish exports growth on the financial side household lending slowed further in december printing 5 5 y y this is the weakest growth seen in five years the nier in january however was perhaps the most surprising as there was a widespread decline in confidence most worrying in this survey was that private services confidence dropped well below the normal 100 level this is worrying in the sense that private services is really the bulk of swedish business and the sector that besides the public sectors has been the main driver of employment growth norway spending hit by high power prices retail sales fell 1 8 m m in december which is much worse than expected the decrease is partly to do with the strong november figures and statistics norway s problems with seasonal adjustment around the black friday phenomenon with christmas trading increasingly being brought forward to november however there was also an underlying deterioration in private consumption towards the end of the year with consumption of goods falling 0 3 q q in q4 we put much of this down to high power prices undermining real wages purchasing power via higher inflation going by forward power prices real wages should begin to rise relatively quickly from april may boosted by stronger wage growth therefore we anticipate a substantial increase in spending in h2 this year and we do not expect developments in private consumption to prevent interest rates from being raised in either march or september latest research from danske bank 1 2 us china trade a deal in sight look out for xi trump meeting s the top

depending on the content of the commissioner s report we should see continued short selling pressure in the australian banking sector banks have already prepared for increased litigation costs but if the asic begins to levy hefty fines in response to the report long shareholders may become sellers as well there is ample borrow supply in these names and borrow costs are at general collateral levels so there are no financing impediments to short stock institutional short investors have already positioned themselves in anticipation of sector wide price weakness and if these stocks continue to trend downwards we can also expect momentum shorts to enter the sector as well monday may be a busy day in the australian market investors also will be positioning for a busy week of reserve bank activity with a policy meeting tomorrow a wednesday speech by the governor and friday s updated forecasts in the bank s statement on monetary policy developments over the past few months have generally been unfavourable to the rba s outlook wrote nab economist kaixin owyong in a week ahead note since its november forecast update we have seen another weak quarter of consumer spending further falls in housing markets and signs of slowing growth abroad there s little new that s been an offset although at face value growth and unemployment remain at healthy levels ms owyong said he key question is will the rba shift towards a clearer medium term neutral policy stance rather than its current view that the next move when it comes will be up over the past quarter it s become harder for the rba to maintain its confidence that the next move will be up markets have already priced in over a 1 3 chance of a rate cut by the end of 2019 as well as housing and the macro economy here and

economist at cibc this is really the story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 were living at home with their parents that s as many as 3 5 million canadians

for the purchase from their parents the education system basically failed them the only thing that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed

it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at

good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this

collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this

their education that has led to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is

which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary

coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per

afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true

the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate

amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24

economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is taking things in stride i ve seen a fair amount of challenges our generation may seem to think that we go through more but i think that every generation goes through some kind of hardships when it comes to finance or jobs it doesn t make things worthwhile if they re just handed to you it s

without a currency board venezuela s opposition will fail venezuela s currency the bolivar has tanked just take a look at the ugly chart below steve h hanke thanks to the collapse of the bolivar venezuela has earned the dreadful distinction of being the world s only country that is experiencing hyperinflation today its annual inflation rate is 121 583 yr see the accompanying chart by hyperinflation standards that s a relatively mild rate putting venezuela at the 23rd rank out of the world s 58 episodes of hyperinflation what makes venezuela s hyperinflation so brutal is that it has lasted for 27 months only four of the 58 episodes recorded in history have lasted longer prof steve h hanke so it s clear what venezuela s big problem is hyperinflation the first order of business for any new government in venezuela is to slay the hyperinflation dragon this can be done within 24 hours with the introduction of a currency board a currency board issues notes and coins convertible on demand into a foreign anchor currency at a fixed rate of exchange as reserves it holds low risk interest bearing bonds denominated in the anchor currency the reserve levels both floors and ceilings are set by law and are equal to 100 or slightly more of its monetary liabilities so the domestic currency issued via a currency board is nothing more than a clone of its anchor currency a currency board generates profits seigniorage from the difference between the interest it earns on its reserve assets and the expense of maintaining its liabilities by design a currency board unlike a central bank has no discretionary monetary powers and cannot engage in the fiduciary issue of money it has an exchange rate policy the exchange rate is fixed but no monetary policy a currency board s operations are passive and automatic the sole function of a currency board is to exchange the domestic currency it issues for an anchor currency at a fixed rate consequently the quantity of domestic currency in circulation is determined solely by market forces namely the demand for domestic currency a currency board cannot issue credit accordingly a currency board imposes a hard budget constraint and discipline on the government this is an underappreciated feature of currency boards unlike central banks a currency board can t be used as a means to finance government budgets currency boards have existed in about 70 countries and none have failed the first one was installed in the british indian ocean colony of mauritius in 1849 by the 1930s currency boards were widespread among the british colonies in africa asia the caribbean and the pacific islands they have also existed in a number of independent countries and city states such as danzig and singapore one of the more interesting currency boards was installed in north russia on november 11 1918 during the civil war its architect was none other than john maynard keynes who was a british treasury official at the time countries that have employed currency boards have delivered lower inflation rates smaller fiscal deficits lower debt levels relative to the gross domestic product fewer banking crises and higher real growth rates than comparable countries that have employed central banks to smash inflation and establish stability a currency board for venezuela would do the trick indeed that s why i proposed a currency board to venezuela s president rafael caldera when i was his adviser from 1995 96 the details of what i proposed then and now are contained in a book i co authored with kurt schuler juntas monetarias para países en desarrollo dinero inflación y estabilidad económica which was published in a second edition in 2015 by cedice in caracas before proceeding it is important to mention argentina s bout of hyperinflation that peaked in july 1989 particularly since the currency reform that crushed argentina s inflation is universally mischaracterized and misunderstood to put an end to hyperinflation president carlos menem with his right hand man minister of economy domingo cavallo established a new currency regime on april 1 1991 they dubbed it a convertibility system an uncommon term for an unusual system while convertibility gave the superficial appearance of being a currency board it was not a currency board most economists never understood that the convertibility system was not a currency board system like currency board arrangements the convertibility system maintained a fixed exchange rate between the peso and its anchor currency the u s dollar that nominal anchor crushed hyperinflation and prevented inflation from rearing its ugly head indeed the consumer price index at the end of 2001 was about where it was in 1994 by smashing inflation convertibility gave menem the credibility he desperately needed to carry out economic reforms the convertibility system was not trouble free however its deviations from currency board orthodoxy allowed it to behave more like a central bank than a true currency board these deviations were significant and prompted me to pen an op ed argentina should abolish its central bank it was published in the wall street journal on october 25 1991 as i wrote then to lock in the menem cavallo achievements and permanently remove skepticism from the argentine monetary scene argentina should abolish its central bank and replace it with a currency board alas the convertibility system after killing a hyperinflation and ushering in a decade long economic boom met its waterloo in 2001 just as i had anticipated in my 1991 wall street journal piece the banco central de la república argentina bcra used convertibility s deviations from currency board orthodoxy to engage in discretionary monetary policies in the end the bcra did just what it had always done it made a mess out of monetary policy and created a currency crisis i know that currency boards work from among other things a great deal of personal experience in stopping hyperinflations stopping them with the introduction of currency boards one such case was in bulgaria when i served as president petar stoyanov s adviser from 1997 2002 after bulgaria took the exit from communism in 1990 bulgarians encountered some potholes the economy plunged there were debt defaults and that balkan paradise experienced an episode of hyperinflation this episode peaked at an astounding 242 per month in february 1997 yes that s per month with the expectation that a currency board would be the best system to crush bulgaria s hyperinflation i wrote a book with kurt schuler that was translated into bulgarian in late 1996 it reached the top of the best seller list in sofia in january 1997 i became president stoyanov s adviser my primary tasks were to draft a currency board law for bulgaria and to explain to bulgarian politicians and the public how such a system would halt the episode of hyperinflation things moved rapidly there s nothing like a crisis to move the ball down the field the currency board was installed on july 1 1997 and inflation and interest rates plunged immediately i can recall the genuine pleasure perhaps relief too that president stoyanov displayed when he congratulated me on the outstanding results produced during the first few weeks of the currency board it was then that he confessed his hope that the currency board would kill inflation but that he had reservations and he was amazed when it worked even more rapidly than i had predicted much later president stoyanov confided that without the stability created by the currency board system bulgaria would have had much more difficulty entering the north atlantic treaty organization nato in 2004 and the european union in 2007 today venezuela should do exactly what bulgaria did in 1997 a currency board would make the bolivar sound a clone of the u s dollar the world s most important currency with that inflation would be smashed within 24 hours and stability established and while stability might not be everything everything is nothing without stability the political forces behind the introduction of a currency board would be seen as credible in the eyes of venezuelans by amassing a huge stock of political capital for slaying the hyperinflation dragon the politicians who introduce the currency board would be able to then begin to clean up venezuela s other messes but if the politicians fail to kill inflation first there will be no successful reforms that s why a currency board is a vital first step for venezuela by steve h hanke www cato org

in advanced countries public debt is at levels not seen since the second world war emerging market public debt has levels last seen during the 1980s debt crisis the imf said and billionaire investor seth klarman warned that debt markets might refuse loans or demand penal interest rates before long but things are about to change and growing awareness of this fact meant that davos man was a more worried man this year as the world s wealthiest tried to drown their fears in champagne at the swiss resort the spectre of an impending debt crisis was invoked far more frequently than in past years both have been masked by the high profile threat of trade and economic wars between the world s two biggest economies the united states and china for all the hundreds or even thousands of headlines that trade wars have grabbed the qe and debt traps have been lucky to get even a handful forget about china s so called debt trap diplomacy it s a mere mousetrap compared to the jaws of two more vicious traps that are waiting to close on the global economy one is the generalised public and private sector debt trap and the other is the more insidious qe quantitative easing trap the debt and qe traps are intimately connected waves of quantitative monetary easing in the us japan and europe may have saved the world from systemic financial collapse and economic depression after 2008 but the historically low interest rates they engendered has led to universal over borrowing quantitative easing may have saved europe from financial collapse but for how long photo reuters there was no master plan to deal with this problem policymakers were too panicked as us and other mega banks lurched on the brink of collapse and the engines of the global economy began to flame out they flew on a wing and prayer hoping that growth or even inflation would somehow take care of things it hasn t and now the lack of an exit strategy from unconventional monetary policy or monetary excess is catching up with the world the fed has tried exiting by stealth but has been forced to back track as wall street slumped while japan is so far sunk in qe as to have no obvious way out meanwhile the vice is tightening various warnings have been sounded but none clearer than by moody s investors service which suggests that global credit conditions will weaken and risks rise this year as economic growth slows funding costs rise liquidity tightens and market volatility returns japan is so far sunk in quantitative easing that there is no obvious way out photo epa just why so many economists and policymakers have been so complacent and for so long about the consequences of monetary easing remains something of a mystery it was never really clear how the trillions of dollars injected into banking systems under qe were supposed to be mopped up without ensuing trauma the qe largesse didn t go into investment and consumption but it did prop up financial institutions that were swaying on the edge of the abyss and it found its way into financial and property assets to an extent that sent their prices soaring creating a wealth effect in the process such asset bubbles are not good news because they create vulnerability to major price corrections as well as increasing wealth inequalities via stock and other asset prices this is the real reason the us federal reserve has been raising rates incrementally rather than any fears over rising inflation federal reserve chairman jerome powell has said that the fed will be patient with further rate increases photo reuters however the world biggest economy is now well and truly stuck in the qe trap and jerome powell s latest promise that the fed will be patient with further rate hikes and flexible with the pace of balance sheet normalisation shows just how scared he is about tightening the trap any further the qe largesse didn t go into investment and consumption but it did prop up financial institutions that were swaying on the edge of the abyss if that sounds like good news it isn t it means the us economy is flying on one engine monetary accommodation having shut down the other one trade expansion president trump will now be forced to turn to fiscal expansion as the economy slows and the fed will be forced to supply more treasury funds japan s huge qe by far the biggest relative to gdp than that of the us or europe is meanwhile being exposed for what it really is an exercise in restraining the value of the yen and keeping the japanese government well supplied with funds to prop up the world s third biggest economy china s economy doesn t face a qe trap as such but it definitely is in a debt trap like the fed which was hoping that no one will notice while it tightens by stealth chinese monetary authorities are being forced to go easy on debt discipline in a slowing economy putting off today s problem until tomorrow all this might appear to be reducing the threat of a debt crisis but again it isn t really to quote moody s funding costs are increasing for corporates and liquidity is weakening for high yield companies in particular while earnings growth will be moderate amid slowing economic growth chinese monetary authorities are being forced to go easy on debt discipline because of a slowing economy photo epa the qe bluff has been called and financial markets know now that they can force monetary authorities to extend or increase stimulus simply by throwing a taper tantrum but this knowledge is no substitute for a safe and sound economy and financial markets also know now that there is no real safety net beneath them this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as beware the two new traps lying ahead for the global economy
the u s dollar rebounded against all of the major currencies on friday on the back stronger economic data nonfarm payrolls rose more than 300k manufacturing activity accelerated and the university of michigan sentiment index was revised slightly higher for the month of january stocks extended their rise pushing usd jpy back above 109 more than 300k jobs were created last month which was significantly better than the 165k forecast and matched december s 300k rise not only does this report tell us that the government shutdown had limited impact on the labor market but after revisions job gains averaged 241k over the past 3 months however even though the labor market is on fire wage growth is slowing and there s a very good chance of downward revisions next month more importantly the change in the federal reserve s monetary policy statement is significant enough to keep the us dollar under pressure so don t trust the rally a lot of the fed s concerns stem from events like brexit funding for the us government and us china trade issues that could be resolved over the next few months despite the latest economic reports the economy is still slowing but if congress passes a permanent spending increase the uk reaches a withdrawal agreement with the eu and the us forgoes further tariffs on china 2 rate hikes this year could still be justified with that in mind any one of these discussions could go south sending the markets into turmoil press conferences after every meeting this year gives the fed the flexibility to change policy as needed and so far domestic and global uncertainty justifies the need for patience there s not much in the way of us data so the dollar could resume its slide the biggest loser was sterling which extended its slide on the back of weaker manufacturing activity the pmi index dropped to 52 8 from 54 2 and there s been no new brexit developments theresa may refuses to rule out a no deal brexit and has not requested to extend article 50 euro on the other hand remains under pressure as weaker economic data prevents the currency from breaking 1 15 it did so briefly after the fomc rate decision but inflation is falling according to the latest german cpi report retail sales in germany fell by the largest amount in 11 years and confidence is down across the region ecb president draghi feels that the risks have moved to the downside and last week ecb member weidmann said growth in 2019 could be well below 1 5 and inflation could be noticeably lower he expects bad news from the economy to continue for a while as uncertainty remains high there are potential downside surprises to all of next week s economic reports from eurozone ppi to retail sales and gdp us dollar weakness is the only reason why eurusd rallied over the past week and the lack of us data in the week ahead makes 1 15 a difficult resistance level to break the recovery in the greenback curtailed the rally in aud and nzd despite stronger australian manufacturing pmi next week is a big one for australia with retail sales trade balance services pmi and a reserve bank of australia monetary policy announcement on the calendar the rba is not expected to change interest rates but they ve made it clear that the next move in rates will be higher the new zealand dollar was pressured by softer consumer confidence the canadian dollar on the other hand was one of the few currencies to extend its gains versus the greenback and that is mostly due to the continued recovery in oil prices

when rep alexandria ocasio cortez said on 60 minutes that she would favor raising the highest marginal tax rate on the nation s wealthiest taxpayers to 70 percent roughly doubling what it is now the idea was cast as radical it is not looking at the actual post world war ii trend lines it is no where near radical enough the sobering reality is that it will take a lot more to undue the massive damage done to the federal balance sheet and the average american household by a corrupt national government that is controlled by the rich for decades the federal government has cut taxes on the wealthiest americans and corporations while spending and borrowing so profligately it should be chargeable as a criminal act while the corporate news media fixates on the trump clown car demolition derby over his absurd 5 7 billion border wall we are automatically adding 5 billion a day to our 22 trillion debt pyramid make no mistake this has been built by the wealthy for the wealthy who have co opted both political parties to do their bidding to get a sense of the lost opportunity cost associated with blowing 5 billion a day on adding to the national debt consider that we are in the midst of a devastating national opioid crisis and spike in suicides that the federal government spends 4 1 billion annually to address now we are on the verge of spending more on servicing this debt than the current 700 billion we spend on our military each year for decades we have been cutting taxes on the highest earners and replacing that revenue with debt for which the entire nation is on the hook put more simply we have subsidized the the bezos bloomberg and schultz mega fortunes by keeping their federal taxes at historic lows while shifting the cost of the government into the future by unprecedented borrowing that casts a dark cloud over the nation s future and watch as that same axis of avarice will make the case that the only way to restore the nation s credit worthiness will be to reduce the size and scope of the social contract we have in social security medicare and medicaid this will be hailed by so called moderates as courageous because it requires everyone to sacrifice something what is entirely ignored is the direct correlation between the explosion of wealth inequality and income disparity and the way the white house and congress managed the federal government s balance sheet since around the time of the assassination of john f kennedy which party was in charge did not matter throughout the 1950s and the eisenhower years the marginal tax rate for the highest income earners was at 90 percent it was during this period that the country paid down the debt racked up fighting germany and japan followed by rebuilding both that was a heavy lift by 1946 the u s had amassed 271 billion in debt so that the national debt to gross domestic product the value of everything produced by the economy was a whopping 119 percent the national debt to gross domestic product ratio is like pairing what you borrowed in a year with what you earned throughout the 1950s that national debt to gross domestic product ratio averaged 68 percent even as the federal government continued to tax the highest earners at 90 percent that period also saw the expansion of the middle class as the share of the national income continued to shift from the tippy top downward to the working class which was also more likely to be unionized than they are today throughout the 1960s that unprecedented middle class driven economic expansion continued as the national debt ratio to gdp dropped to 44 percent and washington dropped the top tax rate to 80 percent but the 1963 to 1964 period was a key inflection point with the top tax rate dropping from that radical eisenhower 91 percent rate to just 77 percent in just one year my how the uber wealthy must have been relieved and yet it was set to become oh so much better by the 1980s and the so called reagan revolution that top tax rate dropped to 45 percent by the 1990s it dropped even further to 36 percent and federal debt ratio to the gdp spiked to over 60 percent in the last decade we are now averaging close to a 99 percent debt to gdp ratio with a spike to 108 percent this year things really got out of whack when during president obama s tenure we kept fighting the pricey global war on terror the federal government bailed out wall street banks and detroit leaving main street america to twist in the wind americans lost 20 trillion in household wealth lost that had taken generations to accumulate several million american families lost their homes this took the heaviest toll on african american and latino households where did it go right to the top in the 21st century gilded age the ethos is not to those that much is given much is expected but rather to those with the most even more must be given exhibit a donald trump speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell 1 5 trillion tax cut con that was sold as a jolt to send the alleged recovery into high gear yet what empirical economic data has now shown is that the windfall went to eye popping ceo bonuses and stock buybacks while sending government debt ever higher into the stratosphere so now that we have tracked the historic building of this us debt pyramid scheme lets step back and behold its towering dimensions according to inequality org in 1982 the poorest american listed on the first annual forbes magazine list of america s richest 400 had a net worth of 80 million the average member of that first list had a net worth of 230 million scroll forward to 2016 and rich americans needed a net worth of 1 7 billion to enter the forbes 400 and the average member held a net 6 0 billion over 10 times the 1982 average after adjusting for inflation meanwhile down here on earth from where we can t see the top of the bezos bloomberg schultz wealth pyramid close to 80 percent of americans live paycheck to paycheck this reality is the real take away from the federal government shutdown that blew up the household finances of 800 000 american families that was just a kind of mean spirited bloodsport donald trump engineered for his own twisted amusement no i would say 70 percent for the highest marginal tax rate is too low in light of our track record for the last 70 years call me an eisenhower radical i am holding out for 90 percent

percent debt to gdp ratio with a spike to 108 percent this year things really got out of whack when during president obama s tenure we kept fighting the pricey global war on terror the federal government bailed out wall street banks and detroit leaving main street america to twist in the wind americans lost 20 trillion in household lost that had taken generations to accumulate several million american families lost their homes this took the heaviest toll on african american and latino households where did it go right to the top in the 21st century gilded age the ethos is not to those that much is given much is expected but rather to those with the most even more must be given exhibit a donald trump speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell 1 5 trillion tax cut con that was sold as a jolt to send the alleged recovery into high gear yet what empirical economic data has now shown is that the windfall went to eye popping ceo bonuses and stock buybacks while sending government debt ever higher into the stratosphere so now that we have tracked the historic building of this us debt pyramid scheme lets step back and behold its towering dimensions according to inequality org in 1982 the poorest american listed on the first annual forbes magazine list of america s richest 400 had a net worth of 80 million the average member of that first list had a net worth of 230 million scroll forward to 2016 and rich americans needed a net worth of 1 7 billion to enter the forbes 400 and the average member held a net 6 0 billion over 10 times the 1982 average after adjusting for inflation meanwhile down here on earth from where we can t see the top of the bezos bloomberg schultz wealth pyramid close to 80 percent of americans live paycheck to paycheck this reality is the real take away from the federal government shutdown that blew up the household finances of 800 000 american families that was just a kind of mean spirited blood sport donald trump engineered for his own twisted amusement no i would say 70 percent for the highest marginal tax rate is too low in light of our track record for the last 70 years call me an eisenhower radical i am holding out for 90 percent
could it be emerging markets day it may well prove to be an inflection point the moment in time when the perfect alchemy of underlying forces propels an em rebound in 2019 there s little question 2018 was ugly tightening u s monetary conditions a strengthening u s dollar and escalating global trade tensions made for a turbulent year by the final tally the msci emerging markets index representing 24 countries was off 6 5 per cent a disappointing performance to be sure yet less than losses on both european and canadian indexes which fell 6 6 per cent and 9 per cent respectively by the fourth quarter em s rout gave way to a turnaround of sorts at least relative to other indexes which got hammered as anxieties peaked late last year here are the key tailwinds that are poised to fill the sails of emerging markets in 2019 strong u s dollar now weakening higher u s bond yields drove the dollar up in 2018 creating a difficult backdrop for em countries that also saw a broad weakening in their own currencies because many em countries borrow in u s dollars their debt became more expensive and those countries with higher current account deficits fared even worse meanwhile oil prices spiked 27 per cent in the first nine months before falling dramatically hitting net importers of oil such as india indonesia and the philippines hard a double whammy when combined with the stronger greenback as we look to 2019 a markedly different picture is developing first as u s economic growth slows combined with a u s federal reserve that is tempering its rate hiking cycle the u s currency is poised to weaken providing the much needed firepower for em economies in fact history shows there is an inverse relationship between the u s dollar and em equity performance in periods of u s currency weakness the average return on the msci emerging market index has been 22 per cent over the past 20 years growth differential swinging in favour of em while em markets are characterized by rapid growth and development gauging how asset classes will perform is tied to whether growth is improving relative to developed markets in other words the growth differential is the difference in growth rates between emerging markets and developed markets in 2018 u s gdp peaked in the second quarter at 4 2 per cent and jpm research estimates it will fall to 1 5 per cent by the fourth quarter of this year a significant deceleration looking ahead the growth differential is also likely to gain momentum in favour of em by as much as 3 4 per cent setting the stage for a strong em market performance easing trade tensions trade frictions between the united states and china created significant uncertainty and volatility in global markets in 2018 and em weren t immune since china accounts for a whopping one third of em s index however news that officials have returned to the bargaining table has boosted market sentiment raising hopes that a deal will be brokered this year reaching an agreement will ultimately come down to how amenable china will be to u s demands on sticking points such as technology transfer intellectual property issues as well as compliance and verification meanwhile while there have been concerns about slowing growth rates in china stimulative measures such as significant tax cuts introduced in the fourth quarter of 2018 will begin to show up in the second quarter of this year the longer term play longer term there are reasons for optimism too many em countries have vibrant domestic economies driven by a growing middle class especially in asia pacific countries em economies are also leading developed market economies in terms of productivity rates in fact productivity in em is improving at double the rate of dm in other words while many of the macroeconomic influences that sideswiped emerging markets in 2018 are lifting and shifting course as we head into 2019 there are reasons to be bullish over the longer term canadian investors who are underexposed to em would be wise to look at the sector as a long term play regina chi is vice president and portfolio manager at agf investments inc the views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of agf its subsidiaries or any of its affiliated companies funds or investment strategies
oil prices are on track for strong gains this week and the price increases are not only the result of the crisis in venezuela the oil market received a boost from the us federal reserve this week which signaled on wednesday that it would essentially suspend its plans to hike interest rates this year fed chairman jerome powell said that economic growth remained solid but that the central bank had the luxury of patience when deciding on further rate hikes that is a big change from prior guidance in which the fed very clearly outlined multiple rate increases in 2019 the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat powell said slowing growth in china and europe a weakening housing market tepid inflation these are not exactly the ingredients that call for aggressive rate tightening the announcement contributed to strong gains for oil prices on wednesday and thursday at the time of this writing wti was trading in the mid 50s with brent above 62 per barrel both close to two month highs read more russia vows to defend its venezuelan oil assets a more dovish position from the fed boosts the bullish case for oil in two ways first lower than expected interest rates will provide a jolt to the economy stock markets rose on the news but second a softer rate outlook also undercuts the us dollar a bit a weaker dollar stokes crude oil demand in the rest of the world and historically the dollar has had an inverse relationship with oil prices meanwhile the oil market received a more direct boost this week on news that saudi arabia slashed shipments to the united states the us has the most transparent and up to date data on the oil market which include weekly releases on production levels imports and exports and inventories that kind of visibility is not readily available in most places around the world as a result saudi arabia appears to be deliberately targeting that data by reducing shipments to the us specifically riyadh can help create the appearance of a tightening oil market saudi shipments to the us dropped by 528 000 bpd last week to just 442 000 bpd the lowest weekly total in more than two years also on rt com oil markets could see deficit in 2019 more to the point opec s production declined by 890 000 bpd in january according to a reuters survey the largest monthly decline since early 2017 the month that the first round of opec production cuts took effect iraq produced above its production ceiling but aside from that the cartel is well on its way to implementing the production curbs in fact there is suddenly a remarkable confluence of events pushing oil in a bullish direction first and foremost are the opec production cuts of 1 2 mb d that are phasing in but beyond that us shale is starting to slowdown and while output is still expected to grow this year the increase could be the smallest in years then there are the supply outages libya lost some output unexpectedly in december with some of its production still offline iran sanctions waivers are set to expire in may and the us hopes to further cut into iranian oil exports the new sanctions on venezuela threaten to create yet another major source of supply outages in fact when considering that opec is determined to keep 1 2 mb d of supply off of the market and painful us sanctions on venezuela and iran threaten to shut in even more output it s pretty amazing that brent crude is only trading at 62 per barrel the fed backing off interest rate hikes is the cherry on top traders and investors are starting to wake up to this bullish sentiment the market is more convinced that there will be aggressive production cuts and the macro picture has improved a bit that s positive for prices going forward jean louis le mee ceo of london based oil hedge fund westbeck capital told the wall street journal another investor echoed that sentiment in comments to the wsj the saudis are sincere about higher oil prices they need to balance their budget the opec cuts will lower stocks so i m pretty bullish said mark gordon portfolio manager at the ascent oil fund oil prices are back up to where they were in november and significant outages from venezuela in the short run could pave the way for more price increases this article was originally published on oilprice com
to guide its work the wb classifies countries into low income lower middle income upper middle income and higher income this started in 1962 in that year it placed the philippines at the lower middle income class with an estimated 220 in per capita gross national income computed using the atlas method we have not moved up since then in 2000 or before arroyo took power our per capita gni went up to 1 220 this was still within the lower middle income level which was set by the wb at 746 to 2 975 in per capita gni in that year ten years later in 2010 with arroyo at the helm our per capita gni more than doubled to 2 480 but this was still within the lower income range of 1 006 to p3 975 in per capita gni in that year at that time arroyo thought of making the country part of the developed world last september socioeconomic planning secretary ernesto pernia asserted that the philippines was poised to climb to upper middle income is this doable the latest available data from the wb placed the per capita gni of the lower middle income class in 2017 at 996 p3 895 down from 1 006 3 995 in 2016 and 1026 4 035 in 2015 there are no figures yet for 2018 as the wb is still getting the complete gni data from all the countries covered in the ranking none also for 2019 but for the moment we can use the 2017 figures for our present purpose of analyzing whether moving up to upper middle income is possible for the philippines this year sufficed it to say that the income range within each of the four income classes may move up or down in any year depending on the changes in the exchange rates and inflation rates of the different countries in the world used in the atlas method the wb uses the atlas method to compute the per capita gdi at current us dollar value for income class classification purposes the atlas method reduces the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in the cross country comparison of national incomes it uses a conversion factor which is the average of a country s exchange rate for that year and its exchange rates for the two preceding years adjusted for the differences between the rate of inflation in the country and that in china japan the united kingdom the united states and the euro area a country s inflation rate is measured by the change in its gdp deflator last year the philippine per capita gni increased by 8 2 percent at current price our 2018 per capita gni was valued at p195 198 at current price assuming the same growth rate as last year our per capita gni will amount to p211 204 this year the actual 2018 and projected 2019 philippine per capita gni at current price assuming the latter is realized are what the wb will used to convert into the philippine per capita gni at current us dollars using the atlas method in 2017 our per capita gni at current price amounted to 3 660 when converted using the atlas method to graduate to upper middle income class we have to push our per capita gni beyond 3 896 which is upper limit of the lower middle income class with price level more elevated last year and the peso also very much depreciated we may end up still short of the required mark nevertheless if the inflation rate is lower this year and the peso gets stronger we may still end up actually joining the upper middle class thanks of course to the previous administration which move faster the economy annually in six years than the one before it in ten years in 2000 our per capita gni in current us dollars was estimated at 1 220 using the atlas method this went up to 2 470 in 2010 under arroyo or by 7 3 percent annually in ten years by 2016 under aquino this went up to 3 580 or by 7 7 percent annually in six years the question remains however will this year s philippine gni be higher or lower than last year will inflation be benign and the peso strong if not then we may still have to wait another year or two to become middle income class your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up

mark stevenson associated press mexico city ap a mass strike at 48 maquiladora or manufacturer plants in mexico s border city of matamoros is heading for victory bringing pay raises for laborers who make less than 1 an hour or about 100 pesos a day assembling auto components and tv sets for export to the united states and causing jitters for the business community the labor battle broke out in mid january after president andres manuel lopez obrador decreed a doubling of the minimum wage in mexico s border zones apparently unaware that some union contracts at the maquiladora plants are indexed to minimum wage increases the decree sparked a wave of walkouts involving about 25 000 workers the maquiladoras claim the strikes threaten the very existence of their industry which has attracted over 5 000 mostly foreign owned plants and 2 million jobs by paying very low wages union leaders say those worries are overblown noting that workers at the border plants still earn far less than their counterparts in the united states less than a week after the strike broke out a majority of the export plants in matamoros 29 companies with a total of about 34 factories have agreed to the union demands a rare victory that owes a lot to something the president probably didn t intend to happen after taking office dec 1 lopez obrador doubled the minimum wage in communities along the u s border to 176 20 pesos a day the equivalent of 9 28 at current exchange rates with maquiladora pay averaging about 146 pesos 7 70 a day the matamoros workers went on strike to demand the 20 percent raise be applied to everybody even those making above the minimum and a one time bonus of about 1 685 more mexican president amlo launches plan to stimulate border economy during jua rez visit perhaps he didn t take into account what was in the labor contracts said javier zuniga an activist with the miners union who has helped coordinate the strike the president acted in good faith but he didn t measure the impact that was going to have on union contracts and the workers came out winners for once since the 1990s many companies in matamoros which is across the border from brownsville texas signed contracts indexed to minimum wage hikes it was a way to keep wages down given that in most previous years annual increases were about equal to the inflation rate one such contract signed in march 2018 at the kongsberg interior systems plant which makes automotive cables stipulates that the company will reach an agreement with the union to increase wages by the same percent that minimum wages are increased in addition many companies annual bonuses are calculated by multiplying minimum wage increases by 365 a figure that in past years usually amounted to only about 100 they the government never thought there was a real union or that there were contract clauses like that said cirila quintero a sociology professor at colegio de la frontera norte who has studied the matamoros union that has represented maquiladora workers for more than a quarter century the industrial workers and laborers union of matamoros which was founded initially in 1932 to represent cotton workers is unusual in mexico because it has won gains for its members that don t exist in contracts anywhere else in the country far more common are pro company ghost unions that sign contracts without consulting the workers they purportedly represent lopez obrador has been wary of antagonizing the business sector and he appears to be an unwilling hero in opening the floodgates of labor discontent both quintero and luis aguirre the head of mexico s association of maquiladora companies said federal officials actively discouraged the matamoros union from seeking the pay increases the labor department refused to confirm that saying only that it sent mediators to matamoros to try to defuse the dispute aguirre also claims federal officials agree that the union s interpretation of the contract clauses is erroneous but he says the federal government has been unwilling to act this will give rise to unemployment and cause at least 15 of these companies to flee aguirre warned his group the maquiladora and export manufacturers industry said in a statement that the wage demands may spread to other areas along the border where the industry is present and will project a very bad image for foreign direct investment still most of the matamoros companies have quietly agreed to the workers demands and they would be hard pressed to find any place near the u s market where they could pay less than 1 an hour other mexican border cities with assembly plants like tijuana and ciudad juarez don t have this point in their contracts quintero noted but what is going to happen is that workers are going to demand their raises to 176 pesos the new minimum and probably across the board he said more nafta deal means business as usual on the border el paso leaders say trump era has maquiladora suppliers worried lopez obrador has come under pressure from the business sector to rein in wage demands but he is unlikely to do so the only thing he has promised mexico s labor movement is to guarantee union freedom and stay out of unions internal affairs for workers that is a big step forward in a country where the labor movement has been smothered for decades by old guard union bosses and pro company protection contracts often signed before factories even open lopez obrador also has shown a certain fondness for militant union bosses like mine workers head napoleon gomez urrutia and the head of the electrical workers union martin esparza even though both have been accused of questionable financial deals and of holding more protests than negotiations but zuniga brushes off suggestions that lopez obrador favors the miners union and he dismisses accusations that he and other strike organizers are helping president donald trump s campaign to bring manufacturing plants back to the united states unfortunately people here in matamoros live on very low salaries zuniga said there is no plot no conspiracy other than to protect and help the workers more news from the border

publishing magnate steve forbes doesn t know exactly what he ll talk about when he gives a speech at ave maria school of law in naples florida in march i always speak from notes he said ahead of his visit and he always wants to use fresh material forbes said he does know a big focus will be on moral and ethical leadership in the business world the timing couldn t be better forbes said ave maria law school created a new speakers series to introduce its students to ethical leaders from near and far the school in north naples recently started a profiles in ethical leadership program to host distinguished ceos entrepreneurs and other leaders at its campus to share their insights with students forbes will be among those leaders the last speaker in the inaugural program the signature event will raise money for student scholarships it s a little bit different than what you find at other schools forbes said of his interest in speaking at the catholic law school they are not taking a cookie cutter approach in a phone interview with the daily news forbes talked about everything from business to politics to the economy chocolate confusion missing tips on kisses prompts hershey to respond the trust factor it s an ideal time to talk about ethical leadership because of the trust factor said forbes chairman and editor in chief of forbes media there is less trust in government he said there is less trust in financial institutions less trust in the economic system less trust in the education system less trust which i think is the basis of it all in money the integrity of money that lack of trust is important because in so many ways the capitalist system runs on trust so what characteristics does forbes think define a truly great leader great leaders need to have a defined sense of direction a trust in their people and the strength to move forward by making difficult decisions even when they re not popular he said no matter how good you are there are always going to be things that don t go right mistakes you make events changes in the marketplace forbes said all sorts of things and sometimes there are no playbooks so you have to make decisions where you don t know how it s going to turn out good leaders need a wider sense of concern and responsibility rather than focusing so much on themselves and they need a long term perspective instead of just considering the present and what s in it for me forbes said we certainly try to do that in our space he said and try to also innovate if people sense that positive things can happen that creativity can bear fruit for the future the world of publishing has changed drastically since malcolm stevenson steve forbes jr joined the family business as a researcher for forbes magazine after graduating from princeton university in 1970 his grandfather an immigrant from scotland with only a grade school education started forbes in 1917 from the beginning he said forbes as a company had a belief in what s now known as entrepreneurial capitalism or private capital investing in private startups forbes never looked at business people as bad people in the first issue of the magazine my grandfather said the purpose of business was to produce happiness not to pile up millions not to pile up money today we call that entrepreneurial capitalism tech talk message to facebook and google don t mess with apple the drucker rule the media business forbes said has tried to keep the drucker rule in mind and continue to move forward the late peter drucker considered a management guru said every organization should always ask itself what is our purpose what is our mission what is it we are trying to do if you do that you re more likely not to get sidetracked and to stay the course forbes said the roads themselves may change but you still have a sense of where you want to go he said today the biggest generator of business for forbes media is its online publishing we had a very good 2018 forbes said we re off to a good start this year less than 15 percent of revenues comes from the magazine and the rest from online or other services the company he said now has 2 800 contracted contributors we run over 110 000 submissions a year so we re doing well there forbes said the key thing there is to remember what your goal is and your purpose is photo gallery forbes 10 top paid actresses of 2018 a drama critic some have compared his family s global media company to a drama critic and forbes thinks that s fitting we love it when a production is done right he said we hate it when a production is not done right the guiding light for the business has been to provide its viewers and readers with the information and insights they need to move ahead and live well forbes said we write about those who are doing right and those who are doing things wrong because there are always lessons to be learned he said the company is always pursuing new ideas and new opportunities forbes said we now have 40 international language editions around the world license agreements he said the scope of what we offer online is enormously expanded economy and trade with china what s forbes take on the u s economy the economy is strong he said i think it will be better reflected in the market the stock market when and if we get a trade deal achieved with china he believes the united states will strike a better trade deal with china within the next few months the china deal will be a pretty big one in terms of the amount of pledges to purchase products in the u s as far as that s concerned i think we will be even agreeing to sell them natural gas forbes said job advice here are two truths to help you build a successful career and future after the longest government shutdown in history recently ended forbes emphasized the importance of moving ahead with the renegotiated north american free trade agreement in one of his columns i think it does more good than harm he said if congress doesn t ratify it it s going to hurt the economy trump good for business forbes a republican candidate in the 1996 and 2000 presidential primaries said president donald trump s administration has been good for business in many ways they ve made enormously important strides in deregulation forbes said regulations are another form of taxation and when it s abused or overdone there can be bad consequences manufacturing he said is springing back to life again now that the government is not overburdening the sector with regulations the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 which significantly cut the federal corporate tax rate has been good for business too of course i would like a flat tax other than that this tax cut was not bad he describes the federal tax cut as a gift that will keep giving by not punishing people and businesses that are trying to get positive things done that low rate will be a boon for a long time to come he said once key trade disputes are resolved forbes said he expects more business owners in the u s to invest in and expand their businesses it s picked up a little bit but i think it s got room for imminent growth he said asked why he ran for president twice forbes said he wanted to advance a pro growth agenda that included a flat tax medical savings accounts a new social security system for working americans and a strong national defense he didn t see anyone

by jason wong strong us data on friday saw us treasury rates move 4 7bps higher across the curve the rise in rates tempered the lift in us equities while currency movements were generally modest apart from some softness in the yen the key feature on friday was a series of stronger than expected data reports in the us that helped lift citigroup s us economic surprise index onto a vertical plane the us employment report was mixed with much stronger employment growth than expected even accounting for negative revisions while the unemployment rate ticked higher and wage inflation was on the soft side looking through the noise in the data employment growth remains solid and will drive the unemployment rate lower if sustained while the trend for wage inflation remains higher that was the message taken by the bond market which took yields higher a stronger than expected rebound in the ism manufacturing index and stronger than expected consumer sentiment and construction data supported the move treasury rates were 4 7bps higher across the curve with the 2 year rate up 4bps to 2 50 and the 10 year rate up 5 5bps to 2 685 the 5 year rate rose by 7bps taking the brunt of the impact of the strong data the s p500 index rose by only 0 1 with performance held back by the rising yield backdrop but a weekly gain of 1 6 was still recorded taking the recovery since christmas eve up to 15 about half of those gains coming from early january after signals from the fed that it was listening to markets the current round of us china trade talks concluded friday morning nz time with the white house releasing a statement saying that while progress has been made much work remains to be done the statement from the chinese delegation said that discussions were candid specific and fruitful reading between the lines the two sides look far from making agreement on the thorny issues of alleged chinese ip theft forced technology transfers and chinese state subsidies to producers treasury secretary mnuchin and us trade rep lighthizer will head to beijing mid month for the next round of talks ahead of a possible trump xi meeting in late february currency markets were fairly quiet on friday the nzd met some resistance near the 0 6940 mark as it did in the previous session and drifted down into the ny close ending just below 0 69 aud was also on the soft side closing the week around 0 7250 leaving nzd aud near 0 95 of the commodity currencies cad performed the best supported by a near 3 lift in oil prices with signs of short sellers capitulating further after the strong rally in prices through january jpy was the weakest of the majors given the rise in us rates usd jpy was up 0 6 for the session to 109 50 while nzd jpy continued to push higher closing the week at 75 5 gbp was also on the soft side slipping back below 1 31 not helped by a weaker pmi manufacturing reading core cpi data for the euro area came in slightly stronger than expected but this was ignored by the market with the annual 1 1 reading still well below ecb comfort levels eur managed to hold its ground against the usd ending the week around 1 1450 nz rates fell on friday following the previous us session s moves nz s 10 year government rate fell by 6bps to 2 19 getting within spitting distance of the record low of 2016 although we d expect to see some retracement today the economic calendar is light to begin the week highlights this week will be nz labour market data on thursday and the rba meeting tomorrow us economic releases are still being held up by the recent government shutdown with a backlog of data to be released over coming weeks get our daily currency email by signing up here bnz markets research is available here
this article is more than 5 years old getty it takes three things to bring a vibrant emerging market economy to the brink of collapse corruption revolution and inflation venezuelans have seen all three unfolding over time though not necessarily in that order they have also seen a long list of failed policies pursued by all sorts of right and left wing revolutionaries from perez to chávez and maduro all of whom can take their fair share of blame for bringing a country rich in natural and human resources to the brink of collapse venezuela s playbook of the sum of all failed policies begins with a wave of nationalizations and labor market regulations back in the late 1970s long before hugo chavéz came to power making conditions even worse says dr rainer zitelmann sociologist historian and author of the upcoming book the power of capitalism one of the reasons for venezuela s problems was the unusually high degree of government regulation of the labor market that set in motion a race for further tighter labor market regulations from 1974 onwards the applicable rules were tightened even further to a level that was unprecedented almost anywhere else in the world let alone latin america explains zitelmann from adding the equivalent of 5 35 months wages to the cost of employing someone in 1972 non wage labor costs soared to add the equivalent of 8 98 months wages in 1992 koyfin koyfin the playbook continued with the price controls and heavy subsidies under rafaelcaldera president twice from 1969 74 and 1994 99 and his strange bedfellows they made crude oil cheaper than water and widened the government deficit adding to soaring government debt wait there s much more there are the currency controls that favored foreign manufacturers over domestic manufacturers and there was the modern version of bolivarian socialism which borrowed a page of two from castro s cuban socialism and from che guevara s and salvatore allende anti americanism to add to the woes of venezuela s economy after hugo chávez s death in 2013 nicolás maduro his successor and former second in command accelerated the nationalization of dairies coffee producers supermarkets manufacturers of fertilizers and shoe factories says zitelmann production buckled or stopped entirely things turn worse when the price of oil collapsed then the oil prices plummeted losing almost 50 of their value within a single year from usd 111 per barrel in late 2013 to usd 57 60 then dropping to usd 37 60 another year later and fluctuating between usd 27 10 and usd 57 30 in 2016 adds zitelmann to be fair the collapse in oil prices had a devastating effect on every major oil producing nation but they were amplified in the case of venezuela according to zitelmann while this would have caused a predicament for any oil producing nation these problems were amplified in a country with an extremely inefficient socialist economy and strict price controls he notes the fatal effects of chávez s socialist policies became obvious once and for all and the entire system fell apart as had become evident in other countries it was apparent that far from being an efficient means to fight inflation price controls only make things worse that s how venezuela ended up with skyrocketed inflation inflation reached 225 in 2016 higher than anywhere else in the world except for south sudan says zitelmann it was probably close to 800 accompanied by a 19 drop in economic output in 2016 according to an internal report by the governor of the national bank economists know too well what follows in this situation people started hoarding all sorts of things that were sold very cheaply and would frequently queue for hours to buy something they would then sell on at a much higher price on the black market explains zitelmann in sum again a socialist experiment was attempted and again it failed as all other socialist experiments have done in the last 100 years and the people of venezuela are paying dearly as the country is at the brink of collapse
the blacklisted 1970s era north korean oil tanker floated in waters a couple of hundred miles south of shanghai tethered to a ship half its size by a hose as if hooked up to an intravenous line the offshore coupling spotted by the japanese navy last month was the latest evidence that north korea may be succeeding in skirting international sanctions designed to pressure the isolated regime into giving up its nuclear weapons the ship was likely receiving a transfusion of oil a primary target of ongoing international sanctions on north korea when north korea s kim jong un met with president trump last june trump claimed it was his maximum pressure campaign centered around sanctions that forced kim to the table for the first ever summit between u s and north korean leaders advertisement but analysts say north korea continues to find ways to adapt illegal smuggling operations like the suspected one in the east china sea have allowed the nation to import between half and two thirds of the oil supply it was getting before the sanctions ramped up in 2017 according to an estimate by go myong hyun an economist at the asan institute for policy studies a seoul based think tank as the u s and north korea prepare for a second summit between trump and kim later this month just how much of his nuclear arsenal kim is willing to trade away may largely hinge on the extent that economic pressure is felt within north korea despite reforms tacitly allowing market activity and an emerging middle class it remains a highly impoverished nation with an economy a fraction the size of neighboring south korea determining the state of the economy in north korea where economic statistics are rarely published requires elaborate guesswork and while it is showing some signs of distress from the sanctions there is also evidence that pyongyang is finding ways to cushion the blow analysts say the threshold is pretty high for economic pain for the north korean regime said benjamin katzeff silberstein co editor of the website north korean economy watch and associate scholar with the philadelphia based foreign policy research institute they re better suited than many other countries to handle sanctions because the economy is still relatively underdeveloped there is less to lose in a way u s and north korean nuclear envoys met in sweden last month and are set to confer again in the coming days to lay the groundwork for the upcoming summit an attendant fills up a taxi with gasoline at a gas station in pyongyang north korea in 2017 ed jones afp getty images advertisement in a speech thursday u s special envoy for north korea stephen biegun reiterated what trump said he told kim in singapore that the promise of economic prosperity awaits at the appropriate time at the completion of denuclearization we are prepared to explore with north korea the best way to mobilize investment improve infrastructure enhance food security and drive a level of economic engagement that will allow the north korean people to fully share in the rich future of their asian neighbors biegun said in a talk at stanford he added though that should the diplomatic process fail the u s had contingencies at the ready biegun s remarks came as trump s own top intelligence officials publicly cast doubt on north korea s willingness to ever denuclearize director of national intelligence dan coats told senators last week that the u s continued to see activity inconsistent with full denuclearization in north korea within north korea there are some signs that the impact of several rounds of sanctions imposed after its nuclear tests in 2017 are adding up exports to china which account for most of north korea s trade were down 88 last year compared with 2017 according to chinese customs cutting off a large source of foreign currency the seoul based bank of korea estimated that the north korean economy shrank by 3 5 in 2017 visitors reported seeing piles of coal a major trading item with china getting rained on in north korean ports and being told that certain factories weren t worth visiting because they were shut down one north korean defector turned journalist wrote in a column for dong a ilbo a major seoul daily that housing prices have been dropping in pyongyang a sign that the elite may be running low on foreign currency or hoarding for leaner times north korea s official rhetoric appears to have increasingly shifted to a focus on sanctions in a new year s address kim cautioned the u s against continuing to pressure north korea with sanctions out of miscalculation of our people s patience advertisement we may be compelled to find a new way for defending the sovereignty of the country and the supreme interests of the state and for achieving peace and stability of the korean peninsula kim said in his fireside chat style speech seated in a leather armchair before a floor to ceiling bookcase yet even with evidence that sanctions are having an impact the effects don t appear to have reached the general public the price of rice a staple has remained relatively stable as has the black market exchange rate with the u s dollar according to data collected by daily nk a seoul based news site that gathers information from sources inside north korea gas prices on a roller coaster for most of last year have also fallen closer to pre sanction levels it s not that sanctions on north korea don t have an effect it s a matter of how broadly how strong and for how long they ll be enforced said kang mijin a daily nk reporter who herself fled from north korea in 2009 what people in north korea are saying is that in the 90s when food distribution stopped people survived on weeds they lived through that but this time it s not headed in that direction then u s ambassador nikki haley talks with chinese diplomat wu haitao in december 2017 at united nations headquarters where the security council voted to impose additional sanctions on north korea including sharply lower limits on its oil imports mark lennihan associated press analysts say the north korean government has been making an effort to cushion the blow to its people by continuing to import consumer goods and buying fuel at a premium cost through illicit channels probably burning through its foreign currency reserves advertisement there s no guarantee that when worse comes to worst north korea won t leave its own people to starve kim jong un he s not a saint he very well could said go the economist at the think tank asan the reason they re not doing that is north korea s leaders might be skeptical internally whether the country could endure another arduous march like the 90s he said referring to a period of widespread famine in north korea analysts said there was reason to believe china was helping mitigate the impact of sanctions silberstein of north korean economy watch analyzed oil prices in north korea and found they have moved in tandem with the state of relations and diplomatic visits between china and north korea the fluctuation in chinese fuel supplies over the past 18 months suggests that beijing has been opening and closing its tap largely according to its national security priorities silberstein concluded in a paper published by 38 north a website run by the think tank stimson center byung yeon kim an economics professor at seoul national university and author of the book unveiling the north korean economy said china holds the key to keeping the heat on north korea by strictly enforcing sanctions the fact that china and north korea s leaders met sends the signal to chinese companies that they ll get a lot of slack for trading with north korea he said the u s has also accused russia of helping north korea evade sanctions with then u n ambassador nikki haley telling the body last fall there is evidence of consistent and wide ranging russian violations the washington post last week quoted unnamed u s officials saying russia had secretly offered to build a nuclear power plant for north korea in exchange for dismantling its missile program advertisement byung yeon kim the economics professor said lax enforcement of sanctions would give pyongyang the upper hand in talks and that washington should have waited until the full brunt of sanctions was felt inside north korea before sitting down adding that the north korean people would understand where to place the blame in the 90s people blamed natural disasters and american sanctions for their difficulties now two thirds of escapees from north korea understand that it s lack of reform and open markets he said stanford fellow andray abrahamian a former director of choson exchange a program to encourage entrepreneurship in north korea attended a trade fair in the port city of rason north korea last fall his contacts complained of factories being shut down because of sanctions restricting exports but at the same time they boasted that it usually takes no more than two weeks for north korea to find a way to evade new sanctions a common refrain was we ve been dealing with sanctions we know how to deal with it we figure it out we always find a way part of that is genuine part of that is performance for a foreigner he said abrahamian said kim was probably motivated to get out from under the sanctions as part of a negotiated compromise but as little information as there is about the north korean economy he added it s apparent it s nowhere near a breaking point if we think that sanctions are going to break north korea he said then we ll probably be waiting in vain advertisement victoria kim latimes com follow me on twitter vicjkim

so the powers that be on the federal reserve board have decided to engage in round two of their little quantitative easing experiment basically agreeing to purchase 600 billion in government debt over the next 8 months in order to keep interest rates artificially low and hopefully juice the economy in the process that 75 billion a month isn t that much in the grand scheme of things and the markets are certainly acting as if all is copacetic but i still find the hubris of the fed incredibly alarming though not incredibly surprising fed chairman ben bernanke of course considers himself an astute historian of the great depression and he remains firmly and forever convinced that the primary cause of that debacle or at least of its depth and duration was the deflation boogeyman he is determined to avoid repeating that experience at any and all costs is there anything scarier than a historian academician who is so convinced in the righteousness of his beliefs and cause unfortunately the costs this time may end up being a permanent debasement of our currency and an economy so out of whack it will take generations to recover meanwhile people like me who have put way too much of their nest eggs into dollar based savings accounts just get screwed i don t want to get into a debate about the necessity of the fed as an entity at all does the idea of eleven men and women setting market prices really sound wise or the silliness of their wildly conflicting dual mandate low stable inflation and high employment that they are charged to work under but this latest move is pure madness bernanke says that the fed s first round of quantitative easing a couple of years ago did its job helping stabilize a free falling economy while keeping inflation at low levels never mind that qe1 led to one of the weakest post recession recoveries in history never mind that many measures of incipient inflation have been soaring price of tips bonds sugar oil gold corn etc etc anyone never mind that many of the assets the fed purchased were trash mortgage securities not worth the paper they were written on and that the fed never engaged in shrinking its balance sheet as it planned on doing once the crisis had passed when all is said and done after qe2 the fed s balance sheet may equal a mind boggling 20 of gdp according to some estimates look i m not a trained economist so i don t know whether the economy has the excess capacity to absorb another round of quantitative easing as bernanke suggests it does what i do know is this 1 the first round of qe did little to stimulate the economy suggesting that the root of our problems wasn t a lack of too little money sloshing around the contraction in available credit was a normal and appropriate response to the destructive debt orgy that preceded it 2 the fed is quickly running out of bullets to fire to juice the economy 3 continuous quantitative easing hasn t worked in japan 4 other countries will respond to our attempt to debase our currency and it won t be pretty 5 in his quest to defeat the delfation boogeyman bernanke is ignoring many key signals of incipient inflation the soaring prices of gold and government bond just cannot continue one of these markets will prove to be spectacularly wrong bernanke even says in the washington post article linked to above that qe2 has already begun to work because interest rates have fallen and the stock market has risen since the fed signaled its plans to the market are you kidding me bernanke is so obsessed with stock prices it actually seems like a rising stock market has become a third part of the fed s new mandate but it s no shock that the stock market will perform well in a high inflation environment anything priced in dollars will go up on a relative basis and in yet another stunning display of hubris bernanke also says that the fed is fully prepared to reverse qe2 should conditions warrant i hope he s right but i have a hard time believing the fed will have control over the situation if inflation becomes the proverbial snowball rolling down the hill as i suspect might happen try reversing qe when the chinese government is trying to dump hundreds of billions of dollars of our debt at the same time look i understand why politicians never get religion when it comes to entitlement reform and deficit reduction in good times or bad they are always trolling for votes and passing out free money is the quickest path to re election but the whole point of the fed was that the wise and thoughtful men and women who populate this independent entity would know better the problem is when you put a small group of people and one man in particular in such an enormous position of power they just end up thinking they know better and god help us all if they don t
one lesson of the 2016 election seemed to be that voting for someone you don t believe in because you think they have a better chance of beating donald trump is a mistake but to assume everyone learned from that mistake would also be a mistake i knew lots of people who believed in the things bernie sanders said and liked him better than hillary clinton but voted for clinton in the primary because they were told over and over by everyone on tv that she had a better shot at beating trump and now some of them have the same plan for 2020 already except of course for the clinton part which has not yet been cast this voting strategy you could call it the values sacrifice has its appeal and it is understandable that people would opt for it when confronted with something they find as scary as they found donald trump the reasoning behind it is something like this the best way to beat someone on the far right is not with someone on the left but with someone in the center because you have to appeal to the people in the middle because there are more of them set aside for a second that the strategy so recently failed maybe it was a fluke and maybe centrist candidates in 2020 won t be as unpopular as clinton and also set aside the bizarre irony in the idea that voting responsibly requires voting for a person who is closer politically to the one you are trying to defeat if you just take the strategy at face value it can appear to make sense but there are reasons why it actually does not first it assumes that centrists in general have the broadest appeal to the electorate this is true in a limited sense but false in a wider one centrists appeal to a broad base the way beige goes with almost anything or the way blank walls make apartments more appealing to renters or the way you can t really disagree with someone who never says anything meaningful it s an appeal that is decidedly uninspiring consequently it is limited to the minority of people who vote no matter what it does not touch the majority who will vote only if given a reason second today s centrism is different from the centrism of the past it s shifted to the right of where it was in the 80 s and far far right of where it was in the 40 s public opinion however has not shifted with it so centrist policies like say the ones that exclude a public health care option or the ones that support public subsidies for the fossil fuel industry or the ones that tax the rich at lower rates than the poor are often not aligned with public opinion here are things that extensive polling over decades has shown that most people think we should have a health care system like they do in canada and the rest of the industrialized world we should spend less on the military and wars the rich should pay more taxes here is what centrists think we should continue doing health care war and taxes the way we ve been doing them with occasional inconsequential tweaks the centrist promise of today is essentially this we ll go back to how things were under clinton the bushes and obama where we argue over how tightly to regulate wall street but never end too big to fail or reinstate glass steagall where we argue over how much private health industries can gouge the public but never stop them from doing it where we do nothing at all to stop corporate assaults on unions where we do nothing to close corporate tax loopholes where we do nothing to protect middle class jobs and of course where no one will ever end the wars or military interventions and free up those billions of dollars for other things this promise is not too appealing even if you don t know what glass steagall is or you don t care about unions or you think the wars are necessary it s still clear that the whole thing rests on a premise that more and more people recognize as false that the government can prioritize the desires of the very rich and at the same time serve everyone else that is the assumption at the core of centrist ideology it runs right down the middle of the two parties because serving the rich is one of the few priorities they share and the assumption is utterly untrue the truth is that the preferences of major industry and the interest of the general population are often at odds with each other because major industry under capitalism demands endless profit growth that growth comes at the cost of lower wages fewer worker benefits more automation more pollution more off shoring of jobs and on and on letting major industry do whatever it wants always eventually hurts the general population the fantasy that it benefits them is called trickle down economics and is today basically a joke today in 2019 it is painfully clear that the world doesn t work that way and the reason it s clear is because we tried it for a few decades and the results are in 30 million people uninsured one in four kids living in poverty 80 of workers living paycheck to paycheck a tiny minority with more money than god and all in the richest country in the history of the world and everyone knows even if they can t recite those statistics they know because they live it they or their friends or family struggle to make ends meet carry huge debts have no insurance can t find work that pays enough to live decently can t afford a thousand dollar emergency and all the rest that is now so familiar they ve lived through all the tax cuts for the rich and seen that the rich do not then invest in more production don t hire more workers don t increase wages don t improve working conditions don t do anything that s supposed to justify the gifts lavished upon them but instead pay themselves huge bonuses buy back their company stock to artificially inflate its value buy government bonds which the government would not even have to issue if it collected those taxes in the first place and sit around engaging in other financial wonkery the promise of centrism worked when there was a strong middle class who felt like their lives were getting better it worked when they weren t so aware of the obscene wealth hoarded at the top but those days are over too many people perceive accurately that centrist big business dominated policies make their lives worse they don t like donald trump and yes he is also a billionaire but they don t want to go back to the government that gave them the financial crash the recession and a stagnant or sinking standard of living donald trump is a disaster but those things are too and it s hard to say which disaster the public thinks is worse it s easy to over estimate how disappointed people are with trump another thing 2016 gave to many on the left was a pristine view of their own bubbles every election is a referendum on the status quo people vote between a candidate who can be expected to continue the current administration s policies and one who can be expected to depart from them sometimes the current administration is so unpopular that both candidates claim to be a departure even when that claim is absurd john mccain did it because the iraq war made bush so unpopular despite the fact that mccain was always a big war enthusiast himself in 2020 the departure from trump cannot be a proposed return to obama as great as many democrats think that would be because it was so nice to have a president who spoke intelligently and made some modest moves for the middle class and was also fun enough to dance on ellen and cool enough to go on marc maron and who wasn t a sleazebag to women in the end his administration did not really make average working people s lives better those people including me and probably you still had to pay a lot for health care and still took on debt just to meet living expenses and still paid banks usurious interest rates and still got no relief if they were hit by the crash while the people who caused it got richer and still dealt with underfunded public services because the tax revenues to pay for them weren t there because they were sitting in off shore tax havens and that s the middle class the poor were drinking poison water we can blame the republican congress if we want it will not help anyone donald trump does not erase all of history the fact that he is an extremist does not make being a centrist bold and new every democratic president for forty years has been a centrist if you measure them against the range of popular politicians over the last two centuries and not just the last two decades that s why saying the country needs a centrist makes no sense you can t really be in need of something you already have a lot of all of this is ignored by the values sacrifice voting strategy it expects that someone whose pitch is we ll get sensible again like we were before trump will bring out the big numbers in this country today that is a very very shaky bet of course there is no really safe bet but here i propose an alternative voting strategy one that rests on a different assumption bringing people out requires giving them a concrete specific reason to vote you could call it the give me a reason just one please god at least one and preferably more reasons to vote for you strategy it is for the most part easy but it does require being vigilant about what qualifies as a reason and what doesn t a reason is not an empty promise and it is not the achievement that you are not donald trump it s a credible promise to better someone s life in a tangible way here are some examples of reasons you will be guaranteed health care your kids schools will have sufficient funding you can go to college for free if you want to work but are unable to find a job the government will hire you to do something the public needs done these programs will be paid for by taxing the richest corporations and individuals who have more than enough money and not by taxing you these are also reasons you will be kept safe because we will aggressively jail criminals you will have more jobs because we will keep the number of immigrants who compete for them to a minimum you will be kept safe because we will bomb and assassinate the terrorists you will have more jobs because we will not allow corporations to ship them overseas you will have more jobs because we will spur investment with tax cuts you will have better roads and infrastructure because we ll stop wasting money on pointless wars you will have more jobs because we will tax imports whatever you think of that second set which should sound familiar they are reasons most may be weak there is lots of evidence that aggressively jailing and bombing people does not make anyone safer and there is little evidence that immigrants cause job scarcity or that tax cuts spur investment but they at least propose concrete solutions to perceived problems and that is what a reason must do a reason then is a concrete policy that is easy to grasp because it is a straightforward solution to a basic problem every reason contains within itself the acknowledgement of an unpleasant truth the truths acknowledged by the second set of reasons above are these we feel unsafe there are not enough jobs infrastructure is bad and needs to be fixed the truths acknowledged by the first set are these we don t have the health care we need schools are underfunded college is too expensive there are not enough jobs fixing these problems will be expensive here is another unpleasant truth repeated constantly in one form or another by donald trump in 2016 the political establishment is corrupt and overwhelmingly serves the rich and powerful at your expense that s the reason you don t have what you deserve these people are full of shit they promise you the world over and over and give you nothing they give it all to their rich friends if you don t think that s true you re not paying attention and if you think it s too simplistic you re expecting people who don t have much time or interest in politics to pay closer attention than is reasonable people may have been wrong to think donald trump was going to fix that problem but they were not wrong to respond favorably to him for acknowledging that truth especially in the truth anemic world of politics the other candidate who consistently acknowledged it became the most popular politician in the country and stayed there for two years despite the media ignoring him and it wasn t because he was as eloquent and charming as barack obama acknowledging that kind of truth which is essential to giving people a reason to vote for you is very hard for centrist politicians it s hard because it exposes the guiding principle to which they are committed that government can cater to the very rich and also serve everyone else as false that is why centrists and most politicians rarely give people real reasons to vote for them but instead give them things that kind of sound like reasons but aren t platitudes a platitude is a vague and open ended statement that aligns with universal values which can be and often is made by any politician anywhere usually with reference to a plan but with no concrete policy proposal it is an expedient but meaningless endorsement of a democratically popular idea this is a platitude every american deserves access to health care and we have a plan to ensure that everyone gets it every politician says this now because they know the entire electorate thinks everyone deserves health care even politicians whose policies make health care impossibly expensive say it it is a meaningless non statement here is another platitude we want to rebuild the middle class you know who wants that everyone in america so every politician says it even politicians whose policies kill the middle class say it it is also a meaningless non statement so here is the pill to swallow which is actually not bitter but sweet the why you can t fight far right with center but must fight it with candidates who are actually committed to substantial policy change pill it is impossible to fight reasons with platitudes a half century of platitudes has put the electorate s bullshit detector in overdrive and the amount of bullshit it takes to make them stop listening is almost zero the slightest hint of bullshit and they think i don t want this sales pitch i m out i m done listening until i hear someone who sounds like a fucking straight talking person and not an android for people in this state whose platitude based political diet has left them so starved for substance they can barely stand a weak reason will beat a strong platitude if a candidate relies on platitudes instead of reasons they are asking to lose again go back and look at donald trump s campaign he had lots of reasons they were weak and fell apart under scrutiny but he won anyway because his opponent hardly had any and ran instead on platitudes the border wall is an example of a weak reason it s really expensive and would not solve the crime and jobs problems it s supposed to solve but it is a concrete policy addressing basic problems that is easy to grasp the other side responded to the jobs problem with platitudes and most people don t even remember what they were even if trump had lost we d still remember the border wall and not just because it s so outlandish and inflammatory sanders lost and nobody forgot medicare for all so it is not enough for a candidate to say that a reason like the border wall is bad explain why and then offer a platitude in its place they must offer other stronger reasons of their own aside from being policy specific and graspable a good reason also needs to be credible that means the promise it contains must align with the past actions of the person making the promise discovering whether that s the case requires some internet searching and is boring so most potential voters won t do it themselves but they ll discover it later when the other side brings it up so anyone not wanting to waste their vote on a weak candidate should make sure their candidate is credible i do not want to pick on hillary clinton and we can fight about why she lost later but i think it s fair to say she suffered because the contradictions between her record and what she promised were so obvious everyone knew she took millions of dollars from wall street banks so her promises to rein in their excesses were not credible she advocated every military intervention including the most disastrous ones so her promises to run sensible foreign policy were not credible she was dishonest with the committee investigating her e mail server so it was very hard for people to trust her it was hard for me to trust her and anyone who wants to believe i am a misogynist because of it is free to do so that won t help anyone either so if you think we should have universal health care vote for a candidate who promises it and whose record makes that promise credible if you think we shouldn t spend billions of dollars a year bombing countries most of us can t even name there are 9 of them now vote for someone who credibly promises to cut military spending if you think the ultra rich should pay more in taxes than the poor and middle class do vote for someone who credibly promises to make them pay if you think the bombing is necessary and tax cuts spur investment and being a billionaire qualifies you to be president then vote that way just don t steal your vote from yourself by trying to fortune tell which personality has the best chance of winning because fortune telling is very very hard to do it s unnecessary and counterproductive you would never choose a doctor that way you probably wouldn t choose a hair stylist that way and its track record lately is

the blacklisted 1970s era north korean oil tanker floated in waters a couple of hundred miles south of shanghai tethered to a ship half its size by a hose as if hooked up to an intravenous line the offshore coupling spotted by the japanese navy last month was the latest evidence that north korea may be succeeding in skirting international sanctions designed to pressure the isolated regime into giving up its nuclear weapons the ship was likely receiving a transfusion of oil a primary target of ongoing international sanctions on north korea advertisement when north korea s kim jong un met with president trump last june trump claimed it was his maximum pressure campaign centered around sanctions that forced kim to the table for the first ever summit between u s and north korean leaders but analysts say north korea continues to find ways to adapt illegal smuggling operations like the suspected one in the east china sea have allowed the nation to import between half and two thirds of the oil supply it was getting before the sanctions ramped up in 2017 according to an estimate by go myong hyun an economist at the asan institute for policy studies a seoul based think tank as the u s and north korea prepare for a second summit between trump and kim later this month just how much of his nuclear arsenal kim is willing to trade away may largely hinge on the extent that economic pressure is felt within north korea despite reforms tacitly allowing market activity and an emerging middle class it remains a highly impoverished nation with an economy a fraction the size of neighboring south korea advertisement determining the state of the economy in north korea where economic statistics are rarely published requires elaborate guesswork and while it is showing some signs of distress from the sanctions there is also evidence that pyongyang is finding ways to cushion the blow analysts say the threshold is pretty high for economic pain for the north korean regime said benjamin katzeff silberstein co editor of the website north korean economy watch and associate scholar with the philadelphia based foreign policy research institute they re better suited than many other countries to handle sanctions because the economy is still relatively underdeveloped there is less to lose in a way u s and north korean nuclear envoys met in sweden last month and are set to confer again in the coming days to lay the groundwork for the upcoming summit advertisement an attendant fills up a taxi with gasoline at a gas station in pyongyang north korea in 2017 ed jones afp getty images in a speech thursday u s special envoy for north korea stephen biegun reiterated what trump said he told kim in singapore that the promise of economic prosperity awaits at the appropriate time at the completion of denuclearization we are prepared to explore with north korea the best way to mobilize investment improve infrastructure enhance food security and drive a level of economic engagement that will allow the north korean people to fully share in the rich future of their asian neighbors biegun said in a talk at stanford he added though that should the diplomatic process fail the u s had contingencies at the ready advertisement biegun s remarks came as trump s own top intelligence officials publicly cast doubt on north korea s willingness to ever denuclearize director of national intelligence dan coats told senators last week that the u s continued to see activity inconsistent with full denuclearization in north korea within north korea there are some signs that the impact of several rounds of sanctions imposed after its nuclear tests in 2017 are adding up exports to china which account for most of north korea s trade were down 88 last year compared with 2017 according to chinese customs cutting off a large source of foreign currency the seoul based bank of korea estimated that the north korean economy shrank by 3 5 in 2017 visitors reported seeing piles of coal a major trading item with china getting rained on in north korean ports and being told that certain factories weren t worth visiting because they were shut down one north korean defector turned journalist wrote in a column for dong a ilbo a major seoul daily that housing prices have been dropping in pyongyang a sign that the elite may be running low on foreign currency or hoarding for leaner times advertisement north korea s official rhetoric appears to have increasingly shifted to a focus on sanctions in a new year s address kim cautioned the u s against continuing to pressure north korea with sanctions out of miscalculation of our people s patience we may be compelled to find a new way for defending the sovereignty of the country and the supreme interests of the state and for achieving peace and stability of the korean peninsula kim said in his fireside chat style speech seated in a leather armchair before a floor to ceiling bookcase yet even with evidence that sanctions are having an impact the effects don t appear to have reached the general public advertisement the price of rice a staple has remained relatively stable as has the black market exchange rate with the u s dollar according to data collected by daily nk a seoul based news site that gathers information from sources inside north korea gas prices on a roller coaster for most of last year have also fallen closer to pre sanction levels it s not that sanctions on north korea don t have an effect it s a matter of how broadly how strong and for how long they ll be enforced said kang mijin a daily nk reporter who herself fled from north korea in 2009 what people in north korea are saying is that in the 90s when food distribution stopped people survived on weeds they lived through that but this time it s not headed in that direction then u s ambassador nikki haley talks with chinese diplomat wu haitao in december 2017 at united nations headquarters where the security council voted to impose additional sanctions on north korea including sharply lower limits on its oil imports mark lennihan associated press advertisement analysts say the north korean government has been making an effort to cushion the blow to its people by continuing to import consumer goods and buying fuel at a premium cost through illicit channels probably burning through its foreign currency reserves there s no guarantee that when worse comes to worst north korea won t leave its own people to starve kim jong un he s not a saint he very well could said go the economist at the think tank asan the reason they re not doing that is north korea s leaders might be skeptical internally whether the country could endure another arduous march like the 90s he said referring to a period of widespread famine in north korea analysts said there was reason to believe china was helping mitigate the impact of sanctions advertisement silberstein of north korean economy watch analyzed oil prices in north korea and found they have moved in tandem with the state of relations and diplomatic visits between china and north korea the fluctuation in chinese fuel supplies over the past 18 months suggests that beijing has been opening and closing its tap largely according to its national security priorities silberstein concluded in a paper published by 38 north a website run by the think tank stimson center byung yeon kim an economics professor at seoul national university and author of the book unveiling the north korean economy said china holds the key to keeping the heat on north korea by strictly enforcing sanctions the fact that china and north korea s leaders met sends the signal to chinese companies that they ll get a lot of slack for trading with north korea he said advertisement the u s has also accused russia of helping north korea evade sanctions with then u n ambassador nikki haley telling the body last fall there is evidence of consistent and wide ranging russian violations the washington post last week quoted unnamed u s officials saying russia had secretly offered to build a nuclear power plant for north korea in exchange for dismantling its missile program byung yeon kim the economics professor said lax enforcement of sanctions would give pyongyang the upper hand in talks and that washington should have waited until the full brunt of sanctions was felt inside north korea before sitting down adding that the north korean people would understand where to place the blame in the 90s people blamed natural disasters and american sanctions for their difficulties now two thirds of escapees from north korea understand that it s lack of reform and open markets he said advertisement stanford fellow andray abrahamian a former director of choson exchange a program to encourage entrepreneurship in north korea attended a trade fair in the port city of rason north korea last fall his contacts complained of factories being shut down because of sanctions restricting exports but at the same time they boasted that it usually takes no more than two weeks for north korea to find a way to evade new sanctions a common refrain was we ve been dealing with sanctions we know how to deal with it we figure it out we always find a way part of that is genuine part of that is performance for a foreigner he said abrahamian said kim was probably motivated to get out from under the sanctions as part of a negotiated compromise but as little information as there is about the north korean economy he added it s apparent it s nowhere near a breaking point advertisement if we think that sanctions are going to break north korea he said then we ll probably be waiting in vain victoria kim latimes com follow me on twitter vicjkim
by kate duguid new york reuters while stocks hog the limelight with their best january in three decades another corner of the risk assets marketplace sprang back to life last month after having taken a pounding at the end of last year though some investors question whether the recovery has legs junk bonds in january delivered their strongest monthly performance in more than seven years with a total return of nearly 4 6 percent according to ice bofaml index data retracing almost all of the fourth quarter s losses issuance of new debt rebounded after a near complete shutdown in december for a graphic on junk bonds roared back to life in january click along with the surge in stocks it would appear to be an endorsement of a u s economy that continues to outperform its global peers as well as the shift by the federal reserve to a wait and see posture regarding future interest rate increases companies with risky credit profiles brought 11 7 billion in new high yield debt to the market in the first month of the year after a nearly six week dry spell at the end of 2018 the bounce back from december has led fund investors to put the most cash into high yield bonds since 2016 according to lipper that backdrop would typically be seen as constructive for more gains some big bond managers however remain skeptical of the rebound attributing it more to a clutch of technical factors that will soon peter out than to a lasting improvement in fundamentals we don t think this is a particularly strong buying opportunity said john mcclain portfolio manager at diamond hill capital anticipating a market correction that will pull prices lower strong high yield gains in january 2018 were more than erased by a volatile february december saw just 594 million in high yield deals the lowest monthly issuance since august 2008 companies stepped back from raising debt because global macroeconomic trends such as slowing global growth the u s china trade war and brexit had whipped up volatility in financial markets but when fed chairman jerome powell last month signaled a pause in the u s central bank s interest rate hiking policy confirmed in last week s policy statement markets rebounded still the high yield market s recovery from the december trough adds up to less than half of january 2018 s issuance the relatively small size of the market may be artificially buoying prices the compensation paid to high yield bond investors for holding riskier securities which had widened to 5 357 percent over treasuries on jan 3 has narrowed by 108 basis points since according to ice bofaml indexes the junk bond market is currently weak buyers are being stingy and disciplined and sellers are offloading as soon as they can said kathleen gaffney director of diversified fixed income at eaton vance two one time events may also be shrinking the market and inflating prices the recent upgrade of hca healthcare s debt to investment grade and the merger of speculative grade first data with the investment grade fiserv nonetheless strong investor demand has led issuers to increase the size of their deals military aerospace parts maker transdigm group priced its 3 8 billion deal wednesday up 1 1 billion from initial price talk the targa resources bond which reopened the market in january added a tranche doubling the offering to 1 5 billion the terms secured by investors are particularly impressive given that the economic and geopolitical worries that roiled markets in december have not disappeared moreover u s corporate profit growth a key driver of junk bond performance is seen stalling through the first three quarters of this year as the tailwinds fade from last year s tax cuts according to refinitiv data in the first quarter alone profits are estimated to barely rise at all growing by 1 1 percent year over year nothing has really changed that much said michael depalma chief executive of hedge fund phasecapital lp people were just projecting forward we re going to have trade wars the economy is slowing the fed s going to raise rates and that s going to ruin everything this january he said nobody cares given the persistence of those macroeconomic themes the volatility that spooked high yield issuers in december could easily return in 2019 and although the fed may be open to pause interest rate hikes this year the continued strength of the u s labor market may make it difficult for the fed to justify holding rates unchanged for too long the market reaction to the fed s dovishness is overblown economic fundamentals have not changed and the fed could raise again after a pause said gaffney for managers skeptical of the rebound in junk then january provided an opportunity to remove risk ahead of anticipated volatility we ve used the first month to really clean up any of the mistakes we had made in our portfolio this really is the time to get out without taking a meaningful haircut said mcclain reporting by kate duguid in new york

venezuela colombia the left non anarchist press sunday february 03 2019 11 25 sunday february 03 2019 11 25 by nick pemberton counter punch by nick pemberton counter punch bernie sanders we hear is interested in running for president in 2020 bernie has once again shot himself in the foot before the starter s gun goes off sanders best known trump like statement was calling venezuelan revolutionary president hugo chavez a dead communist dictator now sanders while bucking the establishment on regime change in venezuela remains woefully uninformed about neoliberalism s effects on a global level and therefore cannot be taken seriously as an agent of radical change sanders released a statement on venezuela that had nothing of substance in relationship to the 1 neoliberalism neocolonialism or any of the driving forces of a clear political crisis in the country instead sanders merely echoed right wing talking points on venezuelan president nicholas maduro and then almost as an aside said the u s intervening in latin america well it ends badly and perhaps one could argue that a non intervention response no matter how you get there is good enough especially considering the political spectrum of the united states establishment which has assassination lists coming from its nobel peace price winners but bernie s failure to understand global politics and the hopelessness of his own party democrats leads one to believe that any revolution he will bring will be half baked and easily squashed as it was in 2016 simply being against intervention is not good enough for another reason the venezuelan people are in an economic crisis and it is important to understand why so far the united states has not intervened militarily and yet our policy in venezuela has still been deadly something sanders failed to acknowledge in his statement on venezuela anyone interested in the well being of venezuelans does have to admit that for one reason or another the maduro government has failed to provide for the masses in the ways that the chavez government did for so many years jorge martin when speaking to chuck mertz said while he was certainly a chavez supporter he was open to criticism of maduro his criticism unlike the u s corporate media came from a left perspective he argued that maduro s downfall came because he made concessions to the free market opposition this opposition has only sabotaged the economy despite maduro s willingness to play ball according to martin it is similar to the u s where centrism while much lauded as a virtue will always be sabotaged by the right if you give these bastards an inch they will take a mile martin instead argues that the entire economy must be owned by the state half measures with the capitalists simply leaves them too much power and as a result they will destroy you for trying bernie could learn from maduro s mistakes in fact these men may have more in common than either would like to believe bernie like maduro has chosen to remain relevant politically over a radical left politics that puts the people first as oil prices fell sanctions mounted regime change threats abounded and people began to starve maduro chose to make concessions to neoliberal development and the privatization of the market this while saving maduro in the short term has only devastated the economy for working class venezuelans and it is the reason that some venezuelans really do want maduro to go likewise bernie continues to prop up the democratic party and the american empire in the hopes that one day they will throw him a bone according to opec 95 percent of venezuela s wealth comes from oil exports venezuela is in an economic crisis in part because the price of oil plummeted oil acts like a cash crop for poorer countries under structural adjustment programs facilitated by the imf and the world bank smaller economies specialize in a single product acting as exporters for larger countries with more diverse economies as a result historically colonized countries are extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market and are left without long term economic stability even if the economy is properly managed ironically for the critics of socialism such tides only justify a socialist model that draws its funding for an economy from far more diverse sources the public turns out leaving the entire economy in the hands of a few people is not only unjust but unstable commentators whining about economic mismanagement of a socialist dictator operate in a completely mythical world if the united states wanted to help we could if the united states wants to hurt we can and we do blaming venezuela for not diversifying the economy then is simply blaming the victims of neocolonialism venezuela has to rely on exports because of structural adjustment loans that only allow countries to repay their debts in hard currency in a recent article praising u s sanctions the new york times admitted that u s consumption of oil provides venezeula with a key cash flow the united states simply does not need venezuela in the same way as venezuela needs us as they can sanction the oil and still trade with a plethora of dependent governments in the middle east to the contrary if venezuela does not do the bidding of the united states their people starve and their government officials lose legitimacy as a result even good leaders may be in trouble as their economies fail often to no fault of their own it is the opinion of some that the government of nicholas maduro which certainly rose up with the left forces of hugo chavez is now choosing its own power over the will of the people the fact that the original failure is no result of socialism is important but that does not change the actions that have followed mike gonzalez of jacobin tracks a return to authoritarianism and neoliberalism to stay in power that said we can pull three clear themes out of the government s behavior a revival of foreign investment in extractive industries a growing militarization of the government and the transformation of the united socialist party of venezuela psuv into an instrument of political control pointing these things out does not make on an advocate of regime change it actually points to the real crisis of neoliberal imperialism dependent governments who wish to stay in power are forced to play ball with large corporations in order to provide any material gains for their people in the past venezuela could maintain independence from imperialism largely because it had the leverage to do so given its large oil exports as prices and production have dipped and with the somewhat unique management skills of chavez absent we have seen neoliberal capital invade such a dynamic is present everywhere take the logic for putting oil pipelines put through indigenous communities in the united states and canada these communities are the ones most hurt by capitalism and the ones most resistant to it and yet because of capitalism s sabotage they need money and have little power to stop capitalism from invading gonzalez continues maduro has suggested one solution to the massive hole in the state budget the arco minero venezuela s amazon region the area represents 12 percent of the national territory and holds a cornucopia of minerals oil and gas additionally it is the country s principal source of freshwater chavez rejected a development proposal some years ago for environmental reasons and in recognition of indigenous communities human and territorial rights but last summer maduro began inviting multinational corporations to bid for concessions the sensible resistance to global capitalists by chavez was only possible because at least for a time the country had enough resources and enough government control to hold the rich at bay now that venezuela has less production of oil and the ruling class has a stronger grip over the government capitalists can swoop in to save the day the state like the individual under neoliberal capital acts as a rentier a debtor given few options to genuinely compete in the market the underclass is forced to accept development projects in their communities that have devastating environment effects profits that go towards the 1 and a slight padding for those who agree to help facilitate it this is why socialism must be an international venture as long as neocolonialism remains in place there will be no sustainable model for socialism the economies are too interconnected and without a clear advantage in resources socialist countries can simply be sanctioned out of the competition left to rely upon exports to rich countries poor countries only hold power as long as rich countries are willing to buy too much power in the hands of the people means not enough profits and projects for the rich therefore socialism becomes a problem and socialist governments will be punished as a result socialist countries will become poor and rich countries will proclaim socialism doesn t work when in reality capitalism is what made the people hungry socialism is what made the people dangerous but there is sadly an inevitable shelf life to socialism as long as the world powers remain capitalist the rich remain powerful and the poor remain dependent for socialism to succeed in the long term there must be a global revolution when the united states calls for intervention based on the issues of democracy and human rights we fail to acknowledge our own role in the current crisis if we should be intervening in anything it should be the imf the world bank and other institutions of global capital that rig the economy against working people especially in the global south this would go a long way to curbing the human suffering in venezuela a blind allegiance to the nicholas maduro would fail to cut to the heart of the issue a more honest assessment would admit that building a prosperous economy for the masses under neocolonialism is a near impossibility and that maduro s concessions to neoliberalism is a predictable if not inevitable consequence of this structure it is clear that many venezuelans want maduro gone but they are wise enough to know that if this regime change is facilitated by the united states and other western actors a change will only cement these dynamics under the guise of a free and fair market the reason many left governments become authoritarian militaristic and corrupt is that they have to compete with capitalist governments for power as left governments are left out of the free market of competition they fail to provide for people in the ways they promised therefore they must either compete with capitalist governments through the military venezuela has been getting arms from russia for years or they must stifle descent to stay in power this has never been a problem of communism or socialism but a natural consequence of capitalism and an understandable response by the left as capitalism takes its hold the only way to stop capitalism is to eliminate it all together for as long as competition remains it will be competition itself capitalism that will triumph the unfortunate reality for the self determination of venezuelans is that to compete in the neocolonial economy their government has to someone s bidding the united states giving venezuela no other options has meant them turning to russia a risky play to stay afloat the sanctions of the united states have effectively decimated the bolivar currency of venezuela as a result some statistics say that as high as 90 of the country does not have enough food trump s war on the poor and brown continues to an extreme extent in venezuela russia itself suffers from u s sanctions making its people another victim of american imperialism its government though remains capitalist and in some cases imperialist and its relationship with venezuela while in many ways admirable is ultimately still an unequal neocolonial relationship that leaves venezuela at the mercy of russia and its capitalists after u s sanctions pushed maduro s electorate to starvation he had few options he could give in to the opposition which was only going to bring his country to the right and therefore push it into long term chaos or he could turn to russia who could operate in much the same way the u s would have which is basically to loot a desperate country in exchange for cash loans ultimately maduro has done some of both as maduro is pushed to the brink of both his people s and his own survival he has sold state owned oil to russia in exchange for cash nine of venezuela s most important petroleum projects have been sold to russia according to reuters ultimately this plan only further hurts the people of venezuela as their assets are sold off on the cheap to an imperialist power amid food and medicine shortages the concession for quick cash is predictable but no less worrisome regime change facilitated by neocolonial powers will only cement the current dynamics of dependence cheering on maduro and russia as the lesser evil is a more reasonable response than most but it is clear that in large part because of u s sanctions even these actors have not provided for working class venezuelans it is easier said than done to return to a prosperous socialism because so much of chavez s success was based in the capitalist demand for oil that could be spread to the masses with a strong enough government the real dictators are the global capitalists who create such dynamics only overthrowing them and seizing their power will guarantee long term solutions for the international working class for now nicholas maduro and his dependence on russia remains the lesser evil and intervention should be opposed not just for sovereignty reasons but for practical ones the working class deserves far better than what neocolonialism and neoliberalism can provide and if the people are to be saved it will be by their communal will if the one good criticism of maduro is that he under enormous political pressure has made concessions to the opposition we should greatly fear a situation where the opposition takes full control from mint press news the oil reporting agency s p global platts reported that in the immediate wake of the us anointing juan guaidó as venezuela s supposed president the opposition leader already drafted plans to introduce a new national hydrocarbons law that establishes flexible fiscal and contractual terms for projects adapted to oil prices and the oil investment cycle in addition guaido is bringing the imf and world bank back to venezuela in full force something chavez opposed strongly the policy of these structures is quite simply austerity in order to allow a government to trade with a rich imperialist country like the united states venezuela would have to agree to cut social programs privatize their markets bernie grumbles a lot about student loans in this country and i am grateful for that but he fails to recognize that the exact same dynamics occur in countries like venezuela and have disastrous effects left with the choice of starving through sanctions or debt programs that hand over the government s keys to the private market south american governments have been pushed out and if too much resistance is given they are simply handed a coup likely with a trump like fascist as the head and a neoliberal corporatist as the body if the united states were really to become an economy owned by the state it would be tremendous not only for the working poor in this country but for the entire globe right now the united state operates as a welfare state for the rich where the poor pay for everything from the research behind the rich s innovations to the grotesque military that the rich use to loot resources from poorer countries it is admirable that bernie wants to make us a welfare state for the poor again but his maga plan will be sabotaged and even if implemented easily reversed because the rich will still own the means of production if not the distribution of the gains hugo chavez could only provide for the working people because his state owned the economy and it could keep the rich at bay what it could not control was the global market which fluctuates especially for dependent single resource countries of the global south nor could he completely control the government of the united states and the capital behind it which would either loot or invade a sustainable socialist future for the world then relies in large part on the imperialist powers becoming socialist too this appears a long way off not just because of corrupt campaign finance system in the u s but because of a loyalty to imperialism across the political spectrum the venezuelan people know what the phrase our revolution means and could teach uncle sanders a thing or two if he cared to listen related link

you know your regime s days are numbered when you start eyeing your bullion indeed gold s status as store of value as money the only currency available when yours is worthless has come into play with respect to the crisis that has been unfolding in venezuela over the last couple of years and appears to be reaching its peak the mysterious plane on tuesday a venezuelan politician tweeted that a russian boeing 777 had landed in caracas intending to transport 20 tons of gold stored in the central bank while jose guerra couldn t provide any evidence of the bullion haul worth about 840 million or 20 of its central bank reserves bloomberg confirmed it separately a person with direct knowledge of the matter told bloomberg news that 20 tons of gold have been set aside in the central bank for loading the news outlet reported on friday however the maduro regime canceled the shipment where could the gold have been going we don t know but we can make an educated guess based on venezuela s recent gold transactions swiss trade data venezuela used to sell gold to switzerland reveals that venezuela exported almost 100 of 2 billion in gold exports over the last two years to turkey and the united arab emirates 1 1 billion to uae and 901 million to turkey in november the country was reportedly planning to sell 15 tonnes to the uae in return for cash euros russia has also received

venezuela s state owned oil company pdvsa which the us believes to be a vehicle for embezzlement the oil sanctions are expected to affect about 7 billion in assets immediately and another 11 billion this year cnn said us purchases of venezuelan oil will be blocked the russian connection so where was the russian plane planning to go with 20 tons of gold a little research shows that maduro needs financial support from russia and is using the only thing he has left as collateral for borrowing more bullion the kremlin loaned the country about 3 billion in 2017 but compared to venezuela s 120 billion debt it s a drop in the bucket the new york times reports russia lent venezuela 10 billion from 2013 17 for a price oil and influence last year the biggest oil company in the world state owned rosneft bought nearly half of citgo pdvsa s refining subsidiary in the united states the purchase was collateral for a 1 5b loan the kremlin made to pdvsa the citgo deal was part of a strategy by russia to use rosneft to achieve foreign policy objectives rosneft s investments have also been focused on cuba china egypt and vietnam and it has been seeking deals around the eastern mediterranean and africa areas where it contends with american interests using its oil company as a geopolitical tool has given russia more running room at a time when western sanctions weigh heavily on its economy the new york times for venezuela the loans avoided a debt default while helping rosneft to lessen the pain of us and european sanctions against the company in fact russia has become venezuela s new banker states new york times replacing china which has given up making loans pdvsa used the russian money to keep producing oil also both russia and china use oil as currency they both accept payment of venezuelan oil in exchange for debt repayments good for venezuela since it avoids having to dip into foreign exchange reserves knowing all this the russian plane parked on the tarmac in caracas waiting for 20 tons of gold begins to make more sense the monroe doctrine it does seem strange though that russia is so flagrantly meddling in venezuela a country clearly within the us zone of influence in the 1800 s the united states under president james monroe invoked the monroe doctrine which stated that any effort by european nations to control any independent state in north or south america would be viewed as an unfriendly disposition towards the united states the intent of the monroe doctrine was to free the newly independent colonies of latin america from mostly spain and portugal so that the states could exert its influence undisturbed since then the monroe doctrine has at times been invoked when us interests in its own backyard were threatened sometimes going as far as regime change a recent book by foreign affairs contributor lindsey o rourke notes that the us attempted 18 overthrows of latin american governments during the cold war 10 of which saw us forces assume power the states was accused of instigating a coup in venezuela an allegation the us denies and trying to assassinate maduro s predecessor hugo chavez as for current us interests in venezuela we know that president trump considered invading venezuela in 2017 but was talked out of it by his national security advisor and others in his cabinet we also know that us geopolitical interests have been threatened recently by russia which in december landed two nuclear capable blackjack bombers this was a way for russia to shore up support for a key ally and its top oil supplier but it was also a means of provoking the us a violation of the 200 year old monroe doctrine the kremlin is trying to take advantage of a weak regime by cozying up to maduro offering financial aid and military support thereby gaining influence in the region the orinoco the lingering question though is why does the united states care so much about venezuela the media reports this week are full of quotes from us officials saying they want to free the suffering venezuelan people from a corrupt regime we ve heard this from the us many times before at ahead of the herd we re a little more cynical and we always follow the money a little digging reveals some interesting truths at the end of december oilprice com reported a confrontation between the venezuelan navy and two norwegian ships conducting seismic work in the waters off guyana next door to venezuela the us jumped to guyana s defense saying the venezuelan navy was being aggressive why should they care because of what lies under the surface as oilprice com reports the move comes as exxonmobil and its partner hess corp are spending heavily to develop a string of oil discoveries off the coast of guyana the discoveries encompass some 5 billion barrels of oil reserves and offshore guyana has quickly jumped to the top of the priority list for exxonmobil as such guyana a very small and poor country on the northern coast of south america is home to one of the most active and attractive offshore plays in the world in early 2018 exxon unveiled a spending plan that would allow the company to significantly increase oil production by 2025 after years of stagnating output exxon s sterling reputation among shareholders has taken a hit in recent years as it has struggled to grow and some of its peers have caught up to the supermajor in fact many analysts now see some of exxon s rivals as a much more compelling investment exxon s strategy to boost profits and expand production hinges on two key upstream targets the first the permian basin comes as no surprise because every other oil company seems to be betting their fortunes on texas shale the second however is offshore guyana the us government protecting american oil companies you don t say if the states can help bring a pro american government to power in venezuela it will assist big oil companies in tapping into the largest oil reserves in the world we find it especially interesting that exxon is heading to offshore guyana for its next oil score us shale oil is heading for a fall in the next few years due to the high depletion rate of shale wells producers have to pump more oil faster just to keep up a phenomenon known as the red queen syndrome putting a pro western government in power would also help to develop the orinoco belt a heavy and extra heavy oilsands region the size of costa rica venezuela has 298 billion barrels of proven oil reserves the largest in the world most are in the orinoco not only is there a lot of oil it s also easier and cheaper to produce than canadian oilsands because it doesn t contain bitumen the oily sludge that is hard to process but the oil is still expensive to extract like alberta it has to be open pit mined or pumped to surface using horizontal directional drilling in the 1990s chavez brought in foreign companies for their technologies but in 2006 07 he took control of the industry despite big investments from exxonmobil chevron conocophillips and bp he gave pdvsa 60 of the four best projects in the orinoco enforcing the order by sending troops exxon and conoco walked away and sued eventually getting compensated while the others stayed content to hang onto 40 stakes the financial times reports the flight of foreign oil companies and technology along with the chavez government s failure to appreciate the level of capital expenditures required meant that orinoco s output declined according to forbes venezuelan oil production has slumped to 1 5 million barrels a day just over half of what is was before 2006 conclusion what do you do when your country is falling apart if you re venezuelan president maduro you find bullion to sell or use as a bargaining chip this is a sad state of affairs especially for the people who must be enduring a monetary hardship the equal of weimar germany but on the other hand it s a solid vindication of gold you don t see maduro trying to sell bitcoin to pay the bills gold is often criticized by wall street as being kind of a useless investment institutional investors tend to prefer investments that are thought to contain the potential for growth growth sprouts an investment has to produce a growing revenue stream if it doesn t grow it doesn t compound so gold is rejected as an investment because it doesn t produce sprouts meaning the steady income and systematic growth so sought after by institutional investors just isn t there but that s not why we the people should own gold gold is insurance gold gives all of us something that fiat paper money or any other financial innovation cannot deliver in times of the turmoil escaping nazi germany or buying food medicine water or even toilet paper in a crisis like venezuela is going through what do you do when your paper money is worthless you sell barter and trade your gold just like maduro
you have 5 articles left sign up for a free account or log in just under half of all spending from endowments goes to supporting student financial aid according to data included for the first time in an annual survey of college and university endowments now the question is whether that s high or low and whether it provides any meaningful insight into colleges and universities priorities the annual study of endowments released today by the national association of college and university business officers and the financial services company tiaa includes the headline finding that endowment returns fell by about a third to 8 2 percent net of fees for the year ending in june 2018 that rate lifted the 10 year average return to 5 8 percent which falls short of a 7 2 percent target set to keep endowments purchasing power intact in the face of spending and the cost of inflation over time but this year s survey also includes an enticing bit of data about how colleges and universities spend the money their endowments generate on average 49 percent of total endowment withdrawals go toward student scholarships and financial aid programs another 16 percent of endowment spending goes toward supporting academic programs 10 percent supports faculty positions and 7 percent supports campus operations the remaining 18 percent falls under a category covering all other purposes it would include any number of functions like hospital operations patient health care or community services in the past the survey has not included information on how institutions allocate the money they spend from their endowments and the data released today didn t include much in the way of context nacubo doesn t have previous years of data on where spending goes making it impossible to compare this year s numbers against the past the business officers association didn t give survey participants specific definitions for each spending category meaning respondents reported spending by categories based on what they felt was the best fit so accounting could differ from institution to institution a nacubo researcher said an analysis breaking down spending destinations by endowment size won t be possible before a full report is released in march differences in the way institutions may have interpreted the question and in the number of institutions in each size segment that answered the question would make an apples to apples comparison difficult the only information the association would release was that in general institutions with larger endowments tended to report dedicating lower percentages of their endowment spending to financial aid than those with smaller endowments but those wealthier institutions still spend more on financial aid when measured in dollars because their endowments generate so much more money this is not a surprise once you consider that schools with big endowments tend to have a greater number of endowed chairs faculty research slots while schools with smaller endowments tend to have fewer endowed chairs said ken redd nacubo senior director of research and policy analysis in an email but this general sense cannot yet be proven with the data we have given the possible effects of non response bias once we try to generate statistics by endowment sizes nonetheless nacubo clearly thought the spending information was important it was the fourth of 14 slides in a presentation for reporters in addition the question of how colleges and universities spend the money generated by their endowments has grown more and more politically contentious with the issue coming to a head about a year ago when republicans passed a tax reform package that included a tax on endowment earnings at the wealthiest institutions higher education associations and wealthy institutions have fought desperately against the tax saying endowments represent a significant source of revenue and that students gain the most from the financial resources in fact across our institutions endowments support a significant and growing portion of our operations for many endowments provide almost half of annual revenues read one letter that 49 wealthy institutions sent last year to congressional leaders students are the leading beneficiary of these resources with each of us committed to significant efforts to enhance affordability yet a large scale accounting of how colleges are spending their endowment earnings has remained elusive individual cases have cropped up over the years providing insight into how much endowment spending is going to student aid at some colleges and universities but a wider look at spending across hundreds of institutions remains conspicuously absent there s no good guidance on how much money colleges have in their endowments for different functions and then how they choose to use the dollars that are unrestricted said robert kelchen an assistant professor of higher education at seton hall university the new study addresses that question only up to a point it includes survey responses from 802 colleges and universities but it doesn t get into key details that would shed light on institutional priorities it s not clear how much money being spent on student aid is need based or non need based also unclear is how much of the spending on student aid or any other category comes from unrestricted funds and how much is required to be spent in certain ways because of agreements with donors as a result higher ed experts and economists weren t sure how to categorize the statistic it is eye catching but practically meaningless said jonathan meer a professor at texas a m university who researches charitable giving and the economics of education finding the percentage of institutions total expenditures devoted to financial aid would be more meaningful than focusing on endowments said charles clotfelter a professor of economics and law at duke university in another email money collected from endowments has the same ability to pay for scholarships as money from other sources like state appropriations or tuition he added so endowment spending alone isn t a full picture of college and university priorities the 49 percent number is highly confusing said art hauptman an independent public policy consultant who specializes in higher education finance institutions with large endowments likely use more money to keep the sticker price of tuition lower than the cost of educating their students while not dedicating nearly as much toward financial aid that would buy down the sticker price students pay most private institutions don t have substantial endowments though so the bulk of the student aid they provide comes in the form of discounts off their sticker prices only 10 percent of spending going to endowed chairs across the higher education sector also seems low he said on the other hand if it is really true that half of endowment income and annual gifts is used for financial aid that is a scary thought hauptman said in an email that would mean that institutions are being incredibly aggressive in their pricing usually virtually nothing to keep tuition below spending per student and that any increase in tuition gets eaten up almost entirely by financial aid advocates for spending more on financial aid for low income students agreed more context is necessary to some extent we know that higher numbers are probably better than lower numbers said andrew nichols senior director of higher education research and data analytics at the education trust who co wrote a 2016 report arguing that small changes in endowment spending at wealthy institutions could significantly increase aid for low income students i think it s difficult to say in aggregate what it means he said of the nacubo spending data it would be easier to tell if we were looking at institutional data and were able to see what other outcomes were nacubo and tiaa leaders thought the statistic meant something they said in a conference call with reporters that the 49 percent figure shows colleges and universities are dedicated to student affordability this was the largest single area of endowment spending as reported by survey participants said susan whealler johnston nacubo s president and chief executive officer this underscores the essential nature of endowments to student access and success as well as to college and university long term planning and goals returns fall in the short term rise in the long term the annual endowment study s primary focus has not been on how endowments spend of course it s been what they earn how they invest and how they ve grown on those points the study shows endowments posting a strong fiscal year in 2018 but not as strong as in 2017 returns also weren t high enough to keep endowment watchers comfortable that the funds will be able to maintain their spending power over the long term breaking the data down further shows a continuing divergence between the wealthiest institutions and everyone else the rich have been getting richer faster earning more on their investments in the process the 802 colleges and universities taking part in the study reported endowment returns averaging 8 2 percent net of fees for the fiscal year that ended in june 2018 that was down from 12 2 percent for the 2017 fiscal year but still much higher than 1 9 percent in 2016 lower performance in u s and international equity markets depressed endowment returns in the most recent year u s equities returned 13 6 percent in 2018 down from 17 6 percent the previous year non u s equities returned 6 8 percent after previously returning 20 2 percent two other asset classes also returned less in 2018 than in 2017 fixed income returned just half a percentage point after returning 2 4 percent in 2017 short term securities cash and other investments returned 1 3 percent down slightly from 1 4 percent the year before only one asset class saw better returns in 2018 than in the year before alternative strategies the broad asset class which includes investments like hedge funds private equity noncampus real estate distressed debt and commodities returned 8 3 percent that was up from 7 8 percent in 2017 the largest endowments invest much more heavily than others in alternative strategies while parts of the asset class have struggled some segments like private equity and venture capital have offered the potential for greater return therefore it s no shock that large endowments posted the best performance in 2018 when endowments are broken down by size the overwhelming trend is still the larger the endowment the easier it is to outperform said kevin o leary chief executive officer of tiaa endowment and philanthropic services during the conference call endowments with assets of over 1 billion returned 9 7 percent a full percentage point higher than the next best return when endowments were broken down by size net annual endowment returns fiscal year 2018 percent all institutions 8 2 over 1 billion 9 7 501 million to 1 billion 8 7 251 million to 500 million 8 5 101 million to 250 million 7 9 51 million to 100 million 7 7 25 million to 50 million 7 5 under 25 million 7 6 larger endowments have outperformed smaller endowments over time including over spans when alternative strategies did not perform as well as some other asset classes in part this could be because smaller endowments generally put more into fixed income investments which are considered less risky than other types of investments that may have more upside more important to college and university endowments than returns for a single year is how they are performing over time the average three year net annualized return across institutions for the period ending in 2018 came in at 6 2 percent for five years it was 7 3 percent and the average 10 year net annualized return perhaps the most important as colleges and universities look at long term performance while setting spending rates notched 5 8 percent last year the 10 year return was 4 6 percent this year s 10 year average rose in large part because the year that dropped off 2008 was a year of poor returns endowments returned 3 percent on average that year that dynamic could be good news for next year s 10 year average the 2009 fiscal year which covers the depths of the great recession saw net endowment returns plunge to 18 7 percent when that negative number drops from the 10 year average next year the metric will likely look better than it does today three five and 10 year net returns for period ending june 2018 percent 3 year 5 year 10 year all institutions 6 2 7 3 5 8 over 1 billion 6 8 8 2 6 0 501 million to 1 billion 6 2 7 4 5 6 251 million to 500 million 6 1 7 3 5 7 101 million to 250

number concerns o leary because it s below a 7 2 percent targeted rate of return endowments should earn over time to cover their average spending and inflation the average return was not able to crest the long term return objective at any time in the last decade he said further if you believe that we are entering into a rising interest rate environment the long term return objective should increase with those rates in inflation this headwind will make it even more challenging for schools to hit their targets especially considering increases in endowment spending other findings two thirds of colleges and universities in the study increased endowment spending and the median increase was 6 6 percent spending increases outpaced the rate of inflation which was 2 8 percent according to the higher education price index endowments are now funding 10 percent of an institution s operating budget on average the average is likely skewed by a small number of large endowments however harvard and yale which have the two largest endowments among private universities use endowment spending to cover more than a third of their budgets for example meanwhile endowments average effective spending rate didn t change between 2017 and 2018 the effective spending rate is the distribution marked for spending divided by the endowment market value at the beginning of the fiscal year it clocked in at 4 4 percent across all institutions and has not risen higher than 4 6 percent in a decade the largest endowments reported higher effective spending rates than endowments of most other sizes with one exception endowments of more than 1 billion had an effective spending rate of 4 6 percent matched only by endowments with between 51 million and 100 million in assets one notable difference between the two groups endowments with more than 1 billion spent 4 6 percent after ticking down by two tenths of a percent from the previous year while those with 51 million to 100 million hit the mark after inching up by one tenth of a point average annual effective spending rates endowments and related foundations percent size of endowment 2018 2017 all institutions 4 4 4 4 over 1 billion 4 6 4 8 501

institutions reported lower annual effective spending rates than private institutions 3 8 percent versus 4 7 percent just over three quarters of respondents 76 percent grew the real value of their endowments in the 2018 fiscal year largely because of positive market returns new gifts also contributed to endowment sizes totaling 9 9 billion among survey participants the median gift level rose from 3 2 million in 2017 to 3 7 million in 2018 public institutions had a higher median gift value than private institutions 5 million versus 3 1 million gifts ranged in size much more widely when looking at institutions by their wealth levels the median gift at small institutions was 376 000 at institutions with more than 1 billion in endowment assets the median gift was more than 50 million the 802 colleges and universities taking part in this year s study held a total of 616 5 billion in endowed assets the median endowment was about 140 2 million but that s skewed upward by large

35 percent of the total assets covered by the study the largest endowment in the country harvard had 38 3 billion 6 percent of all assets covered in the study looking at public versus private

the brookfield institute found that 41 5 of new brunswick s employed labour force members are in jobs that are at high risk of being affected by automation that means they have a 70 to 100 per cent probability of being affected over the next 20 years the disappearance of so many jobs in such a short period could severely strain our existing social welfare models in the five fiscal years between 2012 13 and 2016 17 new brunswick s personal income taxes accounted for an average of 28 of the province s own source budget revenue and an average of 18 of all revenue federal transfers contributed an average of 36 of the province s revenue during the period advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content an average of nearly 49 of the federal government s total revenue during these five years came from personal income taxes what happens when potentially 40 of the province s and country s income taxpayers suddenly cease to earn income nor will it only be low wage jobs hit by automation the brookfield study estimates the average income of workers with a high risk of job loss due to automation was 33 411 about 3 000 more than new brunswick s 2015 median income an individual earning that amount still would have paid 2 756 in federal income tax and 2 065 in provincial income tax this year the impact on

become unsustainable both due to expanded demand and severely diminished revenue sources moreover the social disruption caused by automation if not mitigated could produce unsavoury political outcomes donald trump s presidential election victory in the united states was partly driven by anxious working class voters who attributed free trade to diminished job prospects that were far more rooted in automation the rise of populist movement in europe also drawing support from such anxieties one idea that demands serious consideration is a guaranteed annual income gai a gai broadly speaking works like this citizens are provided with regular payments from the government that adjust according to a sliding scale based on the employment income these payments would cease once a certain employment

washington post 29 january the us charges also concern a claim that huawei offered bonuses to employees who stole confidential information from other firms a spokesman for china s ministry of industry and information technology said that the us had no proof to back up the charges and called them unfair and immoral china s foreign ministry said in a statement that beijing would resolutely protect the interests of chinese companies comment trade deal or not it is clear the tech war will rage on some us politicians have argued for a ban of selling microchips to huawei which could cause severe disruption for huawei in the short term however a step like that would in our view quickly back fire and possibly trigger a consumer boycott of us goods in china for more on huawei and the tech war see this article in foreign affairs is huawei a pawn in the trade war 30 january chinese pmi data weak but rays of light hint at bottom soon both the private and official version of pmi manufacturing was released this week the pmi is one of our favourite gauges of the state of the chinese business cycle the official version surprised a bit to the upside whereas the private version declined sharply some may say this is a sign that the official data are unreliable however it is actually the case that the official version has dropped much more in previous months and the private version is simply catching up with this weakness see top chart on page 1 on a positive note the export orders in both sets of pmi point to stabilisation bottom and the same picture emerges when looking at metal prices which are normally a good real time indicator for chinese activity china consumes 50 of global metals china announced further stimulus for consumers this week offering subsidies on cars and home

publishing magnate steve forbes doesn t know exactly what he ll talk about when he gives a speech at ave maria school of law in naples florida in march i always speak from notes he said ahead of his visit and he always wants to use fresh material forbes said he does know a big focus will be on moral and ethical leadership in the business world the timing couldn t be better forbes said steve forbes chairman and editor in chief of forbes media ave maria law school created a new speakers series to introduce its students to ethical leaders from near and far the school in north naples recently started a profiles in ethical leadership program to host distinguished ceos entrepreneurs and other leaders at its campus to share their insights with students forbes will be among those leaders the last speaker in the inaugural program the signature event will raise money for student scholarships it s a little bit different than what you find at other schools forbes said of his interest in speaking at the catholic law school they are not taking a cookie cutter approach in a phone interview with the daily news forbes talked about everything from business to politics to the economy chocolate confusion missing tips on kisses prompts hershey to respond the trust factor it s an ideal time to talk about ethical leadership because of the trust factor said forbes chairman and editor in chief of forbes media there is less trust in government he said there is less trust in financial institutions less trust in the economic system less trust in the education system less trust which i think is the basis of it all in money the integrity of money that lack of trust is important because in so many ways the capitalist system runs on trust so what characteristics does forbes think define a truly great leader great leaders need to have a defined sense of direction a trust in their people and the strength to move forward by making difficult decisions even when they re not popular he said no matter how good you are there are always going to be things that don t go right mistakes you make events changes in the marketplace forbes said all sorts of things and sometimes there are no playbooks so you have to make decisions where you don t know how it s going to turn out good leaders need a wider sense of concern and responsibility rather than focusing so much on themselves and they need a long term perspective instead of just considering the present and what s in it for me forbes said we certainly try to do that in our space he said and try to also innovate if people sense that positive things can happen that creativity can bear fruit for the future the world of publishing has changed drastically since malcolm stevenson steve forbes jr joined the family business as a researcher for forbes magazine after graduating from princeton university in 1970 his grandfather an immigrant from scotland with only a grade school education started forbes in 1917 from the beginning he said forbes as a company had a belief in what s now known as entrepreneurial capitalism or private capital investing in private startups forbes never looked at business people as bad people in the first issue of the magazine my grandfather said the purpose of business was to produce happiness not to pile up millions not to pile up money today we call that entrepreneurial capitalism tech talk message to facebook and google don t mess with apple the drucker rule the media business forbes said has tried to keep the drucker rule in mind and continue to move forward the late peter drucker considered a management guru said every organization should always ask itself what is our purpose what is our mission what is it we are trying to do if you do that you re more likely not to get sidetracked and to stay the course forbes said the roads themselves may change but you still have a sense of where you want to go he said today the biggest generator of business for forbes media is its online publishing we had a very good 2018 forbes said we re off to a good start this year less than 15 percent of revenues comes from the magazine and the rest from online or other services the company he said now has 2 800 contracted contributors we run over 110 000 submissions a year so we re doing well there forbes said the key thing there is to remember what your goal is and your purpose is photo gallery forbes 10 top paid actresses of 2018 a drama critic some have compared his family s global media company to a drama critic and forbes thinks that s fitting we love it when a production is done right he said we hate it when a production is not done right the guiding light for the business has been to provide its viewers and readers with the information and insights they need to move ahead and live well forbes said we write about those who are doing right and those who are doing things wrong because there are always lessons to be learned he said the company is always pursuing new ideas and new opportunities forbes said we now have 40 international language editions around the world license agreements he said the scope of what we offer online is enormously expanded economy and trade with china what s forbes take on the u s economy the economy is strong he said i think it will be better reflected in the market the stock market when and if we get a trade deal achieved with china he believes the united states will strike a better trade deal with china within the next few months the china deal will be a pretty big one in terms of the amount of pledges to purchase products in the u s as far as that s concerned i think we will be even agreeing to sell them natural gas forbes said job advice here are two truths to help you build a successful career and future after the longest government shutdown in history recently ended forbes emphasized the importance of moving ahead with the renegotiated north american free trade agreement in one of his columns i think it does more good than harm he said if congress doesn t ratify it it s going to hurt the economy trump good for business forbes a republican candidate in the 1996 and 2000 presidential primaries said president donald trump s administration has been good for business in many ways they ve made enormously important strides in deregulation forbes said regulations are another form of taxation and when it s abused or overdone there can be bad consequences manufacturing he said is springing back to life again now that the government is not overburdening the sector with regulations the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 which significantly cut the federal corporate tax rate has been good for business too of course i would like a flat tax other than that this tax cut was not bad he describes the federal tax cut as a gift that will keep giving by not punishing people and businesses that are trying to get positive things done that low rate will be a boon for a long time to come he said once key trade disputes are resolved forbes said he expects more business owners in the u s to invest in and expand their businesses it s picked up a little bit but i think it s got room for imminent growth he said asked why he ran for president twice forbes said he wanted to advance a pro growth agenda that included a flat tax medical savings accounts a new social security system for working americans and a strong national defense he didn t see anyone else raising a hand for the job with those ideas at the time i decided instead of complaining to do something about it so i ran forbes said would he consider another presidential run you never say never he said but my role now is an agitator this article originally appeared on naples daily news steve forbes talks trust trade and good leadership in exclusive interview

january was a month of bad economic news when there was any news at all i e when data wasn t delayed because of the government shutdown until wednesday then we found out from payroll processor adp that private employers added 213 000 jobs this month hours later the federal reserve spooked enough by the tumult over the shutdown and the manifest nuttiness emanating from the white house and the shutdown said it was out of the business of raising interest rates for a while and stocks zoomed with the dow jones industrial average djia 0 06 s rising 435 points and the standard poor s 500 spx 0 86 tacking on 1 6 has the orange combover morphed into goldilocks hmmm more like we re getting a reminder that fundamentals matter more than politics right now the fundamentals are still pretty good the congressional budget office estimates the shutdown cost the economy a modest 11 billion it s a 20 trillion a year economy and 8 billion of it will be made up as federal workers get back pay employers are still hiring not everything is perfect there was a very weak report on existing home sales from the national association of realtors and business and consumer confidence surveys are weakening but with the shutdown ended president donald trump s erratic behavior isn t killing us for now so what happens next first take the fed s easing off the brakes seriously inflation is so low still that the central doesn t really have to raise interest rates only 1 9 in core inflation the last 12 months and oil and gasoline prices excluded from the core number have been falling recently after spiking higher earlier in 2018 there s more disinflation coming our way later this year too as new oil pipelines in texas are completed letting producers more freely move the southwest s fast growing crude production to refineries in the rest of the country i was in texas last weekend where the first gas station i saw was charging 1 81 a gallon for regular about 40 cents below the national average because the pipeline shortage forces local producers to keep more of their crude in the region while prices might not fall that much nationally when those locked down supplies become available to more americans we re going to get a dose of what people in the interior of the country are having and it will give the fed the ability to wait before raising rates much or any more obviously the fed going more slowly than had been expected is good for stocks it sure looks like this fed chair may believe in a triple not dual mandate maximum employment stable inflation and a solid equity market independent economist joel naroff told clients second the next big way trump can mess things up is by hiking tariffs on 250 billion of chinese made manufactured goods if the two nations don t reach a revised trade deal by march as the wall street journal reported both sides are under pressure to make a deal china because its economic growth is slowing and trump because the ineptitude of his capitulation in the government shutdown when he didn t get the wall on the mexican border he wanted ego often trumps the president s appreciation of his own self interest but his incentives are to play ball and take a less than radical deal with china it keeps the markets calm preserving more of the gains that bolster his taking credit for economic stewardship and to put a none too fine point on it he needs a stretch where he doesn t look like a clown to all but his most devoted followers but all of this really only gets the economy through the next few months after that the market will depend on corporate earnings which are coming in strong for the fourth quarter facebook fb 0 23 and apple beat estimates facebook trounced them but estimates for the rest of the year marketwide are still declining cfra research strategist sam stovall said so those strong fundamentals i mentioned a moment ago we re finally at the point in the expansion where the weakening is apparent on the horizon it might fix before we get to the middle to late part of 2019 or it might not the fed is mindful that financial conditions have tightened global growth is slowing the outcome of ongoing trade disputes remains uncertain as does the outcome of brexit regions financial economist richard moody said what remains fairly subdued inflation gives the the latitude to see how these issues resolve before deciding on the appropriate path of the fed funds rate going forward this is clearly the appropriate stance to take at this time source marketwatch
pakistan china strategic nexus is unequivocally the most formidable national security challenge for india the two countries have romanticized this relationship by acliché higher than mountain deeper than ocean stronger than steel the foreign policy mandarins in beijing have coined a new epithet for pakistan ba taa the iron brother pakistan china strategic partnership is essentially an asymmetric relationship pakistan is a failing state whereas china is on the trajectory to become a great power by the middle of this century what makes the two strange bedfellows click is their shared disdain for india to put in the words of noted former pakistani diplomat hussain haqqani for china pakistan is a low cost secondary deterrence to india and for pakistan china is a high value guarantor of security against india president xi jinping during his april 2015 visit to islamabad had alluded china will be pakistan s net security provider china uses pakistan as a millstone to fix india in the south asian orbit and pursue its stratagem kill with a borrowed knife rawalpindi plays the dragon card to pose a two front dilemma for india while it prosecutes proxy war in kashmir with impunity cpec the strategic flagship programme of xi jinping s signature belt and road initiative bri has further cemented their strategic embrace pakistan is the linchpin in china s south asia and indian ocean strategy china has become de facto a third party in the kashmir dispute the evolving geopolitical milieu has profound strategic ramifications for india evolution of nexus president ayub khan had mooted the idea of india pakistan joint defence act against china though parried by pandit nehru in 1963 under a boundary agreement pakistan ceded 5100 sq km shaksgam valleys to china after the two sides signed a boundary agreement since then their bilateral relations were marked by a number of agreements notably comprehensive nuclear cooperation agreement 1986 free trade agreement 2003 treaty of friendly cooperation and good neighborly relations 2005 cpec and 51 other agreements signed in apr 2015 during the early seventies pakistan facilitated rapprochement between uncle sam and the dragon the opening up of karakoram highway kkh in 1997 further boosted their partnership in the mid nineties beijing covertly aided pakistan foisted taliban regime in kabul and in the wake of 1998 nuclear tests china provided financial assistance to islamabad to tide over financial crisis accrued from the us economic sanctions china has scuttled india s entry into the nuclear supplier group and blocked un resolution 1267 to declare mohd azhar as a terrorist nevertheless beijing has remained calculative in rendering open support to pakistan during the past conflicts particularly during 1971 war when china choose to keep the northern borders dormant during the kargil conflict beijing favored maintaining the sanctity of the lc and resolution of conflict through dialogue also beijing has voted in favor of financial action task force decision to put pakistan in the grey list for abetting terror financing nonetheless pakistan china strategic nexus remains on a firm footing in all its determinants determinants of nexus strategic the bri and its flagship project the cpec have increased the salience of pakistan in the strategic calculus of china kkh is the jugular vein that connects xinjiang via the indian claimed territory of gilgit baltistan gb with pakistan gwadar has emerged as the strategic pivot in the arabian sea where the continental and maritime prongs of bri converge cpec will provide an alternate trade routes to the strait of malacca a choke point for china sea trade notably in ladakh and northern kashmir the political and military objectives of pakistan and china converge china is in illegal occupation of 38000 sq km of aksai china and 5100 sq km of shaksgam valley pakistan on the other hand occupies about 70000 sq km of indian territory through which china is building the cpec but for gblink pakistan and china will have no common borders it is for this reason and in deference to china s concerns pakistan had issued the new gb order 2018 making it virtually a quasi 5th province of pakistan china is wooing afghanistan by extending the cpec there and assisting afghans inter alia to set up a brigade size military base in the wakhan corridor bordering the xinjiang province pakistan has also become a linchpin of russia cobbled anti us alliance that includes china iran and taliban if taliban reaches a power sharing arrangement in kabul both pakistan and china will tacitly call for truncation of india s pre eminent role in afghanistan economic pakistan china trade is slightly more than 20 billion with more than 18 billion imports from china and less than 2 00 billion exports from pakistan in addition to projected investment of 62 billion for the cpec china has pledged 2 billion as a bail out to shore up pakistan s diminishing foreign exchange reserves cpec is estimated to boost pakistan s gdp by 2 to 3 create 700 000 jobs and produce 5000 mw of surplus power however there is consternation about pakistan plunging into a debt trap it is known that 91 of revenues from gwadar port over next 40 years will go to china with nearly half the cpec projects completed pakistan currently owes china 23 billion after the completion of 62 billion investments pakistan would owe china a whopping 90 billion pakistan will come under heavy debit and end up becoming china s satellite state diplomatic in the diplomatic domain pakistan encashes on china s veto power at the unsc islamabad swears by one china policy be it china s position on taiwan tibet or feigning ignorance about the human rights violations committed against uighur muslim population in xinjiang for china pakistan is a conduit for spreading influence in the muslim world as far as kashmir china has moved away from the position of studied neutrality to that of overt pro pakistan stance security pakistan is the world s largest recipient of china s military largesse as per sipri 47 of china s military hardware goes to pakistan making it the top

expansion of kkh will have military implications for india the 1300 km long road is said to have about 100 tunnels that could be used for hiding missiles there are a number of axial arteries leading

islamic state of khorasan province iskp east turkestan islamic movement etim baluchistan liberation army bla and tehrik e taliban of pakistan tpp pose threats both for pakistan and china in the past the killings of chinese citizens by pakistan based terrorists groups had strained their relations leading to the storming of lal masjid china is well aware of the linkages between hardcore elements within the isi and the etim china s oppression of uighurs in xinjiang will sooner or later generate a blow back effect in pakistan against china such contingencies could strain bilateral relations security implications for india collusive and hybrid threats from pakistan and china are a stark reality at the low end of the conflict spectrum india will continue to face proxy war from pakistan and creeping assertiveness at the lac from china concurrently india will face the risk of asymmetric threats in the cyber information and outer space there exist a number of flash points such as jihadi strikes and border action team bat actions by pakistan and depsangor chumar or doklam type incursions by the pla resolute indian responses such as surgical strikes and quid pro quo actions could take the conflict up the escalation ladder to sectoral conflicts or even conventional wars under a fragile nuclear overhang ironically segments of our political class and strategic community take a very benign view of collusive hybrid threat scenarios ignoring what pierre wack an unconventional french thinker said in our times of rapid change and discontinuity crises of perception the inability to see novel reality emerging being locked inside obsolete assumptions have become the main cause of strategic failure can india afford another strategic failure strategic response pakistan is like a toxic jelly that may change its form but will retain its toxicity towards india china and india with divergent and venerable cultures and vast population are likely to compete with each other for resources and influence for the decades to come india will encounter strong pakistan china strategic nexus for india it is a strategic imperative to remain a pre eminent power in south asia and the ior be a strong asian power and an important global stakeholder development of comprehensive national power cnp synergy in the instruments of national power and strategic configuration of cnp for furtherance of national interests is a sine qua non for india new delhi and beijing will have to evolve a modus vivendi to steer their vexed relations along a positive trajectory india should assiduously address the issue of widening power symmetry vis a vis china as far as pakistan is concerned india needs to sharpen its punitive deterrence capabilities by investing inter alia in the domain of non contact non kinetic warfare to raise the cost of proxy war for rawalpindi diplomatically india should step up its efforts to garner international support to pressurise pakistan on the issues such as grey listing of pakistan in the fatf and sanctions under the un resolutions 1267 to reclaim its strategic influence in the immediate neighborhood india will have to become a credible net security provider an anchor of regional economic integration and a soft power hub india should continue to follow a multi vector policy foreign and leverage its stature to build a concert of middle level states in the balance of power in order to mitigate the two front dilemma india needs to balance out by investing in the free and open indo pacific policy and india iran afghanistan

export markets foreign capital imported technology and essential inputs such as oil the world economy also matters a great deal for the past two decades the world economic forum wef that held its annual 2019 meeting in davos switzerland from january 22 to 25 has been the premier platform that annually reviews the status of the global economy and where it is headed this year the wef did not have the same glitter that it had in the past almost all the leaders of the top g20 countries including presidents donald trump of usa xi jinping of china emmanuel macron of france and prime ministers theresa may of uk and narendra modi of india skipped the meeting they lead the countries that play a dominant role in globalization in their absence a few second tier country leaders gained some prominence most of the ceos of global multinational titans that play a key role in globalization from the business side were present but reports from davos suggest that even in business the mood was somewhat subdued and mixed while ict companies appeared to be optimistic oil companies and the some segments of the automobile industry that did not have the best year in 2018 were less so in a way this year davos captured the uncertainties that face globalization 4 0 that the forum adopted this year as its main theme globalization 4 0 globalization 4 0 is broadly defined as connectivity of digital and virtual systems and ideas and services across borders davos tried to connect globalization 4 0 to what is known as the fourth industrial revolution ir4 ir4 refers to the development and adoption of the latest technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence ai that have the potential to be very disruptive technologies under globalization 4 0 if ai and robotics take over what humans do in the workplace the world will face a major socio economic and political challenge examples include driverless cars and taxis and robots doing routine work of assembly line workers productivity will increase in such a situation but the allocation of income will become a major challenge because people need well paying jobs globalization 4 0 is also seeking answers to other major challenges that globalization 3 0 created one is the large increase in international migration from poor to rich countries that has created political turmoil in europe and usa the purpose of this article is to draw the attention of the reader to some of the latest issues that confront the global economy in the context of globalization 3 0 and 4 0 that can potentially impact the future of sri lanka s economy since about 1990 the gathering in davos has been seen more as a celebration of the triumph of capitalism and globalization the soviet union collapsed in 1989 90 and almost every country including russia and china abandoned socialism for capitalism eu welcomed many of the east european countries that became liberal democracies and expanded membership from 16 in 2004 to 28 today world output growth accelerated under the new order in 1980 global output was 10 8 trillion in 1990 21 8t an increase of 102 2000 31 5t 44 5 2010 66 0t 109 5 and 2017 80 7t 22 3 major changes in key economic policies especially in trade and foreign capital flows in the leading economies contributed to the economic growth described above the simple mean tariff in usa was cut from 5 6 in 1989 to 4 0 in 2000 and in eu from 4 1 to 2 4 china s tariffs dropped from 41 in 1992 to 16 3 in 2000 and india s from 79 in 1990 to 32 5 in 1999 sri lanka s tariffs dropped from 28 3 in 1990 to 9 9 in 2000 world trade as a share of world output rose from 39 in 1990 to 58 in 2018 in the past four decades rules governing international capital transfers were liberalized annual foreign direct investment fdi increased over fourteen fold from about 200 billion in 1990 to 1 67 trillion in 2000 in 2007 the year before the start of the great recession it stood at 2 1 trillion fdi declined in the 2008 recession dropping to 1 4 trillion in 2010 but in 2017 it had recovered to 1 95 trillion china was one of the principal beneficiaries of this change the country s gdp growth rate averaged 10 over 27 years helping it to climb from an economic backwater with a gdp of 350 billion per capita gdp 300 in 1989 to produce a gdp of 12 2 trillion per capita gdp 8 700 in 2017 in 2010 the chinese economy surpassed that of japan to become the world s second largest global poverty dropped sharply under globalization in 1990 about 1 9 billion 36 of the global population lived under the purchasing power parity 1 90 per day international poverty line in 2017 only about 730 million 10 of the world population lived under the poverty line about 1 2 billion people have escaped poverty since 1990 400m of them were chinese liberal rules based system under stress this remarkable economic revolution occurred largely under a rules based system led by usa a set of key institutions such as the un and its affiliated agencies such as who and undp world bank imf wto formerly gatt provided the global institutional framework from 2008 the viability of the system has been called into question first the 2008 global financial crisis and the recession that followed showed some of its serious structural weaknesses especially in the financial sector global output declined by 3 6 in 2009 but recovered starting 2010 second while the share of the global population living in absolute poverty was cut back by almost 75 between 1990 and 2017 there still are about 800 million that live in poverty about half of them in south asia globalization is yet to reach them inequality third in a large number of countries rich middle income and poor income and wealth inequality has risen under globalization typically the urban rural gap has increased in favour of the former in china the average income per person in a rural area is about one fifth of the average urban income within countries some regions have done much better than other regions for example in usa the east coast and the west coast have prospered and in china the same is true of the eastern coastal region china does not hold one person one vote elections to allow people to express their disaffection arising from such inequities that globalization produces but western democracies such as usa and uk do in usa donald trump got elected as president in 2016 with strong support from poor white people in rural areas and in urban working class areas of the old rust belt states with declining industries that also lost jobs to developing countries as a result of globalization in the uk voters who were suspicious of the eu and globalization and felt that they have been left behind voted for brexit inequality in sri lanka interestingly sri lanka has not followed this global trend in inequality to the same degree in 1985 86 the top 20 of the income earners got 56 of the income and the bottom 20 got 5 in 1995 the shares were 43 and 8 in 2016 the shares were 48 and 7 that is a reversal though not very substantial in favour of the better off in sri lanka electoral pressure led governments to enhance welfare payments such as janasaviya and samurdhi to the poor and provide subsidies such as free schoolbooks free uniforms for school children and subsidised credit schemes for micro entrepreneurs these particularly befitted the low income households responding to globalisation 4 0 globalisation 4 0 that concerns among other things ict ai and robotics may appear to be remote and of no consequence to sri lanka in the short term however for the long term they matter a lot and we have to plan for such change ai and robotics will cut back labour cost in rich countries reducing or wiping out the advantage of cheap labor that we have that means the production model even in industries such as garments can change and we may lose markets and jobs but other options will open up for sri lanka especially in services the imf reports that over the period 2004 14 over 40 of productivity growth in emerging economies developing countries came from knowledge flows knowledge flows refer mainly to services that these countries could provide not only for domestic consumers but for cross border customers for example india is moving from providing traditional ict based services such as payroll management for multinationals to more creative ict based services such as design and advertising under globalisation 4 0 there is a trend away from inter regional long distance global trade to more intra regional trade with neighbouring countries that means sri lanka has to prepare to do more trade with asian countries especially with the two asian economic superpowers india and china the recent free trade agreements with singapore may have shortcomings that need correction but the bottom line is as a small country sri lanka can t change the way the global and regional economy evolves what we can do is to have a sound grasp of the changes that occur and adjust our policies to make the best use of the opportunities that come our way
in his influential 1954 article economic development with unlimited supplies of labour the future nobel laureate economist arthur lewis concluded that the central problem in the theory of economic development is to understand the process by which a community which was previously saving and investing 4 or 5 per cent of its national income or less converts itself into an economy where voluntary saving is running at about 12 or 15 per cent of its national income or more that process lewis argued is the central problem because the central fact of economic development is rapid capital accumulation including knowledge and skills with capital lewis s insight is highly relevant to china s rapid investment led growth in recent decades but china s growth has been based on much higher levels of national savings than arthur could ever have imagined and now this development has become unbalanced and appears increasingly risky in a reversal of the process that lewis described china must now find a way to reduce its excessive savings by moving to an economic development model based more on the sheer size of its domestic consumption this would represent a major shift for 30 to 40 years china has relied on export led industrialization to sustain rapid economic progress like japan and other fast growing east asian economies before it china successfully channeled its high savings into investment in export oriented manufacturing and as surplus labour continued to move within china from agriculture to export sectors the savings rate continued to increase like japan and other small fast growing east asian economies while manufacturing exports boomed domestic service and non tradable sectors including telecoms and finance were highly protected and suppressed in china the level of this protection was usually unnecessarily high such a structurally unbalanced strategy kept the shares of labour income and domestic consumption in gdp relatively low this led to an ever increasing chinese trade surplus especially with the united states and a rising risk of trade frictions or even trade wars about 15 years ago china under enormous pressure from the us and other leading western countries to reduce its trade surplus was forced to expand substantially its spending on investment in domestic infrastructure and housing and let the renminbi appreciate thereby making its exports more expensive as a result china s trade surplus has fallen from a peak of around 8 6 per cent of gdp a decade ago to near balance today but china has paid a heavy price for this rebalancing adjustment although a surge in infrastructure investment can help to reduce excessive savings too much of it can lead to macroeconomic volatility and fragile razor edge growth and this is what has happened before the 2008 global financial crisis china s economy had already been drifting on an unhealthy growth trajectory since then it has gone further in the wrong direction with accelerating credit expansion pushing investment in the construction of infrastructure and real estate to record highs after more than a decade of continuously increasing domestic investment china now faces accelerated deterioration in total factor productivity and return on capital gdp growth is slowing because of deteriorating productivity and will almost certainly not return to previous levels worse still the country has accumulated huge macro and credit risks that will limit future investment growth all of this suggests that china s high saving high investment growth model of recent decades has run its course the right course now would be to rely on a development model that lowers the country s excessive savings japan s failure to take a similar step led to the eventual collapse of its asset price bubble in the early 1990s yet even now china does not seem to recognize the urgency of reducing its savings despite the huge significance for its long term growth prospects china needs to shift the focus of its development model from exports to its huge domestic market of 1 4 billion people which will require opening up the service and non tradable sectors to foreign and private domestic investors in order to expand supply because these sectors have been suppressed and protected for decades their productivity remains relatively low but china has enormous market potential in telecoms health care social security education entertainment finance and insurance the huge purchasing power already released in the country s mobile internet sector highlights the wisdom of liberalizing these other sectors doing so would boost productivity significantly because china s domestic market is large enough to accommodate many competitors in a sector that in turn would create sustainable employment to compensate for job losses caused by the structural shift away from export oriented manufacturing more importantly opening up the domestic market based non tradable sectors would help to increase consumption demand and inhibit excessive savings thereby helping to improve investment returns china is at a pivotal point in its economic development for decades it successfully adopted the investment and export led growth strategy of small east asian economies and it has yet to take full advantage of its size as the risks of this unbalanced model become increasingly apparent china s growth must rely more on demand from its domestic market and less on its industrial capacity and exports this is the smart way to manage the country s savings and it is the key to winning any trade war with the us project syndicate
weekly and in some instances daily threats of strike action by some teachers and other sections of zimbabwe s populace are not helping matters at a time the country needs all hands on deck to deal with challenges confronting the economy granted some of those threatening industrial action have genuine grievances that need attention but there are always better and more constructive engagement strategies that can be applied to redress the situation but some misguided elements believe going on strike sends the message home more effectively and ensures swift response this is a myopic view that fails to recognise that the repercussions of such actions far outweigh the benefits taking to the streets has never been the best way to end any labour crisis it creates more problems and compromises the authorities ability and latitude to resolve problems it is most unfortunate that the social media has exaggerated situations and has even encouraged people to go on strike those that take heed to the destructive calls are regarded as heroes and yet the opposite is actually true there is no heroism in destroying efforts to rebuild this country it is destructive to engage in an industrial action particularly against a government that is encouraging dialogue and has in most instances bent over backwards to accommodate concerns by doctors teachers and other constituencies only last week teachers had largely agreed to dialogue to resolve their issues but we are surprised that at the weekend a certain radical section of the teaching profession has threatened to go on strike on tuesday because they insist on being paid in united states dollars while it would be great for everyone to be paid in us dollars simple logic should tell us that the country does not have the greenbacks receipts from exports and the diaspora are even failing to meet critical import requirements in most instances where then should the dollars to pay teachers and other civil servants come from at this juncture president mnangagwa has repeatedly implored zimbabweans to be patient and endure the short term pain many are suffering because the biblical canaan is not far the minister of finance and economic development professor mthuli ncube has said in 12 months s time some challenges in the economy would have dissipated resulting from the austerity measures he has put in place zimbabweans have always been considered a resilient and patient lot no wonder we always find ways of getting out of seemingly impossible situations the onus is on everyone to give current efforts a chance the gross impatience being exhibited in the economy is a foreign phenomenon that we had better shrug off sooner rather than later government has made interventions such as introducing cheaper and more reliable forms of transport to reduce transport costs and facts are there for everyone to see that even kombis have reduced their fares to largely a dollar per trip from the previous levels of between 3 and 5 even for short distances of less than 10 kilometres furthermore government warning shots have been fired against retailers and manufacturers who had made it a habit to increase prices without any fundamental justification on a grand scale president mnangagwa has led teams on a re engagement exercise that has begun to bear fruit a deal with belarus will see 500 buses coming in while multi billion projects such as the great dyke platinum project and refurbishment of hwange 7 and 8 have started more investments are expected while the country is also in discussion with south africa to find solutions for the economy these are certainly not hollow efforts but will bring results in the short to medium term but engaging in destructive strikes and violence as was the case mid last month will not be helpful it will only compromise all these efforts our focus as zimbabweans should remain on the goals of delivering a better zimbabwe and we should collectively reject calls by some misguided elements to cause mayhem as this diverts efforts and attention on that which builds this nation the tripartite negotiation forum should be a platform that can bring all parties together for amicable solutions to challenges giving talks a chance is not an act of cowardice but demonstrates the maturity and commitment that is expected of every zimbabwean so we can turn the tide vision 2030 is real and quite achievable we should not be intimidated by a few meanders on the road to prosperity but we should remain resolute to see a better zimbabwe for ourselves and for posterity

wheat the wheat market saw losses this week as the polar vortex cold snap didn t give this market its expected boost the u s lost a tender to sell wheat to egypt it lost to romania and france despite having the lowest bid because with higher freight costs it was still cheaper for egypt to buy from other sources u s prices are competitive and could lead to better export news going forward but freight is the deciding factor currently romania russia and france are all cheaper than the u s once freight is added on and u s wheat prices may need to fall 4 to 5 percent to win future tenders the trade doesn t seem as concerned about the cold snap that is hitting the midwest this week it will also take some time to see how much damage is done after the recent polar vortex and it is yet to be

the perspective atlanta georgia february 3 2019 after reading the full annual report provided by president weah on the state of the nation my initial reaction is that the president lied under oath as follows on page 43 of president weah s annual message he stated that when we came to power we inherited a debt of 878 2 million united states dollars at the end of 2017 the debt stock now stands at 987 8 million in 2018 at the end of 2018 the increase in the debt stock of 109 6 million during the period under review is mainly on account of disbursements from borrowing external loan portfolios including the world bank african development bank badea and saudi arabia which were ratified in 2017 to date my administration has not added to the debt stock but that does not mean we will not increase the stock of debt in the interest of our people we are working on this however the president reports on page 44 of the speech that total official development assistance received from january up to september 2018 is about 399 million united states dollars in support of various programs and activities under our pro poor agenda to our partners we say thank you merci and obbligato of this amount approximately 279 2 million united states dollars represents seventy percent 70 in grants while the remaining 120 million united states dollars represents thirty percent 30 received as concessional loans tom kaydor according to oecd 2018 concessional loans are loans that are extended on terms substantially more generous than market loans the concessionality is achieved either through interest rates below those available on the market or by grace periods or a combination of these in view of the above there is a contradiction in the president s report because concessional loans are part of liberia s debt stock that must be repaid by the government of liberia whether under president weah or any other government the 120 million 30 concessional loans received by the pro poor government as spoken about on page 44 of the speech by president weah exceeds the 109 6 million debt stock added from the previous loans ratified in 2017 this means liberia has attracted additional debt stock under president weah based on this contradiction it can be concluded that the president lied about his government not adding to the debt stock of the republic this constitutes perjury the ministry of finance and development planning or entire government must correct the statistics i am awaiting the ministry s response in this premise about the author tom kaydor is a lecturer at the ibb graduate school of international studies

by john rubino we baby boomers timed it perfectly we came of age during in an era of plentiful jobs and relatively high wages public pensions were generous stock bond and home prices were low and have since risen strongly enriching anyone who managed to save regularly college was by current standards insanely cheap allowing us to upgrade our skills with minimal sacrifice the result was a generation with high average net worth and at first glance a great shot at a comfortable retirement but that s an illusion for several reasons we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us first the average net worth stat masks the fact that many boomers didn t actually do much saving all those outrageous wealth inequality charts include retirees which by definition means that most boomers have been harvested by the 1 along with their kids and grandkids second public sector pensions as just about everyone knows by now don t have anything like the resources needed to actually pay current and future retirees what they ve been promised when those plans start imploding in the next recession benefits will be cut dramatically see here here and here for the grisly details and this morning the wall street journal added to the list with a feature on how of all things boomer student loan balances are exploding over 60 and crushed by student loan debt one generation of americans owed 86 billion in student loan debt at last count its members are all 60 years old or more many of these seniors took out loans to help pay for their children s college tuition and are still paying them off others took out student loans for themselves in the wake of the last recession as they went back to school to boost their own employment prospects on average student loan borrowers in their 60s owed 33 800 in 2017 up 44 from 2010 according to data compiled for the wall street journal by credit reporting firm transunion total student loan debt rose 161 for people aged 60 and older from 2010 to 2017 the biggest increase for any age group according to the latest data available from transunion some are having funds garnished from their social security checks the federal government which is the largest student loan lender in the country garnished the social security benefits tax refunds or other federal payments of more than 40 000 people aged 65 and older in fiscal year 2015 because they defaulted on student or parent loan debt that s up 362 from a decade prior according to the latest data from the government accountability office student debt is one of the biggest contributors to the overall increasing debt burden held by seniors u s consumers who are 60 or older owed around 615 billion in credit cards auto loans personal loans and student loans as of 2017 that is up 84 since 2010 the biggest increase of any age group according to the transunion data the borrowing buildup has upended the traditional arc of adult life for many americans average debt levels traditionally peak for families headed by people aged 45 to 54 years old according to the employee benefit research institute based on data from the federal reserve s survey of consumer finances but between 2010 and 2017 people in their 60s like most other age groups accelerated their borrowing in nearly every category according to the transunion data seniors are finding they have to work longer holding onto positions younger adults might otherwise receive they re relying on credit cards and personal loans to pay for basic expenses people 65 and older account for a growing share of u s bankruptcy filers according to the consumer bankruptcy project unlike most consumer loans student debt is rarely dischargeable in bankruptcy perhaps the most surprising element of this surge is the rapid run up in student loans an issue that used to be mostly concentrated among young adults changes made in the wake of the last recession help explain the shift in the years after 2008 banks and other private student lenders began tightening underwriting standards for their loans requiring more parents to sign on to student loans along with the student borrower cosigning makes the parents equally responsible for paying back the loan resulting in a lower credit score and crimping their ability to borrow if they or their child miss a payment in recent years private lenders including slm corp better known as sallie mae and citizens financial group inc have increased their focus on parents they ve rolled out student loans that are just for parents who want to pay for their kids college education the loans main pitch includes the possibility of a lower interest rate for parents who have high credit scores than what the federal government charges on its own parent loans it also allows parents to spare their children the burden of debt by taking it on themselves another problem the federal government caps the dollar amount of loans that undergraduate students can borrow for college but no caps exist for the aggregate amount that parents can take on that has contributed to parents increasingly borrowing to cover the gap between tuition costs and the amount of free aid and loans their children receive the federal government disbursed 12 7 billion in new parent plus loans during the 2017 18 academic year up from 7 7 billion a decade prior and 3 3 billion in 1999 2000 according to an analysis of education department data by mark kantrowitz publisher of savingforcollege com its underwriting standards are generally looser than banks and other private lenders making it easier for more applicants to qualify parents on average owed an estimated 35 600 in these loans at the time of their children s college graduation last spring according to mr kantrowitz they owed nearly 6 400 on average not adjusted for inflation in the spring of 1993 there s so much to hate about this situation the fact that the government and private sector lenders are targeting seniors for student loans the fact that soaring senior debt has upended the traditional arc of adult life for so many and last but definitely not least the fact that this is happening during a long economic expansion in the coming recession retiree borrowing will soar along with the attendant stress and anger we boomers might find ourselves back where we started during the vietnam war in the streets protesting an outrageously predatory government
spread this news by alois vinga zimbabwe s economic experts have urged the central bank to solve once and for all the confusion surrounding the real value of the local bond note compared to the more stable united states dollar they were speaking in separate interviews with newzim business ahead of the monetary policy statement soon to be announced by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz zimbabwean authorities maintain that the bond note is at par with the us dollar although the black market which has become the zimbabwean equivalent of wall street has pegged the greenback at four times the value of the local currency top economist prosper chitambara said authorities must end their denial and come clean on the real value of the zimbabwean currency we expect this to be reviewed in the forthcoming monetary policy because this has been affecting the smooth flow of business and it is time the central bank liberalized the forex market he said chitambara said authorities must also speak clearly on the future of the zimbabwean dollar following recent pronouncements by finance minister mthuli ncube that government was considering reintroducing the long discarded local currency addressing the issue will ventilate the speculation which is building up already in our markets and playing out negative as it is eroding business confidence we expect the governor to make it clear that no new currency is to be introduced until such a time when the markets have built up enough confidence chitambara said confederation of zimbabwe industries president sifelani jabangwe also said there was urgent need to address the currency challenges affecting the economy and put in place strategies to protect industry he said this was important especially during the fourth quarter of the year when industry is mostly hard hit by the challenge another economist john robertson also said government must seriously tackle currency issues we expect government to allow the market to determine the exchange rates and tackle issues that will not harm relations with the private sector the rbz must also put in place mechanisms that assist in confidence restoration for the public to buy into policy measures he said on his part confederation of zimbabwe retailers president denford mutashu said focus must be paid on dealing with the current pricing distortions the monetary policy should address the current pricing distortions in the economy he said the distortions have become a breeding ground for arbitrage trust and confidence building efforts should be sustained economic growth drivers like production exports beneficiation and value addition should be given priority ahead of non productive consumption characterising expenditure patterns currently
the government has imposed fees on the dependents of expatriate workers and restricted foreigners from working in certain sectors rising costs as part of an overhaul of the economy intended to make saudi arabia less dependent on oil have hit low wage foreign workers especially hard the result has been a massive exodus of foreigners from the labour force recent shifts in government policy however have forced iqbal to consider pulling up stakes at the age of 60 the workers arrived from asia and the middle east often on short term contracts to satisfy the saudi government s ambitious development plans but iqbal stayed raising three children and finding work over the decades even as the saudi government s priorities changed and its control over the foreign labour market tightened mohammed iqbal joined the throng of foreign workers bound for saudi arabia during the oil boom of the 1970s after recruiters from pepsi visited his native india and dangled an opportunity in the kingdom driving a delivery truck the abrupt outflow has also illustrated the steep challenges facing crown prince mohammed bin salman as he tries to remake the saudi economy a central pillar of his plan involves creating employment for saudi citizens in the private sector where jobs are now overwhelmingly held by foreigners in the short term though saudi citizens have not filled the jobs that expatriates are vacating adding to the pressure on business owners already struggling with an economic downturn between early 2017 and the third quarter of last year more than 1 1 million foreigners left the workforce in saudi arabia according to the latest figures from the government statistics agency the increasing jobless rate is forcing the government to revise its short term unemployment goals photo salwan georges washington post it is not the first recent large scale exodus of foreigners hundreds of thousands left or were deported in 2013 and 2017 but while that exodus was largely the result of a government crackdown on people violating a work visa sponsorship programme the latest flight appears to reflects broader hardships and unease among foreigners and saudi citizens alike the upheaval has added to a sense of uncertainty in the country as saudi leaders grapple with a depressed economy struggle to attract foreign investment and try to repair the kingdom s image after the murder of washington post contributing columnist jamal khashoggi by saudi officials in istanbul four months ago there are signs that the exodus has caught the government by surprise late last year saudi officials were reportedly considering lifting or easing the fees imposed on expatriate workers because of the harm the policy had caused the economy according to bloomberg but saudi officials have yet to announce any change in the policy and the fees remain in place in the long term the flight of foreigners serves one of the government s most urgent priorities finding jobs for the more than half of the saudi population that is under the age of 30 and in doing so staving off the kind of youth dissatisfaction that has led to protests in other arab countries and unnerved the saudi leadership in immigrant neighbourhoods the exodus is immediately apparent photo salwan georges washington post but for now a major concern has been a spike in the unemployment rate over the past two years to as high as 12 9 per cent the increasing jobless rate is forcing the government to revise its short term unemployment goals and further exposing the gap between the expectations of saudi workers and the jobs that are becoming available to them in lower wage construction or retail jobs for example as the foreigners leave karen young an expert on the political economy of the persian gulf states at the american enterprise institute said that while it was good news that more saudi women were entering the workforce many with higher education degrees were not finding positions that matched their skills the business environment in saudi arabia has also suffered because of the crown prince s more aggressive policies including the arrests of hundreds of business executives public officials and royal family members during what the government called an anti corruption sweep last year as the crackdown spooked international investors local investors complain of new hurdles to license and register businesses and comply with new hiring policies that require the hiring of saudi citizens young said saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman photo handout the government s response to focus on pump priming or increased government capital expenditures was in line with what many economists would suggest to start growth when foreign investment and the local economy were sluggish young said but that is not a sustainable long term growth strategy the government cannot spend its way out of this forever she added in a sign it was responding to the economic fears the government this past week held its second major investor conference in less than four months intended to draw hundreds of millions of dollars in investment for mining energy and other industries also this past week the saudi leadership announced what it said was the conclusion of the anti corruption purge another major cause of investor anxiety the government has also promoted plans to expand the entertainment industry and tourism betting that those initiatives will create jobs while also distracting from the criticism of the kingdom over its more repressive policies in the meantime in immigrant neighbourhoods the exodus is immediately apparent buildings are emptying stores staffed by foreign workers are struggling or closed and nearly everyone knows families who have left or are strongly leaning toward heading home those leaving or considering doing so include single men who spent a few years in saudi arabia building up their savings or sending their earnings to family back home and as the expatriates have embarked on an anxious search for work outside the kingdom their home countries are bracing for the impact of a potentially dramatic decrease in remittance payments christian lacap originally from the philippines had worked in the coastal saudi city of jiddah for the past seven years but he said he decided to leave saudi arabia because of price hikes which were imposed by the government as part of its economic programme saudi citizens with better paid government jobs could absorb the rising costs but it s big for us he said we have minimum salaries it s too hard filipino christian lacap is hoping to work in south korea or canada next photo salwan georges washington post photo lacap who works in a restaurant did not have a job lined up back in the philippines and was hoping to go to another country maybe south korea or canada where the prospects were better he said he said he doubted whether a saudi worker would take his job others such as iqbal said they were holding out for now he had lost his last job at a market research company that had downsized as it struggled to pay the new government fees iqbal had been unable to find work since and feared his age was becoming as much a factor as the saudisation effort to replace foreign workers with nationals the cost of utilities and basic goods was rising he said medicine was becoming more expensive for his wife who is diabetic many of his friends had already left so it was only a matter of time he reckoned before he joined them no one wants to live here everyone is going back to india he said adding that he had planned to work in saudi arabia for at least another five or six years i m very sad but what can i do
wheat the wheat market saw losses this week as the polar vortex cold snap didn t give this market its expected boost the u s lost a tender to sell wheat to egypt it lost to romania and france despite

freight is the deciding factor currently romania russia and france are all cheaper than the u s once freight is added on and u s wheat prices may need to fall 4 to 5 percent to win future tenders the

you probably don t live in poverty you probably have a job maybe a savings account and even a 401 k retirement plan at work but could you survive a shock such as going four weeks without a paycheck like many federal workers did during the government shutdown how would you fare in case of a job loss or large unexpected expense below are 10 ways to assess your level of affluence including some unconventional ones many were evaluated as part of a new report on financial vulnerability from prosperity now a progressive group in washington d c that aims to improve opportunities for struggling americans 1 your income fluctuates a lot roughly 10 years into the economic recovery unemployment rates have fallen across the board yet holding a job by itself doesn t tell the whole story many positions pay poorly and unstable income can put workers at financial risk one in five households faces moderate to significant income fluctuations from month to month according to the prosperity now report people with income fluctuations said they were twice as likely as the general population to be falling behind on bills they also often must rely on costly payday type loans to make ends meet 2 your credit score isn t great late payments delinquent accounts and other borrowing related problems show up in credit reports and this information goes into credit scores nearly half the nation 48 percent of americans have mediocre or poor scores according to prosperity now people in this category face higher interest rates or other poor terms if they can get loans they also might need to pay more for utilities and other services debt is a doubled edged sword as too much borrowing can take you down but access to credit plays a role in helping people build wealth through home purchases financing college starting a business and even buying a vehicle to commute to a better job definitions of prime credit scores vary and there are different scoring models but anything above 720 on the popular fico range of 300 to 850 is considered excellent 3 you don t even have a credit score roughly one in six americans doesn t have a score because they can t be scored according to a new report by the company behind another model called vantagescore an estimated 40 million adults can t be scored because they don t use credit much if at all and often don t have any relevant accounts without a credit score it s much less likely that you could receive a conventional loan the vantagescore report warns if you tried you could face costly even unfair terms 4 you re feeling priced out of a home the nation s homeownership rate has inched up to 64 4 percent yet remains far below the high near 69 percent reached in 2005 housing costs are rising faster than incomes keeping the homeownership rate down prosperity now said you don t need to own a home to prosper but this is the largest asset for many americans and a good source of tax savings mortgage interest and property taxes are deductible and most homeowners avoid taxes on housing profits when they sell if you don t own a home you re also vulnerable to rising rents roughly half of all renters spend more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent and utilities a threshold that prosperity now considers important 5 you lack even modest savings everyone should strive to accumulate long term investments but the first step is stockpiling enough cash to meet big expenses or patch over a period of income volatility when households have a financial cushion even a modest one it can make them more resilient to these financial shocks said the prosperity now report financial planners typically suggest building up enough liquid assets to meet three to six months of expenses but even households with as little as 250 to 750 are more likely to keep up with key payments and avoid shocks said prosperity now homeowners should strive to accumulate savings equal to several months of mortgage payments 6 you re dependent on dollar stores stores featuring especially low priced items often without a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables are concentrated in moderate income urban areas african american neighborhoods and rural communities according to prosperity now the prevalence of these stores can be an indicator that a neighborhood has a high proportion of lower income residents if you depend on these outlets it could mean your shopping dollars don t stretch as far as you think despite low prices dollar stores don t necessarily offer better bargains than competitors such as walmart the report added 7 you put off medical care due to money if you have skipped doctor visits or failed to buy medications on schedule it could be a symptom of financial stress nearly one in seven americans skipped doctor visits because they couldn t afford them according to the prosperity now report the high cost of health care including inadequate insurance can take a toll on families in many ways and can quickly mushroom into unpaid bills delinquent accounts and bankruptcies assuming people seek treatment avoiding or reducing medical attention also can be risky and can worsen your finances a person s ability to work save and build wealth is heavily influenced by their physical health and vice versa said prosperity now 8 you depend heavily on your tax refund for many families income tax refunds represent a once a year opportunity to pay down debts purchase a big ticket item or save money but if this is your single largest source of funds that could be an indication that you re living on the edge keep in mind that refunds might be lower this filing season than the nearly 2 800 average for tax year 2017 tax reform changes lowered tax rates but paycheck withholding amounts also were adjusted generally lower many taxpayers thus could receive lower refunds and might owe taxes the internal revenue service has warned 9 you re a member of a racial minority prosperity now changed its assessment from prior years previously the focus was on measuring household financial health overall across the nation and in the various states but a new format incorporates race in a significant way by gauging how well or poorly blacks latinos native americans and pacific islanders achieve affluence as an example for every 1 in wealth accumulated by white households latino households have 13 cents and african american households a mere 6 cents financial vulnerability is all too common in the united states particularly for people of color who were by and large left out of the economic recovery wrote the report s authors race and ethnicity have an outsized impact on economic well being 10 you re out of the stock market the last couple of months have provided a bumpy ride for investors who own stocks individually or through mutual funds and the like but despite providing occasional bouts of unease if not terror stocks have been a great way to build wealth over time how many other assets have quadrupled in value over the past decade or so that s what the wilshire 5000 the broadest measure of the u s market has done since bottoming in march 2009 including dividends stock market

shadow treasurer chris bowen will pitch to workers discontents when he declares in his first economic speech of the year that they are being denied a fair go under the liberals the economy is not working for working people bowen will say delivering the chifley oration in melbourne on monday he will argue that growth is too low more than a million people are under employed and far too many workers are underpaid too many australians are being pushed to the margins ignored by the liberals in the suburbs let down by the nationals in the regions squeezed out of the middle class cut off from the fair go denied the chance to fulfil their potential not because they ve been forgotten but because they ve been deliberately excluded not just left behind locked out labor s pitch to frame the economic debate is in contrast to the government case which is to emphasise the positives especially jobs growth while claiming the economy would weaken under a shorten government the escalating debate over the economy comes as bill shorten on sunday said labor was not for turning on its proposed crackdown on cash refunds for franking credits which threatens to cost the opposition a good number of votes among retirees there is no principle that says it is fair that a non taxpayer gets a tax refund a cash tax refund shorten told the abc it is also not fair that we re spending 100 million a week paying non taxpayers cash tax refunds it is not fair in this country that we re spending more money giving non taxpayers a tax refund than we are on public schools pressed on whether he was saying there would be no tweaking of the policy shorten said if i can put it really directly do people want a government or do they want a piece of plasticine do people want a government with tax principles and fairness at their core or do they just want a lump of political putty we ve had six years of the plasticine government and we are putting our views out because we want australia to be fairer in his address an extract of which was released ahead of delivery bowen says the economy is not growing as broadly or strongly or fairly as it should and this is contributing to the stagnating of living standards the last labor government saw a 7 6 increase in living standards despite the global financial crisis over the same period living standards have lifted by just 2 5 under the liberals in much better international circumstances last quarter they actually declined bowen says australians are reminded of this every time they get paid with wages growth at record lows in the april 2 budget last year s budget wages forecast will be downgraded again as happened in previous budgets bowen says in every single hockey and morrison budget the wages growth forecasts have had to be downgraded as bill has said so many times everything is going up except people s wages since the liberals were elected electricity prices are up 15 the cost of long day child care is up 24 private health insurance premiums are up 30 prices racing ahead of wages means more and more families are dipping into their savings just to keep the show on the road bowen says the household savings ratio has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade and household debt is the second highest in the oecd he says bowen also seeks to discredit the government s argument on its employment record on unemployment he says australia is an underperformer compared to similar countries such as the united states united kingdom and new zealand but more concerning than the headline unemployment rate is the fact that it masks deep and persistent underemployment there are 1 1 million under employed people in australia and another 666 700 who are unemployed meaning there are 1 8 million australians who want more work bowen says his first budget would as well as investing more in schools hospitals and essential services also contain bigger fairer tax cuts for 10 million working australians who earn up to 125 000 these bigger and fairer tax cuts will give a much needed shot in the arm to consumption while our better tax offering to all businesses particularly our australian investment guarantee will encourage much needed investment and get productivity going again the opposition is releasing a booklet titled the true state of the economy under the liberals
in 1950 californians voted to put a provision in the state constitution that makes it harder for poor people to find a place to live article 34 which remains in effect requires voter approval before public housing is built in a community at the time it passed the real estate industry argued taxpayers should have a right to vote on low income housing projects because they were publicly funded infrastructure similar to schools or roads the campaign also appealed to racist fears about integrating neighborhoods and featured heated rhetoric about the need to combat socialism the rule stymied low income home construction in california for decades including a decision to abandon public housing in los angeles chavez ravine neighborhood and build dodger stadium instead article 34 also weakened efforts to integrate suburban communities across the state and led to a landmark u s supreme court case that had the effect of allowing government policies nationwide that discriminate against poor people advertisement we know the roots of where it came from los angeles mayor eric garcetti said it s a white supremacist chapter in the state s history garcetti is behind a new effort to ask voters to repeal article 34 mostly as a way to erase what many see as a stain on california s constitution other states have had and repealed laws that called for a public vote before the construction of low income housing but no other state constitution similarly requires voter approval for public housing according to the california constitution center at uc berkeley s law school today as the state grapples with an unprecedented affordable housing shortage article 34 has limited effects on the construction of low income developments but it remains an obstacle los angeles officials believe that without a public vote in the coming years the city will no longer be able to finance such projects even though it has the money to do so state sen ben allen d santa monica has introduced legislation to put the repeal before voters if it goes on a 2020 statewide ballot it would be the fourth time californians would consider changing or doing away with article 34 three prior efforts including the most recent in 1993 failed by wide margins with opponents arguing that residents should have the right to keep public housing out of their neighborhoods but allen believes the electorate has changed since the last attempt in the past few years voters have supported tax increases and bond measures to help support low income and homeless housing article 34 allen said is an anachronistic barrier that stands in the way of that article 34 grew out of a fight in the northern coastal city of eureka residents there collected signatures to overturn a decision to build public housing financed by a federal program inaugurated during the new deal but in 1950 the state supreme court ruled the acceptance of federal dollars wasn t subject to a referendum and residents couldn t block the development the california real estate assn the forerunner of today s california assn of realtors came up with a ballot initiative later that year to combat the eureka decision and require a public vote before public housing could be built realtors argued that residents should be able to weigh in on such a project because it could create taxpayer debt but the campaign which coincided with the start of the korean war was about more than giving voters a say in the realtors internal newsletter charles b shattuck the organization s legislative committee chairman wrote that public housing threatened capitalism if you value your property if you hold liberty dear if you believe in the dignity of the individual if you love this land of the free and the home of the brave if you desire to stop the enemy of socialism that is gnawing at the vitals of america from within the ballot box is your weapon the one and only means by which our great republic will be preserved and improved shattuck wrote in november 1950 newspaper ads paid for by the realtors also blamed minority pressure groups for pushing public housing at the time the realtors code of ethics included a provision barring agents from integrating neighborhoods on the basis of race or nationality if doing so would be clearly detrimental to property values the initiative passed by fewer than 50 000 votes in los angeles residents supported article 34 by an overwhelming margin the city was planning to build 10 000 units of public housing and the success of the statewide measure buoyed opponents who agitated for a referendum on the projects the city had already approved the resulting election in 1952 ended in a rejection of public housing and plunged city politics into chaos a top official in the city s public housing department was fired after an accusation that he was a communist and was later called to testify before state and federal un american activities committees the pro public housing mayor lost his reelection bid and the city canceled two planned developments including one in which residents were already being displaced in the mexican american community of chavez ravine on a site that eventually became dodger stadium the disputes chilled attempts to build public housing in los angeles which did not hold another article 34 referendum for more than two decades los angeles wasn t the only city where article 34 thwarted public housing by 1969 voters across the state had turned down nearly half the public housing that had been proposed in article 34 elections 15 000 units and many housing agencies didn t hold elections fearing that their plans would be rejected a federal department of housing and urban development report at the time found that california had the nation s largest population of poor people but ranked 22nd in the amount of housing available for them the report blamed article 34 those opposed to public housing were often open about their reasons in 1968 san jose city councilwoman virginia shaffer led a campaign against a series of publicly funded duplexes and small apartments in her city telling a reporter that some poor people drag the whole neighborhood down people oppose public housing because too often it means there will be piles of garbage trash knee high grass and undisciplined children in a neighborhood where other people are trying to meet their payments shaffer said the san jose vote failed prompting a legal challenge to article 34 the lawsuit argued that it violated the u s constitution s equal protection clause by denying poor people access to housing the case made its way to the u s supreme court where in 1971 justices affirmed article 34 s constitutionality in the majority opinion justice hugo black agreed that article 34 put low income residents at a disadvantage but wrote it did not violate the constitution because the provision didn t single out a racial group provisions for referendums demonstrate devotion to democracy not to bias discrimination or prejudice black wrote the supreme court decision was consequential said matthew lassiter a history professor at the university of michigan and an expert in the growth of the u s suburbs the ruling had the effect of affirming state and local policies that were openly biased against poor people he said soon afterward president richard nixon released a statement that embraced the decision s logic saying that the federal government would not impose economic integration on cities and counties the supreme court case is one of the most important defeats in civil rights history in the last century and is under appreciated in how much it contributed to the stoppage of efforts to integrate communities across the country lassiter said lassiter also was critical of the ruling for overlooking article 34 s racial implications racial discrimination in housing was legal until 1968 and in decades prior the federal government had guaranteed bank loans to developers of white only subdivisions promoted the use of racially restrictive covenants on deeds to prevent people of color from buying homes and subsidized white residents mortgages but not others the policies gave whites access to wealth through homeownership that others didn t have blocking low income housing lassiter said had the consequence of keeping most non whites from living in those areas as well to say it was not about race is to say history doesn t matter and there was this magic historical moment where all vestiges of a racialized housing market went away and everything started anew like the book of genesis lassiter said the supreme court decision returned the focus to california on three occasions state lawmakers have asked voters to rescind or weaken article 34 in 1974 a repeal failed by 24 percentage points six years later legislators put forward a proposition so that residents could appeal a decision to build public housing instead of holding an automatic vote that measure lost by an even greater margin then in 1993 lawmakers tried again with a proposition that would have kept article 34 on the books but exempted almost all projects from its rules this time the measure was supported by the california assn of realtors the group behind the original push for article 34 it didn t matter opponents including a state senator from northern los angeles and an orange county assemblyman contended in the official voter guide that article 34 was a success because it prevented public housing from being built why should we trust politicians and special interests to protect our local neighborhoods and spend our tax dollars wisely they wrote nearly 60 voted no article 34 is much less of a barrier to low income housing construction than it used to be over the years funding sources for such projects have changed when private developers set aside a portion of homes in a project for low income residents or housing is funded by federal or state tax credits a vote is not required courts have also decided that local governments can hold elections to authorize an overall number of public housing units to be built in future years rather than go to voters for each individual project and residents became friendlier to article 34 elections with around 80 of referenda approved by the early 1990s according to a report by the state department of housing and community development still the provision continues to be an obstacle for some low income homebuilding affordable housing developers structure deals to avoid triggering a vote legal and consulting costs can be in the tens of thousands of dollars or must ensure that a city has enough units approved from a prior article 34 election but when a local government hits its cap it must again seek approval from voters that s happening in los angeles a 2008 ballot measure approved by voters allowed up to 3 500 public housing units per council district in the city some neighborhoods are now close to their limit city officials believe they ll have to hold another vote within the next couple years to increase the cap prompting garcetti to instead pitch a repeal of article 34 to the legislature garcetti also said he takes issue with the argument that low income housing should be subject to a public vote because it involves spending government money taxpayer subsidies for homeowners through the mortgage interest deduction and other means long have dwarfed the public funding available for low income housing development we have done a much better job helping middle class upper middle class and wealthy californians with housing subsidies than we have for working class residents garcetti said but a repeal of article 34 is hardly a sure thing said former state treasurer phil angelides who worked on one of the failed efforts to weaken it angelides called the provision a blot on the constitution but said on its face a requirement to hold a public vote doesn t seem like it might have negative effects while it s clearly discriminatory it has the aura of local control which is something people like in california angelides said it s going to take a campaign of informing voters what it means coverage of california politics liam dillon latimes com dillonliam
professor dr omphemetse s sibanda is a professor of law and the executive dean of the faculty of management and law at the university of limpopo he holds a doctor of laws in international economic law from north west university a master of laws from georgetown university law centre us and an llb hon and b juris from the then vista university soweto campus a number of instruments are used to rate and measure a country s level of corruption and notable among these is transparency international s corruption perceptions index cpi the cpi for example uses various corruption indicators to arrive at a country s corruption index countries are ranked on a scale of zero to 100 with a score of zero representing highly corrupt and a score of 100 very clean watch the corruption scores are standardised before being averaged into the cpi and the 2018 cpi was released on tuesday 29 january 2019 according to transparency international ti the cpi reveals varying degrees of countries failing to control corruption and thus posing a threat to democracy worldwide the cpi results came with a few surprises for instance the united states is ranked outside of the top 20 internationally least corrupt countries for the first time since 2011 at number 22 with a score of 71 global average denmark is ranked number 1 with a score of 88 as the least corrupt country the cpi puts south africa at an unenviable position number 73 with a score of 43 in the perceived level of public sector corruption out of 180 countries territories in the world sa s ranking is similar to that of morocco and just three notches better than lesotho trinidad and tobago ghana and burkina faso who all ranked at 78 with a score of 53 singapore scored 85 with a ranking of number 3 and hong kong is ranked number 14 with a score of 78 interestingly both singapore and hong kong are identified by many scholars as countries the south african anti corruption framework must emulate another country south africa is hoping to emulate with respect to combating corruption is botswana with the ranking of 34 and the score of 61 botswana took the title of the second least corrupt country in the whole of africa after seychelles which is ranked at number 28 while somalia took the title of the world s most highly corrupt country in the world and in africa ranked at number 180 and scoring only 10 in fairness to titanic south africa one must also recognise that the cpi placed south africa in the top 10 of the least corrupt countries in africa however recognising this decent placement does not mean one should ignore or forget the fact that some of our very own institutions including people at the executive level of government spurned the recommendations of institutions like the public protector that sought to ferret out corruption others opposed the implementation of advocate thuli madonsela s remedial actions against corruption maladministration and all the related rot truth be told being in the top 10 means nothing when considered against the fact that our anti corruption agencies need to be admitted to icu they are acutely diseased and sick responding to the appalling 2018 cpi results president cyril ramaphosa said that t his should now be the last time that south africa is described like that we are going through a very cathartic moment where all the wrong things are spewing out it would have raised eyebrows had the first citizen and the commander in chief of south africa not expressed concerns with the score and the rating south africa received not that it is anything new because the country has not been consistent in improving its corruption free character for instance in 1996 south africa achieved a high score of 57 56 80 points and it fell 10 points between 2007 and 2011 from a rating of 5 1 to 4 1 and the 2018 cpi remains the same as that in 2017 a number of reasons can be noted for this unstable anti corruption performance particularly the country s 2011 worst cpi ranking since the cpi was established notable amongst these include the cost of corruption involving government procurement reported at around r30 billion each year according to the then head of the special investigating unit siu willie hofmeyr in his report to the portfolio committee for justice and constitutional development in october 2011 at the time the siu was investigating 588 procurement contracts valued at r9 1 billion and about 360 conflict of interest matters valued at r3 4 billion the year 2011 also saw two cabinet members released from duty following allegations that they had been compromised and conflicted in that they misused their powers for irregular and illicit gains for themselves and or some people connected to them the late sicelo shiceka then minister for cooperative governance and traditional affairs was fingered for misusing state resources allegedly to visit a girlfriend in a swiss prison the details of his transgressions are contained in the public protector of the republic of south africa report in the extreme report no 11 of 2011 12 of the public protector on an investigation into allegations of a breach of the executive ethics code by the minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs mr sicelo shiceka mp gwen mahlangu nkabinde then minister of public works was also fingered for her role in the awarding of two tenders worth r1 116 billion and r604 million respectively to a politically well connected businessman for the lease of new premises for the saps at above reasonable market price this matter was also investigated by the public protector and resulted in a scathing report titled against the rules too report of the public protector in terms of section 182 1 of the constitution of the republic of south africa 1996 and section 8 1 of the public protector act 1994 on an investigation into complaints and allegations of maladministration improper and unlawful conduct by the department of public works and the south african police service saps relating to the leasing of saps accommodation in durban 2011 another revelation in november 2011 was the story by the mail guardian newspaper about extensive upgrades at the homestead of former president jacob zuma in nkandla at the cost of r60 million at the time also seven complaints lodged between 13 december 2011 and november 2012 with the public protector regarding nkandla renovations these triggered an investigation by the then public protector thuli madonsela in 2013 and her report titled secure in comfort report by the public protector on an investigation into allegations of impropriety and unethical conduct relating to the installation and implementation of security measures by the department of public works at and in respect of the private residence of president jacob zuma at nkandla in the kwazulu natal province report no 25 of 2013 24 march 19 2014 revealed that the former president and his family had unduly benefited from upgrades which has escalated from r60 million to r246 million in costs the notoriety of secure in comfort was that it took the intervention of the constitutional court in 2016 to conclude the former president and his parliament violated the constitution by repeatedly ignoring the public protector s findings and arguing that they were not enforceable furthermore the nkandla saga was identified with the slogan bring back the money and the consequent chaotic handling of the sittings of parliament the fact that south africa s 2018 cpi remains unchanged from 2017 is not a surprise or rather should not be a surprise by now it is common knowledge that corruption is endemic in south africa past and recent events including various revelations about corruption and corrupt practices indicate that public office public service corruption could be a significant problem in south africa there is no way that international corruption indexing institutions could have missed the events leading to an investigation into alleged improper and unethical conduct of the country s executive and possibly corrupt award of state contracts and benefits to the gupta family s businesses for example the resultant public protector state capture report of 14 october 2016 was also widely revealed and it precipitated the setting up of the zondo commission on state capture the zondo commission has already revealed that corruption is a pernicious phenomenon and a challenge that the country must deal with the testimonies at the commission particularly those relating to the watsons and the guptas postulate state capture as characterised by complex networks and interpenetration of business politics administration police and security forces and sometimes ngos which colonise the interface between ostensibly different spheres between public and private you have single individuals or families exerting undue and illegal control over both state and economy also oligarchies with a complex range of networks and corrupt and reciprocal relations have been formed the cpi rating must mean and spur many things for south africa including putting in place a concerted comprehensive and holistic approach to combating the spate of corruption engulfing south africa as a corrective response there are innumerable actions approaches interventions that can be considered below is a sample of the many prosecution and consequence management first and foremost the authorities must begin with visiting consequence management on those who are involved in corrupt activities including the corrupt leadership especially at government executive level sadly our beloved npa has expressed its unwillingness to exercise its prosecutorial powers and functions until the zondo commission is done and dusted what if the commission takes a decade to complete as has happened in state capture investigations in some countries this reluctance to prosecute happens despite the publicly known importance of the npa to revive and maintain its prosecutorial integrity which in my view could benefit from decisively dealing with the rampant selling and purchasing of political and government s administrative decisions in a broad sense one would have expected the npa to independently investigate these allegations and where applicable begin a prosecuting process i would have expected institutions like the npa and other law enforcement agencies including the saps the hawks and ipid to appreciate the fact that perceptions of their complicity in the rampant corruption are taking place against the background of and as part of a broader public disillusionment with the criminal justice system historical precedence indicates that some jurisdictions take the issue of corruption seriously particularly political corruption and executive corruption for instance in the united states case of united states v kenny international corp cr no 79 372 ddc ﬁled aug 2 1979 a new york corporation kenny international corp was convicted of offering sir albert henry the then premier of the cook islands and the cook island party then the majority political party in the cook island legislative assembly ﬁnancial assistance to the value of nz 337 000 in connection with his re election through using an aircraft to ﬂy voters from new zealand to the elections in the cook islands the intention was for sir albert to ensure that kenny international corp secured the renewal of an agreement of its exclusive promotion distribution and sale of cook islands postage stamps throughout the world fortunately as part of his views on the cpi and the on goings at the zondo commission ramaphosa emphatically declared that t here should be real serious action taken it s important that we hold hands and fix our country we should not be a country that is defined by acts of corruption that are completely out of kilter with the value system we put for ourselves and nothing can be more serious an action than the president leading a clear warning to institutions such as the npa that a decision to keep in abeyance the investigation of those alleged to have been perpetrators and co perpetrators conspirator and co conspirators accomplices to state capture and accessories after the fact is wrong it is tantamount to dereliction of duty assault on democracy and human rights investigation and prosecutions must be commenced without any further delay if we are serious in our determination that t his should now be the last time that south africa is described as one of the corrupt countries in the world and committed to our vow that there will be real serious action taken to ensure that south africa is not defined by acts of corruption that are completely out of kilter with the value system we put for ourselves the country s executives that are found to have been involved in public corruption must be severely punished so are the members of the public companies doing business with the government and owners directors board members of companies doing business with the government that are a party to these corrupt activities perhaps south africa must consider following countries like china with severe penalties for corruption except of course that unlike south africa china has no constitutional bar to impose the death penalty for corruption recalibration of anti corruption agencies and other state units president ramaphosa has called for the recalibration of state institutions and the appointment of individuals to these institutions who are fit and proper we are headed in a direction where we are rebuilding the integrity of our country and reforming our institutions and addressing soes the efficacy of our soes needs to be recalibrated said ramaphosa according to my prefatory observation recalibration reforms and i am assuming here an earnest transparent open process to rethink our anti corruption agencies and relevant other institutions including membership of the parliamentary integrity committees may positively affect the anti corruption crusade and succeed where many have failed recalibration must not be another exercise that will produce paper tigers or a mere act of musical chairs of heads of institutions and state owned enterprises soes the appointment of advocate shamila batohi as the head of the npa for instance makes me believe that with people like her at the helm of the npa the country s prosecutorial prowess will be re orientated however the fight against corruption and instilling prosecutorial ethics integrity and efficacy cannot be achieved effectively by just relying on the competence and character of advocate batohi supported by her well intentioned prosecutors and investigators otherwise she will fail dismally issues of organisation effectiveness and co operative governance and the apolitical operational environment of these organisations must be addressed better control of public resources writing about accountability and transparency to fight against corruption brusca rossi aversano brusca rossi aversano accountability and transparency to fight against corruption an international comparative analysis 2018 journal of comparative policy analysis research and practice 20 5 486 504 correctly noted that in the public domain the availability of resources that are not directly controlled by a single owner can create the perfect ground for corruption through for example large procurements and major public works projects tax administration debt management customs and ill designed privatisation of state owned enterprises their observation rings true in the south african context public procurement and tenders came in handy for the corrupt and provided a fertile ground for corruption these authors further observed that i n the domain of democratic theory corruption is seen as a violation of the basic norms of the democratic process which disempowers citizens in this perspective the role of strong institutional control and good auditing has been highlighted as a way to prevent bad politicians from diverting resources conducting a nationwide audit on all contracts with the state past and present contracts will be helpful towards achieving and maintaining control of public resources so is the open budget index obi which is the index used to measure the disclosure of budgetary reporting and transparency another interesting observation by brusca rossi aversano is that countries that have a higher obi score have better positions in the corruption perception index of transparency international and the world bank governance indicator of control of corruption public vigilance the public too must build momentum towards holding the south african criminal justice system the government and its executives to virtues of accountability and transparency even if it means having recourse to public interest litigation and private prosecution to spur actions against corruption the cultural economic and political characteristics of the country should never be allowed as a safeguard for corruption and corrupt activities robert klitgaard once explained corruption in a simple formula corruption monopoly discretion accountability in international cooperation against corruption international monetary fund 4 march h 1998 south african government holds a monopoly over the public purse and many other public resources and when the government its executives and other public office bearers are not publicly held accountable the fight against corruption will be lost active and passive corruption by government officials will become a normal occurrence

spread the love the flamboyant victorian british prime minister benjamin disraeli once noted that there can be economy only where there is efficiency by prof mthuli ncube zimbabwe s economy has been full of inefficiencies for far too long waste in the economy has led to want amongst the people our people deserve better and as the minister of finance i have a duty to set things right the government s transitional stabilisation programme is at the heart of our reform programme it outlines the state enterprise reform initiative as one of the most important areas to ensure sustainable economic growth and improved service delivery at the core of this restructuring initiative is what to do with our under performing parastatals on the one hand we believe that our natural resources and large industries are zimbabwean and must remain in the hands of zimbabweans yet on the other hand with the bureaucracies and inefficiencies of government including our own the experience and qualifications of private sector investors and managers would guarantee significant improvements in both production and profits it is no wonder former united states president harry truman once quipped that he would like someone to find him a one handed economist however economists all agree that by making these state run industries efficient all zimbabweans will profit we will take the astronomical burden and their associated costs off the shoulders of government and with costs cut these moves will increase revenues from both the sale of the companies themselves and in the long run the increased tax revenues from the newly profitable ventures state enterprises in their foundation were supposed to play a major role in the provision of infrastructure and other critical services such as water electricity telecommunications transportation health education among others however recently they simply are not up to the task it has been noted that most of them are loss making 99 percent and they continue to hold onto idle and unproductive labour accumulating salary arrears and continuously requiring bailouts from government to finance their operations and debt servicing who pays the costs the zimbabwean taxpayer we therefore cannot allow for inefficiencies and mismanagement to waste our taxpayers money anymore especially in an era of austerity the people of zimbabwe deserve better the inefficiencies arising from poor business models and years of maladministration including uneconomic pricing and poor product service development demand immediate reform cognisant of their traditionally critical role and the emotional attachment of such institutions to the people of zimbabwe government is not applying a blanket approach the reform and restructuring process will include a host of thought out and carefully examined interventions these reforms will range from liquidation full privatisation transformation to regulator merging and demerging as well as departmentalisation into existing ministries depending on how strategic the parastatals are and their respective performances there are numerous factors to take into consideration we will learn from the mistakes of other countries and ensure that zimbabwe conducts these processes in the right manner this will be driven by economics not politics the reform process therefore will ensure that parastatals and their restructuring are fully accountable transparent efficient effective and viable complementing government efforts in promoting economic growth and improved service delivery to the general public we will not allow a situation whereby tenders are won by the most connected but only the most qualified and deserving already with support from development partners both international and local government is carrying out performance reviews of our parastatals we are diving deep into the processes of governance systems as well as the financial operational and legal environment the reviews will analyse all levels of processes and procedures in order to guide us on an appropriate course of action to improve operational activities it is important that we do not try and chart this course alone of course we have a team of local experts many of whom are leading global experts in finance economics and business management however local brainpower must be supplemented with international counterparts ensuring optimal quality and full transparency in that light we will bring in recognised and qualified transactional advisers with international experience to accompany the process these advisors will include accountants and strategic advisers and will be complemented by government technical committees to ensure the people of zimbabwe get the best deal possible deal during the process because it is our duty to put the economy back on its feet at all times we must put the people of zimbabwe first austerity measures of course are tough restructuring and reforming will inevitably require a degree of creative destruction but this is how innovation begins this is how we will rebuild zimbabwe s economy from the bottom up our economy tragically has been a sick patient for too long it is now time to inject the right medicine however painful it may be in the short term to get our patient up on its feet and walking again by bringing efficiency back to our economy and in particular our failing parastatals zimbabwe will not just walk again we will fly the writer is the minister of finance and economic development share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like

in 1950 californians voted to put a provision in the state constitution that makes it harder for poor people to find a place to live article 34 which remains in effect requires voter approval before public housing is built in a community at the time it passed the real estate industry argued taxpayers should have a right to vote on low income housing projects because they were publicly funded infrastructure similar to schools or roads the campaign also appealed to racist fears about integrating neighborhoods and featured heated rhetoric about the need to combat socialism advertisement the rule stymied low income home construction in california for decades including a decision to abandon public housing in los angeles chavez ravine neighborhood and build dodger stadium instead article 34 also weakened efforts to integrate suburban communities across the state and led to a landmark u s supreme court case that had the effect of allowing government policies nationwide that discriminate against poor people we know the roots of where it came from los angeles mayor eric garcetti said it s a white supremacist chapter in the state s history garcetti is behind a new effort to ask voters to repeal article 34 mostly as a way to erase what many see as a stain on california s constitution other states have had and repealed laws that called for a public vote before the construction of low income housing but no other state constitution similarly requires voter approval for public housing according to the california constitution center at uc berkeley s law school advertisement today as the state grapples with an unprecedented affordable housing shortage article 34 has limited effects on the construction of low income developments but it remains an obstacle los angeles officials believe that without a public vote in the coming years the city will no longer be able to finance such projects even though it has the money to do so state sen ben allen d santa monica has introduced legislation to put the repeal before voters if it goes on a 2020 statewide ballot it would be the fourth time californians would consider changing or doing away with article 34 three prior efforts including the most recent in 1993 failed by wide margins with opponents arguing that residents should have the right to keep public housing out of their neighborhoods but allen believes the electorate has changed since the last attempt in the past few years voters have supported tax increases and bond measures to help support low income and homeless housing advertisement article 34 allen said is an anachronistic barrier that stands in the way of that article 34 grew out of a fight in the northern coastal city of eureka residents there collected signatures to overturn a decision to build public housing financed by a federal program inaugurated during the new deal but in 1950 the state supreme court ruled the acceptance of federal dollars wasn t subject to a referendum and residents couldn t block the development the california real estate assn the forerunner of today s california assn of realtors came up with a ballot initiative later that year to combat the eureka decision and require a public vote before public housing could be built realtors argued that residents should be able to weigh in on such a project because it could create taxpayer debt advertisement but the campaign which coincided with the start of the korean war was about more than giving voters a say in the realtors internal newsletter charles b shattuck the organization s legislative committee chairman wrote that public housing threatened capitalism if you value your property if you hold liberty dear if you believe in the dignity of the individual if you love this land of the free and the home of the brave if you desire to stop the enemy of socialism that is gnawing at the vitals of america from within the ballot box is your weapon the one and only means by which our great republic will be preserved and improved shattuck wrote in november 1950 newspaper ads paid for by the realtors also blamed minority pressure groups for pushing public housing at the time the realtors code of ethics included a provision barring agents from integrating neighborhoods on the basis of race or nationality if doing so would be clearly detrimental to property values advertisement the initiative passed by fewer than 50 000 votes in los angeles residents supported article 34 by an overwhelming margin the city was planning to build 10 000 units of public housing and the success of the statewide measure buoyed opponents who agitated for a referendum on the projects the city had already approved the resulting election in 1952 ended in a rejection of public housing and plunged city politics into chaos a top official in the city s public housing department was fired after an accusation that he was a communist and was later called to testify before state and federal un american activities committees the pro public housing mayor lost his reelection bid and the city canceled two planned developments including one in which residents were already being displaced in the mexican american community of chavez ravine on a site that eventually became dodger stadium advertisement the disputes chilled attempts to build public housing in los angeles which did not hold another article 34 referendum for more than two decades los angeles wasn t the only city where article 34 thwarted public housing by 1969 voters across the state had turned down nearly half the public housing that had been proposed in article 34 elections 15 000 units and many housing agencies didn t hold elections fearing that their plans would be rejected a federal department of housing and urban development report at the time found that california had the nation s largest population of poor people but ranked 22nd in the amount of housing available for them the report blamed article 34 those opposed to public housing were often open about their reasons in 1968 san jose city councilwoman virginia shaffer led a campaign against a series of publicly funded duplexes and small apartments in her city telling a reporter that some poor people drag the whole neighborhood down advertisement people oppose public housing because too often it means there will be piles of garbage trash knee high grass and undisciplined children in a neighborhood where other people are trying to meet their payments shaffer said the san jose vote failed prompting a legal challenge to article 34 the lawsuit argued that it violated the u s constitution s equal protection clause by denying poor people access to housing the case made its way to the u s supreme court where in 1971 justices affirmed article 34 s constitutionality in the majority opinion justice hugo black agreed that article 34 put low income residents at a disadvantage but wrote it did not violate the constitution because the provision didn t single out a racial group advertisement provisions for referendums demonstrate devotion to democracy not to bias discrimination or prejudice black wrote the supreme court decision was consequential said matthew lassiter a history professor at the university of michigan and an expert in the growth of the u s suburbs the ruling had the effect of affirming state and local policies that were openly biased against poor people he said soon afterward president richard nixon released a statement that embraced the decision s logic saying that the federal government would not impose economic integration on cities and counties the supreme court case is one of the most important defeats in civil rights history in the last century and is under appreciated in how much it contributed to the stoppage of efforts to integrate communities across the country lassiter said advertisement lassiter also was critical of the ruling for overlooking article 34 s racial implications racial discrimination in housing was legal until 1968 and in decades prior the federal government had guaranteed bank loans to developers of white only subdivisions promoted the use of racially restrictive covenants on deeds to prevent people of color from buying homes and subsidized white residents mortgages but not others the policies gave whites access to wealth through homeownership that others didn t have blocking low income housing lassiter said had the consequence of keeping most non whites from living in those areas as well to say it was not about race is to say history doesn t matter and there was this magic historical moment where all vestiges of a racialized housing market went away and everything started anew like the book of genesis lassiter said advertisement the supreme court decision returned the focus to california on three occasions state lawmakers have asked voters to rescind or weaken article 34 in 1974 a repeal failed by 24 percentage points six years later legislators put forward a proposition so that residents could appeal a decision to build public housing instead of holding an automatic vote that measure lost by an even greater margin then in 1993 lawmakers tried again with a proposition that would have kept article 34 on the books but exempted almost all projects from its rules this time the measure was supported by the california assn of realtors the group behind the original push for article 34 it didn t matter opponents including a state senator from northern los angeles and an orange county assemblyman contended in the official voter guide that article 34 was a success because it prevented public housing from being built why should we trust politicians and special interests to protect our local neighborhoods and spend our tax dollars wisely they wrote advertisement nearly 60 voted no article 34 is much less of a barrier to low income housing construction than it used to be over the years funding sources for such projects have changed when private developers set aside a portion of homes in a project for low income residents or housing is funded by federal or state tax credits a vote is not required courts have also decided that local governments can hold elections to authorize an overall number of public housing units to be built in future years rather than go to voters for each individual project and residents became friendlier to article 34 elections with around 80 of referenda approved by the early 1990s according to a report by the state department of housing and community development still the provision continues to be an obstacle for some low income homebuilding affordable housing developers structure deals to avoid triggering a vote legal and consulting costs can be in the tens of thousands of dollars or must ensure that a city has enough units approved from a prior article 34 election but when a local government hits its cap it must again seek approval from voters advertisement that s happening in los angeles a 2008 ballot measure approved by voters allowed up to 3 500 public housing units per council district in the city some neighborhoods are now close to their limit city officials believe they ll have to hold another vote within the next couple years to increase the cap prompting garcetti to instead pitch a repeal of article 34 to the legislature garcetti also said he takes issue with the argument that low income housing should be subject to a public vote because it involves spending government money taxpayer subsidies for homeowners through the mortgage interest deduction and other means long have dwarfed the public funding available for low income housing development we have done a much better job helping middle class upper middle class and wealthy californians with housing subsidies than we have for working class residents garcetti said advertisement but a repeal of article 34 is hardly a sure thing said former state treasurer phil angelides who worked on one of the failed efforts to weaken it angelides called the provision a blot on the constitution but said on its face a requirement to hold a public vote doesn t seem like it might have negative effects while it s clearly discriminatory it has the aura of local control which is something people like in california angelides said it s going to take a campaign of informing voters what it means coverage of

robert bradley jr founder and ceo of the institute for energy research there is nothing new about the green new deal it s the same old failed idea with a new green patina intended to make it appear what hasn t work still might proponents of the green new deal would do themselves a favor by examining the actual energy policies of fdr and their results if they did there would be perplexity even embarrassment about the new deal itself energy policy in the 1930s concerned a futile effort to make the oil and coal industries more profitable via federal control it was about fossil fuel executives setting codes of fair competition and a police state trying to enforce them it also was about federal electrification policy stamping out the distributed wind industry but most of all the new deal was about exacerbated chronic unemployment in short the green new deal has badly misbranded itself unemployment incubator the real new deal was a job sink not a job creator as documented by robert murphy among many other economists unprecedented government intervention in response to the fourth quarter 1929 financial crash created record unemployment pre 1929 unemployment of 3 4 percent worsened with hoover s interventionism and deteriorated further during fdr s national recovery act averaging more than 20 percent modest progress in the next years was reversed with 1938 s 19 percent many stocks and bonds in 1937 38 lost 40 percent of their value in the depression within a depression the hoover fdr new deal in short has nothing to offer an economy that is at virtually full employment unless green new deal advocates are machiavellian futile industry protectionism the results of the real new deal were no better at the industry level oil and coal executives wasted an ocean of time haggling over federal controls on prices and output with a philosophy that captains of industry could plan their industries and thus promote wider recovery fdr s philosophy cronyism was institutionalized the oil code and the coal code were two of many codes of fair competition for struggling industries each detracted from the adjustment process needed to remove excess capacity and rationalize output the men and women of the great depression consumers and taxpayers all were forgotten and for many workers artificially high wage rates meant zero wages unemployment or reduced hours underemployment there was an alphabet soup of federal bureaucracy the national industrial recovery act nira set up a division of investigation within the department of interior to try to enforce oil cutbacks under nira administrator hugh johnson code administrator harold ickes established the petroleum administra tion board pab which in functions and in struc ture greatly resembled the old oil division of the united states fuel adminis tration in world war i under the pab a planning and coordination committee established a network of local level commit tees staffed by oil execu tives to apportion quotas to each producing state and deal with code violations command and control regulation of prices and production had the predicable result of what economist ludwig von mises called planned chaos eyewitness economist myron watkins explained in reference to the oil code no matter how ela borate may be the statistical technique employed no matter how conscientious and fair minded may be those who apply it no mat ter how zealous may be the endeavor to conceal its naked arbi trariness by such descriptive terms as scientific legiti mate or equi table there is no escape from arbitrariness in quota fixing the coal code proved to be the most difficult problem to be faced by the nira according to historian james johnson the national coal association could not control its heterogeneous membership and john lewis s united mine workers were militant martial law would be required to keep the peace and the political socialization of industry as one state s coal operators described it was futile in the face of high output supply and low demand a police state despite more than 400 prosecutions on more than 1 800 reported infractions in the oil industry alone effective enforcement was never achieved for every disputed violation there was a hundred more and federal judges were as inclined to dismiss code violations as they were to side with the government the problem of code enforcement was encapsulated by warren platt unquestionably thousands of violations are being practiced everyday we have been waiting for almost a year now for the government to prosecute violators but the governmental mind is not made up yet though a mess of cases has been sent out to federal district attorneys who are having their troubles figuring out what it is all about even the government moves quickly would only be a drop in the bucket anyway they do not look like real crimes to the end that the public gets its oil and gasoline cheaper it is going to be hard to excite a jury gaming the federal rules became sport under politicized capitalism explained w t holiday the president of ohio standard there is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that if a statute in this way attempts to enumerate all the specific acts which constitute violation then any acts which are omitted are not prohibited expect a green new deal aiming to outlaw fossil fuel usage to be a police state too with self interested actions towards cheaper more reliable energies thwarting the central planners from washington d c distributed wind power erased irony of ironies fdr s signature program rural electrification substituted coal fired central station electricity for distributed wind battery power one history explained the displacement by fdr s rural electrification administration the aggressive rea program pitted neighbor against neighbor and insisted that any farm or wind electric plant equipment was removed or made inoperative for bogus safety reasons in the process rea destroyed an entire industry of more than 170 primary manufacturers and several hundred secondary manufacturers plus sales and service organizations which operated successfully and even grow in a vibrant free market during the great depression along with the losses of tens of thousands of jobs the small town manufacturers and retailers disappeared and energy dollars flowed out of these towns to the electric power monopolies in the urban centers wind enthusiast wilson clark provided this account the american windmill industry continued to grow in the early twentieth century until other sources of power invaded the prairies in the 1920s companies began to develop wind powered electric generators by the 1930s the death knell was sounded for wind machines of both the water pumping and the electric generating variety the rural electrification administration rea provide federally subsidized power to america s farmers in regions remote from privately financed power plants conclusion as economist and classical liberal historian richard ebeling concluded the proposed green new deal would be a giant leap on the road to serfdom it would create the distortions and conflicts that would engender more of the same its slow motion attack on wealth creation to subsidize the inefficient and a growing class of cronies would spiral the united states toward a present day venezuela indeed the same intellectuals and politicians behind the green new deal are predisposed to a new social order that was supposed to come with chavez maduro the larger lesson of venezuela s catastrophe should be learned wrote bret stephens in the new york times twenty years of socialism cheered by corbyn klein chomsky and co led to the ruin of a nation a basic understanding of economics and history should lead to a rejection of both the actual new deal and a prospective green new deal editor s note robert bradley couldn t be more on the money if you doubt that read amity shlaes wonderful book the forgotten man the classic road to serfdom is also a must read for anyone wanting to understand the venezuela crisis or any number of other stupid government attempts to direct an economy it s more

economic war redux the russia china factor cold war 2 0 has hit south america with a bang pitting the us and expected minions against the four key pillars of in progress eurasia integration russia china iran and turkey it s the oil stupid but there s way more than meets the oily eye caracas has committed the ultimate cardinal sin in the eyes of exceptionalistan remember iraq remember libya yet iran is also doing it turkey is doing it russia is partially on the way and china will eventually trade all its energy in petroyuan with venezuela adopting the petro crypto currency and the sovereign bolivar already last year the trump administration had sanctioned caracas off the international financial system no wonder caracas is supported by china russia and iran they are the real hardcore troika not psycho killer john bolton s cartoonish troika of tyranny fighting against the trump administration s energy dominance strategy venezuela is a key cog in the machine psycho killer bolton admitted it on the record it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela it s not a matter of just letting exxonmobil take over venezuela s massive oil reserves the largest on the planet the key is to monopolize their exploitation in us dollars benefitting a few big oil billionaires once again the curse of natural resources is in play venezuela must not be allowed to profit from its wealth on its own terms thus exceptionalistan has ruled that the venezuelan state must be shattered by now it s firmly established what happened in caracas was not a color revolution but an old school us promoted regime change coup using local comprador elites installing as interim president an unknown quantity juan guaido with his obama choirboy looks masking extreme right wing credentials everyone remembers assad must go the first stage in the syrian color revolution was the instigation of civil war followed by a war by proxy via multinational jihadi mercenaries as thierry meyssan has noted the role of the arab league then is performed by the oas now and the role of friends of syria now lying in the dustbin of history is now performed by the lima group the club of washington s vassals instead of al nusra moderate rebels we may have colombian or assorted emirati trained moderate rebel mercenaries the ruling socialist party got 70 percent of the votes the opposition with many parties boycotting it got 30 percent a serious delegation of the latin american council of electoral experts ceela was adamant the election reflected peacefully and without problems the will of venezuelan citizens the american embargo may be vicious major food importers speculating like there s no tomorrow are making a killing still reliable sources in caracas tell that the barrios the popular neighborhoods remain largely peaceful in a country where a full tank of gas still costs less than a can of coke the un rapporteur to venezuela expert on international law and former secretary of the un human rights council alfred de zayas goes straight to the point much more than engaging in the proverbial demonization of maduro washington is waging economic war against a whole nation it s enlightening to see how the venezuelan people see the charade in a poll conducted by hinterlaces even before the trump administration coup regime change wet dream 86 of venezuelans said they were against any sort of us intervention military or not and 81 of venezuelans said they were against us sanctions so much for benign foreign interference on behalf of democracy and human rights analyses by informed observers such as eva golinger and most of all the mision verdad collective are extremely helpful what s certain in true empire of chaos mode is that the american playbook beyond the embargo and sabotage is to foment civil war dodgy armed groups have been active in the caracas barrios acting in the dead of night and amplifying social unrest on social media still guaido holds absolutely no power inside the country his only chance of success is if he manages to install a parallel government cashing in on the oil revenue and having washington arrest government members on trumped up charges irrespective of neocon wet dreams adults at the pentagon should know that an invasion of venezuela may indeed metastasize into a tropical vietnam quagmire the brazilian strongman in waiting vice president and retired general hamilton mourao already said there will be no military intervention psycho killer bolton s by now infamous notepad stunt about 5 000 troops to colombia is a joke these would have no chance against the arguably 15 000 cubans who are in charge of security for the maduro government cubans have demonstrated historically they are not in the business of handing over power it all comes back to what china and russia may do china is venezuela s largest creditor maduro was received by xi jinping last year in beijing getting an extra 5 billion in loans and signing at least 20 bilateral agreements president putin offered his full support to maduro over the phone diplomatically stressing that destructive interference from abroad blatantly violates basic norms of international law by january 2016 oil was as low as 35 a barrel a disaster to venezuela s coffers maduro then decided to transfer 49 9 of the state ownership in pdvsa s us subsidiary citgo to russian rosneft for a mere 1 5 billion loan this had to send a wave of red lights across the beltway those evil russians were now part owners of venezuela s prime asset late last year still in need of more funds maduro opened gold mining in venezuela to russian mining companies and there s more nickel diamonds iron ore aluminum bauxite all coveted by russia china and the us as for 1 3 billion of venezuela s own gold forget about repatriating it from the bank of england and then last december came the straw that broke the deep state s back the friendship flight of two russian nuclear capable tu 160 bombers how dare they in our own backyard the trump administration s energy masterplan may be indeed to annex venezuela to a parallel north american south american petroleum exporting countries nasapec cartel capable of rivaling the opec love story between russia and the house of saud eurasia energy integration will mostly bypass the petrodollar this is at the very heart of both the brics and sco strategy from nord stream 2 to turk stream russia is locking down a long term energy partnership with europe and petroyuan dominance is just a matter of time moscow knows it tehran knows it ankara knows it riyadh knows it so what about plan b neocons

we should consider whether or not we have the fiscal and monetary policies in place to support this level of participation and economic expansion labor pains i ve written about labor issues in these

see positive growth there might be some small corrections over the next several months but for the most part things are looking good this past month the bureau of labor statistics reported that 304k

president as i wrote about in the last newsletter the equity markets are robust inflation is essentially flat and more people are working that s all good but there is one number i keep coming back to and that is the labor participation rate to keep the status quo in employment in the united states businesses need to produce around 190k jobs a month this is the number that matches the influx of individuals who reach age 16 and are then eligible to be counted in the workforce thus if the government reports more than 190k jobs being created then we are likely to see unemployment go down of course a lot depends on the participation rate today that participation rate is 63 2 this has been a steady number for the past several years but is far below the 66 of just a decade ago it may not be realistic to think that we would ever get back above 67 as we once were just a few years ago but a goal of 66 participation rate seems workable and important to achieve if the nation were to get to 66 participation rate that would mean an additional seven million people working if we were able to get seven million more people into the workforce we would likely see an additional 60 billion in federal tax revenue come into the treasury each year these additional wage earners would also contribute nearly 500 billion dollars to the gross domestic product this additional consumption would be a

the us economy well into its 10th year of growth still has a spring in its step and it s all the more visible when set against a tiring global picture a robust january jobs report on friday showed that america s companies are for now brushing off an array of economic perils and still hiring at a brisk pace the risks that for months had induced hand wringing among economists about a possible looming recession appear to have had little effect on employers overseas growth is stumbling led by weakness in china the world s second largest economy europe is hamstrung by a recession in italy and the potential for an unruly brexit a trade war between the us and china and higher us mortgage rates partly engineered by the federal reserve remain threats no matter employers added 304 000 jobs in january the healthiest burst of hiring in nearly a year the unemployment rate ticked up a notch to a still low 4 percent but that was mostly because thousands of furloughed federal workers were considered temporarily unemployed because of the partial government shutdown that quirk should reverse itself this month the solid jobs report and a separate survey that showed friday that us factory growth picked up last month stood in stark contrast with evidence of slower economic momentum in china and europe said lydia boussour senior us economist at oxford economics so why is the united states doing so well and will the sluggish global economy eventually depress us exports and economic growth trends that had looked alarming a month or two ago now appear benign perhaps even supportive of growth the stock market having plunged 16 percent late last year rose 8 percent in january its best monthly performance since 2015 americans who are invested in stocks typically cut spending when market indexes fall steadily that is now less likely to happen and suddenly the fed under chairman jerome powell looks like an economic ally the central bank had raised its benchmark short term interest rate four times last year action that helped make mortgages and other consumer and business loans costlier and in december the fed s policymakers said they envisioned raising rates twice more this year but this week the fed held its benchmark rate steady and sent its strongest signal to date that it saw no need to raise rates in the coming months perhaps even for the rest of the year its message ignited a rally on wall street which cheered the prospect of continued modest borrowing rates for the near future other factors have helped give the us economy an edge over most of its major rivals ethan harris global economist at bank of america merrill lynch said the trump administration s tax cuts in late 2017 and a sharp increase in government spending last spring helped fuel growth no other major economy in the world did what we did harris said the stimulus did a very good job of covering up all the blemishes of the economy including the risks of the trade war vigorous us hiring in the past few months partly represents a lagged effect from faster growth over the spring and summer harris said businesses that weren t able to quickly find and hire all the workers they wanted then have kept adding jobs in subsequent months the united states with its huge domestic market isn t as exposed to the vagaries of the global economy as some of its counterparts overseas are china for example expanded last year at its slowest pace in three decades that slowdown has in turn hit german manufacturers that sold much of their industrial machinery to china and italian automakers whose auto exports to china have plunged though earnings at some large us multinationals like the heavy equipment maker caterpillar have been weak corporate profits have so far been holding up despite the global slowdown and trade rifts of the companies in the s p 500 that have reported results for the fourth quarter of 2018 71 percent delivered profit growth that topped wall street forecasts though some have cut expectations for 2019 and china s downturn might not last megan greene chief economist at manulife said in a research note friday that beijing s efforts to stimulate growth appear to be having some effect still many economists including harris think the us economy will slow this year after expanding roughly 3 percent in 2018 the fastest pace in more than a decade harris forecasts that annual growth in the october december quarter of 2018 will be just 2 percent he and other economists expect the impact of the tax cuts and extra government spending to fade and for the rate hikes the fed has already imposed to hold back growth somewhat inevitably too a prolonged global slump would weaken the us economy as well published in daily times february 4th 2019
global investors recommended an increase in equity holdings to the highest in almost a year with a majority of funds polled by reuters this month saying the pull back in stocks has run its course the monthly poll of 44 wealth managers and chief investment officers in europe the united states britain and japan taken jan 14 30 showed overall equity exposure rose to 48 5 percent in a global balanced portfolio that was the highest since february last year and up from 47 2 percent in the previous month clearly the month of december was horrendous for global equity investors but this aggressive pull back has left valuations looking more attractive and now more investible said peter lowman chief investment officer at london based investment quorum financial markets swung wildly toward the end of 2018 slashing yearly gains from stocks to commodities the global msci index the s p 500 and the dow all had their worst year since the financial crisis that was driven by a steady drumbeat of disappointing economic data reinforcing concerns of slowing global growth alongside an escalating u s china trade war and an impasse over the terms under which britain will leave the european union while those risks remain equities have recovered somewhat this year sixty percent of fund managers who answered an additional question said the sell off in global stocks is done the s p 500 index has risen more than 10 percent from a trough carved on dec 26 last year bond allocations were trimmed in the latest poll to 39 1 percent on average from 39 5 percent cash holdings a gauge of investor caution nudged up to 6 2 percent from 6 1 percent the highest since november 2016 that suggests fund managers aren t yet confident about a significant lift off in stocks clear signs of a u s economic slowdown and the longest ever closure of the federal government are likely to keep the federal reserve on the sidelines until at least april u s policymakers reinforced their recent dovish stance on wednesday indeed separate reuters polls of over 500 economists around the world this month showed a synchronised global economic slowdown is now under way and any escalation in the u s china trade war risks would trigger a sharper downturn we start 2019 constructive on stocks but have been trimming the size of our overweights as we expect to get more cautious on the outlook as the year progresses said trevor greetham head of multi asset at royal london asset management those concerns coincide with growing unease among market strategists polled by reuters who have lowered forecasts in the past few months across various assets from stock prices to bond yields and oil among global asset managers the most notable change this month was a cut to european asset allocations a barrage of weak data including news that europe s top economy germany barely skirted a recession late last year suggests growth has slowed and economists now expect the european central bank to hold rates steady for longer we have moved europe to a deeper underweight as european economic data have been worse than expected and political risks are growing greetham said but for now at least allocations to north american assets were largely left unchanged while global equity valuations are still reasonably attractive it is noticeable that this is happening amidst a backdrop of continuing trade uncertainty between the u s and china and a deteriorating corporate earnings growth outlook for 2019 said thomas mcdonald portfolio manager at russell investments from this perspective we find it hard to justify a view other than neutral about 60 percent of fund managers in the latest poll who answered an additional question said the long dollar position was not the most crowded trade anymore that echoes the views of currency strategists polled by reuters who concluded that a rapid dialing back of fed rate hike expectations has diminished the greenback s edge over its peers but emerging markets are still being approached with caution as in recent months now that the fed is unlikely to raise interest rates over the near term the biggest risk to the economy and the markets is trade tensions with china said alan gayle president of via nova investment management if progress is made equity prices particularly international and emerging market prices should benefit we are hopeful but will wait for results before committing and reallocating funds source reuters by rahul karunakar additional reporting and polling by sujith pai manjul paul and sarmista sen in bengaluru fumika inoue in tokyo and maria pia quaglia regondi in milan editing by ross finley larry king
the price action in eurusd pair was highly volatile across the month of january however a look at weekly and monthly chart clearly shows that price was little changed at end of the month geopolitical events remained the main driving force behind price action of the pair across the month similar to price action in 3rd quarter of fy2018 19 despite clear indication of positive proceedings in major political and economic events none of them show any signs of resolution in near future with deadlines for two of most anticipated and followed events nearby they dominated price action across the month and are expected to continue influencing price action during february 2019 as well the two events have been wreaking havoc for quite some time in the market now that even people living under the rock are familiar with them namely brexit sino u s trade war both the events have been active across all three financial quarters of the ongoing financial year and resulted in historic declines immediately after global markets experienced one of its finest pace of economic growth in fy2017 18 the first week of january saw subdued price action owing to caution ahead of key political and economic events set to follow shortly resulting in pair closing in red for the first week of january 2019 headlines on sino u s trade talks fed s portfolio shrinking plans underpinned euro bulls while price action was positive at the start of the week gains were capped owing to cautious market sentiment as traders awaited speech from previous and current us federal reserve chairpersons however comments made by fed chair jerome powell and his predecessors during their speech at end of the first week hinted at u s federal reserve taking a dovish stance towards rate hike plans for 2019 which caused us dollar to weaken across broad market helping the pair close well above weekly lows the second week of january saw euro climb steadily owing to optimism surrounding sino u s trade talk this event was the first face to face talks between representatives of both nations after december s g 20 summit headlines hinted at progress during talks despite the event unexpectedly extending for the third day resulting in the pair hitting monthly highs near 1 1569 however no details on what topics were discussed during talks hit the market further news of an unexpected visit from north korean leader kim jong un with an itinerary to stay in china for a couple of days when talks between china u s were in progress inspired a fresh wave of bearish influence in a market resulting in euro moving downwards erasing all gains made early in the week north korean leader kim jong un s new year statement which contained a veiled threat to the u s just ahead of his visit to china was the main reason for investors caution resulting in the pair in red the third week saw pair extend previous week s decline owing to a multitude of bearish events the pair sustained sharp losses as uk parliament voted down pm may s brexit deal with the us the outcome of parliament meeting was as widely expected with mp s rejected pm may s deal while pm may managing to win the vote of confidence against her while the outcome was mostly priced in by traders across the market dovish comments from ecb president mario draghi and us dollar s modest recovery owing to slight rebound of us treasury yield near the end of third week pressured euro into sharp downwards price action across the week resulting in the pair seeing bearish closing for the week euro was further pressured by disappointing chinese gdp data imf s reduction of growth forecast for 2019 at the start of the week political power struggle stemming from italy as italy s anti eu axis activities saw key figures trying to gain dominance and power over their counterparts in germany and france increasing bearish pressure on euro resulting in the pair trade range bound near third week lows for most of the week however the pair managed to recover from weekly lows and close positive on the fourth week as american market hours on last trading session of the week saw u s president donald trump temporarily reopen government for three weeks and wall street journal reported that the fed is likely to stop shrinking their balance sheet earlier than expected resulting in positive closing for the week the fifth week saw positive price action with euro moving back near monthly highs as us fomc members stated that future interest rate decision will depend on the economic performance of u s a and that there is a chance for even reducing rates instead of hiking depending on economic progress in u s markets fed chair powell further stated that their portfolio shrinking activities is likely to end earlier than expected as ongoing trade war with major global economies and the partial shutdown of u s government took a significant toll on u s economy brexit chaos e u u s china u s trade talks likely to push euro into bears territory this caused the dollar to suffer a sharp decline in market helping euro gain momentum despite the lack of fundamental support ending the month of january on a positive note however the month ahead looks gloomy for euro as the currency has a clear lack of fundamental support to sustain positive price action and uk parliament session during last week of january brought back brexit chaos to the forefront both pm may and labor party failed to get their amendments approved resulting in a scenario on no deal exit as motion to extend article 50 and attempt brexit referendum as voted down and pm may was given an ultimatum where her plan b can be put in motion only if she convinces eu to replace irish backstop with another deal which eu is not ready for this situation will lead to sharp losses in both economies further sino u s trade deal could also be foiled if presidents xi jinping and donald trump fail to resolve their differences during their meeting eu is also likely to enter trade talks with the u s but current scenario suggests that e u doesn t want to open access of their agriculture market to u s a which u s expects to obtain via threat of sanctions of eu auto market as

columns staff reports the herald mail washington the federal reserve decided not to raise interest rates last week in the midst of declining consumer confidence and a sharply volatile stock market after nearly a year or so of watching stocks rise and fall on wall street with dizzying repetition the central bank voted without dissent to hold its rate between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent moreover the fed signaled that any future rate moves would be decided with increased patience and caution to first see how economic conditions unfold in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes the fed said in a statement that cautionary promise followed remarks during a question and answer press conference last october when chairman jerome powell said it would be a long time before the fed adopted a neutral rate of growth that rattled the major financial markets briefly sending them into a bear market selling binge making matters worse powell angered investors in december by suggesting that the fed s plan to curb its bond holdings was on autopilot but the fed s far more cautious statement wednesday to keep interest rates where they were reassured the stock markets wednesday sending the dow up 435 points to over 25 015 the nasdaq finished at up 154 79 while the s p rose by 41 79 wednesday s statement from the policymaking federal open market committee struck a more tepid approach writes economic reporter jeff cox of cnbc the committee lowered its assessment of economic growth from strong to solid and noted that its inflation gauges have moved lower in recent months he added the statement also removed the balance of risks portion in which the committee sought to quantify the chances of economic growth above or below forecasts still president trump s economy is not out of the woods u s consumer confidence fell to a 1 1 2 year low in january as a partial government shutdown and financial markets turmoil left households nervous about the economy s near term outlook reuters reported wednesday the drop in confidence reported by the conference board on tuesday mirrors another survey earlier this month showing sentiment tumbling to its lowest level since president donald trump was elected more than two years ago reuters added the conference board s consumer confidence index dropped 6 4 points to 120 2 this month the lowest reading since july 2017 another warning of slower economic growth ahead comes from the congressional budget office which tells us that the longest government shutdown in u s history cost the economy 11 billion but about 8 billion of that will be made up by additional economic transactions when back pay goes out to returning federal workers in a report earlier this week cbo projected that the economy would be growing by only 1 7 percent in 2020 a sharp slowdown from previous years it further projects that the economy will grow by 2 3 percent this year as a result of trump s tax cuts and new federal spending programs that gloomy forecast becomes even gloomier if trump goes ahead with his planned march 2 tariff hike on 200 billion in chinese goods if he does expect slower economic growth why because in the final analysis consumers will end paying for those tariffs in the form of higher prices as for consumer confidence falling to a 1 1 2 year low in january expect that to go even lower we re in for a bumpy ride folks donald lambro has been covering washington politics for more than 50 years as a reporter editor and commentator

ending the banishment of children under its harsh asylum seeker policy the psychiatric and physical suffering of children has been the major criticism of the government s asylum seeker policy since 2013 the rule has seen those arriving by boat sent to an immigration camp on nauru or men only facilities on papua new guinea prime minister scott morrison said the last four asylum seeker children on nauru would soon be resettled with their families in the us under a deal struck in the final months of president barack obama s administration every asylum seeker child has now been removed from nauru or has had their claim processed and has a clear path off the island mr morrison said in a statement the us agreed in 2016 to accept up to 1 250 refugees recommended doctors refuse to discharge a baby from hospital to go back to nauru more than 1 000 others remain on the islands and face uncertain futures law firm maurice blackburn said it would continue its legal fight until all asylum seekers

washington ap the u s economy well into its 10th year of growth still has a spring in its step and it s all the more visible when set against a tiring global picture a robust january jobs report on friday showed that america s companies are for now brushing off an array of economic perils and still hiring at a brisk pace the risks that for months had induced hand wringing among economists about a possible looming recession appear to have had little effect on employers overseas growth is stumbling led by weakness in china the world s second largest economy europe is hamstrung by a recession in italy and the potential for an unruly brexit a trade war between the u s and china and higher u s mortgage rates partly engineered by the federal reserve remain threats no matter employers added 304 000 jobs in january the healthiest burst of hiring in nearly a year the unemployment rate ticked up a notch to a still low 4 percent but that was mostly because thousands of furloughed federal workers were considered temporarily unemployed because of the partial government shutdown that quirk should reverse itself this month the solid jobs report and a separate survey that showed friday that u s factory growth picked up last month stood in stark contrast with evidence of slower economic momentum in china and europe said lydia boussour senior u s economist at oxford economics so why is the united states doing so well and will the sluggish global economy eventually depress u s exports and economic growth trends that had looked alarming a month or two ago now appear benign perhaps even supportive of growth the stock market having plunged 16 percent late last year rose 8 percent in january its best monthly performance since 2015 americans who are invested in stocks typically cut spending when market indexes fall steadily that is now less likely to happen and suddenly the fed under chairman jerome powell looks like an economic ally the central bank had raised its benchmark short term interest rate four times last year action that helped make mortgages and other consumer and business loans costlier and in december the fed s policymakers said they envisioned raising rates twice more this year but this week the fed held its benchmark rate steady and sent its strongest signal to date that it saw no need to raise rates in the coming months perhaps even for the rest of the year its message ignited a rally on wall street which cheered the prospect of continued modest borrowing rates for the near future other factors have helped give the u s economy an edge over most of its major rivals ethan harris global economist at bank of america merrill lynch said the trump administration s tax cuts in late 2017 and a sharp increase in government spending last spring helped fuel growth no other major economy in the world did what we did harris said the stimulus did a very good job of covering up all the blemishes of the economy including the risks of the trade war vigorous u s hiring in the past few months partly represents a lagged effect from faster growth over the spring and summer harris said businesses that weren t able to quickly find and hire all the workers they wanted then have kept adding jobs in subsequent months the united states with its huge domestic market isn t as exposed to the vagaries of the global economy as some of its counterparts overseas are china for example expanded last year at its slowest pace in three decades that slowdown has in turn hit german manufacturers that sold much of their industrial machinery to china and italian automakers whose auto exports to china have plunged though earnings at some large u s multinationals like the heavy equipment maker caterpillar have been weak corporate profits have so far been holding up despite the global slowdown and trade rifts of the companies in the s p 500 that have reported results for the fourth quarter of 2018 71 percent delivered profit growth that topped wall street forecasts though some have cut expectations for 2019 and china s downturn might not last megan greene chief economist at manulife said in a research note friday that beijing s efforts to stimulate growth appear to be having some effect still many economists including harris think the u s economy will slow this year after expanding roughly 3 percent in 2018 the fastest pace in more than a decade harris forecasts that annual growth in the october december quarter of 2018 will be just 2 percent he and other economists expect the impact of the tax cuts and extra government spending to fade and for the rate hikes the fed has already imposed to hold back growth somewhat inevitably too a prolonged global slump would weaken the u s economy as well but exactly how the u s economy is faring is harder than usual to judge because many data reports including the quarterly figures on growth are still delayed from the 35 day government shutdown the government hasn t yet said when it will release its first estimate of gross domestic product the broadest gauge of the economy for the final three months of 2018 there are hints that the u s economy won t fare as well in the coming year as it did in 2018 diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton noted that u s home and auto sales are declining a sign that they might have peaked if so america s consumers may not be able to propel the economy as much as they have and businesses have cut back on their investments in buildings and large equipment which suggests a reluctance to permanently expand their facilities they re willing to add more people that s good swonk said but right now they re not willing to pull the trigger and bet on building more capacity that undermines your foundation for future growth copyright

while equity markets have entered bear territory in recent days investors can expect a sizeable bear market bounce in the first half of 2019 jp morgan asset management jpmam said its singapore based global market strategist jasslyn yeo noted that several potential positive catalysts support the case for a significant bounce including the recent change to a more dovish view by the united states federal reserve s policymaking committee the first quarter has typically been a seasonally weak quarter for us growth coupled with the us government shutdown we expect the fed to pause in march and for this pause to bring about much relief for risk assets said dr yeo she added that investor sentiment could improve on the back of a positive fourth quarter earnings season further china policy stimulus and a potential us china trade deal before the march 2 deadline dr yeo also judged this bear market to be a more cyclical one associated with the normal downturn of business cycles given the absence of major structural imbalances cyclical bears tend to see shallower corrections and quicker recoveries than structural bears however the outlook pointed to further recession risks and longer recoveries ahead given the limited ability of central banks to stimulate the economy going by slowing real gross domestic product figures global growth was moderating from above trend to trend rates and markets were firmly in late cycle 2 0 dr yeo said in the firm s quarterly outlook on thursday global central banks were also gradually withdrawing liquidity support that bolstered market returns and asset prices in the last several years global growth is slowing and global liquidity is tightening but the us federal reserve is unlikely to stop hiking rates with no immediate threat of a recession jpmam noted the european central bank could find it hard to raise rates while the bank of japan is likely to remain status quo conversely the chinese government could further ease policy to stabilise growth but we don t expect to see any big bang stimulus she recommended that longer term investors use the bear market bounce to de risk their portfolios and consider more bond exposure to diversify and mitigate volatility demand for safe haven us treasuries would likely increase as the fed approached the peak of its rate hike cycle and recession risks also increased us corporate bonds however were vulnerable with large downside risks and typically poor liquidity with the recession risks jpmam remained cautious on equities beyond the prospect for a bounce preferring those with more defensive income generating characteristics valuations may be looking more reasonable following a difficult 2018 but it s hard to see sustainable re rating with tightening global liquidity and negative earnings revisions dr yeo said earnings per share growth is likely to fall further as the cycle slows down dr yeo advised caution on emerging markets and asia ex japan equities as the us dollar was likely to appreciate with rising recession risk
sen sherrod brown an ohio democrat who is weighing a presidential bid speaks during a meet and greet on saturday at inspire cafe in dubuque iowa for democrats looking to retake the white house few midterm election results provided a bigger thrill than victories in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania the once blue states donald trump won by excruciatingly narrow margins in 2016 in large part because of support from white working class voters enough of those voters came back in 2018 to deliver victory to democratic governors and u s senators across the industrial belt now as a big field of 2020 presidential candidates takes shape democrats face an urgent question who if anyone can keep those voters in the fold advertisement sherrod brown of ohio a progressive third term senator with strong ties to organized labor thinks he may be the answer little known outside his home state brown has gained attention while exploring a presidential bid because he sees a void in the field you ve got to talk to workers he said after meeting with union members saturday in eastern iowa i don t think anybody s done that loudly enough strongly enough and emphatically enough advertisement conducting a three day tour this weekend through this influential early voting state brown flashed his political badge of honor in 2018 he was the only democrat to win statewide in ohio holding the support of tens of thousands of trump voters in a state hillary clinton lost by 8 points if brown can win in ohio an increasingly conservative state that many democrats say is all but lost to the party in presidential races surely he can carry wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania he and his backers say that pitch found a receptive audience in iowa tim powers a retired firefighter in waterloo sees in brown s lunch bucket liberalism a possible antidote to democrats 2016 defeat advertisement we left the lunch box behind and we got our ass kicked in the last election he said the latest from washington keeping a focus on blue collar issues is easier said than done when many in the progressive wing of the party are animated by social issues such as lgbtq rights and immigration policies to the left of the views held by many working class families noting that a large share of democrats 2018 victories were built on increasing support from upscale suburban women republican pollster bill mcinturff said the energy inside the democratic party and their issue focus suggests they have moved on from competing for white working class voters especially men advertisement but democratic strategists argue that even if democrats can t win back all the voters who moved to trump in 2016 they can t give up the fight to hold a share of the white working class vote if you look at the chances for democrats in 2020 one thing they absolutely have to do is take back those states in the upper midwest said ruy teixeira a political analyst at the liberal center for american progress brown he said is among the best to do that advertisement in 2016 trump won wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania by fewer than 80 000 votes that was enough to smash the blue wall of states on which democrats had relied since 1992 in those states and elsewhere clinton suffered resounding losses among white working class voters nationwide she lost them by 39 points the largest margin for a democrat going back to 1980 when exit polls first started tracking those voters but the midterm results showed democrats that recovery is possible in 2018 democratic candidates in the big industrial states narrowed the gap by half or more compared with clinton s deficits according to exit polls advertisement to be sure many of the midterm victories were carried out by well established incumbents such as michigan sen debbie stabenow and some of the republican defeats were narrow wisconsin gop gov scott walker lost by just one point for example that s a reminder to democrats that winning back the voters they need won t be easy i would not take them for granted said dayton mayor nan whaley co chair of a political committee draft sherrod brown we need to pay very close attention to what we are saying rather than just assuming everyone will come back home indeed trump allies say they are hopeful that the midterm results in the upper midwest are not harbingers of a 2020 loss for the president advertisement just as obama lost the house in 2010 and won reelection in 2012 midterms are poor indicators of future results said brian o walsh president of america first action a pro trump super pac whether it s a liberal senator from ohio or a progressive senator from california they re both part of the problem in washington d c brown cuts a different profile than many of his potential democratic rivals from the east and west coasts even in a political era where authenticity is highly valued and sen bernie sanders i vt set a low bar for polish brown is a standout his trademarks are unkempt hair disheveled suits and a gravelly voice advertisement he s the columbo of the democratic party said david axelrod a democratic strategist who advised president obama he d be doing beer commercials if he was a voice over guy his tour theme is the dignity of work a catchphrase for a populist economic agenda that includes an increased minimum wage expanded collective bargaining rights and fighting corporations on behalf of workers he is careful to aim his message to workers of all races and types not just the white working class as a way to bridge a festering division within the party whether you shower before work or after work whether you go to work early in the morning or whether you go to work late at night is a standard introduction to his litany advertisement too often people act like our party has to choose between advocating for strong progressive values that excite our base or talking to working class voters about their lives he said when he kicked off his tour thursday night in cleveland for us it s not either or it s both jeff horwitt a democratic pollster sees promise for the party in surveys showing that blacks and working class whites share a sense of dissatisfaction with an economic and political system they see as stacked against people like themselves whomever democrats nominate in 2020 it will be critical for the nominee to speak the language of the white working class horwitt said but he added there are an awful lot of ways where the white working class and people of color are looking for the same kinds of change in our country advertisement brown s tour included many of the kinds of communities democrats will have to win back in 2020 counties that voted for barack obama in 2008 and 2012 and flipped to trump in 2016 in clinton county where he met with union members saturday voters went for obama with 60 in both elections but favored trump by 5 points in 2016 like many potential democratic candidates brown is not well known nationally a december poll by the des moines register found 69 did not know enough about him to have an opinion 41 said that about california sen kamala harris 12 about massachusetts sen elizabeth warren he s a lifelong ohio politician beginning with his election to the state legislature in 1974 at age 22 he later served as ohio secretary of state in the u s house and was elected to the senate in 2006 advertisement brown digs deep into the past to establish his progressive bona fides including his house votes against the iraq war the north american free trade agreement and the anti gay defense of marriage act former vice president joe biden a potential rival to brown voted in favor of all three while in the senate brown s supporters like to point out his opposition to nafta aligned him with trump and may have helped him win reelection in 2018 while all other statewide democrats in ohio lost brown won by almost 7 points although that was a smaller margin than polls projected in a race where he outspent his gop opponent 7 to 1 if he runs for president brown may face pushback for one notable departure from liberal orthodoxy he does not support medicare for all an idea that has moved from the party s liberal fringes to increasing acceptance especially among potential 2020 candidates brown considers it impractical advertisement brown says he supports the idea of universal health coverage and proposes first to allow people in their 50s to voluntarily opt into medicare he also would make a public health insurance option available through the affordable care act at a meet and greet friday in waterloo iowa questioners confronted him on his incremental approach he responded by calling the broader proposal tilting at windmills everybody feels good saying i m for medicare for all i m for medicare for all but nothing changes he said i want to change people s lives and help people now advertisement with that he may have lost a vote ruth walker a cedar falls retiree said afterward that she was disappointed in his answer and would probably not consider backing him i m a real stickler she said i was not impressed but brown may also make converts dave donovan a sanders supporter who met brown in dubuque has backed medicare for all but was impressed with brown s argument he s made me think donovan said he s got passion
the cost is bound to be steep puerto rico s bankruptcy case is one of the largest in united states history with billions of dollars in bond debt and unfunded pensions to restructure and mind bending legal complexities mckinsey will have earned 69 million as of the end of december according to court filings and the terms of its contracts with the federal oversight board the firm s conduct has been challenged in other bankruptcies as well in november the justice department asked a bankruptcy judge in virginia to reopen the case of a coal company alpha natural resources and force mckinsey to return the roughly 20 million it was paid because mckinsey had concealed an investment stake a hearing to discuss the matter has been scheduled for january and a bankruptcy judge in houston david r jones this week ordered limited discovery in the bankruptcy of westmoreland coal where mckinsey s role representing the company is also being challenged mckinsey has said it did nothing wrong in either case in october congressional aides met with the chairman of puerto rico s federal oversight board josé b carrión iii and expressed concern over mckinsey s undisclosed investments mr carrión said the board was confident that mckinsey s advice was not tainted but the aides said there was at the very least an appearance of impropriety they warned that they were working on a legislative fix the united states bankruptcy code requires the experts who work on bankruptcies to have undivided loyalties which is intended to uphold public confidence in a system where large amounts of money constantly change hands all professionals working on a case are required to make sworn disclosures of any investments and business activities that connect them with the other parties being connected does not automatically disqualify the professional but it must be disclosed the penalties for hidden conflicts can be severe as a united states territory puerto rico was not eligible for bankruptcy congress had to enact a new law called promesa to give the island a legal framework for its restructuring the new bill would require all professionals to make the usual sworn disclosures not just mckinsey but also other experts working for puerto rico s oversight board including citigroup ernst young and proskauer rose it would also give the justice department s bankruptcy watchdog the office of the united states trustee an explicit mandate to investigate possible conflicts of interest and empower the federal judge handling puerto rico s case to block the payment of an adviser s fees if a conflict is found

billionaires are pretty damn sure they know what s best for you no more taxes on the rich and none of that medicare for all is what s best for you according to two billionaires toying with seeking the presidency or maybe that s what s best for them one of those billionaires former starbucks ceo howard schultz called medicare for all un american actually what is un american is the fact that america is the only first world country that fails to provide universal health insurance schultz and michael bloomberg the other billionaire who thinks he should be president revealed themselves as out of touch private jet riding multi mansion owning gold leaf latte sippers by condemning lawmakers who have proposed raising taxes on the nation s most obscenely rich bloomberg said for example we need a healthy economy and we shouldn t be embarrassed about our system no it s not embarrassing that 40 percent of americans don t have 400 for an emergency expense it s not humiliating that in the richest country in the world federal workers couldn t afford their insulin during the government shutdown because their low pay forces them to live paycheck to paycheck it causes no discomfort that 5 million americans are stuck in part time jobs when they need full time ones to get by or that so many more are trapped in precarious or contract work without security or benefits when they need you know security and benefits it s not shameful that the number of americans without health insurance increased by 3 2 million in the first year of billionaire donald trump s presidency well the americans who are demeaned and degraded by our system the d c cafeteria workers who make so little they live in cars the people who can only dream of affording a 5 schultz latte don t need or want billionaires telling them how to run their lives or how to fix the system that has rendered so many so desperate they ve got their own ideas they want an american system that fulfills its promise of equality not equality of income no one is demanding that they want a democracy that provides them with equality as self determining citizens they want political equality they don t have that parity when they are financially desperate they don t have it when they are uninsured or covered by insurance so costly that they can t afford to use it they know they are not politically equal to a schultz or bloomberg or trump who can buy themselves hordes of lobbyists to get what they want from washington can purchase even the presidency itself and then with that power sustain a system that benefits the very rich at the expense of everyone else in recent weeks several lawmakers have offered ideas to change the system for average americans u s sen elizabeth warren suggested a small tax on the wealth of those worth more than 50 million u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez proposed taxing at 70 percent income above 10 million both of them u s sen kamala harris u s sen bernie sanders and others support medicare for all reducing health care costs for most americans and increasing taxes on the uber rich could help fund universal childcare student debt relief and other programs to ease financial stress on the 99 percent and that would free them to engage in political activism to become marginally more politically equal these populist pitches to rein in rule by plutocrats left bloomberg and schultz gagging barely containing his condescension 3 4 billionaire schultz called ocasio cortez a bit misinformed and her tax plan punitive as if a levy on ultra millionaires that would be lower than the 91 percent charged in 1950 would be punitive but pay so pathetic that full time d c workers are reduced to homelessness is not bloomberg said he knew of no country in the world with a wealth tax like the one warren suggested in fact the number of nations charging such a tax has declined from 12 in 1990 as income and wealth inequality has risen worldwide but there are still four france norway spain and switzerland bloomberg just does not think the rich should be paying taxes he said president barack obama s proposal to raise taxes on the rich was about as dumb a policy as i can think of this is the guy who wants to tax the poor with a levy on soda pop the 47 billionaire believes that poor people consume too many sugary drinks he was going to help them keep weight off by making pop unaffordable rich guys like him can quaff as many 1 000 bottles of chateau lafite rothschild 2009 as they want with twice as many calories per cup as cherry dr pepper but he was going to try to control the lives of poor people the rich got their way in december of 2017 at the behest of billionaire donald trump congress substantially cut taxes on the wealthy and on corporations they promised that gift to the rich would trickle down on the rest and that corporations would take those big fat savings and invest them in american factories research and hiring and they claimed there d be so much more economic activity that the tax cut would pay for itself none of it happened corporations didn t invest a quarterly poll by business economists released this week found the tax cut had almost no impact on investment or hiring instead corporations spent the money on stock buybacks a scheme that enriches already wealthy ceos and stockholders buybacks hit a record 1 trillion last year nearly 50 percent more than the year before the congressional budget office said this week that the tax cuts pushed the federal budget deficit up to 900 billion that they didn t come close to paying for themselves and that their stimulus effects would wane this year to close that budget deficit republicans in congress and the billionaire in the oval office refuse to consider reinstating higher taxes on the rich and corporations instead they re talking about repealing the estate tax charged only to a tiny percent of the nation s most wealthy and slashing the very programs that non rich americans cherish and depend on medicare medicaid and social security all of this defies logic in a democracy nearly 80 percent of americans want social security and medicare expanded not cut at least 56 percent support medicare for all not cuts to federal health insurance programs for the poor and elderly and the vast majority of non rich people in this country are all for increasing taxes on fat cats even a recent poll by the conservative fox news found that to be the case it determined that by a 46 point margin voters want to raises taxes on those earning more than 10 million it was 70 percent in favor to a tiny 24 percent opposed but u s workers don t get what they want the rich determine which bitter pill to shove down the throats of the 99 percent and billionaires like schultz and bloomberg believe they have the absolute right to prescribe that pill political equality and self determination be damned

by mike rosenberg seattle times the ceos of the seattle metro s largest businesses from amazon and boeing to starbucks and nordstrom are pushing for more housing for middle income workers at a time when professionals like nurses teachers and cops are increasingly being priced out and new housing is aimed mostly at higher earners challenge seattle a group of 17 local ceos led by former gov christine gregoire released a report wednesday that amounts to a call for action on more housing aimed at households making between 54 000 and 108 000 or less for individuals the group also includes the chief executives of microsoft costco zillow weyerhaeuser alaska airlines expedia and the bill melinda gates foundation among others except for microsoft the companies thus far have not ponied up their own financial resources to spur investment in new housing instead they are advocating for things gregoire concedes should prove challenging to implement like zoning reform and changes to real estate investment that could lower profits the basic problem is this over the past decade local home prices and rents have soared twice as fast as incomes the biggest impact has been on low income residents but now about 40 percent of middle income earners spend more on housing than they can afford defined as more than 30 percent of their income seattle and a couple of its suburbs have seen an epic building boom yet new housing aimed at middle class workers has been almost nonexistent this decade 85 percent of new county apartments have been luxury units where rents top 2 000 a month developers do that because it s the most profitable on the other end some nonprofits and public agencies have been building subsidized housing aimed at the lowest wage earners helped by tax credits and gifts that make those projects work financially the report outlines some of the effects a local utility apparently puget sound energy has just three after hours responders left living in the service area that spans renton bellevue kirkland mercer island and newcastle slowing response times local cops even the police chief of bellevue have had to move to cities outside where they serve the share of commuters driving at least 90 minutes one way has grown 70 percent this decade if a community cannot provide housing to those who are the heart and soul of it those who respond to disasters provide health care teach our kids and so on then what kind of community is that to live in gregoire said in an interview the group asks local governments to relax zoning laws to allow for more density especially near transit that will be a tough sell in suburbs where housing construction is already weaker than its historical average as residents fed up over issues like traffic and noise fight to protect single family neighborhoods however mayors of nine local suburbs at the urging of challenge seattle and microsoft recently signed a letter committing to consider such changes the ceos also ask governments to reduce impact fees that help fund projects to offset some of the issues development exacerbates like traffic to reduce construction costs it wants the state to relax laws that make it easier for condo owners to sue developers in hopes the change would spur more condo construction an effort already underway in olympia this session and it wants tax credits used to finance low income projects to be extended to projects aimed at middle income earners the group also wants to challenge the real estate industry to essentially make less money in the short term which figures to be an even harder sell for instance it wants socially conscious banks and investors to make loans for middle income housing with below market interest rates asks equity partners that invest in developments in exchange for a stake in the project to receive their profits in smaller chunks over a longer time frame and wants lenders to provide short term loans for land the riskiest time for investors to give out loans because projects aren t certain at that stage microsoft a member of the coalition made a big splash last month with plans for a 500 million housing fund including 225 million in loans to help finance middle income housing at below market interest rates but no other member of the group has committed to spending its own money on the problem even as the housing crisis affects their employees and communities where they are based gregoire said the group will consider in the coming weeks creating a housing lending fund similar to microsoft s with its member companies and perhaps other local businesses and even private citizens eligible to contribute we re by no means done she said the report acknowledges an obvious self serving aspect of their efforts the housing crisis makes it harder for companies to attract and retain employees and the region risks losing its economic edge because of affordability problems there s been some momentum toward the middle income housing issue lately in addition to microsoft s investment seattle mayor jenny durkan last week formed the city s first advisory council aimed at promoting policies to build more middle income housing co chaired by another former governor gary locke
sen sherrod brown an ohio democrat who is weighing a presidential bid speaks during a meet and greet on saturday at inspire cafe in dubuque iowa for democrats looking to retake the white house few midterm election results provided a bigger thrill than victories in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania the once blue states donald trump won by excruciatingly narrow margins in 2016 in large part because of support from white working class voters enough of those voters came back in 2018 to deliver victory to democratic governors and u s senators across the industrial belt now as a big field of 2020 presidential candidates takes shape democrats face an urgent question who if anyone can keep those voters in the fold sherrod brown of ohio a progressive third term senator with strong ties to organized labor thinks he may be the answer advertisement little known outside his home state brown has gained attention while exploring a presidential bid because he sees a void in the field you ve got to talk to workers he said after meeting with union members saturday in eastern iowa i don t think anybody s done that loudly enough strongly enough and emphatically enough conducting a three day tour this weekend through this influential early voting state brown flashed his political badge of honor in 2018 he was the only democrat to win statewide in ohio holding the support of tens of thousands of trump voters in a state hillary clinton lost by 8 points if brown can win in ohio an increasingly conservative state that many democrats say is all but lost to the party in presidential races surely he can carry wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania he and his backers say that pitch found a receptive audience in iowa tim powers a retired firefighter in waterloo sees in brown s lunch bucket liberalism a possible antidote to democrats 2016 defeat we left the lunch box behind and we got our ass kicked in the last election he said the latest from washington keeping a focus on blue collar issues is easier said than done when many in the progressive wing of the party are animated by social issues such as lgbtq rights and immigration policies to the left of the views held by many working class families noting that a large share of democrats 2018 victories were built on increasing support from upscale suburban women republican pollster bill mcinturff said the energy inside the democratic party and their issue focus suggests they have moved on from competing for white working class voters especially men but democratic strategists argue that even if democrats can t win back all the voters who moved to trump in 2016 they can t give up the fight to hold a share of the white working class vote if you look at the chances for democrats in 2020 one thing they absolutely have to do is take back those states in the upper midwest said ruy teixeira a political analyst at the liberal center for american progress brown he said is among the best to do that in 2016 trump won wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania by fewer than 80 000 votes that was enough to smash the blue wall of states on which democrats had relied since 1992 in those states and elsewhere clinton suffered resounding losses among white working class voters nationwide she lost them by 39 points the largest margin for a democrat going back to 1980 when exit polls first started tracking those voters but the midterm results showed democrats that recovery is possible in 2018 democratic candidates in the big industrial states narrowed the gap by half or more compared with clinton s deficits according to exit polls to be sure many of the midterm victories were carried out by well established incumbents such as michigan sen debbie stabenow and some of the republican defeats were narrow wisconsin gop gov scott walker lost by just one point for example that s a reminder to democrats that winning back the voters they need won t be easy i would not take them for granted said dayton mayor nan whaley co chair of a political committee draft sherrod brown we need to pay very close attention to what we are saying rather than just assuming everyone will come back home indeed trump allies say they are hopeful that the midterm results in the upper midwest are not harbingers of a 2020 loss for the president just as obama lost the house in 2010 and won reelection in 2012 midterms are poor indicators of future results said brian o walsh president of america first action a pro trump super pac whether it s a liberal senator from ohio or a progressive senator from california they re both part of the problem in washington d c brown cuts a different profile than many of his potential democratic rivals from the east and west coasts even in a political era where authenticity is highly valued and sen bernie sanders i vt set a low bar for polish brown is a standout his trademarks are unkempt hair disheveled suits and a gravelly voice he s the columbo of the democratic party said david axelrod a democratic strategist who advised president obama he d be doing beer commercials if he was a voice over guy his tour theme is the dignity of work a catchphrase for a populist economic agenda that includes an increased minimum wage expanded collective bargaining rights and fighting corporations on behalf of workers he is careful to aim his message to workers of all races and types not just the white working class as a way to bridge a festering division within the party whether you shower before work or after work whether you go to work early in the morning or whether you go to work late at night is a standard introduction to his litany too often people act like our party has to choose between advocating for strong progressive values that excite our base or talking to working class voters about their lives he said when he kicked off his tour thursday night in cleveland for us it s not either or it s both jeff horwitt a democratic pollster sees promise for the party in surveys showing that blacks and working class whites share a sense of dissatisfaction with an economic and political system they see as stacked against people like themselves whomever democrats nominate in 2020 it will be critical for the nominee to speak the language of the white working class horwitt said but he added there are an awful lot of ways where the white working class and people of color are looking for the same kinds of change in our country brown s tour included many of the kinds of communities democrats will have to win back in 2020 counties that voted for barack obama in 2008 and 2012 and flipped to trump in 2016 in clinton county where he met with union members saturday voters went for obama with 60 in both elections but favored trump by 5 points in 2016 like many potential democratic candidates brown is not well known nationally a december poll by the des moines register found 69 did not know enough about him to have an opinion 41 said that about california sen kamala harris 12 about massachusetts sen elizabeth warren he s a lifelong ohio politician beginning with his election to the state legislature in 1974 at age 22 he later served as ohio secretary of state in the u s house and was elected to the senate in 2006 brown digs deep into the past to establish his progressive bona fides including his house votes against the iraq war the north american free trade agreement and the anti gay defense of marriage act former vice president joe biden a potential rival to brown voted in favor of all three while in the senate brown s supporters like to point out his opposition to nafta aligned him with trump and may have helped him win reelection in 2018 while all other statewide democrats in ohio lost brown won by almost 7 points although that was a smaller margin than polls projected in a race where he outspent his gop opponent 7 to 1 if he runs for president brown may face pushback for one notable departure from liberal orthodoxy he does not support medicare for all an idea that has moved from the party s liberal fringes to increasing acceptance especially among potential 2020 candidates brown considers it impractical brown says he supports the idea of universal health coverage and proposes first to allow people in their 50s to voluntarily opt into medicare he also would make a public health insurance option available through the affordable care act at a meet and greet friday in waterloo iowa questioners confronted him on his incremental approach he responded by calling the broader proposal tilting at windmills everybody feels good saying i m for medicare for all i m for medicare for all but nothing changes he said i want to change people s lives and help people now with that he may have lost a vote ruth walker a cedar falls retiree said afterward that she was disappointed in his answer and would probably not consider backing him i m a real stickler she said i was not impressed but brown may also make converts dave donovan a sanders supporter who met brown in dubuque has backed medicare for all but was impressed with brown s argument he s made me think donovan said he s got passion
