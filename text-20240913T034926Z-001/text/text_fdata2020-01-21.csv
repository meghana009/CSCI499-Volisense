for the ninth consecutive year mti consulting via its corporate finance practice in partnership with daily ft daily mirror and sunday times has concluded the mti ceo business outlook study collectively outlining the sri lankan business community s perception for the state of business in 2020 supplemented by mti s experience as a thought leadership oriented organisation the annual survey collated and analysed the perceptions of over 100 sri lankan business leaders with regard to their business past and expected performance their predictions regarding the state of the local and global economy in 2020 and the main challenges that they believe sri lanka and sri lankan companies will face in 2020 the results of the survey including its supplementary analysis will assist organisations in streamlining their strategic decision making for 2020 effectively enabling them to gear their operations in accordance with the economic sentiments of their peers in 2019 businesses performed way below expectations nearly three fourth of the surveyed chief executives were of the opinion that their businesses performed below expectations in 2019 in contrast only 5 percent of the surveyed ceos felt that their businesses performed above expectations indicating a similar trend as in 2018 macroeconomic performance to supplement the ceo perceptions in 2019 mti analysed the key macroeconomic indicators of sri lanka for 2019 during january to september of 2019 the sri lankan economy recorded a subdued growth of 2 6 percent compared to the growth rate of 3 3 percent in the corresponding period of 2018 the international monetary fund imf expects the real gdp growth of sri lanka to rebound to 3 5 percent in 2020 driven by the recovery in the tourism sector according to the world bank the sri lankan economy grew at a rate of 2 7 percent in fy 18 19 ended june 2019 indicating sri lanka as one of the poorest performing countries in the south asian region bangladesh leads the south asian region in terms of economic growth by posting 8 1 percent gdp growth in fy18 19 agriculture forestry and fishing activities registered a moderate growth of 2 1 percent during 3q of 2019 compared to the 4 3 percent growth in the same period of the preceding year industrial activities and service activities also showed soft growth rates of 2 6 percent and 2 8 percent during 3q of 2019 respectively in comparison to the growth rates of 1 8 percent and 4 4 percent in the same period of 2018 growth in industrial activities was primarily driven by the recovery in construction and mining and quarrying activities during the period while the service sector was largely supported by the expansion in financial services wholesale and retail trade activities and other personal services activities during january to october 2019 a marginal growth of 0 8 percent was recorded in exports attributing to the growth of industrial exports accounting for 80 percent of total exports which expanded by 2 3 percent compared to the same period in 2018 agriculture 4 4 percent mineral 6 3 percent and all other export segments 3 6 percent recorded negative growth rates during the same period leading to an overall trade deficit in the same period the import expenditure during the first 10 months of 2019 declined by 12 4 percent largely driven by lower imports of gold 99 5 percent personal vehicles 53 2 percent rice 90 1 percent fuel 5 6 percent and transport equipment 17 8 percent tourism earnings recorded a drop of 20 7 percent owing to the easter sunday attacks which led to a decline in tourist arrivals workers remittances improved year on year yoy in october 2019 although a cumulative decline was recorded according to the central bank of sri lanka cbsl gross official reserves increased to us 7 5 billion by november 2019 mainly due to the receipt of the international sovereign bond isb proceeds purchase of foreign exchange by the cbsl from the domestic market and the receipt of the sixth tranche of the imf extended fund facility eff due to the challenges which arose from the slowdown in economic activities due to the easter sunday terror attacks and the delay in implementing certain revenue proposals announced in the 2019 budget the fiscal sector of sri lanka displayed a poor performance during the first seven months of 2019 the government revenue as a percentage of gdp declined to 6 7 percent in the first seven months of 2019 from 7 5 percent in the same period of the preceding year driven by the lower tax and non tax revenue collections the decline in tax revenue was mainly due to the underperformance of revenue collection from excise duties on motor vehicles and petroleum products and vat on domestic goods and services during the first seven months of 2019 the total government expenditure as a percentage of gdp rose up to 11 1 percent in comparison to 10 7 percent in the corresponding period of 2018 supported by the increase in recurring expenditures the government debt rose to rs 12 646 billion as at end july 2019 from rs 10 959 billion at end july 2018 warranted by the expansion in the budget deficit the cbsl adopted a relaxed monetary policy by reducing the standing deposit facility rate sdfr and standing lending facility rate slfr with a view of fuelling economic activity that was challenged by a high interest rate environment in 2018 as a result of subdued economic activity and high interest rates credit to the private sector decelerated to 4 4 percent by end november 2019 compared to a growth of 16 2 percent in the same period in 2018 with a view of stabilising inflation to mid single digit levels over the medium term the cbsl moved to a flexible inflation targeting fit regime in 2019 in order to sustain price stability and strengthen financial sector oversight how have major industries performed banking as a result of the moderation in loans and advances the total assets of the banking sector recorded a soft growth rate of 2 4 percent in the first eight months of 2019 compared to 7 3 percent in the same period in 2018 the growth rate of total assets was largely supported by the increase in investments consequently the yoy growth in assets declined to 9 3 percent in august 2019 from 14 6 percent registered at end 2018 driven by the lower credit growth due to the adverse business environment observed in the first eight months of 2019 yoy credit growth declined to 9 7 percent as at end august 2019 from 19 6 percent at end 2018 as at june 2019 the banking sector credit was mainly extended to the consumption 18 4 percent construction 15 4 percent wholesale and retail trade 15 2 percent manufacturing 11 0 percent and infrastructure 8 6 percent sectors tourism the tourism sector was adversely affected by the easter sunday attacks in april 2019 leading to a noticeable decline of 20 5 percent in tourist arrivals to 1 3 million in the first nine months of 2019 in terms of region tourists from western europe who accounted for 18 0 percent of total tourist arrivals declined by 17 5 percent yoy during the first nine months of 2019 while tourists from south asia recorded a yoy decline of 20 0 percent in may 2019 an economic relief package was introduced on both capital and interest payments of the loans taken by registered businesses in the tourism industry which is valid till march 31 2020 lonely planet and travel leisure magazine highlighted sri lanka as the number one destination in the world to visit in 2019 which likely contributed to the slow recovery in the tourism industry at the close of 2019 tea during the first half of 2019 tea production grew marginally by 0 2 percent as a result of the 1 2 percent decline in tea production witnessed in the first quarter of 2019 due to trade union action coupled with the 1 4 percent growth in tea production shown in the second quarter of the year supported by favourable weather conditions during the first half of 2019 the average tea prices at the colombo tea auction cta declined by 7 3 percent from the corresponding period of 2018 the highest yoy decline in average tea prices at the cta was recorded for medium grown tea 10 4 percent followed by high grown tea 8 1 percent and low grown tea 6 3 percent construction construction activities grew 4 7 percent in the first half of 2019 in comparison to the contraction of 0 8 percent recorded in the corresponding period of 2018 as reported by the central bank of sri lanka construction activities are expected to grow at a higher rate with the acceleration of government initiated development projects such as the continuation of the central expressway and the first phase of the proposed light rail transit system in addition to the buildings to be constructed in the colombo port city infrastructure developments within and outside the city of colombo including an elevated road from the new kelani bridge and an underground road connecting port city to the rest of the colombo commercial district are expected to be positive developments in the construction sector for 2020 apparel during the first eight months of 2019 export earnings from textile and garment recorded a growth of 8 3 percent supported by benefits arisen from the restoration of the european union s eu generalised system of preferences plus gsp facility despite trade diversion due to the us china trade tensions the increased production of printing of fabric mainly contributed to the positive developments in the textile industry the manufacture of wearing apparel subsector registered a growth of 2 8 percent during the first half of 2019 in comparison to the growth of 3 9 percent recorded in the corresponding period in 2018 supported by higher demand from germany the netherlands and the uk earnings from garment exports to the eu market increased by 5 9 percent in the first eight months of 2019 while garment exports to the usa increased by 7 7 percent in the same period the colombo stock exchange cse experienced a decline in its yearly turnover and market capitalisation in 2019 primarily affected by the easter sunday attacks followed by political volatility notably on account of the easter sunday attack the all share price index aspi and s p sri lanka 20 index recorded a single day drop of 3 6 percent and 4 4 percent respectively on april 23 2019 in addition the policy uncertainty together with the subdued performance of the corporate sector further fuelled the negative performance of the market which was amplified by foreign outflows further the cse raised rs 0 4 billion through one initial public offering ipo in 2019 a decline from the rs 2 billion raised through two ipos in 2018 world in 2019 global economy and trade 2019 global gdp grew at a subdued rate of 2 5 percent from january to september 2019 affected by us china trade tensions and slow growth in japan and europe trade tensions eased in december as the united states and china agreed on a phase one agreement on december 13 2019 china agreed to sharply increase its purchases of the us agricultural products in exchange of cancelling planned tariff increases and reducing the tariff rate on approximately us 120 billion worth of chinese imports to the united states in addition to tariff reductions china agreed to reportedly make concessions in areas of intellectual property technology transfer agriculture financial services and foreign exchange global financial conditions and commodity market 2019 following the announced phase one agreement equity markets recorded a positive performance with the s p 500 rising 2 6 percent since the start of december in 2019 an upward momentum in oil prices was witnessed on account of the opec further limiting oil supply from the previous limit of 1 2 million barrels to 0 5 million barrels a day in late 2019 driven by the output shortfalls in some edible oils especially palm oil agriculture prices increased by 3 7 percent in november 2019 in addition as gains in aluminum prices were balanced by declines in nickel lead and iron ore prices the metal price index changed up to a certain degree global economy expected to recover in 2020 the world bank forecasts economic growth in emerging markets and developing economies emdes to reach 4 6 percent in 2020 up from 4 0 percent in 2019 the uptick in the forecast is primarily on account of the waning impact of the financial pressure faced by the emdes on the back of the benign global financial conditions of 2019 the world bank also expects oil prices to average at us 65 per barrel in 2020 down from the price point of us 64 04 per barrel in 2019 and us 69 78 per barrel in 2018 global trade is expected to stabilise to an average of 3 2 percent in 2020 and 2021 due to subsiding of manufacturing weaknesses the imf expects the growth of advance economies to soften to 1 7 percent in 2020 while the us economy is expected to expand by 2 1 percent in 2020 further the uk and eu economies are expected to grow at a rate of 1 4 percent in 2020 on average business leaders in sri lanka expect that the global economy will remain subdued in 2020 while nearly half of the surveyed ceos have noted a negative sentiment towards global economic growth in 2020 46 percent of the surveyed ceos have taken an optimistic view that the global economy is expected to recover or take off in 2020 2020 expected to be a recovering year for sri lankan economy the survey results reveal a growing confidence among business leaders for the sri lankan economy in 2020 as the statistics supporting the acceleration of the sri lankan economy is at its highest when analysing the survey results with the past years this is further confirmed with the dramatic drop from 45 percent to 7 percent in the number of surveyed ceos who have cited that they expect a decline in the local economy more than half of the surveyed ceos expect the local economy to stabilise in 2020 indicating an overall optimistic view in terms of the sri lankan economy in 2020 sri lanka in 2020 the imf expects the real gdp growth of sri lanka to strengthen to 3 5 percent in 2020 as the country is on the path to recovery from the negative impact of the easter sunday terrorist attacks in april 2019 according to the world bank local economic growth is expected to reach 3 3 percent in 2020 and 3 7 percent in 2021 supported by recovering investment and exports according to the asian development bank s adb country operations business plan cobp 2020 22 the proposed lending programme for sri lanka for the three year period is estimated at us 2 46 billion the lending programme is expected to focus on transport focus on transport 39 percent of the total lending followed by water and other urban infrastructure and services 16 percent agriculture natural resources and rural development 14 percent energy 12 percent education 8 percent multisector 6 percent and finance 5 percent the projects implemented under the programme will include railways roads secondary education power system reliability irrigation water supply urban development and rural livelihoods economic policies main challenges for sri lanka in 2020 seventy two percent of the surveyed ceos have identified that economic policies will be the biggest challenge to their businesses in 2020 followed by political legal and governance issues which were a concern for 21 percent of the respondents the concern for political legal and governance issues as well as economic policies in 2020 remain unchanged when compared to the previous year s survey as political and economic tensions witnessed in 2019 continued to hinder business and investor sentiment in 2020 other issues cited as business challenges in 2020 were human capital cost of living and international factors which amounted to 7 percent of the overall challenges debt repayment and budget deficit concerns expected to continue in 2020 debt repayment and budget deficit were cited as key economic challenges in 2020 as the overall budget deficit was financed largely through domestic sources leading to a significant increase in government debt stock in 2019 the exchange rate stability 15 percent and attracting fdi 12 percent are seen as the third and fourth most challenging economic factors for 2020 respectively this is mainly attributable to the depreciation of the rupee and the adverse impact from the easter sunday attacks in april 2019 the economic stability and growth 11 percent is the next most concerning economic factor with the effect of recovery in the tourism sector the monetary policy and business confidence were less cited economic challenges for businesses in 2020 political stability concerns expected to continue in 2020 concern for the lack of political stability and corruption and good governance are the key political challenges that were cited by the ceos for 2020 on the back of key political events such as the presidential election which took place in the latter part of 2019 and the upcoming parliamentary election in 2020 corruption and good governance accounted for one fourth of the overall challenges highlighted by ceos signifying the importance of regenerating business confidence positive business outlook for 2020 since the inception of ceo survey in 2012 a record high of 61 percent of the surveyed ceos believe that their businesses will perform better in 2020 compared to 2019 meanwhile 36 percent of the ceos believed that their business will achieve the same level of growth in 2020 as in 2019 only 3 percent of the business leaders are expecting a lower growth in their business for 2020 indicating the lowest negative outlook since the initial survey in 2012 as a whole there appears to be a positive outlook for business performance with the expectancy for the recovery in global economy as well as in the local economy in 2020 external challenges dominate fifty four percent of the ceos believe that the success of their businesses in 2020 will mainly be affected by factors external to their business which was recorded as 70 percent in the previous year however 46 percent of the ceos identified internal factors to be the key determinant of their business performance in 2020 compared to the 31 percent of ceos who attributed controllable factors as determinants of business performance in 2019 the main external challenge cited by the ceos was economic challenges 33 percent where many ceos expressed concern over the currency depreciation and inconsistencies in taxation that would lead to a rise in import costs and thus increased costs of living political and regulatory concerns 27 percent was another key external challenge that was identified due to inconsistent government policies that have been implemented in 2019 the effects of which is expected to continue on to 2020 global challenges 8 percent were seen as an external challenge to businesses on account of issues such as slowing consumer demand and political and economic uncertainty brought about by countries such as the us ceos also pointed out that growth expansion and investment 8 percent as well as the demand generation 8 percent would pose challenges to their businesses due to the lower consumer spending and negative investor confidence in addition the surveyed ceos found environmental and human resources to be external challenges to their businesses in 2020 although at a much lower frequency than economic and political issues that are expected to arise in the same period the main internal challenge that the ceos expect to face in 2020 is productivity and cost optimisation 38 percent especially considering the challenge of keeping costs of operations at a feasible level with the rising cost of imports another key challenge that was discussed is growth expansion and investment 24 percent where safeguarding market share and keeping minimum pressure on company bottom lines were considered as risks financial health 18 percent was cited as the next most concerning internal challenge followed by human resources which accounted for 9 percent of the overall responses ceos also cited demand generation 7 percent as a key issue they are likely to face in 2020 conclusion since the launch of the mti ceo business outlook survey in 2012 2020 marks the year in which the most number of surveyed ceos expressed a more positive outlook in terms of the sri lankan economy for 2020 however growth forecasts for sri lanka and the global economy per the imf and world bank remain at a subdued level citing rising debt levels and slowdown in productivity the policymakers will need to address these challenges to ensure recovery and surpass predicted forecasts to ensure moderate growth in 2020 the long term trend since 2012 of the business environment performing below expectations continued in 2019 where 73 percent of the ceos expressed dissatisfaction in the performance of their industry in 2019 with a slight drop from the previous peak of 75 percent recorded in 2018 the lacklustre performance was no doubt on the back of a weak economy and a turbulent political environment prevalent during the previous year hence it was no surprise that external factors continued to challenge the ceos in their daily operations during 2019 as evidenced by the survey results however considering the continuing trend of businesses citing external factors as their number one challenge this will be the opportune time for the ceos to ensure that reasonable firewalls are in place to mitigate the impact that unexpected challenges can create in the long term in addition robust and effective action by industry stakeholders including the government are likely to result in opportunities for the business sector to capitalise on in the coming year despite the political and economic headwinds that are expected to arise in 2020 ti

loading loading press release stockholm january 21 2020 nordic outlook short term relief but long term risks sweden below trend growth rising unemployment and key rate pause the world economy seems to have emerged from last year s manufacturing slump growth is accelerating cautiously but lingering political uncertainty and supply side constraints are diminishing the power of the upturn central bank signals of low key interest rates for a lengthy period will provide support but they also raise questions about long term risks of debt build up and spiralling asset prices fiscal policymakers can play an increased role but because of rigid fiscal frameworks and weak government finances the dose of stimulus will still be cautious in sweden sentiment indicators point to weak or even falling gdp in late 2019 and early 2020 but a recovery in household consumption and a turnaround in residential construction suggest that the economy will keep expanding in 2020 growth will speed up in 2021 as sweden joins in the international upswing continued strong population growth is one reason why unemployment will keep rising during the coming year the riksbank will keep the swedish key interest rate unchanged even though inflation will fall further below the central bank s 2 per cent target global growth is accelerating cautiously after bottoming out in 2019 the us federal reserve s key interest rate cuts and decreased trade risks due to progress in us chinese negotiations have led to a resurgence of optimism in financial markets manufacturing activity is showing signs of having bottomed out with small hints of recovery in sentiment indicators domestic demand has remained resilient in most countries sustained by strong labour markets this has laid a more stable foundation for future growth seb economists predict that global gdp growth will increase from 3 0 per cent in 2019 to 3 1 per cent this year and 3 3 per cent in 2021 marginally better than our forecast in november s nordic outlook a recovery in emerging market em economies is the main reason for the acceleration as large countries like india russia brazil and turkey gain momentum while china s economy continues to decelerate improved world trade will also help to sustain exports in europe and elsewhere during 2021 but for various reasons global growth looks set to be lower than the average during recent decades many em economies have reached a degree of maturity that makes it difficult for them to maintain their earlier rapid trend growth in advanced economies the lowest unemployment levels in 40 50 years are shifting the focus of attention to supply side constraints as downside risks to demand fade yet the potential for a further upturn in us labour force participation and a lower equilibrium unemployment rate in the euro area including reforms in france spain and elsewhere will make it possible to prolong the economic expansion further political uncertainty factors also remain with question marks about us chinese trade after their success in reaching a phase 1 agreement as well as about trade between the european union and both the united states and the united kingdom another source of uncertainty is increased tensions between the us and iran in all these cases however the parties involved have powerful reasons to avoid an escalation extended period of low interest rates and yields raises new questions central banks will continue to support their economies in the prevailing low inflation environment but there is not much room for new initiatives an increased awareness of the drawbacks of negative rates and yields has raised the bar for further stimulus measures in the euro area for example signals from leading central banks that they will accept a degree of inflation overshooting after a long period of below target inflation rates meanwhile imply that the threshold to rate hikes will be high in this environment fiscal policymakers are expected to play an increased role for example through public sector investments in infrastructure climate related projects and education yet in practice the dose of fiscal stimulus is expected to be limited given already high us federal budget deficits and rigid fiscal frameworks in europe an extended period of low interest rates and bond yields meanwhile raises questions about the long term risks of debt build up and spiralling asset prices starting on the day that there may be changes in underlying conditions affecting inflation interest rates bond yields and other variables special theme articles in this february nordic outlook explore the scope of fiscal policy the high debt levels in china and the us share valuations and the need for sustainable energy innovations steeper yield curves weaker usd better risk climate and share prices bond yields have stabilised a bit above their previous lows in the prevailing low inflation environment central banks have an asymmetric reaction function key interest rate cuts are closer at hand than rate hikes this pushes down short term yields and leads to a steepening of yield curves our forecast of one more federal reserve rate cut this coming autumn will nevertheless contribute to a temporary downturn in long term treasury yields by the end of 2021 10 year us treasury securities will yield just over 2 00 per cent while long term german government bond yields will be slightly above zero an improved risk climate including positive economic growth signals and successful trade negotiations will cause usd positive drivers to fade because the us dollar is overvalued in the long term it will gradually depreciate with the eur usd exchange rate climbing to 1 20 by the end of 2021 slightly better growth and ultra low bond yields will help to sustain high share price valuations our main scenario is slightly positive stock market returns and good performance for both cyclical industrials and structurally favoured growth companies in digitisation and sustainability decelerating nordic growth delayed baltic impact of global slowdown the norwegian economy appears to have peaked in autumn 2019 the mainland economy excluding oil gas and shipping will slow towards its trend growth rate as oil investments fall and demand from this sector shrinks mainland gdp growth will decelerate from 2 5 per cent last year to 2 0 per cent in 2020 and 1 8 per cent in 2021 the weak krone will push inflation above target this year but because of increased international risks slower domestic economic growth and less risk to financial stability norges bank will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1 50 per cent denmark will show faster economic expansion than the euro area sustained by strong job growth and decent private consumption yet it will decelerate gradually from more than 2 per cent last year to 1 5 per cent in 2021 improved consumption and service exports sustained finnish economic growth last year it will level off at around 1 5 per cent supported by somewhat better global economic conditions after a lag the three baltic economies are now beginning to be affected by last year s global slowdown this includes lower industrial production and weaker demand for transport services despite slower growth labour markets remain tight and pay increases are high lithuania s gdp growth will slow from more than 3 5 per cent last year to around 2 5 per cent in both 2020 and 2021 in latvia a temporary slump to 2 0 per cent growth this year will be followed by a new acceleration to 2 5 per cent in 2021 estonia will see a slowdown from last year s 3 8 per cent growth to 2 0 per cent in 2020 then a rebound to 2 6 per cent in 2021 sweden below trend growth rising unemployment and key rate pause despite certain signs of stabilisation sentiment indicators point to weak or even falling swedish gdp in late 2019 and early 2020 this weakness is clearest in manufacturing while domestically oriented sectors are showing signs of some recovery most apparent in the retail and construction sectors progress in us chinese trade negotiations suggests that manufacturing sentiment will rebound during the next few months this is one reason why we have only adjusted our 2020 gdp forecast marginally lower to 1 1 per cent november 1 2 per cent our 2021 forecast of 1 7 per cent gdp growth is unchanged a bit further ahead there is upside potential supply side restrictions in the labour market are further away than in comparable countries the krona is weak and strong government finances will allow room for increased fiscal stimulus measures there are many indications that higher central government grants to local governments will be part of the upcoming spring budget but a strict interpretation of sweden s official fiscal framework and the gridlock created by the government s january agreement on budget cooperation with two opposition parties will have a restraining effect for a long time the swedish manufacturing sector was resilient to weaker conditions elsewhere especially in germany after plunging last september the purchasing managers index pmi is now well below the expansion threshold of 50 this was reflected in clear downturns for industrial production and merchandise exports during the autumn but recovery tendencies in international manufacturing activity suggest that the swedish downturn in the sector will be brief as early as the second quarter of 2020 we believe exports will start growing again loading loading machinery investments have declined while residential investments are close to bottoming out during 2020 we expect a cautious upturn in housing starts resulting in slightly rising residential investments during 2021 due to high demand for health care social services and schooling the upturn in public sector investments will continue though at a somewhat slower pace this is one reason why the downturn in overall capital spending will be only 2 0 per cent in 2019 and 1 0 per cent this year followed by a 2 per cent increase in 2021 household consumption began a slight falling trend in mid 2018 but rebounded starting in q2 2019 the future outlook is mixed job growth and higher real wages and to some extent tax cuts have provided support the same is true of the record high savings ratio and increasing asset prices including home prices a clearly weaker labour market has shaken household confidence but what worries consumers is mainly the general economic situation whereas confidence in their own finances has recovered we expect a gradual upturn in consumption by 1 3 per cent during 2020 and 1 7 per cent next year public sector consumption is decelerating but will be sustained by strong demand for public services and the forecasted higher central government grants the swedish labour market has cooled noticeably job growth is continuing but not fast enough to match an increasing labour supply due to both rising labour force participation and rapid population growth our forecast is that job growth will be less than half a percentage point this year and that unemployment will climb to 7 4 per cent by late 2020 and then stabilise at that level swedish wage and salary growth has diverged from the international pattern remaining at a very even rate of about 2 5 per cent yearly we expect total pay increases to accelerate only moderately to 2 6 per cent in 2020 and 3 per cent in 2021 the ongoing national wage round is expected to result in a slight higher pay hikes than the previous wage round in 2017 inflation is below the riksbank s 2 per cent target despite a weak krona falling electricity prices as well as lower electrical network charges are expected to push cpif inflation the consumer price index minus interest rate changes down towards 1 per cent during the coming six months before it rebounds to a bit above 1 5 per cent during 2021 cpif excluding energy will remain just below 2 per cent during the next few months and then fall towards 1 5 per cent as exchange rate effects fade after hiking the repo rate to zero per cent in december 2019 a majority of the riksbank s executive board members are signalling an unchanged key rate until mid 2022 the central bank s increased acceptance of overshooting above its inflation target suggests that very large upside inflation surprises will be required for a rate hike to occur the december rate hike which occurred in spite of rising unemployment and below target inflation meanwhile suggests that the threshold for a return to negative key rates is high we see a higher probability of more stimulus measures than normalisation but our main scenario is a lengthy pause for the repo rate at zero the riskbank s december rate hike removed another negative factor for the krona a somewhat more positive international environment suggests that the krona can continue to appreciate with the eur sek exchange rate falling to 10 00 by

if the u s federal reserve fumbles its long planned move toward higher interest rates the sharpest words about fed chair janet yellen are likely to come from the turks brazilians indians and chinese who borrowed in the currency that the american central bank issues in these once soaring emerging markets the u s dollar may be their problem even modest increases in u s interest rates can redirect the flow of capital across national boundaries as investors seek higher returns in the largest economy in the world and boost the value of the dollar vis a vis other currencies but that hasn t happened for nearly 10 years as the fed has kept interest rates low to fight the lingering effects of the great recession that long stretch of easy money allowed companies all over the world from istanbul to sao paulo to johannesburg to fill up on cheap dollar denominated credit and since many of them still earn their profits in lira reals or rand they are perilously exposed to any rise in the value of the dollar which would make paying their debts more and more expensive so companies around the world are watching the fed wary of how its turn in policy could ripple across the globe if it ends up coming more quickly than anticipated or if investors give in to panic there will be shift there s no doubt about that and if the fed does its work gradually and slowly people will adjust said lubomir mitov the chief economist for central and eastern europe at unicredit a large european bank but that s just not a given since markets are so unpredictable if you are on pins and needles awaiting the fed it s likely you re in one of the large emerging markets that have done so well over the last decade but where economic growth is now slowing stretched budgets mean governments don t have much room to stimulate their economies with new spending and political turmoil has unnerved investors major companies have borrowed dollars without any clear plan for paying them back since the 2008 financial crisis dollar credit to non bank companies real estate construction utilities and many others has exploded from 6 trillion to 9 trillion according to the bank of international settlements the reason was simple fed monetary policy had driven down interest rates on u s government bonds so investors with dollars to sock away put them into dollar denominated securities issued by companies in fast growing emerging markets that promised a better return brazil s external debt current usd findthedata the fed is now making policy in a new era for emerging markets this month goldman sachs brought down the curtain on the era that made emerging markets synonymous with explosive growth goldman invented the label brics brazil india russia and china in 2001 but this month dismantled a money losing investment fund aimed at those previously red hot markets reflecting the new reality the international monetary fund in its latest economic outlook downgraded growth prospects for emerging markets to 4 2 percent down from nearly 5 percent in 2014 it s a far cry from the situation the fed faced during previous episodes in which it raised interest rates from 2004 to 2006 the fed notched up interest rates in the united states but money rushed into the major emerging markets whose economic growth created appealing enough returns to counteract trends elsewhere stocks prices in emerging markets shot up 65 percent according to a recent study by the organization for economic cooperation and development big emerging markets have home grown problems these days in brazil for example the slide in energy prices has dented earnings from oil exports at the same time its state owned oil company petrobras is facing a lengthy corruption investigation that has tarnished the administration of president dilma rousseff meanwhile the brazilian government isn t in the position to stimulate the economy through new spending in china authorities are trying to cool off a real estate boom without damaging the broader economy and ease the country s heavy dependence on exports to fire growth president xi jinping has said the country s growth could sink to 6 5 percent far off the rates it managed for much of the past 20 years emerging markets have their own problems these days that are entirely independent of u s monetary policy said angel ubide a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics turkey s external debt current usd findthedata still with the world connected by phone email and financial markets what the fed does and says over the next few months will be important turkey said the economist mitov is in a very precarious situation because it relies so heavily on money coming into the country turks love their credit cards notable because emerging market citizens tend to be savers so the country needs 4 billion 5 billion per month flowing in to keep running and turkish companies need to be able to swap those dollars for lira at reasonable rates so they can service debts turkey s current account deficit essentially the money it needs to borrow to hold the economy together summarizes the country s predicament and its reliance on fickle flows of capital that deficit runs at about 5 percent of gross domestic product a high number for any developing country where economic opportunities abound foreigners are often willing to finance a deficit like that through foreign direct investment in hard to move things like factories and industrial machinery only a fifth of turkey s deficit is financed that way the rest relies on money that moves at the touch of a button you can only have a deficit like that if somebody is willing to finance it mitov said and then there are the politics of turkey president recep tayyip erdogan recently won re election on the strength of vows to crush kurdish militants who renewed a long simmering guerrilla conflict three years ago next door turkey has to contend with the complicated grisly war in syria and erdogan s government has also squeezed press freedom over the past year financial markets have already started voting on turkey s prospects and the results are not good the turkish lira has plummeted by nearly a quarter this year alone power generation conglomerates in turkey answered the siren call of cheap dollar denominated debt for the simple reason that turk s don t save much domestically so they needed to borrow abroad since turkey generates much electricity with imported natural gas investments in hydropower and solar energy promised a welcome relief from energy import bills and a shot at fulfilling demand that rose 5 6 percent per year according a study by the caspian strategy institute an istanbul based research institute so six of the largest publicly listed power companies in turkey now have about 850 million in exposure to dollar based debt according the paper s author fatih macit this debt is more than a financial burden he points out it reduces the level of investments the companies are willing to make slowing the transition from imported energy it can only get worse if the fed decides it needs to hike rates at an unexpectedly fast clip said enestor dos santos is principal economist for brazil and latin america at bbva research the baseline scenario is not for the fed to tighten quickly dos santos said if it comes more speedily than expected we will see some more serious turbulence
houston tx accesswire january 20 2020 both forex trading and stock trading provides investors with a diversity of investment opportunities each with its own features perks and risk levels though they both deal with buying and selling their major difference can be drawn from the kind of commodities they trade forex trades foreign currencies over the counter otc while stock trading is focused on trading company shares on a central exchange what is the forex market the forex market is the market in which participants can buy sell exchange and speculate on currencies the currency market is considered to be the largest financial market with over 5 trillion in daily transactions which is more than the futures and equity markets combined investopedia advertisement advertisement what is the stock market the stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying selling and issuance of shares of publicly held companies take place investopedia trading forex vs trading stocks there are investors traders who trade both stocks and forex but one of the major reasons why some traders would pick forex over stock trading is forex leverage for a new investor or trader it may be quite tricky knowing which one to trade in no one is better than the other they are both financial instruments that have the potential to fetch the investor or trader more profit if played well though the underlying goals and risk levels of forex and stock may be quite similar they have certain dissimilarities that set them apart outlined below are some of the dissimilarities trading platform in stock trading investors or traders require a central exchange like the new york stock exchange nyse to trade these central exchanges provide stock traders and investors access to order books that have records of all stock purchases and sales with a record of all the buying and selling traders investors are able to analyze similar patterns that occurred on the exchange in the past and recent times stock traders and investors study past buying and selling patterns for different reasons one of which is tracking the exchange activity to know the best time to buy or sell a stock while for forex trading currencies are traded over the counter otc meaning that there is no central exchange that regulates forex as all transactions are privately done between buyer and seller advertisement advertisement trading time another major difference between forex and stock trading can be seen in market trading hours since forex has no central exchange and it spans across different time frames it is open 24 hours meaning that traders can trade currencies around the clock at all forex trading sessions the major trading sessions are new york london sydney and tokyo sessions note that the forex market is only open for trading during working days and closed for trading on weekends on the flip side the stock market is only open for trading on central exchanges from 8 am to 5 pm daily the time is subject to the exchange geographical location once the market closes by 5 pm all pending trades can only be made when the market opens the next day by 8 am for some traders the stock market timing stands as a major limitation story continues trading pattern in forex trading currencies always quoted in pairs e g usd gbp or eur usd each currency quoted in a pair is dependent on the other so a forex trader is not only concerned about the financial status in the country of the currency that is being traded but also the financial situation of the country that is being traded against whereas in stock trading the trader is only concerned with the happenings surrounding the company he owns shares in that is if a trader owns apple shares he is only concerned with financial occurrences and other occurrences that happen around apple whatever happens in other companies is absolutely none of his business unless for other interests forex trading pairing nature requires that the trader be consciously aware of the economic standing of both countries before trading their currencies a downside for the forex market is that it is prone to political and economic influence unlike the stock market which is hardly affected by any socio political and economic issues that may arise in a country minimum capital required for most investors forex is a more preferable way to enter into the financial market due to the lower capital required to enter the market unlike trading stocks which require more capital to get started through leverage forex allows small speculators or traders to enlarge their controlling units when trading this can be both beneficial and unprofitable for these speculators forex trading amounts can go as low as 500 but such an amount wouldn t yield much profit compared to a forex trader who trades 5 000 daily compared to stocks the minimum trading amount would be on the high side especially if the investor desires high returns leverage the leverage in stock trading and forex trading greatly differ and most traders prefer forex overstock for this reason leverage allows the trader to buy more currencies with less cash and when the currency s value increases the trader gains more return in stock trading traders are allowed a maximum of 2 1 leverage that is being able to make trades only twice above their current account balance while in forex some brokerage firms allow traders leverage of up to 50 1 allowing them to make trades up to fifty times above their account balance 50 1 is the highest leverage in america other countries can go as high as 400 1 leverage high leverages may seem like a great opportunity provided to the trader however it also holds high tendencies of incurring losses leverage has the ability to increase your profits and losses it all depends on how you place your bet insider trading insider trading is an act that is greatly prohibited because it gives certain investors and traders an advantage over the rest of what s supposed to be a fair market however the issue of insider trading is one that is still ongoing as a large number of public listed companies give room for insider trading the category of stock traders who take advantage of insider trading work hand in hand with stock market insiders who have firsthand information about a company s financial position ongoing plans for a new product line or any other important information required to make a successful stock trade or investment the case is not so in forex trading though the forex market is the largest financial market it cannot be manipulated to support insider trading because there is no central exchange and the currencies are particular to each country if peradventure a case of insider trading almost arises in forex trading the liquidity and size of the forex market are able to cover any trading pressure that may come from insider trading advertisement advertisement commissions and transaction costs forex is considered as one of the easily accessible financial markets because of its low commissions and transaction costs some forex brokers run commission free services but get their fees off the bid ask spread while other brokers charge upfront commissions in the stock market some brokers may decide to generally charge low commissions and transaction fees while others may charge according to the type of investment made and the risk level tradable instruments when it comes to the number of available tradable instruments the stock market beats the forex market the stock market gives traders and investors a wide variety of investment options the new york stock exchange alone has about 2 000 listed stocks whereas the foreign market provides its traders with a variety of only eight major currencies the major currencies include the us dollar usd euro eur british pound gbp canadian dollar cad swiss franc chf new zealand dollar nzd and the japanese yen jpy the major currencies form the major pairs which make up about 72 of the forex volume the overall number of forex pairs are nothing compared to a number of accessible investments that can be made in the stock market on the contrary the stock market may have the advantage of providing investors with multiple investment options however it is quite easier to control fewer currencies or shares compared to controlling a large base it would then be preferable for stock traders to channel their focus on the shares of a particular industry for better monitoring and control rather than having multiple shares from various industries presence of middlemen since forex trades are done over the counter and transactions made directly between the buyer and the seller there d be no room for a middleman unlike stock trading which requires the services of a middleman which is a stockbroker stock traders or investors can only access the stock market through their brokers which serve as an intermediary in processing all transactions by routing or buying and selling orders to match the best possible prices on the market pros cons of forex trading like most financial vehicles forex trading also has its perks and threats it is advisable for individual investors to first weigh the benefits and possible disadvantages of forex before engaging it it is also important to know that forex is not necessarily an investment vehicle but merely a currency trade that holds the potential of bringing in a profit the forex market is the largest and most accessible financial market there is it only takes traders about 1 3 days to set up and account and fund it with at least 500 forex trading is done otc directly between the buyer and the seller but you can also choose to trade through a brokerage which can be done online online forex trading provides traders with real time market pricing price charts news and tools the forex market is always open 24 hours 5 days per week therefore traders have the liberty of trading at any time of choice forex leverage is another important feature that attracts many investors its availability is greater than most markets and traders in the us can access up to 50 1 leverage if played well forex has a potential for yielding high returns as the returns are received daily however due to having no central regulatory body the forex market lacks full transparency unlike the stock market since trades are direct a trader may not get the best prices or have control over how his trade order is executed he also may have limited views on the trading quotes presented to him by his broker to avoid this traders should opt for regulated brokers found within the group of broker regulators there are also no fixed prices as the price of a currency can be determined by how much the traders are willing to negotiate unlike the stock market which is rarely affected by external forces the forex market can greatly be affected by governmental or economic issues in the currency holding countries traders ought to be concerned about the economic downturn of the countries of their paired currencies advertisement advertisement pros easily accessible all day trading high leverage no middleman or central regulator fast returns potential supports easy short selling high liquidity technical analysis lower chances of insider trading lesser commissions and fees simplified tax rules cons small traders may suffer some losses lower residual returns high volatility no official regulatory protection no transparency high risk pros cons of stock market investing in the stock market is a great way to make money in a short time if you play your cards right it is also important to note that any investment with high potentials of bringing in quick returns would also come with a significant level of risk compared to other investments like bonds cds and real estate investors can easily buy or sell stock as they deem fit and as well have easy access to their money without having to wait for a very long time in as much as the stock market offers quite some advantages to its investors its major threat is crashing in 2008 the stock market crashed in only a few hours and a whole lot of investors were badly affected it didn t take until years before most of these investors were able to recover from the shock and rebuild their portfolios also its high volatility makes it that those who bet well win so much money and those who do not bet well lose all their money and watch their investment go down the drain in just a matter of time investing in risk is for those with high risk tolerance and solid financial stability advertisement advertisement pros capital growth high returns part ownership of a company volatile market high liquidity portfolio diversification cons risk of a company going bankrupt stock market crash fall in shares price high commissions and charges conclusion as earlier stated no financial market is better than the other as both the forex market and the stock market have their benefits and risk levels the result of trading stocks or forex is dependent on how well the trader understands the market and uses it to his advantage the choice is completely up to you as an investor or trader what we have been able to do is highlight major differences in both trades that can help you figure out which one works better for you there are many traders who trade both forex and stocks successfully for beginners forex trading may be a good starting point to get into the financial market as forex trading holds substantial advantages such as leverage lower commissions and transaction costs favorable trading times no middleman interference absence of insider trading and lower starting capital once a certain level of mastery has been gained about how the forex market works the novice trader can move into stock trading and at the end of the day compare which one works better for them advertisement

on top of a downgrade of global growth forecasts from the international monetary fund and moody s cut the credit rating of hong kong axitrader strategist stephen innes said the coronavirus outbreak

provide shareholders and potential investors with a more complete perspective on baytex s current and future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes there is no representation by baytex that actual results achieved will be the same in whole or in part as those referenced in the forward looking statements the forward looking statements contained in this document are made as of the date hereof and baytex does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as may be required by applicable securities law all amounts in this press release are stated in canadian dollars unless otherwise specified non gaap financial and capital management measures certain financial and operating results included in this news release including but not limited to production capital expenditures adjusted funds flow free cash flow ebitda net debt and operating netbacks for the year ended december 31 2019 are based on preliminary unaudited results these results are preliminary and unaudited and are inherently uncertain and subject to change as we complete our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2019 given the timing of these estimates we have not completed our customary financial closing and review procedures as at and for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 and there can be no assurance that our final results will not differ from these estimates in this news release we refer to certain financial measures such as adjusted funds flow ebitda exploration and development expenditures free cash flow net debt and operating netback which do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by canadian gaap non gaap measures and are considered non gaap measures while adjusted funds flow ebitda exploration and development expenditures free cash flow net debt and operating netback are commonly used in the oil and gas industry our determination of these measures may not be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other issuers adjusted funds flow is not a measurement based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry we define adjusted funds flow as cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in non cash operating working capital and asset retirement obligations settled our determination of adjusted funds flow may not be comparable to other issuers we consider adjusted funds flow a key measure that provides a more complete understanding of operating performance and our ability to generate funds for exploration and development expenditures debt repayment settlement of our abandonment obligations and potential future dividends in addition we use a ratio of net debt to adjusted funds flow to manage our capital structure we eliminate settlements of abandonment obligations from cash flow from operations as the amounts can be discretionary and may vary from period to period depending on our capital programs and the maturity of our operating areas the settlement of abandonment obligations are managed with our capital budgeting process which considers available adjusted funds flow changes in non cash working capital are eliminated in the determination of adjusted funds flow as the timing of collection payment and incurrence is variable and by excluding them from the calculation we are able to provide a more meaningful measure of our cash flow on a continuing basis ebitda is not a measurement based on gaap in canada ebitda is defined as net income or loss adjusted for financing and interest expenses unrealized gains and losses on financial derivatives income tax non recurring losses payments on lease obligations certain specific unrealized and non cash transactions including depletion exploration and evaluation expenses unrealized gains and losses on financial derivatives and foreign exchange and share based compensation exploration and development capital expenditures is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define exploration and development expenditures as additions to exploration and evaluation assets combined with additions to oil and gas properties we use exploration and development expenditures to measure and evaluate the performance of our capital programs the total amount of exploration and development expenditures is managed as part of our budgeting process and can vary from period to period depending on the availability of adjusted funds flow and other sources of liquidity free cash flow is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define free cash flow as adjusted funds flow less exploration and development expenditures both non gaap measures discussed above payments on lease obligations and asset retirement obligations settled we use free cash flow to evaluate funds available for debt repayment common share repurchases potential future dividends and acquisition and disposition opportunities our previous definition of free cash flow referred to sustaining capital as opposed to exploration and development expenditures given the current commodity price environment our exploration and development expenditures are primarily comprised of sustaining capital which we consider the amount of exploration and development capital required to maintain production accordingly we have revised our definition of free cash flow to provide clarity on the reconciliation to measures determined in accordance with gaap net debt is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define net debt to be the sum of cash trade and other accounts receivable trade and other accounts payable and the principal amount of both the long term notes and the bank loan we believe that this measure assists in providing a more complete understanding of our cash liabilities and provides a key measure to assess our liquidity we use the principal amounts of the bank loan and long term notes outstanding in the calculation of net debt as these amounts represent our ultimate repayment obligation at maturity the carrying amount of debt issue costs associated with the bank loan and long term notes is excluded on the basis that these amounts have already been paid by baytex at inception of the contract and do not represent an additional source of capital or repayment obligation operating netback is not a measurement based on gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry operating netback is equal to petroleum and natural gas sales less blending expense royalties production and operating expense and transportation expense divided by barrels of oil equivalent sales volume for the applicable period our determination of operating netback may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities we believe that this measure assists in characterizing our ability to generate cash margin on a unit of production basis and is a key measure used to evaluate our operating performance advisory regarding oil and gas information the reserves information contained in this press release has been prepared in accordance with ni 51 101 complete ni 51 101 reserves disclosure will be included in our annual information form for the year ended december 31 2019 which will be filed on or before march 30 2020 listed below are cautionary statements that are specifically required by ni 51 101 the term barrels of oil equivalent boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one boe 6 mcf bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year this press release contains estimates of the net present value of our future net revenue from our reserves such amounts do not represent the fair market value of our reserves this press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry such as capital efficiencies finding and development costs finding development and acquisition costs net asset value recycle ratio operating netback and reserves life index these terms do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons such metrics have been included in this press release to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate baytex s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of baytex s future performance and future performance may not compare to baytex s performance in previous periods and therefore such metrics should not be unduly relied upon capital efficiency means the cost to drill complete equip and tie in a well divided by the initial production rate of the well on a boe basis over its initial 365 days of production finding and development costs are calculated on a per boe basis by dividing the aggregate of the change in future development costs from the prior year for the particular reserve category and the costs incurred on exploration and development activities in the year by the change in reserves from the prior year for the reserve category finding development and acquisition costs are calculated on a per boe basis by dividing the aggregate of the change in future development costs from the prior year for the particular reserve category and the costs incurred on development and exploration activities and property acquisitions net of dispositions in the year by the change in reserves from the year for the reserve category net asset value has been calculated based on the estimated net present value of all future net revenue from our reserves before income taxes as estimated by mcdaniel effective december 31 2019 plus the estimated value of our undeveloped land holdings less net debt recycle ratio means operating netback divided by finding and development costs for the particular reserves category reserve life index means the reserves for the particular reserve category divided by annualized 2019 fourth quarter production this press release discloses drilling inventory and potential drilling locations drilling inventory and drilling locations refers to baytex s total proved probable and unbooked locations proved locations and probable locations account for drilling locations in our inventory that have associated proved and or probable reserves unbooked locations are internal estimates based on our prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves unbooked locations are farther away from existing wells and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty whether such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves resources or production in the eagle ford baytex s net drilling locations include 140 proved and 83 probable locations as at december 31 2019 and 52 unbooked locations in the viking baytex s net drilling locations include 1 080 proved and 319 probable locations as at december 31 2019 and 636 unbooked locations in peace river baytex s net drilling locations include 77 proved and 75 probable locations as at december 31 2019 and 100 unbooked locations in lloydminster baytex s net drilling locations include 178 proved and 63 probable locations as at december 31 2019 and 361 unbooked locations in the duvernay baytex s net drilling locations include 11 proved and 10 probable locations as at december 31 2019 and 295 unbooked locations notice to united states readers the petroleum and natural gas reserves contained in this press release have generally been prepared in accordance with canadian disclosure standards which are not comparable in all respects to united states or other foreign disclosure standards for example the united states securities and exchange commission the sec requires oil and gas issuers in their filings with the sec to disclose only proved reserves but permits the optional disclosure of probable reserves each as defined in sec rules canadian securities laws require oil and gas issuers disclose their reserves in accordance with ni 51 101 which requires disclosure of not only proved reserves but also probable reserves additionally ni 51 101 defines proved reserves and probable reserves differently from the sec rules accordingly proved and probable reserves disclosed in this press release may not be comparable to united states standards probable reserves are higher risk and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than proved reserves in addition under canadian disclosure requirements and industry practice reserves and production are reported using gross volumes which are volumes prior to deduction of royalty and similar payments the sec rules require reserves and production to be presented using net volumes after deduction of applicable royalties and similar payments moreover baytex has determined and disclosed estimated future net revenue from its reserves using forecast prices and costs whereas the sec rules require that reserves be estimated using a 12 month average price calculated as the arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period as a consequence of the foregoing baytex s reserve estimates and production volumes in this press release may not be comparable to those made by companies utilizing united states reporting and disclosure standards baytex energy corp baytex energy corp is an oil and gas corporation based in calgary alberta the company is engaged in the acquisition development and production of crude oil and natural gas in the western canadian sedimentary basin and in the eagle ford in the united states

chinese authorities announced on january 2 that listings on the shanghai london stock connect would be suspended likely owing to political tensions over the ongoing hong kong protests due to china s existing set of capital controls foreign access to mainland financial markets and mainland access to foreign markets are tightly regulated by chinese officials the shanghai london stock connect allows chinese firms to issue depositary receipts in london and british firms to issue depositary receipts in china by contrast hong kong s links with markets in shanghai and shenzhen allow traders based in hong kong to trade mainland shares with no new issuance required as such the shanghai london stock connect has attracted little interest thus far with only one chinese firm huatai securities currently making use of the platform symbolically the move is a major escalatory move as beijing has shifted from merely isolating individual firms and companies to disrupting trade in 2018 china applied formal pressure on global airliners to include taiwan in the same geographic region as the mainland on their websites later the chinese government began formal pressure campaigns on firms associated with the hong kong protests most notably cathay pacific the importance of the shanghai london stock connect suspension will depend on whether additional policy moves targeting large british firms will follow in terms of tangible effects this event causes little economic disruption but is probably the most symbolically important use of chinese financial sanctions thus far these could be consequential especially for the british financial sector the promise of expanded financial liberalization coupled with lucrative fee income streams has lured global asset managers to the mainland further china s new loan benchmark the loan prime rate includes standard chartered and citigroup both major global lenders with expansionist aims in china last year despite the political pressure of brexit london overtook singapore as the largest renminbi rmb clearing hub outside of the mainland and hong kong one particular firm to watch may be hsbc europe s largest lender which fell into beijing s sights last year as early as 2011 hsbc has explored its options for a mainland listing with rumors circulating in late 2018 that the firm along with british luxury brand burberry could be the first to issue chinese depository receipts cdrs however liu xiaoming china s ambassador to the uk summoned the firm s ex ceo john flint to a contentious meeting regarding the firm s role in the ongoing case against huawei chief financial officer meng wangzhou placed under an independent monitoring group after its 2012 money laundering scandal hsbc cooperated with the us department of justice s investigation providing details on huawei s potential financial misdeeds despite its expansive corporate presence in china hsbc was also excluded from the loan prime rate s eighteen participating banks which includes smaller foreign lenders and domestic lenders such as standard chartered citigroup and bank of xian in a world with a more activist chinese sanctions policy hsbc s delicate balance between the east and west is already endangered in november hsbc shuttered an account belonging to spark alliance fund a key fundraiser for the city s protestors on compliance grounds this action coupled with the hong kong police force s arrest of four individuals associated with the account on money laundering charges earned the firm the distrust of the city s protestors many of whom allege the bank cooperated with police to punish protestors though details remain scarce the closing of the account raises another powerful trend in the world of sanctions that may very well be affecting firm s chinese units today de risking as washington has policed firms dollar clearing access many banks have resorted to withdrawing altogether from risky jurisdictions rather than going through the effort to clear transactions through established compliance processes while these have produced a psychological effect whereby uncertainty over sanctions has given extra economic pressure often without explicit action by officials at the us treasury or state department they have also made sanctions more difficult to lift as was the case in iran after the completion of the 2015 nuclear deal many international firms remained wary of re entering iranian markets for fear of a snapback of sanctions in the future the lack of a credible economic benefit to complying with us authorities wishes could make sanctions a weaker deterrent in china s case de risking may very well favor its short term interests as it partially does with the united states today were china to threaten even informal pressure major western banks may act as unwitting pawns of beijing s foreign policy strategy in such a scenario there could be very tangible effects as demonstrated by ubs loss of its role in a dollar bond sale by china rail construction corp after a scandal involving its global chief economist s comments on the african swine fever outbreak given china s plethora of state owned enterprises and control over state run media outlets the communist party could very well organize a boycott of select firms services after being targeted over the hong kong protests cathay pacific faced boycotts from some of china s financial firms like citic and huarong asset management which banned their employees from using the airline such restrictions could be particularly damaging for financial firms which are uniquely exposed to reputational risk beijing should be wary of its newfound financial power in the sanctions arena as the country manages a future of declining growth with an emboldened sanctions agenda abroad authorities steps towards financial openness could ring hollow especially if future action targets financial firms though de risking could favor china if it targets its rivals an activist approach could reduce the benefits to international firms of mainland market access thus compounding the effects of the ongoing trade war more importantly though beijing risks a harsh response from washington which controls the global spigot of dollars despite china s ambitious campaign to internationalize the renminbi the chinese yuan s influence has waned since the harsh reassertion of capital controls in 2015 and waning prospects for capital account liberalization the country cannot fully isolate itself from the dollar denominated financial world especially as it tries to raise the profile of its comparably small investment banks it is clear that china s sanctions policy has escalated as its provocations have gone unpunished south korea found itself unable to build a credible case at the world trade organization in 2016 owing to the political economy of china s labyrinthine maze of regulators state owned enterprises and politicized media landscape after geographic changes were forced on global airliners washington dismissed these moves as orwellian nonsense as china failed to back up statements with credible responses washington should not enable chinese actions or let them go unpunished the us government must convey that american financial market access is a privilege not a right michael b greenwald is a fellow at harvard kennedy school s

recently the ridiculous real estate company wework has faced intense scrutiny after their business model was absurdly overvalued and their ceo one adam neumann was exposed as an abusive boss as well as an overall crazy person investors from the saudi royal family companies like softbank and j p morgan and numerous venture capitalists poured vast sums of money into the company fueling its overvaluation which ran as high as 47 billion dollars unfortunately mainstream media continues to trot out this story as well as other famous instances of corporate fraud corruption and malfeasance as anomalies aberrations somehow absurd corporate business models outright fraudulent behavior and speculative overvaluations are seen as exceptions to the rule the bare truth of the matter is that various forms of fraud and cons are the rule for the vast majority of large corporations wework is basically a tiny fish in the ocean when we step back and consider the scale of cons from various transnational corporations for more recent and humorous examples check out current affairs 2019 griftie awards all the signs of brazen criminality are in front of us we have to do no more than look at the public figurehead of the con economy our own president his personality is the distillation of the elite grifter a hollow shell of a human heir to a fortune which has created a uniquely toxic mix of entitlement hubris ignorance and malignant narcissism a truly pathetic man molded by late capitalism celebrity and tv culture his wealth bequeathed by inheritance profits acquired through real estate scandals and university scams his brain is addled by a diet of fast food and his worldview warped by utterly deluded conservative media for instance the spurious idea that 1 5 trillion in tax cuts will help grow our economy through job creation or new business ventures is a fraud on its face but represents an exquisite example of capitalist propaganda this is a lie that millions of us citizens either sincerely believe or acquiesce to due to generations of mainstream media indoctrination as for the corporate scams cited below there are similar factors involving coercion and propaganda and they are similarly undemocratic the ownership class and upper management dictate narratives in the media how the labor is done how the con will play out and workers carry out immoral orders against their better judgment for instance take boeing and the two tragic crashes involving its 737 max 8 jet the market valuation of the company fluctuates today at around 200 billion dollars even as it knowingly and deliberately sold its newest model without the needed software updates mcas as well as without the needed sensor reading and indicator light to multiple foreign airlines and in many cases without training pilots on the new system now you might think that the software needed to keep a plane from nose diving might come standard with the purchase of a multimillion dollar passenger jet but you d be wrong in its infinite wisdom boeing decided to not to include the computer programmed safety features selling them for extra and deeming them optional internal boeing emails make clear there was systemic negligence and incompetence with the implementation of the mcas program let s take another somewhat dated example the behemoth volkswagen which had a huge emissions scandal in regard to its diesel vehicles produced from 2009 2015 volkswagen installed cheat software to fool emissions tests in 11 million of its diesel cars which when driven for real world road tests pumped out up to 40 times the permissible amount of nitrogen oxides further studies with other car manufacturers showed that many other brands were also well above the allowable limit for diesel emissions one air pollution expert confided that the added pollution in european cities would result in thousands of deaths volkswagen was forced to fork out 2 8 billion dollars to the us for their troubles that might seem like a lot but with 11 million cars sold in the process and taking a guess and using a round number of 20 000 for each new car sold it adds up to 220 billion in car sales just for these diesel automobiles let s shift to finance a sector just filled with the most outlandish craven and fraudulent criminal activity we could go on and on down the line from bank of america to wells fargo to deutsche bank by the way media devoted to following the practices of these hallowed institutions have scandal timelines and lists of the biggest scandals just to help us make sense of the dizzying and insane levels of depravity these corporations have reached one might think that encyclopedic chronologies and compendiums documenting these bank scams would shame and humble these corporations into adopting a semblance of corporate responsibility but no recently goldman sachs has been in the news for their involvement in the 1mbd scandal haven t heard of it this was a massive scheme involving the malaysian government and goldman sachs executives to sell billions of dollars worth of bonds to a giant malaysian shell company functioning effectively as a ponzi scheme a massive international conspiracy to embezzle billions of dollars in the words of a wealth fund which was bilked in the process seventeen goldman sachs employees face charges in malaysia and goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein met with the disgraced malaysian prime minister najib razak and the mastermind of the scam one jho low who is now believed to be on the run in china check the chinese wine caves in all likelihood these scandals are just the tip of the iceberg even if someone like blankfein did time for his involvement in 1mbd it might be analogous to al capone doing time for tax evasion the amount of immoral criminality is staggering when one attempts to tally how many countries have been ripped off and commons privatized how much land and assets seized how many poor and vulnerable people have had benefits cut and prices of necessities jacked up to benefit a tiny elite how many desperate people have died to serve neoliberal business models these untold atrocities are barely hidden and all one has to do is scratch the surface of our system to reveal the sordid deeds which must stay hidden for the economy to stay afloat and for public morale not to wane and stir folks to revolution no one is ever held responsible for financial crimes under capitalism just like our war criminals even though the culprits roam free in broad daylight and even though these crimes have devastating real world consequences no corporate media will ever acknowledge that these are just the cases we know about what else lies under the surface who among us has the means and the guts to find out if the mainstream media won t if these companies are willing to go to these lengths to defraud their customers there is really nothing they won t do if we knew the full scope of the mafioso like corruption and barbaric behavior of these multinationals people might actually revolt and overthrow our inhumane capitalist system mainstream media thus has a distinct role and performs excellently for the transnational corporations tncs by not investigating and not pushing for prosecution of guilty parties this balanced approach to news is justified in the name of being objective and trying to show both sides of the issues it s not just corporate leaders politicians and the media who are shirking their duties the judicial system is just as complicit on january 17th the 9th circuit court of appeals threw out a case juliana vs united states brought by twenty one young plaintiffs who argued that the us government acts as a barrier to climate action and quite rightly pointed out that the us government violating their right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness by enacting policies that contribute to the climate crisis the majority 2 1 ruling reluctantly concluded that the plaintiff s case must be made to the political branches or the electorate at large isn t it revealing that these judges view the judicial system as somehow above politics the dissenting judge called her fellow colleagues out for their cowardice it is as if an asteroid were barreling toward earth and the government decided to shut down our only defenses seeking to quash this suit the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the nation my colleagues throw up their hands concluding that this case presents nothing fit for the judiciary here we can clearly see the kafkaesque institutional evasion of responsibility everyone in these elite institutions is to blame so no one can be blamed for it risks exposing the system as the root cause in the west we are stuck in a time where no one accepts a public duty to do anything regarding climate change corporate criminality etc as mark fisher succinctly explained in capitalist realism the supreme genius of kafka was to have explored the negative atheology proper to capital the center is missing but we cannot stop searching for it or positing it it is not that there is nothing there it is that what is there is not capable of exercising responsibility as fisher and others have shown the lack of responsibility taken and lack of corporate and governmental transparency and lack of differentiation between the corporate judicial legislative and media bodies is a defining feature of late capitalism we can view the contours and delineate between the modern and postmodern periods in terms of the sea change from a foucauldian disciplinary society to a deleuzian society of control in the modern period there were bounded separate domains of work home life recreation public and private etc in our late stage dystopia it becomes exceedingly obvious that all that is holy is profaned for instance judges supposed impartial arbiters of fairness and democratic values who are supposedly duty bound to uphold basic issues of social environmental and economic justice yet do not have the temerity to overturn the death grip fossil fuel multinationals have over our country whereas before disciplinary action punishment and jail time could act as a bit of leverage to limit outright corporate crimes now we have interconnected networked embedded elite coteries who can no longer be distinguished as serving private or public functions the revolving door phenomenon today our elites also cannot distinguish or internalize their own actions and take responsibility for them internal checks could at least possibly prevent catastrophes or lead to feelings of shame and regret for past actions in the old fashioned modern way for this reason we can view someone like robert mcnamara as perhaps the last modernist public servant in the old school disciplinary age his actions were unconscionable but it is well known he at least regretted his part in the vietnam war afterwards the bizarre but true story of mcnamara almost getting thrown off a ferry to martha s vineyard in deep ocean in 1972 by an enraged anti war citizen with family who had served in vietnam confirms this afterwards mcnamara refused to press charges making clear he knew on some level he deserved punishment on the contrary take the figures of bush cheney and rumsfeld today they are insulated by layers of ideology and bodyguards inebriated by luxurious lifestyles and sycophantic think tanks who parrot their every word and interwoven within the framework and institutions of imperialist and conservative power who no longer have the capacity for self reflection their perceptions and self image in other words are managed by a network of power control and domination in this example the interests of the national security state figures such as bush obama and trump operate under the aegis of the capitalist imperial postmodern society of control which has continually formulated modulated subdued and attenuated any tension any tendency to self doubt or any capacity to think critically and examine the atrocities committed by their orders it is a world where instantaneous feedback can assuage and soothe the troubled nerves of the elites by providing media and or classified reports that justify their grotesque barbarism in real time we can observe this on a smaller scale when examining how social media algorithms create echo chambers and polarize those with opposing belief systems the type of worldview our war criminal presidents are subject to is a higher immorality as c wright mills put it it was best summed up by an unnamed senior bush regime official supposedly karl rove speaking to journalist ron suskind people like you are still living in what we call the reality based community you believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality that s not the way the world really works anymore we re an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while you are studying that reality judiciously as you will we ll act again creating other new realities which you can study too and that s how things will sort out we re history s actors and you all of you will be left to just study what we do the commonality between all these absolutely absurd scams is that unlike the relatively small size and bumbling ineptitude of a wework the fetishization of and overvaluation of hare brained tech with a company like theranos the pyramid scheme of a bernie madoff or the cooking the books accounting of an enron companies such as boeing volkswagen and goldman sachs form the commanding heights of the world economy these are supposedly the bona fide respectable blue chip companies which many middle class investors look to for stable steady growth of their wealth these companies and their corporate owners cannot clearly view reality who can but still and the public is simply left to just study what they do another aspect is the proliferation of marketing and advertising which hypnotizes the middle classes which in the west are approaching comatose status in regards to the scale of these interlocking crises of corporate greed and climate disruption abject submission and conformity are the key features of the professional managerial class who hype new trends and fads and even business models such as wework pharmaceutical companies spend more on advertising than research and development which lead the most sycophantic employees to top positions with deadly repercussions for example in the vioxx scandal and leads to modern pharmacological advances being in many cases guided by snake oil peddling quack researchers and their corporate overlords individuals as well as our artistic preferences and urban spaces increasingly are modulated by these corporate structures leading to a flattened consumerist aesthetic in a brilliant essay andru okun explains using quotes from author oli mould as mould argues neoliberalism is about the marketization of everything the imprinting of economic rationalities into the deepest recesses of everyday life posits that 21st century capitalism turbocharged by neoliberalism has co opted the conceptual framework of creativity in the interest of endless growth even movements interested in destabilizing capitalism can be viewed as a potential market to exploit subsumed by the very world they seek to transform creativity under capitalism is not creative at all it merely replicates existing capitalist registers into ever deeper recesses of socioeconomic life writes mould this form of imprinting becomes clear when examining the professional managerial classes and the petit bourgeois class class locations as erik olin wright pointed out invariably determine the psychological states of the middle classes who exert exploitative pressure upon their subordinates as well as pressure from above when advances and promotions are made within the confines of the professional class structure one can view the accommodation to capital with near empirical precision individual consciousness is related to position within the class structure that is the attitudes and behaviour of individuals has a connection to the location they occupy within the division of labour and the contradictory locations that exist in capitalism thus mark fisher explains how the individual actions of managers to change corporate culture are futile the delusion that many who enter into management with high hopes is precisely that they the individual can change things that they will not repeat what their managers had done that things will be different this time but watch someone step up to management and it s usually not long before the grey petrification of power starts to subsume them it is here that the structure is palpable you can practically see it taking people over hear its deadened deadening judgments speaking through them again the activities of these huge conglomerates which dictate the global economy public discourse and private and individual aesthetic preferences are not exceptions they represent the rule when it comes to the behavior of tncs and international finance scamming is what they do best whether by illegal software or the tv commercial and the scam ees quite often turn out to be other elite venture capital and banking firms hoodwinked by the allure of profit no matter the unseemly source or the ridiculousness of the business model climate denialism is also a very profitable scam for its elite adherents in the fossil fuel industries and the media one that plays a key role by influencing public opinion just enough to convince judges politicians and ceos that nothing can be done within their hallowed institutions the assertion i ll lay out here and it s admittedly not a particularly original or insightful one is simply that the falling rate of profit as we approach what we might call terminal stage capitalism has convinced these tncs to slightly adjust their calculus the adjustment is to supplement the neoliberal grip on power with the brazenness of the scam the neoliberal era stretching from approximately the mid 1970s until now can be defined quite rightly by david harvey as being driven by a process of accumulation by dispossession in his brilliant 2004 essay the new imperialism accumulation by dispossession harvey explains the four main policies which drive this process as privatization selling out the commons to private interests financialization the penetration of all parts of the economy by banks loans institutions such as the imf world bank the wto excessive debt etc management and manipulation of crises for instance see naomi klein s the shock doctrine and state redistributions huge subsidies and contracts for the fossil fuel and military industrial corporations socialism for the rich as it were perhaps today we can add a fifth category accumulation by the scam if a volkswagen or boeing or goldman sachs stands to make hundreds of billions of dollars by swindling their customers and can somewhat accurately guess that the level of future fines will be small or negligible that lobbyists can protect future interests that their teams of corporate lawyers can derail federal investigations that federal regulators will be hamstrung due to lack of expertise power and or resources and that their customer base and supply chains will remain relatively stable there is more of an incentive to cheat than ever before if the gravediggers of capital ultimately end up being a united working class and or the ecological crises combined with global warming induced climactic armageddon perhaps it d be helpful to think of these corporate grifters as the grave robbers exhuming and reanimating whatever scam du jour they deem necessary to circulate capital not only does this reliance on fraud betray the moral failings of the people and institutions implicated but it reinforces that marx was right the falling rate of profit over time and over accumulation continues to force new methods of creative destruction to enter our midst to necessitate continuous expansion neoliberal economics officially saw its death knell during the 2008 recession but twelve years later this undead ideology maintains hegemony in a world teetering on the brink of disaster zombie economics if you will profit and gdp growth at all costs to line elites pockets and increase national tax bases is killing the planet and working classes put another way from a humorous statement by anarchopac on twitter the problem with capitalism is eventually you run out of planet to destroy to maximize short term profit put yet another way john maynard keynes pointed out capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all in our late capitalist reality there are barely any new frontiers to shift capital and production to and the possibility of opening new markets in underdeveloped nations is also limited the colonialist frontiers have been tapped and the system begins to cannibalize itself a rentier economy coalesces and the contours of a neo feudal regime based on debt and precarity are readily apparent now speculation and passive income from the fire sectors finance insurance and real estate are near all time highs but their assets are so overvalued that sooner or later it will spur on an economic downturn that at this point is unavoidable consider for instance that the dow jones at its low point in march 2009 stood at around 6 600 here in 2020 we find the average hovering over 29 000 no one can legitimately say that our markets or average families are four times as well off or any more resilient and economically secure than ten years ago the next crash could very well make terms like housing bubble and tech bubble seem quaint the entire us economy is a bubble a rigged casino designed to implode since financial real estate and stock speculation has in some sense reached a tipping point of limited returns on investment our hypothesized 5th category accumulation via fraud is implemented it fits into our upside down world nicely since what is productive for one class is often unproductive for another one percenters elide reality to maintain their own class interests at all costs and block any real public discussion in the media of what constitutes productive versus unproductive labor the masters know what is good for us capitalist elites see no moral qualms in the most debased forms of wealth acquisition it s all relative to them and where previous taylorist models focused on planned obsolescence of products now we construct products that do not even work initially i e jets that literally fall out of the sky without the necessary software updates in all likelihood these examples are just harbingers of things to come as the structural instability of capital demands new avenues for expansion even as it teeters before the inevitable collapse the brazen criminality and fraudulence of the system bubbles to the surface and can no longer be rationalized away as an aberration as real material conditions deteriorate for the multitudes resistance to capitalism must intensify as it enters its final death throes

this was previously printed in the atlantic two things have been true so far in 2017 the news cycle keeps spiraling downward and the stock market keeps going up consider a brief review of the year s chaos in domestic news washington s legislative machine is even more broken than normal and president donald trump tweeting furiously while under investigation for possible collusion and obstruction has oscillated between sympathy for white nationalists and recklessness toward north korea a series of historic natural disasters have ravaged houston florida the u s virgin islands puerto rico and northern california abroad the u k is sleepwalking toward divorce with europe a crisis with a middle east ally is brewing and a missile flew over japan but what observable effect has this cavalcade of chaos had on the stock market none really the s p 500 is in the middle of one of the strongest bull runs since world war ii the dow passed 23 000 this week for the first time ever i cannot for the life of me understand why the market keeps going up michael bloomberg said tuesday in an interview with cbs news so what s going on here are three theories 1 it s simple corporations everywhere are making a bunch of money it s important to remember that the stock market is not a referendum on the state of liberalism or conservatism it is not a barometer of moral progress and it is not a report card on the president of the united states even if he wishes it were the stock market is a collective daily wager on the future performance of the nation s public companies and they are to employ a technical term making a boatload of money right now in the first quarter of this year corporate profits reached an all time high tech is leading the way with behemoths like facebook and google racking up several excellent years in a row emerging tech companies especially those that manufacture semiconductors such as nvidia micron technology and advanced micro devices have rode the ai machine learning wave to double their valuations since trump s election but it s not just tech just about any sector you pick including cars chemical production banks and health care has seen valuations soar in 2017 the most obvious explanation for rising corporate profits is that the u s economy is well into a long slow and steady recovery less obvious perhaps is that international sales account for nearly half of revenue in the s p 500 indeed netflix adds about five global subscribers for every one new domestic viewer and two global manufacturers boeing and caterpillar have accounted for about one quarter of the dow s 1 000 point jump in the last 10 weeks so it s equally important that the global recovery is marching on with business confidence at a decade high across the once moribund economies of the european union and japan low interest rates from central banks around the world haven t done much to move inflation but they re clearly succeeding in raising asset prices as well as u s markets have done since trump s election stock indices in europe japan and emerging markets are up even more it s a bit ironic that the global boom is feeding a so called trump bump on the campaign trail donald trump threatened to start a trade war with china leading many to assume that global trade would take a hit under his presidency instead the very opposite has happened in the first half of 2017 world trade grew at its fastest pace in the last five years in september the world trade organization reported stronger than expected growth driven by guess who asia and north america precisely the markets most under threat by trump s campaign rhetoric 2 a1 chaos doesn t drive the business cycle the unbelievably low volatility in a time of massive global uncertainty seems mysterious to me nobel prize winning economist richard thaler recently said indeed when people like thaler and bloomberg express astonishment at the resilience of the stock market in the face of political chaos they re suggesting that front page stories political crises geopolitical uncertainty and natural disasters ought to move markets maybe they ought to but do they washington s dysfunction hasn t interrupted the metronomic expansion of gdp and payrolls saber rattling in pyongyang hasn t prevented south korea from hitting a six year high in exports as for natural disasters the interamerican development bank analyzed the long run economic impact of catastrophes around the world between 1970 and 2008 and found almost no effect particularly in developed economies for example the 1995 kobe earthquake in japan was a terrible tragedy killing more than 6 000 people but within a year and a half the area s manufacturing economy was operating just 2 percent below its pre quake trend finally the market has clearly learned to shrug off trump s twitter feed perhaps the principle of inflation applies here and an oversupply of presidential bluster has served to depreciate the market moving power of the bully pulpit in general a1 news is a mixed indicator of stock market performance while the front pages and homepages of u s news organizations have been chaotic dire and whiplashing the business cycle has been the opposite steady positive and nearly boring brexit s effect on global markets has been much less catastrophic than people assumed just as the soviet crises of the 20th century and even 9 11 had sudden impacts that were overtaken by the business cycle said michael cembalest the chairman of market and investment strategy at jp morgan the percentage of countries in major expansion mode is about as good as it can get 3 there aren t many obvious signs of bubbles or causes for imminent corrections this isn t 1987 and it s not 2007 either unlike the mid 2000s when gdp growth was buffeted by an unsustainable rise in mortgage debt this boomlet doesn t seem to be driven by aberrant debt or ahistorical trade imbalances unemployment is low and so is inflation the housing market has bounced back but new home construction is still far below the pre crisis high commercial real estate borrowing is significantly below its levels during the real estate bubbles of the mid 1980s and mid 2000s furthermore there doesn t seem to be much fear that the fed will panic and suddenly raise rates or sell off assets in a hurried bid to combat inflation indeed investors seem so unalarmed they are practically napping trading volatility is at record lows as the investor and bloomberg writer conor sen pointed out on twitter the number of days in the last year where trading moved the stock market more than 1 percent is near its 60 year trough this week morgan stanley predicted a small and imminent correction due to the unwinding of the federal reserve s balance sheet and the potential failure of the gop tax cut legislation but it s not clear that investors should fret about either of these things trump and his ex goldman economic advisers must understand that the economy is the best thing the president has going for him it would be quite strange for a claque of former bankers to tap a new fed chair who quickly raises rates and shrinks the fed s balance sheet which would spook big banks and throttle economic growth as for taxes the republican party might contain just enough deficit hawks to reject the current tax framework which would add trillions to u s debt but it s almost inconceivable that a gop controlled government could screw up a small tax cut within 12 months of a midterm election as senator lindsey graham saidof passing tax cuts on cbs s face the nation on sunday if we don t we re dead perhaps the mere promise of future tax cuts is enough to string along an otherwise calm stock market it s a bit like a mother running an errand with her daughter in the car who purchases her little girl s cooperation with the promise of a future ice cream cone inevitably the allegedly short shopping excursion becomes an afternoon long affair testing the young girl s patience but as long as the girl believes the promise of imminent ice cream she ll at least try to behave a little the stock market might have slightly more patience than a five year old girl but it s similarly riding the forward momentum of a global recovery while marginally motivated by the promise of a future benefit corporate tax reform is a nice little ice cream cone that mom has promised as long as the promise is out there the market can keep telling itself that tax cuts are on their way no matter how much evidence washington provides to the contrary derek thompson is

recently the ridiculous real estate company wework has faced intense scrutiny after their business model was absurdly overvalued and their ceo one adam neumann was exposed as an abusive boss as well as an overall crazy person investors from the saudi royal family companies like softbank and j p morgan and numerous venture capitalists poured vast sums of money into the company fueling its overvaluation which ran as high as 47 billion dollars unfortunately mainstream media continues to trot out this story as well as other famous instances of corporate fraud corruption and malfeasance as anomalies aberrations somehow absurd corporate business models outright fraudulent behavior and speculative overvaluations are seen as exceptions to the rule the bare truth of the matter is that various forms of fraud and cons are the rule for the vast majority of large corporations wework is basically a tiny fish in the ocean when we step back and consider the scale of cons from various transnational corporations for more recent and humorous examples check out current affairs 2019 griftie awards all the signs of brazen criminality are in front of us we have to do no more than look at the public figurehead of the con economy our own president his personality is the distillation of the elite grifter a hollow shell of a human heir to a fortune which has created a uniquely toxic mix of entitlement hubris ignorance and malignant narcissism a truly pathetic man molded by late capitalism celebrity and tv culture his wealth bequeathed by inheritance profits acquired through real estate scandals and university scams his brain is addled by a diet of fast food and his worldview warped by utterly deluded conservative media for instance the spurious idea that 1 5 trillion in tax cuts will help grow our economy through job creation or new business ventures is a fraud on its face but represents an exquisite example of capitalist propaganda this is a lie that millions of us citizens either sincerely believe or acquiesce to due to generations of mainstream media indoctrination as for the corporate scams cited below there are similar factors involving coercion and propaganda and they are similarly undemocratic the ownership class and upper management dictate narratives in the media how the labor is done how the con will play out and workers carry out immoral orders against their better judgment for instance take boeing and the two tragic crashes involving its 737 max 8 jet the market valuation of the company fluctuates today at around 200 billion dollars even as it knowingly and deliberately sold its newest model without the needed software updates mcas as well as without the needed sensor reading and indicator light to multiple foreign airlines and in many cases without training pilots on the new system now you might think that the software needed to keep a plane from nose diving might come standard with the purchase of a multimillion dollar passenger jet but you d be wrong in its infinite wisdom boeing decided to not to include the computer programmed safety features selling them for extra and deeming them optional internal boeing emails make clear there was systemic negligence and incompetence with the implementation of the mcas program let s take another somewhat dated example the behemoth volkswagen which had a huge emissions scandal in regard to its diesel vehicles produced from 2009 2015 volkswagen installed cheat software to fool emissions tests in 11 million of its diesel cars which when driven for real world road tests pumped out up to 40 times the permissible amount of nitrogen oxides further studies with other car manufacturers showed that many other brands were also well above the allowable limit for diesel emissions one air pollution expert confided that the added pollution in european cities would result in thousands of deaths volkswagen was forced to fork out 2 8 billion dollars to the us for their troubles that might seem like a lot but with 11 million cars sold in the process and taking a guess and using a round number of 20 000 for each new car sold it adds up to 220 billion in car sales just for these diesel automobiles let s shift to finance a sector just filled with the most outlandish craven and fraudulent criminal activity we could go on and on down the line from bank of america to wells fargo to deutsche bank by the way media devoted to following the practices of these hallowed institutions have scandal timelines and lists of the biggest scandals just to help us make sense of the dizzying and insane levels of depravity these corporations have reached one might think that encyclopedic chronologies and compendiums documenting these bank scams would shame and humble these corporations into adopting a semblance of corporate responsibility but no recently goldman sachs has been in the news for their involvement in the 1mbd scandal haven t heard of it this was a massive scheme involving the malaysian government and goldman sachs executives to sell billions of dollars worth of bonds to a giant malaysian shell company functioning effectively as a ponzi scheme a massive international conspiracy to embezzle billions of dollars in the words of a wealth fund which was bilked in the process seventeen goldman sachs employees face charges in malaysia and goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein met with the disgraced malaysian prime minister najib razak and the mastermind of the scam one jho low who is now believed to be on the run in china check the chinese wine caves in all likelihood these scandals are just the tip of the iceberg even if someone like blankfein did time for his involvement in 1mbd it might be analogous to al capone doing time for tax evasion the amount of immoral criminality is staggering when one attempts to tally how many countries have been ripped off and commons privatized how much land and assets seized how many poor and vulnerable people have had benefits cut and prices of necessities jacked up to benefit a tiny elite how many desperate people have died to serve neoliberal business models these untold atrocities are barely hidden and all one has to do is scratch the surface of our system to reveal the sordid deeds which must stay hidden for the economy to stay afloat and for public morale not to wane and stir folks to revolution no one is ever held responsible for financial crimes under capitalism just like our war criminals even though the culprits roam free in broad daylight and even though these crimes have devastating real world consequences no corporate media will ever acknowledge that these are just the cases we know about what else lies under the surface who among us has the means and the guts to find out if the mainstream media won t if these companies are willing to go to these lengths to defraud their customers there is really nothing they won t do if we knew the full scope of the mafioso like corruption and barbaric behavior of these multinationals people might actually revolt and overthrow our inhumane capitalist system mainstream media thus has a distinct role and performs excellently for the transnational corporations tncs by not investigating and not pushing for prosecution of guilty parties this balanced approach to news is justified in the name of being objective and trying to show both sides of the issues it s not just corporate leaders politicians and the media who are shirking their duties the judicial system is just as complicit on january 17th the 9th circuit court of appeals threw out a case juliana vs united states brought by twenty one young plaintiffs who argued that the us government acts as a barrier to climate action and quite rightly pointed out that the us government violating their right to live liberty and the pursuit of happiness by enacting policies that contribute to the climate crisis the majority 2 1 ruling reluctantly concluded that the plaintiff s case must be made to the political branches or the electorate at large isn t it revealing that these judges view the judicial system as somehow above politics the dissenting judge called her fellow colleagues out for their cowardice it is as if an asteroid were barreling toward earth and the government decided to shut down our only defenses seeking to quash this suit the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the nation my colleagues throw up their hands concluding that this case presents nothing fit for the judiciary here we can clearly see the kafkaesque institutional evasion of responsibility everyone in these elite institutions is to blame so no one can be blamed for it risks exposing the system as the root cause in the west we are stuck in a time where no one accepts a public duty to do anything regarding climate change corporate criminality etc as mark fisher succinctly explained in capitalist realism the supreme genius of kafka was to have explored the negative atheology proper to capital the center is missing but we cannot stop searching for it or positing it it is not that there is nothing there it is that what is there is not capable of exercising responsibility as fisher and others have shown the lack of responsibility taken and lack of corporate and governmental transparency and lack of differentiation between the corporate judicial legislative and media bodies is a defining feature of late capitalism we can view the contours and delineate between the modern and postmodern periods in terms of the sea change from a foucauldian disciplinary society to a deleuzian society of control in the modern period there were bounded separate domains of work home life recreation public and private etc in our late stage dystopia it becomes exceedingly obvious that all that is holy is profaned for instance judges supposed impartial arbiters of fairness and democratic values who are supposedly duty bound to uphold basic issues of social environmental and economic justice yet do not have the temerity to overturn the death grip fossil fuel multinationals have over our country whereas before disciplinary action punishment and jail time could act as a bit of leverage to limit outright corporate crimes now we have interconnected networked embedded elite coteries who can no longer be distinguished as serving private or public functions the revolving door phenomenon today our elites also cannot distinguish or internalize their own actions and take responsibility for them internal checks could at least possibly prevent catastrophes or lead to feelings of shame and regret for past actions in the old fashioned modern way for this reason we can view someone like robert mcnamara as perhaps the last modernist public servant in the old school disciplinary age his actions were unconscionable but it is well known he at least regretted his part in the vietnam war afterwards the bizarre but true story of mcnamara almost getting thrown off a ferry to martha s vineyard in deep ocean in 1972 by an enraged anti war citizen with family who had served in vietnam confirms this afterwards mcnamara refused to press charges making clear he knew on some level he deserved punishment on the contrary take the figures of bush cheney and rumsfeld today they are insulated by layers of ideology and bodyguards inebriated by luxurious lifestyles and sycophantic think thanks who parrot their every word and interwoven within the framework and institutions of imperialist and conservative power who no longer have the capacity for self reflection their perceptions and self image in other words are managed by a network of power control and domination in this example the interests of the national security state figures such as bush obama and trump operate under the aegis of the capitalist imperial postmodern society of control which has continually formulated modulated subdued and attenuated any tension any tendency to self doubt or any capacity to think critically and examine the atrocities committed by their orders it is a world where instantaneous feedback can assuage and soothe the troubled nerves of the elites by providing media and or classified reports that justify their grotesque barbarism in real time we can observe this on a smaller scale when examining how social media algorithms create echo chambers and polarize those with opposing belief systems the type of worldview our war criminal presidents are subject to is a higher immorality as c wright mills put it it was best summed up by an unnamed senior bush regime official supposedly karl rove speaking to journalist ron suskind people like you are still living in what we call the reality based community you believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality that s not the way the world really works anymore we re an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while you are studying that reality judiciously as you will we ll act again creating other new realities which you can study too and that s how things will sort out we re history s actors and you all of you will be left to just study what we do the commonality between all these absolutely absurd scams is that unlike the relatively small size and bumbling ineptitude of a wework the fetishization of and overvaluation of hare brained tech with a company like theranos the pyramid scheme of a bernie madoff or the cooking the books accounting of an enron companies such as boeing volkswagen and goldman sachs form the commanding heights of the world economy these are supposedly the bona fide respectable blue chip companies which many middle class investors look to for stable steady growth of their wealth these companies and their corporate owners cannot clearly view reality who can but still and the public is simply left to just study what they do another aspect is the proliferation of marketing and advertising which hypnotizes the middle classes which in the west are approaching comatose status in regards to the scale of these interlocking crises of corporate greed and climate disruption abject submission and conformity are the key features of the professional managerial class who hype new trends and fads and even business models such as wework pharmaceutical companies spend more on advertising than research and development which lead the most sycophantic employees to top positions with deadly repercussions for example in the vioxx scandal and leads to modern pharmacological advances being in many cases guided by snake oil peddling quack researchers and their corporate overlords individuals as well as our artistic preferences and urban spaces increasingly are modulated by these corporate structures leading to a flattened consumerist aesthetic in a brilliant essay andru okun explains using quotes from author oli mould as mould argues neoliberalism is about the marketization of everything the imprinting of economic rationalities into the deepest recesses of everyday life posits that 21st century capitalism turbocharged by neoliberalism has co opted the conceptual framework of creativity in the interest of endless growth even movements interested in destabilizing capitalism can be viewed as a potential market to exploit subsumed by the very world they seek to transform creativity under capitalism is not creative at all it merely replicates existing capitalist registers into ever deeper recesses of socioeconomic life writes mould this form of imprinting becomes clear when examining the professional managerial classes and the petit bourgeois class class locations as erik olin wright pointed out invariably determine the psychological states of the middle classes who exert exploitative pressure upon their subordinates as well as pressure from above when advances and promotions are made within the confines of the professional class structure one can view the accommodation to capital with near empirical precision individual consciousness is related to position within the class structure that is the attitudes and behaviour of individuals has a connection to the location they occupy within the division of labour and the contradictory locations that exist in capitalism thus mark fisher explains how the individual actions of managers to change corporate culture are futile the delusion that many who enter into management with high hopes is precisely that they the individual can change things that they will not repeat what their managers had done that things will be different this time but watch someone step up to management and it s usually not long before the grey petrification of power starts to subsume them it is here that the structure is palpable you can practically see it taking people over hear its deadened deadening judgments speaking through them again the activities of these huge conglomerates which dictate the global economy public discourse and private and individual aesthetic preferences are not exceptions they represent the rule when it comes to the behavior of tncs and international finance scamming is what they do best whether by illegal software or the tv commercial and the scam ees quite often turn out to be other elite venture capital and banking firms hoodwinked by the allure of profit no matter the unseemly source or the ridiculousness of the business model climate denialism is also a very profitable scam for its elite adherents in the fossil fuel industries and the media one that plays a key role by influencing public opinion just enough to convince judges politicians and ceos that nothing can be done within their hallowed institutions the assertion i ll lay out here and it s admittedly not a particularly original or insightful one is simply that the falling rate of profit as we approach what we might call terminal stage capitalism has convinced these tncs to slightly adjust their calculus the adjustment is to supplement the neoliberal grip on power with the brazenness of the scam the neoliberal era stretching from approximately the mid 1970s until now can be defined quite rightly by david harvey as being driven by a process of accumulation by dispossession in his brilliant 2004 essay the new imperialism accumulation by dispossession harvey explains the four main policies which drive this process as privatization selling out the commons to private interests financialization the penetration of all parts of the economy by banks loans institutions such as the imf world bank the wto excessive debt etc management and manipulation of crises for instance see naomi klein s the shock doctrine and state redistributions huge subsidies and contracts for the fossil fuel and military industrial corporations socialism for the rich as it were perhaps today we can add a fifth category accumulation by the scam if a volkswagen or boeing or goldman sachs stands to make hundreds of billions of dollars by swindling their customers and can somewhat accurately guess that the level of future fines will be small or negligible that lobbyists can protect future interests that their teams of corporate lawyers can derail federal investigations that federal regulators will be hamstrung due to lack of expertise power and or resources and that their customer base and supply chains will remain relatively stable there is more of an incentive to cheat than ever before if the gravediggers of capital ultimately end up being a united working class and or the ecological crises combined with global warming induced climactic armageddon perhaps it d be helpful to think of these corporate grifters as the graverobbers exhuming and reanimating whatever scam du jour they deem necessary to circulate capital not only does this reliance on fraud betray the moral failings of the people and institutions implicated but it reinforces that marx was right the falling rate of profit over time and overaccumulation continues to force new methods of creative destruction to enter our midst to necessitate continuous expansion neoliberal economics officially saw its death knell during the 2008 recession but twelve years later this undead ideology maintains hegemony in a world teetering on the brink of disaster zombie economics if you will profit and gdp growth at all costs to line elites pockets and increase national tax bases is killing the planet and working classes put another way from a humorous statement by anarchopac on twitter the problem with capitalism is eventually you run out of planet to destroy to maximize short term profit put yet another way john maynard keynes pointed out capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all in our late capitalist reality there are barely any new frontiers to shift capital and production to and the possibility of opening new markets in underdeveloped nations is also limited the colonialist frontiers have been tapped and the system begins to cannibalize itself a rentier economy coalesces and the contours of a neo feudal regime based on debt and precarity are readily apparent now speculation and passive income from the fire sectors finance insurance and real estate are near all time highs but their assets are so overvalued that sooner or later it will spur on an economic downturn that at this point is unavoidable consider for instance that the dow jones at its low point in march 2009 stood at around 6 600 here in 2020 we find the average hovering over 29 000 no one can legitimately say that our markets or average families are four times as well off or any more resilient and economically secure than ten years ago the next crash could very well make terms like housing bubble and tech bubble seem quaint the entire us economy is a bubble a rigged casino designed to implode since financial real estate and stock speculation has in some sense reached a tipping point of limited returns on investment our hypothesized 5th category accumulation via fraud is implemented it fits into our upside down world nicely since what is productive for one class is often unproductive for another one percenters elide reality to maintain their own class interests at all costs and block any real public discussion in the media of what constitutes productive versus unproductive labor the masters know what it good for us capitalist elites see no moral qualms in the most debased forms of wealth acquisition it s all relative to them and where previous taylorist models focused on planned obsolescence of products now we construct products that do not even work initially i e jets that literally fall out of the sky without the necessary software updates in all likelihood these examples are just harbingers of things to come as the structural instability of capital demands new avenues for expansion even as it teeters before the inevitable collapse the brazen criminality and fraudulence of the system bubbles to the surface and can no longer be rationalized away

countries including ceos risk managers brokers and insurance experts business interruption an undiminished threat with new causes after seven years as the top risk globally bi drops to the second position but maintains top spot in china in the allianz risk barometer reflecting the continuing trend for larger and more complex bi losses causes are becoming ever more diverse ranging from fire explosion or natural catastrophes to digital supply chains or even political violence in australia the total damage and economic loss caused by wildfires from september 2019 and into 2020 is estimated to cost 110 billion businesses are also increasingly exposed to the direct or indirect impact of riots civil unrest or terrorism attacks escalating civil unrest in hong kong has resulted in property damage bi and general loss of income for both local and multinational companies as shops closed for months customers and tourists stayed away or employees couldn t access their workplace due to safety concerns the consequence is a business interruption without physical losses but high financial ones natural catastrophes remain as a top three risk devastating typhoons in asia and record breaking wildfires in australia were among the disasters which dominated global headlines in 2019 however economic losses from natural catastrophe events actually declined 20 year on year to around 133bn in recent years significant non weather related nat cat events such as earthquakes or tsunamis have been rare and consequently the importance of these risks has declined in the allianz risk barometer nevertheless nat cat risks are in the top three risks in many regions across the globe that are frequently affected by meteorological geophysical climatological and hydrological events including china us and japan says patrick zeng ceo hong kong greater china cyber risks continue to evolve awareness of the cyber threat has grown rapidly in recent years driven by companies increasing reliance on data and it systems and a number of high profile incidents businesses face the challenge of larger and more expensive data breaches an increase in ransomware and spoofing incidents as well as the prospect of privacy driven fines or litigation after an event a mega data breach involving more than one million compromised records now costs on average 42mn up 8 year on year incidents are becoming more damaging increasingly targeting large companies with sophisticated attacks and hefty extortion demands five years ago a typical ransomware demand would have been in the tens of thousands of dollars now they can be in the millions says marek stanislawski deputy global head of cyber agcs extortion demands are just one part of the picture companies can suffer major bi losses due to the unavailability of critical data systems or technology either through a technical glitch or cyber attack many incidents are the results of human error and can be mitigated by staff awareness trainings which are not yet a routine practice across companies says stanislawski mr zeng added with china locked in an ongoing trade war with the us that does not look to be fully resolved fully any time soon risk managers in the country are concerned about the impact it will have on business interruption as the unpredictable nature of tariff announcements have made it difficult to plan accurately for the future also noteworthy is cyber risks making the top 3 for the first time in china as businesses in the country show a growing appreciation of the perils of non traditional risks also taking the third spot market developments are a key risk for china companies 2019 was characterized by high market volatility which will continue in 2020 according to ludovic subran chief economist at allianz uncertainties caused by trade conflict and political risks will continue to affect markets low growth low inflation may hide more direct pass through from political risks to financialmarkets and the need to manage negative externalities of interventionist policy makers he adds higher volatility from the us china trade conflict will keep the dollar strong the renminbi should depreciate further a more fragmented world also means volatile commodity prices currencies and capital flows for emerging markets climate change brings added risk complexity climate change making its debut in the top 10 ranking in fifth place in china is a huge riser regionally jumping to third from eighth last year in the asia pacific standings driven by risk management experts in countries and territories such as australia hong kong india and indonesia ongoing wildfires engulfing australia as well as severe floods in jakarta have certainly hammered home the consequences of increasingly volatile weather for businesses an increase in physical losses is the exposure businesses fear most 49 of responses as rising seas drier droughts fiercer storms and massive flooding pose threats to factories and other

there is a great deal of international interest in this speech president trump well thank you very much klaus and a very special congratulations on your 50th year hosting the annual meeting of the world economic forum a truly amazing achievement it s an honor to address the distinguished members of this organization for the second time as president when i spoke at this forum two years ago i told you that we had launched the great american comeback today i m proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before we ve regained our stride we discovered our spirit and reawakened the powerful machinery of american enterprise america is thriving america is flourishing and yes america is winning again like never before just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made they just happened to get done in the same week these agreements represent a new model of trade for the 21st century agreements that are fair reciprocal and that prioritize the needs of workers and families america s economic turnaround has been nothing short of spectacular when i took office three years ago america s economy was in a rather dismal state under the previous administration nearly 200 000 manufacturing jobs had vanished wages were flat or falling almost 5 million more americans had left the labor force than had gotten jobs and more than 10 million people had been added to the food stamp rolls the experts predicted a decade of very very slow growth or even maybe negative growth high unemployment and a dwindling workforce and very much a shrinking middle class millions of hardworking ordinary citizens felt neglected betrayed forgotten they were rapidly losing faith in the system before my presidency began the outlook for many nations was bleak top economists warned of a protracted worldwide recession the world bank lowered its projections for global growth to a number that nobody wanted to even think about pessimism had taken root deep in the minds of leading thinkers business leaders and policymakers yet despite all of the cynics i had never been more confident in america s future i knew we were on the verge of a profound economic resurgence if we did things right one that would generate a historic wave of investment wage growth and job creation i knew that if we unleashed the potential of our people if we cut taxes slashed regulations and we did that at a level that s never been done before in the history of our country in a short period of time fixed broken trade deals and fully tapped american energy that prosperity would come thundering back at a record speed and that is exactly what we did and that is exactly what happened since my election america has gained over 7 million jobs a number unthinkable i wouldn t say it i wouldn t talk about it but that was a number that i had in mind the projection was 2 million we did 7 more than three times the government s own projections the unemployment rate is now less than 3 4 and 5 percent and at 3 5 percent that s a number that is the lowest in more than 50 years the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with reasonably high rate for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we re concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy ever to exist we are lifting up americans of every race color religion and creed unemployment rates among african americans hispanic americans and asian americans have all reached record lows african american youth unemployment has reached the lowest it s ever been in the history of our country african american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level since 1953 and women now comprise a majority of the american workforce that s for the first time the unemployment rate for veterans has dropped to a record low the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time record low workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in u s history wages are rising across the board and those at the bottom of the income ladder are enjoying the percentage by far largest gains workers wages are now growing faster than management wages earnings growth for the bottom 10 percent is outpacing the top 10 percent something that has not happened paychecks for high school graduates are rising faster than for college graduates young americans just entering the workforce are also sharing in america s extraordinary prosperity since i took office more than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5 percent annually a number that was unthinkable nobody would have ever thought it was possible three years ago a record number of americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working in the eight years before i took office over 300 000 working age people left the workforce in just three years in my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce ten million people have been lifted off welfare in less than three years celebrating the dignity of work is a fundamental pillar of our agenda this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 percent three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded the american dream is back bigger better and stronger than ever before no one is benefitting more than america s middle class we have created 1 2 million manufacturing and construction jobs a number also unthinkable after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations hard to believe when you hear 60 000 factories america has now gained in a very short period of time 12 000 new factories under my administration and the number is going up rapidly we ll be beating the 60 000 number that we lost except these will be bigger newer and the latest years of economic stagnation have given way to a roaring geyser of opportunity u s stock markets have soared by more than 50 percent since my election adding more than 19 trillion to household wealth and boosting 401 k s pensions and college savings accounts for millions of hardworking families and these great numbers are many things and it s despite the fact that the fed has raised rates too fast and lowered them too slowly and even now as the united states is by far the strongest economic power in the world it s not even close it was going to be close but a lot of good things happened to us and some not so good things happened to certain other places they re forced to compete and we compete with nations that are getting negative rates something very new meaning they get paid to borrow money something that i could get used to very quickly love that got to pay back your loan oh how much am i getting nevertheless we still have the best numbers that we ve had in so many different areas it s a conservative approach and we have a tremendous upside potential when all of the trade deals and the massive deregulation starts kicking in which will be during this year especially toward the end of the year those trade deals are starting to kick in already the regulations are kicking in right now and i see such tremendous potential for the future we have not even started because the numbers we re talking about are massive the time for skepticism is over people are flowing back into our country companies are coming back into our country many of you who i know are coming back in with your plants and your factories thank you very much america s newfound prosperity is undeniable unprecedented and unmatched anywhere in the world america achieved this stunning turnaround not by making minor changes to a handful of policies but by adopting a whole new approach centered entirely on the wellbeing of the american worker every decision we make on taxes trade regulation energy immigration education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday americans we are determined to create the highest standard of living that anyone can imagine and right now that s what we re doing for our workers the highest in the world and we re determined to ensure that the working and middle class reap the largest gains a nation s highest duty is to its own citizens honoring this truth is the only way to build faith and confidence in the market system only when governments put their own citizens first will people be fully invested in their national futures in the united states we are building an economy that works for everyone restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite citizens and powers nations today i hold up the american model as an example to the world of a working system of free enterprise that will produce the most benefits for the most people in the 21st century and beyond a pro worker pro citizen pro family agenda demonstrates how a nation can thrive when its communities its companies its government and its people work together for the good of the whole nation as part of this new vision we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history we doubled the child tax credit benefitting 40 million american families and lifting 650 000 single mothers and their 1 million children out of poverty and out of poverty quickly we passed the first ever tax credit for employers who provide paid paternal leave for employees earning 72 000 less annually and passed paid family leave for government employees as a model for the country we made childcare much more affordable and reduced or eliminated childcare waitlists all across the nation our childcare reforms are supporting working parents and ensuring their children have access to high quality care and education all of which they very much deserve we lowered our business tax from the highest in the developed world down to one that s not only competitive but one of the lower taxes we created nearly 9 000 opportunity zones in distressed communities where capital gains on long term investments are now taxed at zero and tremendous wealth is pouring into areas that for a hundred years saw nothing the 35 million americans who live in these areas have already seen their home values rise by more than 22 billion my administration has also made historic investments in historically black colleges and universities i saved hcbus we saved them they were going out and we saved them we re removing roadblocks to success and rewarding businesses that invest in workers families and communities we ve also launched the most ambitious campaign in history to reduce job killing regulations for every new regulation adopted we are removing eight old regulations which will save an average of american households about 3 100 per year it was going to be for every one we do two but we were able to lift that to eight and we think that s going to go quite a bit higher we still have a way to go today i urge other nations to follow our example and liberate your citizens from the crushing weight of bureaucracy with that you have to run your own countries the way you want we re also restoring the constitutional rule of law in america which is essential to our economy our liberty and our future and that s why we ve appointed over 190 federal judges a record to interpret the law as written one hundred and ninety federal judges think of that and two supreme court judges as a result of our efforts investment is pouring into our country in the first half of 2019 the united states attracted nearly one quarter of all foreign direct investment in the world think of that twenty five percent of all foreign investment all over the world came into the united states and that number is increasing rapidly to every business looking for a place where they are free to invest build thrive innovate and succeed there is no better place on earth than the united states as a central part of our commitment to building an inclusive society we established the national council for the american worker we want every citizen regardless of age or background to have the cutting edge skills to compete and succeed in tomorrow s workplace this includes critical industries like artificial intelligence quantum computing and 5g under ivanka s leadership who is with us today our pledge to america s workers has become a full blown national movement with over 400 companies committing to provide new job and training opportunities to already very close to 15 million american students and workers fifteen million america is making sweeping changes to place workers and their families at the center of our national agenda perhaps the most transformative change of all is on trade reform where we re addressing chronic problems that have been ignored tolerated or enabled for decades our leaders did nothing about what happened to us on trade before i was elected china s predatory practices were undermining trade for everyone but no one did anything about it except allow it to keep getting worse and worse and worse under my leadership america confronted the problem head on under our new phase one agreement phase two is starting negotiations very shortly china has agreed to substantially do things that they would not have done measures to protect intellectual property stop forced technology transfers remove trade barriers in agricultural goods and on agricultural goods where we were treated so badly open its financial sector totally that s done and maintain a stable currency all backed by very very strong enforcement our relationship with china right now has probably never been better we went through a very rough patch but it s never ever been better my relationship with president xi is an extraordinary one he s for china i m for the u s but other than that we love each other additionally china will spend an additional 200 billion over two years on american services agriculture and energy and manufactured goods so we ll be taking in an excess of 200 billion could be closer to 300 billion when it finishes but these achievements would not have been possible without the implementation of tariffs which we had to use and we re using them on others too and that is why most of our tariffs on china will remain in place during the phase two negotiations for the most part the tariffs have been left and we re being paid billions and billions of dollars a year as a country as i mentioned earlier we ended the nafta disaster one of the worst trade deals ever made not even close and replaced it with the incredible new trade deal the usmca that s mexico and canada in the nearly 25 years after nafta the united states lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs including nearly 1 in 4 vehicle manufacturing jobs it was an incentive to leave the country the nafta agreement exemplified the decades long failures of the international trading system the agreement shifted wealth to the hands of a few promoted massive outsourcing drove down wages and shuttered plants and factories by the thousands the plants would leave our country make the product sell it into our country we ended up with no jobs and no taxes would buy other countries product that doesn t happen anymore this is the wreckage that i was elected to clean up it s probably the reason i ran for president more than any other thing because i couldn t understand why we were losing all of these jobs to other countries at such a rapid rate and it got worse and worse and i think it s probably the primary reason that i ran but there are other reasons also and to replace with a new system that puts workers before the special interests and the special interests will do just fine but the workers come first our brand new usmca is the result of the broadest coalition ever assembled for a trade agreement manufacturing agriculture and labor all strongly endorsed the deal and as you know it just passed in congress overwhelmingly it shows how to solve the 21st century challenge we all face protecting intellectual property expanding digital trade re shoring lost jobs and ensuring rising wages and living standards the united states has also concluded a great new trade deal with japan approximately 40 billion and completely renegotiated our deal with south korea we re also negotiating many other transactions with many other countries and we look forward to negotiating a tremendous new deal with the united kingdom they have a wonderful new prime minister and wants very much to make a deal as they say to protect our security and our economy we are also boldly embracing american energy independence the united states is now by far the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far it s not even close while many european countries struggle with crippling energy costs the american energy revolution is saving american families 2 500 every year in lowering electric bills and numbers that people said couldn t happen and also very importantly prices at the pump we ve been so successful that the united states no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations with an abundance of american natural gas now available our european allies no longer have to be vulnerable to unfriendly energy suppliers either we urge our friends in europe to use america s vast supply and achieve true energy security with u s companies and researchers leading the way we are on the threshold of virtually unlimited reserves of energy including from traditional fuels lng clean coal next generation nuclear power and gas hydrate technologies at the same time i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years we re committed to conserving the majesty of god s creation and the natural beauty of our world today i m pleased to announce the united states will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the world economic forum one trillion trees applause and in doing so we will continue to show strong leadership in restoring growing and better managing our trees and our forests this is not a time for pessimism this is a time for optimism fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse they are the heirs of yesterday s foolish fortune tellers and i have them and you have them and we all have them and they want to see us do badly but we don t let that happen they predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s mass starvation in the 70s and an end of oil in the 1990s these alarmists always demand the same thing absolute power to dominate transform and control every aspect of our lives we will never let radical socialists destroy our economy wreck our country or eradicate our liberty america will always be the proud strong and unyielding bastion of freedom in america we understand what the pessimists refuse to see that a growing and vibrant market economy focused on the future lifts the human spirit and excites creativity strong enough to overcome any challenge any challenge by far the great scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century from penicillin to high yield wheat to modern transportation and breakthrough vaccines have lifted living standards and saved billions of lives around the world and we re continuing to work on things that you ll be hearing about in the near future that even today sitting here right now you wouldn t believe it s possible that we have found the answers you ll be hearing about it but we have found answers to things that people said would not be possible certainly not in a very short period of time but the wonders of the last century will pale in comparison to what today s young innovators will achieve because they are doing things that nobody thought even feasible to begin we continue to embrace technology not to shun it when people are free to innovate millions will live longer happier healthier lives for three years now america has shown the world that the path to a prosperous future begins with putting workers first choosing growth and freeing entrepreneurs to bring their dreams to life for anyone who doubts what is possible in the future we need only look at the towering achievements of the past only a few hundred miles from here are some of the great cities of europe teeming centers of commerce and culture each of them is full of reminders of what human drive and imagination can achieve centuries ago at the time of the renaissance skilled craftsmen and laborers looked upwards and built the structures that still touch the human heart to this day some of the greatest structures in the world have been built hundreds of years ago in italy the citizens once started construction on what would be a 140 year project the duomo of florence an incredible incredible place while the technology did not yet exist to complete their design city fathers forged ahead anyway certain that they would figure it out someday these citizens of florence did not accept limits to their high aspirations and so the great dome was finally built in france another century long project continues to hold such a grip on our hearts and our souls that even 800 years after its construction when the cathedral of notre dame was engulfed in flames last year such a sad sight to watch unbelievable site especially for those of us that considered it one of the great great monuments and representing so many different things the whole world grieved though her sanctuary now stands scorched and charred and a sight that s hard to believe when you got used to it to look at it now hard to believe but we know that notre dame will be restored will be restored magnificently the great bells will once again ring out for all to hear giving glory to god and filling millions with wonder and awe the cathedrals of europe teach us to pursue big dreams daring adventures and unbridled ambitions they urge us to consider not only what we build today but what we will endure long after we are gone they testify to the power of ordinary people to realize extraordinary achievements when united by a grand and noble purpose so together we must go forward with confidence determination and vision we must not be timid or meek or fearful but instead we must boldly seize the day and embrace the moment we have so many great leaders in this room not only business leaders but leaders of nations and some are doing such a fantastic job we work together very closely we will draw strength from the glories of the past and we will make greatness our common mission for the future together we will make our nations stronger our countries safer our culture richer our people freer and the world more beautiful than ever before above all else we will forever be loyal to our workers our citizens and our families the men and women who are the backbone of our economies the heart of our communities and the soul of our countries let us bring light to their lives one by one and empower them to light up the world thank you very much god bless you god bless your countries and god bless america thank you thank you very much applause

it s a new day unless you re terminally ill or the guest of a terrorist cell this observation won t come as much of a surprise or in itself cause much delight and yet that s the tagline for the combined chrysler dodge and jeep brands in an explanatory tv ad an animated child tells viewers that the american automaker will listen to you and build cars the cars you want the ad is an excellent example of what adolph hitler called the big lie a falsehood so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously to wit if any single automaker isn t building the cars you want it s chrysler ipso facto chrysler s u s market share is swirling around the toilet bowl although they re now a privately held company exempt from full public financial disclosure analysts reckon auburn hills accounts for just 14 percent of the america s new car sales pie and falling not to mention the bulk sales propping up that share and no wonder chrysler s three brands are suffused with poorly built hugely discounted high depreciation product that you would be crazy to buy the timing of chrysler s new day new tagline adds to the cognitive dissonance why would chrysler announce its newfound desire to build cars customers want sounds crazy but it just might work just as it s about to decimate its entire model lineup this forthcoming execution of ten or more chrysler losers makes perfect sense the first part of making the cars you want is shit canning the cars you don t want but it s a pr nightmare customers will see the bloodletting as an abject admission that chrysler isn t clued in to its customers need don t worry it s a new day how mein kampf is that yes well what about all those customers who helped keep chrysler alive by buying all the models that the company is now killing unless these owners plan to take their lame duck car or truck to the grave via their very own personal lifetime warranty chrysler s producticide will add depreciation insult to depreciation injury should old acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind guess so the discrepancy between chrysler s new day sloganeering and its past and current predicament isn t the only reason that their new tagline is a big lie the automaker s inability to implement this consumer centric philosophy in the future also puts paid to their napoleonic declaration that history begins now let s set aside the fact that chrysler s new owners intention to sell the company to someone else talk about commitment we re going to build the cars you want until we can get someone else to do it to bring meaning to chrysler s new day promise to listen and respond to customers needs they ve got to change they way they do business hence the tagline s tagline you talk we listen the evidence for this communications revolution is weak the official website proclaims the new day and invites customers to see the difference on 12 models the majority of the enhancements are options i e extra expense rather than new you asked for it you got it standard features are we really to believe that charger customers clamored for cool vanilla paint at best these changes result from the same old focus group filtration at worst chrysler s spinning to create a false sense of consumer empowerment for evidence of chrysler s supposed desire to get close to the customer we turn to their official blog not only is chrysler leaving this electronic forum to rot on the vine but even a cursory glance reveals that it s nothing more than corporate propaganda written by insiders hacks and spinmeisters yes a truck can be a family vehicle a new day dawns at our dealerships unleashed in a web swimming with millions of car buyers and enthusiasts most blog posts get single digit including 0 responses nuff said it s too bad that chrysler s new day is a big lie they ve missed a huge opportunity to make an enormous competitive leap if chrysler really wanted to revolutionize its business to create a genuine new dawn they could do so by throwing open the company to its customers dealers and workers they could use the net to destroy the walls separating us and them and establish a sophisticated feedback loop where the company could listen to its customers and act upon that information in a timely way yeah right chrysler is owned by cerberus a private equity company known for its obsessive kremlin like secrecy of all the automakers in the world chrysler is the least likely to let its guard down there will be no glasnost in auburn hills chrysler s new day is nothing more than a false dawn for those gullible or desperate enough to believe that the sun will come out tomorrow for the product challenged financially troubled american automaker

there is a great deal of international interest in this speech president trump well thank you very much klaus and a very special congratulations on your 50th year hosting the annual meeting of the world economic forum a truly amazing achievement it s an honor to address the distinguished members of this organization for the second time as president when i spoke at this forum two years ago i told you that we had launched the great american comeback today i m proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before we ve regained our stride we discovered our spirit and reawakened the powerful machinery of american enterprise america is thriving america is flourishing and yes america is winning again like never before just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made they just happened to get done in the same week these agreements represent a new model of trade for the 21st century agreements that are fair reciprocal and that prioritize the needs of workers and families america s economic turnaround has been nothing short of spectacular when i took office three years ago america s economy was in a rather dismal state under the previous administration nearly 200 000 manufacturing jobs had vanished wages were flat or falling almost 5 million more americans had left the labor force than had gotten jobs and more than 10 million people had been added to the food stamp rolls the experts predicted a decade of very very slow growth or even maybe negative growth high unemployment and a dwindling workforce and very much a shrinking middle class millions of hardworking ordinary citizens felt neglected betrayed forgotten they were rapidly losing faith in the system before my presidency began the outlook for many nations was bleak top economists warned of a protracted worldwide recession the world bank lowered its projections for global growth to a number that nobody wanted to even think about pessimism had taken root deep in the minds of leading thinkers business leaders and policymakers yet despite all of the cynics i had never been more confident in america s future i knew we were on the verge of a profound economic resurgence if we did things right one that would generate a historic wave of investment wage growth and job creation i knew that if we unleashed the potential of our people if we cut taxes slashed regulations and we did that at a level that s never been done before in the history of our country in a short period of time fixed broken trade deals and fully tapped american energy that prosperity would come thundering back at a record speed and that is exactly what we did and that is exactly what happened since my election america has gained over 7 million jobs a number unthinkable i wouldn t say it i wouldn t talk about it but that was a number that i had in mind the projection was 2 million we did 7 more than three times the government s own projections the unemployment rate is now less than 3 4 and 5 percent and at 3 5 percent that s a number that is the lowest in more than 50 years the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with reasonably high rate for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we re concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy ever to exist we are lifting up americans of every race color religion and creed unemployment rates among african americans hispanic americans and asian americans have all reached record lows african american youth unemployment has reached the lowest it s ever been in the history of our country african american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level since 1953 and women now comprise a majority of the american workforce that s for the first time the unemployment rate for veterans has dropped to a record low the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time record low workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in u s history wages are rising across the board and those at the bottom of the income ladder are enjoying the percentage by far largest gains workers wages are now growing faster than management wages earnings growth for the bottom 10 percent is outpacing the top 10 percent something that has not happened paychecks for high school graduates are rising faster than for college graduates young americans just entering the workforce are also sharing in america s extraordinary prosperity since i took office more than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5 percent annually a number that was unthinkable nobody would have ever thought it was possible three years ago a record number of americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working in the eight years before i took office over 300 000 working age people left the workforce in just three years in my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce ten million people have been lifted off welfare in less than three years celebrating the dignity of work is a fundamental pillar of our agenda this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 percent three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded the american dream is back bigger better and stronger than ever before no one is benefitting more than america s middle class we have created 1 2 million manufacturing and construction jobs a number also unthinkable after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations hard to believe when you hear 60 000 factories america has now gained in a very short period of time 12 000 new factories under my administration and the number is going up rapidly we ll be beating the 60 000 number that we lost except these will be bigger newer and the latest years of economic stagnation have given way to a roaring geyser of opportunity u s stock markets have soared by more than 50 percent since my election adding more than 19 trillion to household wealth and boosting 401 k s pensions and college savings accounts for millions of hardworking families and these great numbers are many things and it s despite the fact that the fed has raised rates too fast and lowered them too slowly and even now as the united states is by far the strongest economic power in the world it s not even close it was going to be close but a lot of good things happened to us and some not so good things happened to certain other places they re forced to compete and we compete with nations that are getting negative rates something very new meaning they get paid to borrow money something that i could get used to very quickly love that got to pay back your loan oh how much am i getting nevertheless we still have the best numbers that we ve had in so many different areas it s a conservative approach and we have a tremendous upside potential when all of the trade deals and the massive deregulation starts kicking in which will be during this year especially toward the end of the year those trade deals are starting to kick in already the regulations are kicking in right now and i see such tremendous potential for the future we have not even started because the numbers we re talking about are massive the time for skepticism is over people are flowing back into our country companies are coming back into our country many of you who i know are coming back in with your plants and your factories thank you very much america s newfound prosperity is undeniable unprecedented and unmatched anywhere in the world america achieved this stunning turnaround not by making minor changes to a handful of policies but by adopting a whole new approach centered entirely on the wellbeing of the american worker every decision we make on taxes trade regulation energy immigration education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday americans we are determined to create the highest standard of living that anyone can imagine and right now that s what we re doing for our workers the highest in the world and we re determined to ensure that the working and middle class reap the largest gains a nation s highest duty is to its own citizens honoring this truth is the only way to build faith and confidence in the market system only when governments put their own citizens first will people be fully invested in their national futures in the united states we are building an economy that works for everyone restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite citizens and powers nations today i hold up the american model as an example to the world of a working system of free enterprise that will produce the most benefits for the most people in the 21st century and beyond a pro worker pro citizen pro family agenda demonstrates how a nation can thrive when its communities its companies its government and its people work together for the good of the whole nation as part of this new vision we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history we doubled the child tax credit benefitting 40 million american families and lifting 650 000 single mothers and their 1 million children out of poverty and out of poverty quickly we passed the first ever tax credit for employers who provide paid paternal leave for employees earning 72 000 less annually and passed paid family leave for government employees as a model for the country we made childcare much more affordable and reduced or eliminated childcare waitlists all across the nation our childcare reforms are supporting working parents and ensuring their children have access to high quality care and education all of which they very much deserve we lowered our business tax from the highest in the developed world down to one that s not only competitive but one of the lower taxes we created nearly 9 000 opportunity zones in distressed communities where capital gains on long term investments are now taxed at zero and tremendous wealth is pouring into areas that for a hundred years saw nothing the 35 million americans who live in these areas have already seen their home values rise by more than 22 billion my administration has also made historic investments in historically black colleges and universities i saved hcbus we saved them they were going out and we saved them we re removing roadblocks to success and rewarding businesses that invest in workers families and communities we ve also launched the most ambitious campaign in history to reduce job killing regulations for every new regulation adopted we are removing eight old regulations which will save an average of american households about 3 100 per year it was going to be for every one we do two but we were able to lift that to eight and we think that s going to go quite a bit higher we still have a way to go today i urge other nations to follow our example and liberate your citizens from the crushing weight of bureaucracy with that you have to run your own countries the way you want we re also restoring the constitutional rule of law in america which is essential to our economy our liberty and our future and that s why we ve appointed over 190 federal judges a record to interpret the law as written one hundred and ninety federal judges think of that and two supreme court judges as a result of our efforts investment is pouring into our country in the first half of 2019 the united states attracted nearly one quarter of all foreign direct investment in the world think of that twenty five percent of all foreign investment all over the world came into the united states and that number is increasing rapidly to every business looking for a place where they are free to invest build thrive innovate and succeed there is no better place on earth than the united states as a central part of our commitment to building an inclusive society we established the national council for the american worker we want every citizen regardless of age or background to have the cutting edge skills to compete and succeed in tomorrow s workplace this includes critical industries like artificial intelligence quantum computing and 5g under ivanka s leadership who is with us today our pledge to america s workers has become a full blown national movement with over 400 companies committing to provide new job and training opportunities to already very close to 15 million american students and workers fifteen million america is making sweeping changes to place workers and their families at the center of our national agenda perhaps the most transformative change of all is on trade reform where we re addressing chronic problems that have been ignored tolerated or enabled for decades our leaders did nothing about what happened to us on trade before i was elected china s predatory practices were undermining trade for everyone but no one did anything about it except allow it to keep getting worse and worse and worse under my leadership america confronted the problem head on under our new phase one agreement phase two is starting negotiations very shortly china has agreed to substantially do things that they would not have done measures to protect intellectual property stop forced technology transfers remove trade barriers in agricultural goods and on agricultural goods where we were treated so badly open its financial sector totally that s done and maintain a stable currency all backed by very very strong enforcement our relationship with china right now has probably never been better we went through a very rough patch but it s never ever been better my relationship with president xi is an extraordinary one he s for china i m for the u s but other than that we love each other additionally china will spend an additional 200 billion over two years on american services agriculture and energy and manufactured goods so we ll be taking in an excess of 200 billion could be closer to 300 billion when it finishes but these achievements would not have been possible without the implementation of tariffs which we had to use and we re using them on others too and that is why most of our tariffs on china will remain in place during the phase two negotiations for the most part the tariffs have been left and we re being paid billions and billions of dollars a year as a country as i mentioned earlier we ended the nafta disaster one of the worst trade deals ever made not even close and replaced it with the incredible new trade deal the usmca that s mexico and canada in the nearly 25 years after nafta the united states lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs including nearly 1 in 4 vehicle manufacturing jobs it was an incentive to leave the country the nafta agreement exemplified the decades long failures of the international trading system the agreement shifted wealth to the hands of a few promoted massive outsourcing drove down wages and shuttered plants and factories by the thousands the plants would leave our country make the product sell it into our country we ended up with no jobs and no taxes would buy other countries product that doesn t happen anymore this is the wreckage that i was elected to clean up it s probably the reason i ran for president more than any other thing because i couldn t understand why we were losing all of these jobs to other countries at such a rapid rate and it got worse and worse and i think it s probably the primary reason that i ran but there are other reasons also and to replace with a new system that puts workers before the special interests and the special interests will do just fine but the workers come first our brand new usmca is the result of the broadest coalition ever assembled for a trade agreement manufacturing agriculture and labor all strongly endorsed the deal and as you know it just passed in congress overwhelmingly it shows how to solve the 21st century challenge we all face protecting intellectual property expanding digital trade re shoring lost jobs and ensuring rising wages and living standards the united states has also concluded a great new trade deal with japan approximately 40 billion and completely renegotiated our deal with south korea we re also negotiating many other transactions with many other countries and we look forward to negotiating a tremendous new deal with the united kingdom they have a wonderful new prime minister and wants very much to make a deal as they say to protect our security and our economy we are also boldly embracing american energy independence the united states is now by far the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far it s not even close while many european countries struggle with crippling energy costs the american energy revolution is saving american families 2 500 every year in lowering electric bills and numbers that people said couldn t happen and also very importantly prices at the pump we ve been so successful that the united states no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations with an abundance of american natural gas now available our european allies no longer have to be vulnerable to unfriendly energy suppliers either we urge our friends in europe to use america s vast supply and achieve true energy security with u s companies and researchers leading the way we are on the threshold of virtually unlimited reserves of energy including from traditional fuels lng clean coal next generation nuclear power and gas hydrate technologies at the same time i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years we re committed to conserving the majesty of god s creation and the natural beauty of our world today i m pleased to announce the united states will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the world economic forum one trillion trees applause and in doing so we will continue to show strong leadership in restoring growing and better managing our trees and our forests this is not a time for pessimism this is a time for optimism fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse they are the heirs of yesterday s foolish fortune tellers and i have them and you have them and we all have them and they want to see us do badly but we don t let that happen they predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s mass starvation in the 70s and an end of oil in the 1990s these alarmists always demand the same thing absolute power to dominate transform and control every aspect of our lives we will never let radical socialists destroy our economy wreck our country or eradicate our liberty america will always be the proud strong and unyielding bastion of freedom in america we understand what the pessimists refuse to see that a growing and vibrant market economy focused on the future lifts the human spirit and excites creativity strong enough to overcome any challenge any challenge by far the great scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century from penicillin to high yield wheat to modern transportation and breakthrough vaccines have lifted living standards and saved billions of lives around the world and we re continuing to work on things that you ll be hearing about in the near future that even today sitting here right now you wouldn t believe it s possible that we have found the answers you ll be hearing about it but we have found answers to things that people said would not be possible certainly not in a very short period of time but the wonders of the last century will pale in comparison to what today s young innovators will achieve because they are doing things that nobody thought even feasible to begin we continue to embrace technology not to shun it when people are free to innovate millions will live longer happier healthier lives for three years now america has shown the world that the path to a prosperous future begins with putting workers first choosing growth and freeing entrepreneurs to bring their dreams to life for anyone who doubts what is possible in the future we need only look at the towering achievements of the past only a few hundred miles from here are some of the great cities of europe teeming centers of commerce and culture each of them is full of reminders of what human drive and imagination can achieve centuries ago at the time of the renaissance skilled craftsmen and laborers looked upwards and built the structures that still touch the human heart to this day some of the greatest structures in the world have been built hundreds of years ago in italy the citizens once started construction on what would be a 140 year project the duomo of florence an incredible incredible place while the technology did not yet exist to complete their design city fathers forged ahead anyway certain that they would figure it out someday these citizens of florence did not accept limits to their high aspirations and so the great dome was finally built in france another century long project continues to hold such a grip on our hearts and our souls that even 800 years after its construction when the cathedral of notre dame was engulfed in flames last year such a sad sight to watch unbelievable site especially for those of us that considered it one of the great great monuments and representing so many different things the whole world grieved though her sanctuary now stands scorched and charred and a sight that s hard to believe when you got used to it to look at it now hard to believe but we know that notre dame will be restored will be restored magnificently the great bells will once again ring out for all to hear giving glory to god and filling millions with wonder and awe the cathedrals of europe teach us to pursue big dreams daring adventures and unbridled ambitions they urge us to consider not only what we build today but what we will endure long after we are gone they testify to the power of ordinary people to realize extraordinary achievements when united by a grand and noble purpose so together we must go forward with confidence determination and vision we must not be timid or meek or fearful but instead we must boldly seize the day and embrace the moment we have so many great leaders in this room not only business leaders but leaders of nations and some are doing such a fantastic job we work together very closely we will draw strength from the glories of the past and we will make greatness our common mission for the future together we will make our nations stronger our countries safer our culture richer our people freer and the world more beautiful than ever before above all else we will forever be loyal to our workers our citizens and our families the men and women who are

the washington post spoke for more than an hour with venezuelan president nicolás maduro on friday at the miraflores presidential palace in caracas in the first interview with a major us media outlet since last february maduro made an appeal to the us ruling elite to agree to a rapprochement the newspaper states that maduro suggested that a bonanza could be waiting for u s oil companies in this opec member state should president trump lift sanctions and press the reset button on u s venezuelan relations according to maduro previous approaches to donald trump including a call in 2018 with republican politician peter sessions in which trump s personal lawyer rudolph giuliani listened in were limited both trump and maduro confirmed last august that their top officials were holding talks while us special envoy for venezuela elliott abrams offered amnesty to maduro if he left power if there s respect between governments no matter how big the united states is and if there s a dialogue an exchange of truthful information then be sure we can create a new type of relationship maduro told the post he framed the talks as an opportunity for a win win situation considering relations in 5 10 years and the rest of the 21st century this marks the most direct appeal made by maduro to the white house and american corporate interests since his 2018 re election was not recognized by washington which soon after launched a regime change operation led by legislator juan guaidó maduro s appeals demonstrate the bourgeois character of his government which defends the property and interests of venezuelan capitalists whose businesses ultimately depend on access to us and european markets and credit in a lame attempt to proclaim his independence maduro then played down the importance of the sanctions and told the post do you want me to tell you the truth i don t care even a little about what europe does or about what the u s does however this didn t prevent him from protesting that trump has had terrible advisers on venezuela building on august 2017 sanctions on trading venezuelan bonds affecting the oil industry the us imposed draconian sanctions on the venezuelan state oil company pdvsa in january 2019 and a virtual economic embargo on any deals with the venezuelan government in august the center for economic and policy research attributed tens of thousands of deaths to the sanctions the un reports also show an accelerated pace of migration during this period with over 4 8 million venezuelans leaving the country since 2015 at one point in the interview maduro referred to 15 foreign partners in oil production and transportation that have saved the economy from total collapse not only is one of these partners the us based chevron which has received sanctions waivers to continue its partnership with pdvsa but the us treasury has avoided sanctioning the russian firm rosneft the chinese state owned cnpc and several indian firms inasmuch as proceeds are used to repay debts as a result the six year free fall of the venezuelan economy has begun to slow oil exports jumped in november december 2019 to levels not seen since last february on the other hand hyperinflation has also begun to slow down largely due to an informal dollarization of the economy openly promoted by maduro who called it an escape valve according to the firm ecoanalítica 53 percent of transactions at the end of 2019 occurred in us dollars this dollarization which is aimed at generating confidence to attract foreign investments is greatly increasing class tensions working families have opted to hold dollars but most wages and social spending is issued in worthless bolivares last week public school teachers carried out strikes and demonstrations in caracas demanding dollar wages these actions were reportedly repressed by pro maduro paramilitary groups the opposition led trade union national coalition has sought to channel growing social opposition behind guaidó leading maduro to intensify the repression the coalition has denounced the disappearance since wednesday of the general secretary of the venezuelan teachers federation and member of the right wing popular will party rené zapata and his wife moreover quinn markwith an economist with capital economics commented if dollarization is done as in ecuador inflation in venezuela would slow down but while the current government is in power this is unlikely to be an option as it requires discipline and a balanced budget no one should doubt maduro s political will to keep the venezuelan deficit down through austerity his administration has already imposed the greatest drop in living standards in the country s history in what amounts to capitalist shock therapy and suppressed popular opposition through severe repression caracas has already used the economic crisis as a pretext to allow foreign corporations to directly exploit and sell venezuelan oil any win win situation between us imperialism and venezuela s ruling circles represented by maduro would be based on continued attacks upon and the super exploitation of the extremely impoverished venezuelan workers and a greater sacking of the country s energy and mineral resources however washington has so far continued to escalate pressure against the maduro government us secretary of state mike pompeo met with guaidó at an anti terrorism conference in bogotá colombia on monday and vowed further action to oust maduro the us state department also recently filed a report accusing russian bots and the venezuelan government of sparking the recent wave of mass protests in south america ultimately us imperialism is moving with increasing lawlessness and desperation as demonstrated by the killing of iranian general qassem suleimani to defend its geopolitical hegemony against its main rivals russia and china as well as their allies like tehran and caracas maduro noted to the washington post that several military officials including defense minister vladimir padrino acted as turncoats to keep him informed of the failed coup launched on april 30 at the time guaidó unsuccessfully called for a military rebellion against maduro on january 5 maduro s united socialist party psuv installed luis parra to replace guaidó as president of the national assembly while using the national guard to prevent the pro guaidó camp from entering the building the following day elliott abrams promised more american help to the forces of freedom adding we have some funds that we can use for the national assembly the usaid indicates on its website that it has spent 467 million in helping the opposition since 2017 including a 128 million deal reached last october for aiding the transition to democracy the opposition lawmakers held a parallel session on january 5 to re elect guaidó effectively splitting the legislature and maintaining the us sponsored shadow government waiting to be installed by a coup last wednesday the pro guaidó legislators held another parallel session at an amphitheater when armed thugs reportedly attacked their convoy as it entered the national assembly the opposition has since called for anti maduro demonstrations and appealed to the venezuelan military without eliciting any significant response defying a travel ban guaidó sneaked out of venezuela and was received with full presidential honors by colombian far right president iván duque guaidó plans to travel to the world economic forum in davos switzerland to appeal to the world s oligarchs and then to meet european union authorities in brussels seeing his popular support plummet guaidó is undoubtedly planning new provocations however doubts are growing in imperialist circles about guaidó responding to recent developments forbes wrote in a piece titled with guaido out who will be washington s president of venezuela now washington will either have to recognize maduro as venezuela s leader recognize parra or painstakingly stick with guaido who has failed to convince the rank and file of the venezuelan military to jump the psuv ship a january 10 article in the london based financial times comments that guaidó has little real clout and that recent maneuvers by guaidó and maduro seem to have only a limited impact on the lives of ordinary venezuelans as maduro s overtures to imperialism and right wing policies make clear workers and youth in venezuela must oppose all factions of the bourgeoisie and mobilize against austerity and the threat of war by orienting to the global upsurge of the class struggle on the basis of an internationalist and socialist program

angola and south africa the three largest economies in the region growth was subdued in 2019 remaining well below historical averages and contracting for a fifth consecutive year on a per capita basis subdued growth in nigeria in 2019 was largely blamed on the government s macroeconomic policy and the country s business environment which according to the world bank were not conducive activity in nigeria was lacklustre as both macroeconomic policy and the business environment remain un conducive to strong domestic demand growth in 2019 is estimated to have remained broadly unchanged at two per cent as the agricultural sector continued to underperform due to lingering insurgency in the north east and farmers herdsmen clashes while unreliable electricity supply constrained manufacturing activity the report however noted that some of the weaknesses in the nigerian economy in 2019 were offset by increased oil production growth in sub saharan africa is projected to firm to 2 9 per cent in 2020 and strengthen to 3 2 per cent in 2021 22 a notably weaker projection than previous ones however the bank noted that the projected growth would depend on factors such as improved investor confidence in some large economies in the region as well as a pick up in oil production and robust growth among exporters of agricultural commodities nonetheless these growth rates will be insufficient to make significant progress in reducing poverty in many countries in the region highlighting the need for lasting improvements in labour productivity to bolster growth over the medium term the report observed the forecast for 2020 22 was lower than previously projected by 0 4 percentage points reflecting weaker demand from key trading partners lower commodity prices and adverse domestic developments in several countries on a per capita basis the outlook translated into a growth of 0 3 per cent in 2020 in sub saharan africa firming to an average of 0 7 per cent in 2021 22 but the report also stated that per capita income is expected to contract among some of the largest economies that account for one thirds of the region s poor namely nigeria angola and sudan you may also like expert warns against cooking with firewood assessing risks faced by sub saharan african countries in 2020 the report warned that decreased demand by major trading partners such as china the euro area and the united states would substantially lower export revenues and investment it added that government s debt in the region was expected to reach 62 per cent of gdp on average in 2020 up from 39 per cent of gdp in 2011 this broad based rise in government s debt has led to sharp increases in interest burden crowding out non interest expenditure and raising concerns about debt sustainability the bank noted also the report observed that insecurity conflicts and insurgencies would weigh on economic activity and food security in several economies including nigeria if they were to intensify

queue now i ll turn the call over to jeff jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer thank you abu and good morning everyone 2019 solidified the pivot from growth to capital discipline in north america and marked another step on the road to recovery in the international markets i m pleased with the way the halliburton team executed our value proposition delivered exceptional safety and service quality and stayed focused on generating healthy returns and strong free cash flow i thank our outstanding halliburton employees for their hard work and execution the entire year 2020 opens a new decade and a new century for halliburton it brings new opportunities that i will address in a few minutes but first some headlines for the full year and fourth quarter of 2019 we finished 2019 with total company revenue of 22 billion and adjusted operating income of 2 1 billion i am pleased with the continued recovery in our international business we increased revenue 10 outgrowing the international rig count for the second year in a row north america revenue declined 18 as a result of customer activity and pricing reductions and our decision to focus on those customers that provide the best returns systematically improving our service delivery immediate cost reductions and the growth in non frac product lines allowed us to stem the margin erosion we delivered over 900 million of free cash flow for the full year demonstrating our ability to generate consistent free cash flow throughout different business environments finally 2019 was an exceptional year for our safety and service quality performance our total recordable incident rate and non productive time both improved by over 20 historical bests across our business this is a result of our employees continued commitment to safety and process execution and now a few points about the fourth quarter we finished the quarter with total company revenue of 5 2 billion a 6 sequential decrease and adjusted operating income of 546 million an increase of 2 quarter over quarter our completion production division revenue declined 13 sequentially and operating margin remained essentially flat our drilling evaluation division delivered a strong quarter we grew revenue 4 and improved operating margins 300 basis points sequentially d e international margins grew significantly offset by margin decline in north america while our north america business declined due to the significantly lower activity in us land internationally we delivered 10 revenue growth this quarter this underscores the versatility and global reach of our business in the fourth quarter we took a 2 2 billion largely non cash impairment charge and made strategic decisions to market for sale our pipeline services and well controlled product lines as i mentioned 2020 brings plenty of opportunities the oil price is more constructive as we enter the year the imminent global recession fears have abated with the help of economic easing from the leading central banks us production growth is slowing because of constricted capital flows the increase in non us non opec supply coming into the market is limited the geopolitical instability in the key oil producing region of the world should add an incremental risk premium to the commodity prices in the near term that said oil prices are still supported by the opec cut and will fluctuate based on the group s resolve to continue limiting production gas prices in the us are below breakeven levels us drilling and completions activity may be biased lower due to the consolidation and restricted access to capital halliburton is no stranger to navigating choppy waters we entered 2020 and our next century with a clear sense of purpose we will continue to do what we do best collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize our customer s asset value while generating industry leading returns and sustainable cash flow for our shareholders we will do this with attention to the sustainability of our business minimizing environmental impact and acting as a responsible corporate citizen the international markets presented plenty of growth opportunities in 2019 we grew revenue 10 year over year closing stronger than anticipated all regions increased revenue led by asia pacific latin america and europe both our divisions meaningfully contributed to the international growth completion production led the charge with 13 expansion due to higher activity in mature fields in europe and unconventionals in argentina the uae and australia drilling evaluation grew international revenues 8 as we increased activity levels in all markets specifically in norway mexico china and nigeria in 2020 we expect the international spend by our customers to increase by mid single digits making it the third consecutive year of spending growth we have the right footprint and an enhanced technology portfolio to compete and win across the international markets we expect to grow at or above the market rate this year consistently focusing on profitable growth and improving our international margins continued gas activity expansion in the middle east resolution of political issues in latin america and several pending project awards may enable us to outgrow the market again in 2020 our drilling evaluation division is poised to grow faster as we get the benefit of the full year in our norway integrated contracts the icruise directional drilling platform rollout continues and new offshore drilling activity starts up around the world the international revenue growth should follow the historical cyclicality in the first quarter we expect international revenue to decline due to normal seasonality and the elimination of year end sales thereafter we should see steady growth that would peak in the fourth quarter this year we expect to increase our international margins we anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the north sea and asia pacific our project pipeline is strong and the incremental activity will help tighten tool availability and absorb the existing cost structure we intend to be prudent with capital allocation driving our organization to have the right pricing discussions with customers given the tool tightness in some product lines and geographies we are strategically reallocating assets to the best returning opportunities pricing in certain international regions is improving and we expect this momentum to continue throughout 2020 about one third of our book of business is awarded every year the remaining two thirds are existing contracts and contract extensions we re gaining pricing traction on new work and contract renewals and we re making strategic choices about the work we pursue i believe the capital and pricing discipline across all geographies will allow halliburton to deliver rational returns driven growth in the international markets turning to north america the us shale industry is facing its biggest test since the 2015 downturn with both capital discipline and slowing leading edge efficiency gains weighing down activity and production as expected in the fourth quarter customer activity declined across all basins of north america land affecting both our drilling and completions businesses the rig count in us land contracted 11 sequentially and completed stages had the largest drop we have seen in recent history while holidays and weather were the usual factors other reasons for this air pocket inactivity included our customers free cash flow generation commitment and an oversupplied gas market with this backdrop halliburton followed our playbook and continued to proactively manage our fleet count as announced last quarter we also proactively cut costs and started the implementation of the strategy to sustainably improve our service delivery those actions allowed us to curb margin declines in north america and deliver lower detrimentals year on year even though the industry s sequential activity drop was much more severe than in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter the market saw clear public evidence of the long awaited equipment attrition this is just the beginning we believe a lot more equipment will exit the market as lower demand increasing service intensity and insufficient returns take their toll as service companies cannibalize idle equipment for parts and use sidelined pumps to beef up working fleets the available horsepower supply in the market may be smaller than some think halliburton has continued doing what we said we were doing stacking equipment to improve our returns we exited 2019 with 22 less available fracturing horsepower we ve rationalized our equipment supply to the anticipated level of demand in 2020 the size and scale of our business in north america give us the ability to right size without sacrificing our market leadership position and the value that comes with it in the fourth quarter we started the implementation of our 300 million annualized cost savings and service delivery improvement strategy we moved quickly to execute the initial personnel reductions and real estate rationalization all with an eye to improving on our near term financial performance we ve achieved about 200 million in savings on a run rate basis in the fourth quarter while this impacts our business globally the majority of the savings are geared toward north america we are looking at 2020 with pragmatism early indications are that our us land customers will reduce capital spending approximately 10 from 2019 levels i believe that the current level of ducs in the market will allow operators to spend less money on new well construction and direct more of it to completions depressed gas pricing is negatively affecting the activity outlook in the gassy basins which will likely bear the brunt of the activity reductions in 2020 in the first quarter operators will reload their budgets and we expect modest improvement in completions activity as a result that said the calendar cadence where some operators are biased to spend more earlier in the year will likely remain halliburton will continue to be proactive in taking actions to generate industry leading returns and strong free cash flow in this environment here are the more significant actions after systematically rationalizing equipment in 2019 to adjust to changing activity levels in 2020 we plan to provide the capacity that maximizes the returns on our overall fleet this should also allow us to be efficient about our workforce and maintenance planning and to achieve higher utilization of existing fleets throughout the year pricing pressure was considerable during the year end tendering season consistent with our capital disciplined approach we ve taken on contracts that are expected to allow our portfolio to earn acceptable returns and decline those that are not i like the slice of the market that we re choosing to participate in this year our high graded customer portfolio gives us confidence in a more sustainable demand level and a mix of pricing and volume that generates returns for halliburton make no mistake we will continue developing technologies whose value accrues to halliburton and not just to our customers our integrated completions offering and the icruise rotary steerable system are prime examples of such technologies they should allow us to reduce our capital outlay and deliver better margins all with the purpose of generating strong returns we plan to continue strategically growing our share of services per well by increasing the competitiveness of our non hydraulic fracturing businesses in north america our wireline and perforating artificial lift and specialty chemical product lines all posted strong double digit revenue growth in 2019 despite the overall market softness in us land we intend to keep this momentum and spread it to other services finally we will continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy halliburton is redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services in order to lower our unit cost and improve margins and returns in the long run 2019 closed the decade of the shale revolution that transformed the united states into the world s top hydrocarbon producer halliburton was an early participant in this development and has been investing in it and innovating ever since hand in hand with our customers as unconventionals enter maturation phase halliburton is committed to the north american market and taking appropriate actions to thrive in the new environment i ll now turn the call over to lance to provide more details on our financial results then i will return to discuss digitalization a topic that will define the next decade for our industry lance lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jeff and good morning let s begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2019 total company revenue for the quarter was 5 2 billion a decrease of 6 and adjusted operating income was 546 million an increase of 2 during the fourth quarter we recognized 2 2 billion of pre tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions these charges consisted largely of non cash asset impairments mostly associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment they also included approximately 100 million of cash costs primarily related to severance as a result of the charge in the fourth quarter we recognized a benefit of approximately 35 million from a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense which reflects two months of dd a impact the after tax impact of this reduction in the fourth quarter is approximately 0 03 of eps of which 0 02 is included in our completion production results and the remainder in drilling evaluation numbers as jeff mentioned we ve also accomplished a significant portion of our intended annualized cost reductions with the remainder to come in the first quarter let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail in our completion production division revenue was 3 1 billion while operating income was 387 million both decreased 13 reduced activity and pricing in multiple product service lines primarily associated with stimulation services in north america land coupled with lower activity for stimulation services in latin america and well intervention services in the middle east drove our results these declines were partially offset by higher pressure pumping activity in the eastern hemisphere coupled with year end completion tool sales globally in our drilling evaluation division revenue was 2 1 billion an increase of 4 while operating income was 224 million an increase of 49 these results were primarily driven by increased activity in all product service lines in the middle east asia coupled with higher drilling activity in europe africa cis and year end software sales globally these improvements were partially offset by lower drilling activity in north america and reduced testing activity in latin america moving on to our geographical results in north america revenue was 2 3 billion a 21 decrease this decline was mainly due to lower activity and pricing in north america land primarily associated with pressure pumping and well construction this decline was partially offset by higher year end completion tool sales in the gulf of mexico in latin america revenue was 598 million a 2 decrease resulting primarily from lower activity in multiple product service lines in argentina coupled with decreased testing activity across the region these results were partially offset by higher activity for all product service lines in colombia increased project management activity and cloud infrastructure installations in mexico and higher year end completion tool sales across the region turning to europe africa cis revenue was 883 million a 6 increase resulting primarily from increased well construction activity in the north sea coupled with increased activity in multiple product service lines in algeria these improvements were partially offset by lower pipeline services across the region in middle east asia revenue was 1 4 billion a 19 increase sequentially largely resulting from increased activity in multiple product service lines across the middle east india and china higher pressure pumping activity in australasia and higher year end completion tool sales across the region these results were partially offset by lower well intervention services in the middle east in the fourth quarter our corporate other expense totaled 65 million and we expect it to be the same in the first quarter of 2020 net interest expense for the quarter was 141 million and should remain approximately the same for the first quarter our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 22 based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix we expect our 2020 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 21 with the projected full year tax rate of approximately 23 we earned approximately 1 2 billion of cash from operations during the fourth quarter as expected we improved our working capital and generated strong free cash flow of approximately 827 million for the quarter delivering approximately 1 billion of free cash flow for the full year excluding the cash impact of the restructuring charges i discussed earlier as a result we ended the year with 2 3 billion in cash capital expenditures during the quarter were 340 million with our 2019 full year capex ending just above 1 5 billion as we look ahead to this year we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by approximately 20 to 1 2 billion we believe this level of spend will still allow us to invest in our anticipated international growth while continuing to rationalize our business to the current market conditions in north america within this reduced capex budget we will continue investing in and growing our production group businesses namely constructing a chemical manufacturing plant in saudi arabia and expanding our artificial lift footprint we will also move forward with the icruise system global rollout but at a more normalized pace than what we accomplished over the last couple of years our digital efforts and new technologies aimed at improving our efficiency and reducing our operating costs will also get an appropriate share of spend we believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors regardless of the market environment finally let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out as is typical our results will be subject to weather related seasonality and the roll off of year end sales which will mostly impact our international business north america will see a modest increase in completions activity as jeff described earlier we will continue to pull the levers that allow us to mitigate margin declines across the business this quarter as such in our completion production division we expect sequential revenue to increase 2 to 4 with margins declining 125 to 150 basis points for our drilling evaluation division we anticipate sequential revenue will decline 4 to 6 with margins decreasing 200 to 250 basis points i ll now turn the call back over to jeff jeff jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer thanks lance one of the key trends that will define the new decade in our industry is digitalization the next 10 years will see digital technologies and artificial intelligence going mainstream just like the smartphones did in the last decade in the oil and gas industry digitalization unlocks the potential to structurally lower costs shorten the time to first oil increase optionality in exploration and production and enhance performance across the entire value chain digital is not a separate strategy at halliburton rather it is an integral part of our value proposition our ability to collaborate engineer solutions and maximize customers asset value is evolving through the seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations digital permeates everything we do and has the same goal as our business strategy deliver value for our customers and returns for our shareholders at halliburton we are hard at work on the next frontier solutions that will shift the balance in the people process technology triad by replacing labor and reducing capital investments through automation and self learning processes we believe this will allow us to harness the transformative power of digitalization and make a quantum leap in productivity similar to going from horses to horsepower it takes time to build the scalable software and hardware infrastructure required to fully capitalize on digital solutions we re well along that path and have been building up our digital capabilities for a number of years with a long term view of how digitization will evolve i m pleased with the internal and customer adoption we re seeing halliburton is in a unique position to reap the benefits of the industry s move toward digitalization our landmark product line is an established leader in petrotechnical software with a powerful cloud enabled decisionspace 365 software platform in 2019 the cloud native software was our fastest growing business within landmark increasing revenues 50 year over year landmark provides us a solid foundation established through decades of investment in software development people domain expertise and processes to create and scale digital solutions this benefits all of our product lines in addition we have strategic partnerships with accenture microsoft aws and schneider electric all of which validate and expand both our vision and our capabilities we now have over 100 customers with thousands of users across the globe leveraging our ienergy digital ecosystem to integrate software and workflows across their organizations regardless if they re halliburton s third party or internally developed this open architecture platform is unique in the industry and in our view is the necessary condition for the successful adoption and scaling of digital solutions true to our dna we are also bringing to market practical smart and interconnected products and services that help unlock value for us and our customers we re pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding well construction and reservoir recovery let me spend a few minutes on each first we transformed subsurface understanding using big data digital frameworks and evergreen models we ve created a unique geological model of the entire earth to provide insights into the origin and productivity of reservoirs once drilling starts we deliver improved field measurements with next generation wireline and logging while drilling tools fiber and sensors we then translate these measurements into faster and more informed decision making using a new class of models made possible by digital technologies for example our earthstar ultra deep resistivity sensor automatically feeds into our industry first scalable earth model that updates in real time customers can now make faster decisions about their development programs and reduce cycle times by a factor of 10 second we improve well construction through collaborative well engineering and drilling automation landmark s digital well program enables seamless collaboration between operators and service companies across a multitude of software platforms the icruise drilling system increases the number of built in sensors by a factor of 5 and offers self guiding capabilities working with our rig partners our digital twin technology delivers better collaboration and faster decision making all of these solutions boost efficiencies and lower costs while demanning the process of well construction last but not least we improved recovery and production by using our digitally enabled tools to connect customers assets and leveraging this to monitor and enhance performance outcomes in completions we use our intelligent completions for monitoring production trends and connecting them to broader reservoir management studies in artificial lift we leveraged digital to monitor esp health and extend run life in stimulation we use our industry leading fracture modeling software and full scale asset simulator to model fracture propagation and frac hits these are examples of how we deliver digital innovation today with a focus on specific domains and aligned with the customers buying behavior they provide immediate value to customers increased customer loyalty and generate returns for halliburton over time we believe digitalization will seamlessly connect subsurface drilling and production enabling customers to make asset level decisions at the speed of execution we have a solid foundation the tools the open architecture and the domain expertise to successfully deliver this vision let me summarize what we ve talked about today in 2020 halliburton is focused on delivering margin expansion industry leading returns and strong free cash flow in our view international growth will continue increased activity disciplined capital allocation pricing improvements and our ability to compete for a larger share of high margin services we believe will lead to international margin expansion in 2020 as north america customer spending declines again this year halliburton will continue to execute our playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow we plan to provide the service capacity that we believe will maximize the returns on our overall fleet continue to invest in technologies that improve margins keep strategically growing our non hydraulic fracturing product service lines and continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy we believe digitalization will define this decade in our industry halliburton continues to move full steam ahead on the digital journey and is uniquely positioned to reap its benefits and now let s open it up for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of james west with evercore isi your line is now open james west evercore isi analyst hey good morning jeff good morning lance jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer good morning james james west evercore isi analyst so jeff toward the end of your prepared comments you ve talked a lot about international and international margin progression i wondered if we could dig into a little more detail there with mid single digit it sounds like growth you may be able to outpace that a touch here as well plus you re seeing some pockets of pricing strength how should we think about the margin expansion as we go through the year what type of incrementals should we be expecting jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yeah well thanks james look i think i spent a fair amount of time on the catalysts themselves obviously activity improving rational project choices and technologies i think the key is it s going to be shaped we re starting at a higher point going into q1 than we certainly did last year and then i would expect the shape of that to look similar where we start and it moves up a little just that shape of the international margins should stay consistent but obviously starting from a hard point james west evercore isi analyst okay okay fair enough and then maybe for lance here on the free cash flow next year looks like it s going to be pretty significant based on some growth but also lower capex here how should we think about when we re going to see the free cash flow start to show up will it be similar to this year or it should be backend loaded or would it be more even throughout the year lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah look i think you re right in terms of the expectations to grow free cash flow this year you re right around the i don t think that the our ability to drive sort of the working capital consumption is going to remain in the first half of the year like it has historically for us i expect some of the extreme volatility that we saw last year to not repeat this year but there still is a consumption of cash from a working capital perspective but overall with the reduction in capex the improvement around margins and some stability around our working capital we expect free cash flow to grow in 2020 james west evercore isi analyst good thanks guys lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from sean meakim with jpmorgan your line is now open sean meakim jpmorgan analyst hey good morning jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer good morning sean meakim jpmorgan analyst so you touched on the margin progression internationally can you maybe just talk about how that translates into d e in 2020 so we had the margin ramp in 4q maybe 70 basis points or so comes from the d e benefit that will help year on year in 20 but can we see 2020 margins on a full year basis get back to 2017 2018 levels do we think we can get back to a double digit type of outcome for the year and i m just curious how you think investors will get comfortable with the trajectory like that just given it s been a difficult business to forecast last couple of years jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yeah sean it has been difficult to forecast but we ve done a lot of things during that time so the platform around our icruise technology and earthstar has been rolling out at the same time we re seeing international a lot of international choppiness now we see some recovery sort of happening which obviously lends itself toward d e and so i think these are multi year efforts that we and we view them that way i d say digital as well will contribute to probably early days to d e so for all of those reasons i don t think it s unreasonable also to expect that we get back to i think 2018 looking kind of number or beyond sean meakim jpmorgan analyst got it okay thank you for that and then so on the digital strategy competitors made a lot more noise about their strategy maybe than you have so far but the repsol contracts sound pretty similar in terms of the offering could you maybe just expand a little bit in terms of the scalability that you see for those types of avenues maybe across a broader set of customers and where you see the most opportunity jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think i tried to describe today our vision around digital and then the mechanics for realizing that vision which then quickly becomes in today s market what are the things we actually do so i used an example of some of the tools that are in the market as we integrate those obviously the moat expands around those so i think it will take many forms over time again it will be big projects which we ve talked about a few of those where it s either a cloud infrastructure and the cloud environment that we either install or operate and we ve got examples of each of those but equally important will be the day in day out march around how this work really gets done which is around drilling production and reservoir filling in those spaces with tools that all contribute to that vision and so i think that there is a lot of scalability here and i think what s most important is really the production capital that halliburton has invested in landmark that really makes it scalable in fact to do these things at scale there s a lot of discipline and practice and agile devops that are required at scale to reliably develop software and then operate maintain and then ultimately continue to advance and we have that so i m really confident in how that rolled out over the longer term and i think the thing to focus on is what are those tools that we re doing now that deliver returns obviously they contribute to the vision sean meakim jpmorgan analyst got it very helpful thank you jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of angie sedita with goldman sachs your line is now open angie sedita goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning guys jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer good morning angie angie sedita goldman sachs analyst so jeff on c p specific to north america could you talk a little bit about the cost cutting that s unwinding here you said you have a 100 million left is there more that could be done beyond that 100 million it s for jeff or lance and then maybe you could talk also about the pricing have you seen the market starting to stabilize on the frac side for pricing are you still seeing pressure in frac and across the other product lines jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thanks angie look the 300 million in savings and we ve moved quickly on that and i think the 200 million that we ve taken out on an annualized basis already expect to get the rest of that done in q1 and i think that really speaks to how that team in north america executes and we execute very quickly and with a lot of purpose and so obviously that contributes beyond that we ve talked about our playbook and how we expect to execute our strategy in north america and i think over time that continues to drive improvement in margins less concentrated in a moment but obviously a set of activities that yield value over time from a pricing standpoint it s still very it s competitive information obviously q4 was quite competitive and so i think the market in spite of attrition is still oversupplied what s important though is that we make our own choices around how to maximize fleet profitability and by virtue of doing that i view it as more stable in that respect lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer angie i might add a comment too on the 300 million in cost savings just to be clear too to add to jeff that s sort of cash structural savings jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yes angie sedita goldman sachs analyst okay okay thank you that s helpful and then maybe staying along the themes on pricing it s obviously the reverse internationally maybe you could talk a little bit or give more color on the pricing power or momentum you re seeing in the international markets is it fairly widespread is it by specific regions or product lines and do you think there could be a little bit of momentum going into 2020 or is it slow and steady jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer look i d more describe it as slow and steady angie and i think what the key is that the setup is constructive and so managing capital in a more prudent way focusing on profitable growth as opposed to growth all of those things conspire to create an environment where we re able to get better pricing is it widespread i d say it s generally widespread but there is probably pockets who are more concentrated than others sometimes driven by availability and complexity of work and things that would normally and rationally drive our pricing and so i think that s what we re seeing in the market and yes it is getting traction angie sedita goldman sachs analyst right thanks i ll turn it over operator our next question comes from bill herbert with simmons your line is now open bill herbert simmons co analyst thank you good morning lance you talked about it conceptually but i d like to kind of refine it if you will with regard to the discussion of the evolution of working capital for this year less pronounced seasonal trends you were a huge consumer cash working capital was in the first half of 2019 at a nice contributor to cash in the second half i m trying to kind of peg the order of magnitude of the reduction in cash consumption during the first half of this year versus the first half of last year lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think what you see bill is sort of a year over year comparison as we don t have i mean last year we were carrying a lot of inventory associated with the boost in the icruise rollout and in some of our c p product lines that i don t think that you see that consumption taking place again this year as we consume more of that inventory as opposed to build it the collection cycle is still going to be very similar albeit as the international business becomes a bigger part of our business that typically has longer dsos so we may see some impact there but still a view where we build receivables early in the year and then unwind those as we get into the later part of the year bill herbert simmons co analyst okay and so just to take a stab at it would you expect that your cash consumption from working capital in the first half of this year would run it like half of what it did in 2019 i mean is that a reasonable starting point lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer i think that s probably a reasonable starting point bill herbert simmons co analyst okay and then secondly again a lot of moving parts but it s kind of a 20 reduction in capex you should have better working capital improvement for this year net income should be up as well so at least from my numbers i m getting to kind of a free cash flow yield assuming a 24 stock price of kind of 7 to 8 which is getting pretty sporty and i m just curious with regards to priorities of the deployment of that surplus cash flow is it still a reduction of net debt first and foremost lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think it is i think with the excess cash i think we do have a near term priority on reducing debt the reality is bill is while we re focused on that debt reduction in the near term what it does and what it offers us as we continue to chip away at it is give us more flexibility to return cash to shareholders in the future and i think today our business we need to address the 3 8 billion of debt that we have coming due over the next six years so i think we ll do that do some of that in the near term but also with an eye on ultimately returning cash to shareholders bill herbert simmons co analyst okay thank you lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks bill jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer thanks bill operator our next question comes from scott gruber with citigroup your line is now open scott gruber citigroup analyst yes good morning jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer good morning scott scott gruber citigroup analyst kind of staying on a similar line of questioning lance you mentioned the 1 2 billion of capex in 2020 which is good to see could you just provide some color on how you think about the sustainability of capex around that level there is a few moving pieces year on year in 20 and there will be a few more in 21 in particular with the saudi chem supplying investment not recurring but just how should we think about kind of broad strokes on that level of capex and feel free to frame it as a percent of sales if it s easy jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yeah scott this is jeff i think the key is around prioritization and we are focused on the best returning opportunities but we were able to fund international growth in 2019 and expect with that level of capex can continue to fund the growth that we see in 2020 so it isn t that we are starving anything the reality is we re feeding things appropriately and around our return expectations we think about spending this year it s probably two thirds international a third us but in our view very sustainable and so we re comfortable with that level of capex and also what it means to making better returns lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would add in an environment in an increasing pricing environment that generates the appropriate returns we may spend more but it will be commensurate with the focus on returns and overall driving better free cash flow scott gruber citigroup analyst got it and then just a question circling back on the domestic frac market with pricing hopefully stabilizing here in early 2020 and jeff you had mentioned a focus on maximizing returns on the frac fleet but broad strokes does that strategy likely mean that your frac business trends with the market in 2020 or they had lagged the market to a degree in 2020 would be focused on returns how should we think about it jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think that it will yeah i would expect we stay consistent with the market but we don t feel like we have to just because we mostly focus on the returns and free cash flow out of that business but i wouldn t think we would be out of the market at any point in time but that said we re focused on the slice of customers that make the best returns for us which gets to a number of factors efficiency but also calendar cadence piece of spend this year going into q1 for example we re 95 committed on the fleet which is the best we ve been since the downturn scott gruber citigroup analyst got it appreciate the color thank you operator our next question comes from david anderson with barclays your line is now open david anderson barclays analyst hi good morning jeff going back to your comments on the digital side as we move beyond the proof of concept and it becomes more broadly accepted you kind of talked about sort of two different types of customers out there i guess as sort of maybe on the e p side as those who have kind of realized they can do themselves and you provide certain discrete operations different applications like you just mentioned on some of your tools on the other side you have other bigger broader customers which you can implement your ecosystem across the organization kind of the announcements you made today how do you see those two sets of customers evolving over the next let s say next several years is it fair to assume just kind of the former and then the former is the majority of that business and then hopefully it kind of evolves more into more the broader implementation can you just talk about how you see the customers acceptance jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yeah look i think customers do this at the pace at which they can digest it realistically and that is the reason why i think you see that bifurcation today it s more apparent just because customers that can actually operate and execute at that level of integration are fewer and far between today and i kind of view it that way it gets implemented at the pace it could be absorbed that s why i tend to talk about the vision and then bring it down to ok here are the more digestible groupings being drilling production and reservoir and then even down into the tools because the reality is number of these tool don t have to be integrated but they can be and they re more effective when integrated and so if i use a fairly simple example like in earthstar tool it s a tool it s metal it runs in the well it s fantastic tool but what s most important about it is the answer product which is the 3d inversion and now that 3d inversion becomes even more valuable when integrated in an earth model and likely yet again more valuable when integrated into the entire ecosphere but that s difficult for everyone to do that at one time and it s very hard to do that given sort of the proliferation of different systems so the key in my view is we continue to advance the platform the ecosystem as you described it while at the same time driving immediate returns around these tools and they re available to be integrated into that ecosystem i hope that s helpful david anderson barclays analyst that makes a lot of sense jeff thanks now the other side of digital here is that it appears to be deflationary to traditional oilfield services going forward your customers can do more with less would you agree with that and do you think that future digital revenue to halliburton presumably it comes at higher margins it s more sustainable can that more than offset this deflation over the next several years jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer i think it can because i think what s missing in this deflation discussion is the moat that comes in around our equipment that allows so much cost savings on the client side part of the business that we ll be able to reap better margins and better returns on those assets to deliver those solutions and obviously at the same time we ll likely be reducing our own costs as we work through this so i think it will be deflationary in some ways but i think the value and the returns on the not just the componentry but how that componentry is part of that ecosphere really widens the moat that may be isn t there is prevalent today but i think we ll see that widen and that ultimately drives better returns for us in spite of what might be deflationary in a number of other areas of the business david anderson barclays analyst thank you jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from chase mulvehill with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open chase mulvehill bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning i guess i want to come back to the capex question and ask it maybe a different way if we think about that 1 2 billion of capex what s the split between d e and c p lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah chase this is lance i would say that it s very similar to the 60 40 split that we talked about between nam and international is a good proxy chase mulvehill bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay so 60 c p is that what you re saying lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer no no no 60 d e chase mulvehill bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay all right if you re 40 i think that puts you sub 4 of c p revenues if we think about capex as a percentage of revenues obviously lower than kind of what you did in 2016 as a percentage of revenues if we look over the next couple of years and kind of call it a sluggish modest growth north america environment how should we think about c p capex over the next couple years and maybe frame it on a percentage of revenues lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah look i think structurally lower as we described it based more on the market and the opportunity set that we see but we re really careful not to we don t peg this to percents of revenues and others things because then when get sort of odd answers when we see markets growing and i don t think growth is geared that way to our capex necessarily and so we will continue to focus on the best returning opportunities where we see those but the idea that it s going to have to move the capex is going to move as a percentage with revenues is really not that s not how we approach them chase mulvehill bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that makes sense and then coming back to frac you talked about 22 less frac horsepower is that the amount that you ve actually retired or is that the amount that you ve actually taken out of the market from an active fleet reduction and then a quick one follow up to that you talked about improvement in frac utilization in 2020 for your active fleets do you care to kind of quantify that how much improvement in utilization across your active fleets you think you can get in 2020 lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer look i ll start with the first question the 22 that we described is out of the market sold by the pound retired but that s done some good things for us i mean the reality is that we re 90 q10s at this point our costs are lower our service quality is the best it s ever been so that s how we view that the activity i guess is as we look out at the balance of the year or in terms of utilization part of maximizing profitability of that fleet and the returns on that fleet is keeping it busy and as i described earlier we started the year 95 committed which is the best we ve been in sometimes so i m encouraged by that outlook based on the fleet that we have chase mulvehill bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay all right that s all i have three i ll turn back over thanks jeff jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from kurt hallead with rbc capital markets your line is now open kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst thank you hey good morning jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer good morning kurt kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst hey thanks for that great rundown i was kind of curious first and foremost on the international front when we look at 2020 where do you think the best relative growth prospects are for halliburton you mentioned that asia pac was a major contributor here in 19 so just kind of curious on how you see the regional dynamics play out for 2020 jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thanks kurt look i think it s again led by asia pac in 2020 europe cis continues to be strong as we get into a full year of activity on a number of the contracts we talked about in the past africa grows but it will be a bit more choppy as it works through exploration and regulatory sort of resetting in that market middle east remains robust but obviously starts at a fairly high point as the market itself and latam likely brings up the rear kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst okay appreciate that dynamic and then i just want to get a little bit better understanding here on just the guidance you provided for first quarter on the margin progressions for c p and d e and i want to try to get in this context for c p when you look at the margin degradation on a quarter on quarter basis could you give us some general sense of how much is that related to the absence of the tool sales versus market dynamics lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean kurt this is lance yes it s definitely impacted by just a non recurring nature of year end product sales in the c p division which were probably up 10 to 15 versus what we saw in 2018 so we had a good fourth quarter at our c p division in terms of year end equipment sales kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst okay and then can the same be said for d e lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer i m sorry i ll let you continue lance sorry no and then and that is obviously those margins are accretive so what we see replacing that in the first quarter in terms of activity largely in the resumption of our pressure pumping business in north america is coming at lower margins and so you see the offset of that in the guidance kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst okay can the same be said for d e lance loeffler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah same can be said for d e probably more comparative flattish year over year in terms of year end product sales in our d e division kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst that s great appreciate that incremental color thanks guys jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer thanks kurt operator the next question comes from the line of marc bianchi with cowen your line is now open marc bianchi cowen analyst thank you jeff you were talking about oversupply still in the frac market and with your retirements and what we ve heard from the others there has been a pretty significant reduction so far what do you think is needed from here to kind of balance the market and what do you think the timeline is for that jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer yeah look i think what s most important is that that attrition is real i get this question a lot and i think a quarter ago i said i thought it was 20 which was viewed as high turns out that s right in the fairway so that attrition is in fact occurring and the market forces or the forces that drove that attrition haven t changed at all in terms of amount of sand pumps number of stages per day all of those things that drive that attrition haven t changed and so i suspect we continue on a pace that s at least consistent with that as far as the timeline of when we see it it happens at some point it doesn t change the way we go to the market today and so we are so focused on delivering our strategy around cost reduction and our service delivery improvement that when that happens it will be terrific and we ll see a great boost from that but i think in the meantime we ve got a plan to deliver solid free cash flows and return sort of in any market marc bianchi cowen analyst okay thanks for that maybe somewhat related we ve got the guidance here for first quarter for c p margins which includes the full benefit of all the cost cutting you re doing where do you think those margins can get absent any kind of pricing recovery for the frac side of business is there just through the self help i think you re talking about a bogey that you would point to over the next number of quarters jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer look no i mean i think we ve provided guidance on q1 i view strategy as something that we executed and we continue to see the value and benefit from and so we re taking a very long view of this business and the actions that we re taking beyond q1 to continue to contribute and improve the business and i think that we will continue to outperform like we have the highest margins today in north america and we ll continue to add to that marc bianchi cowen analyst great thanks so much operator and that will conclude today s question and answer session i d like to turn the call back to mr miller for closing remarks jeff miller chairman president and chief executive officer thank you liz before we wrap up i d like to close with a few points first i expect that halliburton s international growth will continue in 2020 and that the combination of capital discipline pricing improvements and technology will lead to margin expansion second halliburton will continue executing our north america playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow and finally i believe digitalization will define the next decade and halliburton is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits look forward to talking to you again next quarter liz please close out the call

on a recent visit to los angeles former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg sat down with the los angeles times editorial board to talk about polarized politics electability and u s policy toward iran among other topics here is a transcript of the conversation edited for clarity nick goldberg editor of the editoral pages so hello thanks for coming in pete buttigieg thanks for having us over goldberg thanks for coming to el segundo you re here with mostly members of the editorial board and the opinion section this is norman pearlstine the editor of the paper other people are editorial writers i m nick goldberg i m the editorial page editor we re on the record this meeting is for the purpose of helping us do our thinking as we decide whom to endorse in advance of the march 3 primary and i guess if you d like to you can give us a minute or so of an opening statement before we start to barrage you with our questions advertisement buttigieg sounds good well i won t do that for too long but thanks again for having me over and let me simply say that i hope during the course of our conversation i can communicate first why i believe i m the best nominee to defeat donald trump but even more importantly the extent to which this is by definition an election for the president who will have to deal with life after trump and that this is an election about who can gather up the pieces of what has been broken and establish what i believe is the next era or will have to be the next era in american life and it s why i always begin my appearances asking voters to really picture that day when the sun comes up and donald trump s not the president not only because it s something to look forward to at least in my party and i think increasingly for a lot of independents and some republicans but also because it reminds us of what we re going to be up against and what we re going to need as a country to unify but also to deal with the big issues that have brought us to this point but i m sure we ll have a chance to cover that as we go goldberg thank you so i feel i should start with sort of an obligatory question but i think it s an important question and it s not one you haven t heard before but i hope you ll give us a thoughtful answer that is you were the mayor of a city of 100 000 people you re 37 years old you were in office for eight years you have no federal experience you have no statewide experience shouldn t a president have a background in legislating and governing and in foreign affairs is it not presumptuous and possibly even dangerous to just come in and assume you can do a job like this and haven t we just seen what happens when a person comes in and doesn t have the experience to do the job buttigieg well i d say the presidency is a leap for anyone i do believe it s important to have governing experience i would argue that while there is no job like the presidency i would also say there is no job in government like being the mayor of a city of any size and in particular of a community like ours one that was struggling with being called a dying city in national press when i took office where our per capita income was i think in the neighborhood of 18 000 when i took office where we had to figure out under very difficult conditions how to move forward and that the experience of a mayor is not only the policy experience that i think legislators spend most of their time and energy on but also management administration again especially in our strong mayor form where there s no such thing as a city manager for example building a government leading it and shaping it for the future advertisement but even more importantly than that on top of the policy on top of the administration the experience of being responsible for leading a population and calling that population to its highest values especially when it comes under stress you can be a very senior senator in the united states and depending on your experience before have perhaps never in your life managed more than 100 people and i think that the experience that you do get as mayor is just different from the admittedly washington establishment experience that people would be expected to have but i think that also americans are looking for a different kind of experience not different in the way that this president is different again i think it matters to have served in government i also think it matters to have served in uniform i m not suggesting that s a prerequisite i m saying that maybe this would be a good time for somebody who has the sense from personal experience of what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the situation room and so while everybody brings their particular blend of experience to the white house it s also the case that no one governs alone matter of fact that s one of the first things you learn as an executive in government the importance of building an administration capable of supporting you in that work advertisement lastly i would say that it s very much part of the purpose of my campaign that i come from a community that is maybe not the biggest certainly not the most famous city in america there s a lot of south bends out there and a lot of communities which by the way are communities full of people who would benefit from democratic policies but with which my party seems to have lost touch my county should be reliably blue last election it went right down the middle 50 50 and i think having a voice from a new generation yes but also from that middle of the country would be a good idea from a governing perspective and from the perspective of winning this election jon healey deputy editorial page editor how might you go about working with congress in a way that would be more successful than the last two presidents if you look at the experience that both president obama and president trump have had with congresses that are not controlled by their own party pete buttigieg well first of all as a democrat governing in indiana i pride myself on working across the aisle i m on my third republican governor we ve been able to work well on different things together even while we ve had very vigorous disagreements but even for that to work you have to have some level of good faith and i m not sure there s much good faith in the congressional gop right now in particular in the senate and there comes a point where if you cannot work with a legislator in good faith then you have to work around them to some extent advertisement what we have going for us even compared to what president obama had to work with 10 years ago is a powerful majority in favor of just about everything that i m calling for when you think about not just issues where democrats have generally been trusted wages the economy healthcare but areas where my party s been on defense immigration guns there is a powerful majority to do the right thing even in conservative states guns in particular i believe more than 80 of republicans think we should at least be doing background checks and so my point is we have reached a stage where republicans in congress are increasingly facing down not just democrats but their own constituents i think a good use of presidential time and resources is to be in the home states and districts of those members reminding their voters of the daylight between them and the people they represent which again is true even in conservative areas and conservative states and so while i haven t given up on the idea of a democratic majority in the senate and again i think electing a middle class midwestern veteran might help us establish the coattails to do that i would also say that no matter who s in control of the senate we have an opportunity to mobilize a powerful american majority provided we can hold it together and not blow it up which i think is a very important consideration in the democratic party right now advertisement mariel garza editorial writer so you re saying you think you can heal the partisan divide in a way that other candidates can t pete buttigieg well it s certainly maybe more a focus of my campaign than it is for some of my competitors and i think that bears out in the fact that at my events especially when we re in states where we visited trump counties a lot of obama trump counties that when i talk about wanting to call in what i call future former republicans to the coalition we re building a lot of people reveal themselves to be in that category i m not tricking them i m not pretending to be conservative we have a very bold progressive agenda but i think there s an understanding with many of them that even if we aren t going to agree on all the policies they re ready for a change and again my experience as mayor is that not everything has to be so tribal and so partisan and we need that priority and that attitude i think reflected in the white house right now advertisement goldberg despite the fact that there are these majorities among american people and voters who can agree on things in washington the level of bitterness gridlock frustration and anger is so high it seems like it can t be overcome how would you begin to combat that if you were sitting in the white house buttigieg so i ve shared a bit about my approach and how i think that would help but the truth is for the longer run this is why the unglamorous issues of democratic reform are so important the importance of dealing with gerrymandering and districts drawn by politicians effectively choosing their voters instead of the other way around the importance of changes to our campaign finance system the need for an end to the electoral college which is better received in some states than others but that i talk about everywhere i go because i think most people intuitively understand that the person who got the most votes ought to win it s why we need to act on voting in general accessibility of voting not just hr 1 which i think is a really excellent piece of legislation that s an example of what s dying in the senate but other measures to make sure that every vote is counted and that every voter gets to count all of these effects we have right now that reinforce structurally that kind of gridlock have to be challenged no matter which party is going to benefit just for the long run and the senate by design tends to be set up to cool off or slow down a majority but i don t believe it is sustainable for it to completely defy an american majority in the way that it does advertisement scott martelle editorial writer gerrymandering obviously doesn t affect senate seats and that gets to our whole blue red divide in this country and i haven t heard anything from you on how you re going to overcome that i mean you can t scare mitch mcconnell into changing his position by going and campaigning at kentucky and telling people he s out of touch how do you make that case buttigieg why not i mean the president s favored candidate was defeated in kentucky recently mitch mcconnell s approval ratings should have him concerned he can only for so long defy the people of his own state on issues from wages to guns before even in a conservative area that might catch up to him or at least create enough pressure to be working on some of these issues in good faith look i m not naive this is going to be challenging clearly but it s also not been for that long that many of the states that have now produced very conservative politicians were conservative on these issues and as we in particular have a deep ideological scrambling of the republican party anyway and when we have a president who doesn t even have an ideology it s actually a pretty healthy moment for us to get some of this realignment done and in my view every election fundamentally is about a voter asking the question how s my life going to be different if we go this way instead of that way advertisement and right now we have better answers on all of that we re the ones trying to get you a raise and they re stopping it we re the ones trying to get you paid family leave and they re blocking it and if this sounds naive consider this i was on the ticket in 2010 in indiana as an unknown democrat not a great time to be running for office as a democrat anyway because the affordable care act was so toxic right by 2018 in a republican senate populated by people whose absolute no 1 signature issue i mean their reason for existing as far as the electorate were concerned was to remove the aca even they could not vote it away why because over the course of eight years people real people some of the same people who went to the 2010 town halls about death panels showed up in the 2017 town halls you re taking away my healthcare facing down members of congress and senators telling them they didn t want that to happen and so when they had control of all branches of government the republican party failed to deliver on their own signature issue don t get me wrong they re undermining the aca in other ways but i m offering this up as a way to demonstrate the extent to which there really is an effect on the behavior even of cynical bad faith obstructionists in the gop senate when they are this out of step with their own people norman pearlstein executive editor of the l a times would you support mandatory voting buttigieg we can talk about it i think right now we ve got to make sure that we give people more reason to have faith in the value of their vote in other words i believe passionately that we should all exercise our right and responsibility to vote i think a lot of people are looking at antidemocratic structures like the electoral college and like gerrymandering and feel a level of frustration or cynicism about that my priority would be to fix that and see what that does to voter turnout advertisement goldberg suppose you were president today given what s happened over the last couple of weeks and the iranians launched an attack that killed 10 americans on an airbase in iraq how would you go about deciding what your response should be how would you make decisions about whether you needed to respond militarily or whether it was not a time to do that buttigieg well the north star of course is keeping americans safe whether that s americans deployed overseas civilian americans around the world or us right here at home and every step that you take deciding to use force deciding not to use force ultimately is about the question will this make americans more safe or less safe i m never going to hesitate to use force where it is the alternative that remains after every possible good alternative turns out to be unfeasible or inferior but you have to believe that force is the last resort in order to go there and if i were president we would not have been in the situation of the escalations beginning with the withdrawal from the jcpoa that got us here the challenge now will be to find means to deescalate which i believe is in both the iranian and american interests not to mention the goal of all of the allies who were party to the jcpoa the first letter of which stands for joint and with whom obviously our relationships are battered but whose interests are still aligned so it s also about making sure that we not only look at this from the perspective of what will we the united states do about this issue but also how can we align our allies and partners to make sure that we re going to be safer advertisement healey one of the arguments on that point from the president is that the jcpoa was badly flawed in at least two respects one there was not enough of a time gap between when it and when the iranians could build a bomb in other words it didn t provide enough protection and the second was that it did not stop the iranians from carrying out their malfeasance in the middle east how important are those two points and then how do you go about reconstructing a nuclear deal if you win buttigieg i think the first point is rendered moot by the fact that they killed it and so any worry about a gap between the end of the compliance with the jcpoa and the beginning of the iranian nuclear deal just makes it worse right now because we re literally living in that gap as we speak also it s worth mentioning that this administration itself certified the effectiveness of the deal on slowing down progress toward nuclear iran now the other issue it s certainly true that jcpoa didn t stop iranian malign activities in the region it wasn t designed for that not because we didn t want to but because it was specifically about the nuclear issue of course we want to stop iranian malign activities in the region and yet saying we re going to do nothing on denuclearization or the nuclear issue because we haven t solved the other issue is i think the wrong way to think about diplomacy advertisement i mean imagine if in north korea we said you know what there s no point in trying to do anything to have any delay in nuclear proliferation in north korea until we solve the problem of peace on the korean peninsula i actually think those two things have to be progressed foward incrementally and in tandem and i think the same is true with iran if anything we could stabilize the region partly through some of the terms of the jcpoa to perhaps make it less in iran s interest to pursue all of these kinds of proxy activities instead of course we ve done the reverse goldberg although the argument was that the jcpoa gave iran such an infusion of cash that it gave them more freedom to go about their bad actions in the region advertisement buttigieg without getting into the question of how the iranian budget is prioritized i get the sense that even as those activities have continued it s not because they ve been in great shape economically it s because they regard that as a core part of their security martelle if i can get you to go back to the gist of nick s question a minute ago you gave us a good concept and broad strokes but say it s your first week in the white house and the table is set as it is now and an attack comes and kills 10 service members in iraq linked to iran what would your process be for deciding if retaliation is called for and what the nature of the retaliation would be buttigieg well again i don t want to go too much down a hypothetical or a rabbit hole but in terms of the decision process you re asking about it s first of all what is the menu of options that s available to the united states how many of those options can be designed to maximize first of all a deterrent effect that would lead to this not happening again secondly establish that whatever the activity was that happened and the damage that was done will have a response third that will serve in some way to reinforce rather than undermine our partnerships both regionally and globally especially if we can undertake an action that s coordinated and fourth that we have thought through all of the moves and the countermoves that this is likely to lead to is this something that will establish a line that won t be crossed or is this something that will create a domestic political need for iran to go even further advertisement as we ve seen right now it seems that the regime is actually better able now to consolidate its domestic position on the heels of protest just a few weeks ago partly because of the consequences of this strike those are exactly the kind of things that need to be contemplated in advance and you re never going to have a crystal ball but having worked in the intelligence community this is what our intelligence professionals spent a lot of time gathering good information on for the president to consume all of that needs to be reviewed all of it needs to be contemplated and the principles guiding this whole process have to be american safety and security american overall interests american values every time we ve tried to separate our values from our interests especially in iran actually if you go back to the days of the shah and the origins of this regime every time we ve tried to separate those two it s ultimately not been in even our own long term interests and certainly something that we ve gone on to regret healey sorry to belabor this but you ve not once used the word proportionality i wonder do you buy the president s argument that sometimes a disproportionate response is the right response advertisement buttigieg there are strategic scenarios where that s the case although it s difficult again to believe that that s true here based on what we know so far but again as a general rule proportionality is called for but the principles i m talking about are security deterrence upholding our values and engaging our allies while that usually means paying a lot of attention to proportionality again this is exactly why i don t want to get into hypotheticals without knowing what it is we re dealing with and what it is we re trying to deter goldberg since you mentioned our allies how difficult do you believe it s going to be to repair relations with america s closest allies that have been damaged during the trump era and how do you begin to go about it buttigieg realistically this will be the work of more than one presidency but what we know is that it s not too late for the reason i mentioned earlier which is that it s not just affection but interest that i think binds us to our allies interest in stability and to the extent we re ready to uphold this authentically interest in certain human values that are also american values around democracy around freedom around self determination advertisement and a lot of this has to do with what you don t do just making sure that we do no harm in terms of relationships with allies things we may have taken for granted until we had a president willing to dismantle them but a lot of this is also proactive the good news if you can call it that is that there are a lot of things right now that require american leadership on the world stage in particular i m thinking about climate here you have a manifestly global issue the u s can t do it alone because we re less than a fifth of the world s emissions the world can t do it without us because we re the largest economy so at a time when our credibility is fragile at best it would make sense for us to be seen leading on an issue like that both by example and in our engagements it s true on issue after issue from stateless terrorism to global public health and pandemics that more not less coordination will be needed if we re playing an authentic and leading role in that i think we have a chance to begin to recapture the credibility and the leadership role that we had advertisement pearlstein in talking about things like democratic principles can you talk a bit about what you would want the relationship with china to be are we in a new cold war with the consequence of decoupling and of more areas of confrontation or do you see a way to have a relationship with china that builds on things like wto buttigieg i think we can decouple let me back up i think china represents a major strategic challenge that their model is fundamentally different from ours i view them as using technology for the perfection of dictatorship and i think we can expect tension to continue especially now that in the perceived chaos and instability of our own model theirs is being held up in some places as an alternative i don t think that has to put us on a collision course and i don t think it has to echo the experience of the cold war we likely will have to undertake certain kinds of strategic disentanglement i m thinking about national security sensitivities around technology thinking about the supply for pharmaceuticals there s certainly some issues where we ve got to be careful advertisement pearlstein would you keep huawei on the entities list buttigieg potentially i think it s less about targeting huawei and more about asking how we can have a robust enough whether we re talking about 5g or other forms of digital infrastructure how it can be robust enough that there s not a national security dependency on a strategic competitor if we take those steps i think it actually helps the relationship overall because where we should be engaging is in areas of mutual benefit economically and if you re from the midwest you re certainly alive to all of the potential in terms of agricultural exports but of course here when you re thinking about the ports and any other part of america we ve got a lot to gain by making sure that that s healthy but from a political perspective i think we also have to demonstrate that we care about these issues that are at stake that at the very least some measure of moral support for people seeking democracy in hong kong or people fleeing religious persecution in xinjiang they ought to see some signal of at least moral support from the u s as a floor and i would go further and say that can t be completely decoupled from our trading and economic relationships if we want to show that we are seriously committed to those values it doesn t have to be a western style democracy for us to have a healthy relationship but we need to be ready to stand up for these values advertisement goldberg how do you do that how do you defend the uighurs speak up for hong kong in anything more than just a symbolic gestural way without damaging this bigger strategic relationship that you re trying to build can it be done can you do both or do you have to sometimes put your moral principles aside pearlstein it depends on whether you re running the houston rockets or not buttigieg well again this is not to say that we have to see every country in our own image before we have a relationship i do think that at minimum we can expect some moral support from the oval office which is obviously impossible now first of all the president made clear that his silence could be purchased as part of the trade process secondly when you have a president who is inclined to do things like characterize unfavorable press as the work of the enemy of the people and echo authoritarian dictators you don t have much standing anyway to be speaking up for these kinds of freedoms it doesn t mean it has to be a condition of every relationship it means that we should be known to have that as an important consideration that we care about in every economic diplomatic and other international relationship that we have the u s is at its best when it s seen to do that advertisement healey but i think what nick is asking is where does it go beyond lip service particularly when you re talking about the crackdown on the protests in hong kong and what they re doing in western china to the uighurs buttigieg right now we don t even have lip service one thing you might begin with is at least some measure of moral support but again i would go further and i would say that this is something that we would indicate that progress or backsliding on could accelerate or diminish our willingness to be in some of these trading relationships carla hall editorial writer back here at home in south bend you ve had a rocky relationship with the black community for almost all the years that you ve been mayor starting around the time that you fired your black police chief and i know you had reasons to believe that he had acted wrongly by allegedly taping secretly other police officers but as you yourself have said it affected your relationship with black citizens of your city for all this time you ve had dust ups with black lives matter what is it that you re doing wrong that you can fix advertisement buttigieg well i would describe it as a family relationship it s complicated first of all it s important for me to say that i would not have been reelected the way i was if it weren t for support in the black community most black elected officials who were supporting anybody in this race who are in south bend are supporting me this is not because they think i m perfect or because we ve been able to resolve all of these issues at home it s because when these issues have faced us we ve worked together side by side to do something about it whether it was around policing where we became the most transparent police department in the region pushing information down to the incident level on use of force online or empowering residents to be part of the process to for example revise policies on how force is used or body cameras or training not all of that s reached the goal we re not even close to where it needs to be in particular i m thinking about recruiting where we ve actually seen the diversity of the department sliding in the wrong direction because of a lot of the issues that we ve faced not just around policing but we have tremendous racial wealth and income inequality part of how we know that is i commissioned the research to tell us some of the brutal facts this is not unique to south bend and it s not something that began on my watch but the question is what are we going to do about it in working together we ve reduced black unemployment we ve reduced poverty for african americans and often been able to do it at a faster rate than the country as a whole it s not just riding the waves of an economic recovery but here too there are areas where we clearly have a long way to go advertisement and so my focus has been on making sure that we engage to make sure things are better that we acknowledge where things aren t where they need to be but we also get results and do it together and of course i have critics as well as supporters but i believe that s the reason i have more supporters than critics garza but just to follow up on that your polling with the african american community is pretty low how are you going to overcome that what s your strategy what policies do you need to address what s going on buttigieg well first of all i would say there s a lot of regional differences here in the midwest where people know me best i m doing well with non white as well as white voters the south is certainly more of a challenge and i get it i don t think it s just about policy it s about voters who have felt taken for granted by my party you come along as a new guy with a lot of ideas and big big policies on offer and before people care about what s in your plan they want to have a sense of what moves you advertisement the douglass plan has been praised as the most comprehensive plan on dismantling systemic racism put forward by any presidential candidate because we look at how everything fits together it s economic empowerment with things like the effort to co invest in black entrepreneurs it s education not just support for but making sure we support things like completion it s health it s housing it s access to democracy itself it s criminal justice reform but recognizing that s not all there is to the black experience in america i will stand by the douglass plan as the best piece of comprehensive policy work done on this in this election but people also want to feel like they know you and that s the work that we re really continuing to work to do we found that different forms of engagement have paid off especially in the south where we didn t only do the 1 000 person rallies but we ve had more kind of intimate conversations listening as much as speaking right here in los angeles visiting places like vector90 in south los angeles and seeing what was being done to cultivate the potential of black entrepreneurs who have the best track record of creating opportunity for others but also seeing what people are up against not just entrepreneurs here but while we were there there was a group traveling from the midwest of black and latino young middle school students mostly who showed a lot of promise in tech just because we happened to collide we wound up having this conversation and hearing kids as young as 14 and 15 including one from indiana describing the kind of racial taunting they re experiencing in school right now it shows just how deep these issues are i believe that if we don t get a handle on this in our lifetime we re going to see white supremacy unravel the american project in our lifetime advertisement garza do you support reparations buttigieg i support hr 40 which is sheila jackson lee s bill to examine reparations but i also don t think we should wait for that to undertake investments that are reparative it s part of the idea of things like the funding for hbcus that i was talking about the co investment for entrepreneurs also if you look at an area like housing we have a lot of people who may be gentrified right back out of neighborhoods they were redlined into a couple of generations ago it s why i m proposing a 21st century homestead act that unlike the original homestead act that ran a lot of native folks out of their land actually helps people acquire title and build wealth in the neighborhoods that they were redlined into my point is these are uses of dollars reparations is often caricatured as a check in the mail the truth is nobody s fully offered a design template that i think everybody s comfortable with it doesn t mean we have to wait for a commission to finish its work to do things that are reparative right now that i think move in that direction advertisement kerry cavanaugh editorial writer on housing and as a mayor cities have guarded their local housing authorities their local control very much for years but there s exclusionary zoning there s history of redlining what role would your administration take on in terms of not just incentivizing cities to build housing but perhaps requiring cities to build housing or tying it to federal funding buttigieg i think it is carrots and sticks look at the effect that the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule had i ll tell you for us as a grantee that s certainly motivated our economic development offices to snap into action and make sure that the city was doing the right thing in that regard it s one of the reasons it s so frustrating that that s been dismantled in this administration s hud we know that that even if it involves more strings it can also lead to better results and i think that as we look at how federal funding reaches communities homes and beyond at the very least we should be offering up templates for what kinds of zoning reform are going to help deal with affordable housing but i think it s also completely fair to make sure that demonstrating that steps have been taken toward more inclusion in these processes is part of what cities should show in order to get that funding advertisement goldberg you got some blowback for comparing your experience as a gay man to the black experience buttigieg except that i didn t but go ahead goldberg ok as i read it was that a mistake to have said something like that are there things that are comparable about the two experiences and finally have you personally experienced discrimination because of your sexual orientation buttigieg this did not penetrate into all the stories but i ve always been very careful and clear to say that i m not comparing different experiences of exclusion i think that s important because they re so different and there s no comparison especially when we re talking about race i walk around a department store if my hand goes into my pocket to fiddle with my keys i get the benefit of the doubt if i m pulled over on the freeway i will roll my eyes and be irritated and think about how much the ticket s going to be not grip the steering wheel and fear for my life it s a different experience advertisement the reason i do want people to hear my own story is to make sure that i m clear about my motivations in making myself useful to others especially across equations of privilege where i m on the privileged side because i ve seen my own rights expanded not only by the activism of people like me but through allies who are not like me we did not get marriage equality because there was an lgbtq majority in america we got it because a lot of different kinds of people by the way many of them closely allied with those fighting for racial justice got together and pushed until rights were expanded for millions of americans including me and that s part of what motivates me to make sure that i am part of every effort to deal with prejudice and exclusion in all of its radically different forms experienced very differently by people some of whom are at the intersection of course of these different patterns of exclusion and make sure i m there for others that s why i talk about my experience goldberg and about your experience have you experienced discrimination yourself buttigieg well i had an employer who would have fired me if i had mentioned anything about my sexual orientation specifically the military that comes to mind pearlstein given the the ways in which nationalism has become an important issue around the world given your own experience is there any way that you could assert that your candidacy actually would reflect an understanding of globalization and where it can be helpful to a country like ours or a defense of competence as opposed to what we re now seeing in the white house or is the democratic party moving in ways in which that would be too risky a position to assert would it be possible to speak with pride about the mckinsey experience about what it takes to get a job offer there and so forth or are we in an age and stage where you almost have to run against yourself to be successful advertisement buttigieg well i think the case for competence and the case for skill is stronger than ever as we see pearlstein among the candidates you re running against and within the party buttigieg sure one of the things that can help bring our party together is our response to the incompetence we re seeing in this administration but let me also say this i m from the industrial midwest a place that heard a lot of experts come along and say just trust us just trust us on economic growth and everything will be great only to have the auto industry collapse just trust us on trade don t worry about your slice of the pie the whole pie is going to be so much bigger that you re going to be better off too and it didn t happen the reverse happened and so the suspicion of expertise that s going on in many parts of the country including my own and that this president takes advantage of that s real and it s coming from a place that deserves to be taken seriously advertisement now it doesn t mean that we throw out expertise especially when it comes to things like science policy and climate science not to mention public health it s more important than ever but one of the reasons even as mayor i sometimes found it difficult to persuade people to follow me on a course of action even when we were just trying to rearrange the way we did streets and traffic to make it healthier for the city and healthier for different ways of getting around just because i could prove it with an engineering study didn t really impress a lot of folks because there s this real sense of loss at the hands of a lot of experts i think that in order to overcome that we ve got to bring together two different instincts that i think both belong in my party one is the respect for science and expertise and skill and merit the other is an insistence that we actually check to see whether they re benefiting the vulnerable that s where the values part comes in it s why most of my campaign is about values because it turns out we have seen living proof that a rising tide doesn t lift all boats the tide s risen in my lifetime more than any tide has ever risen in an economy pearlstein california might be quite different from indiana in that respect innovation globalization imports and foreign students from graduate schools have actually in many ways defined us we have 50 000 chinese students in southern california and some people think that puts us at great risk other people think that that gives us great opportunity in the world to come buttigieg well if you re talking about global connections i think one of the really striking things that we ve seen for ourselves on the campaign actually is that it really is everywhere i mean you go to storm lake iowa i m pretty sure it s in steve king s district you go to their 4th of july parade part of it s the parade of nations 22 countries that are all the countries of origin of the people who are there largely working in agricultural facilities the agricultural economy there wouldn t work without them and of course many of them are undocumented advertisement true in my city too the reason we re so proud of the fact that our city is growing at all is because we were called dying the truth is if you netted out immigration from that we wouldn t be growing of course so much of our growth at different times has been a function of our global relationships whether it was immigration coming in or international relationships that were part of our economy too so i don t think you have to fit the template of a modern megacity to have a lot at stake in being connected around the world especially now that there are digital relationships that make that easier it may play out in ways that seem quaint in our global cities it may have more in some communities to do with somebody s experiences with an exchange student than with a multinational corporation but all the same i think that there s no reason to strip that away from the mindset of people in the middle of the country as long as we continue to show how it s actually helping healey just to be clear you mentioned a couple of things that made me think that you believe that on net nafta and china s entry into the wto were bad things is that what you believe advertisement buttigieg i think that at best nafta was problematic i m not a close the border no more trade free trade or no trade kind of guy i do think it s clear that a lot of the promises around nafta didn t come true for my part of the country doesn t mean we don t participate in trade it means when we do we make sure that it s lined up in a way that s fair that s going to benefit workers by the way the improvements that were made to the usmca largely because of a push from democrats are an example of how that can work we got to get away from this idea that you re either for free trade or nothing because neither one of those is going to work certainly where i m coming from and i don t think either one of those will work for the country pearlstein would you support a tpp advertisement buttigieg it needed more improvement for me to have felt good about it the idea of making sure that china isn t setting the terms for trade in asia makes sense but again the kinds of things that we did get in usmca i think more of those would ve made it easier to feel comfortable with tpp healey although much of usmca was taken from tpp buttigieg yeah but again look at the push that happens in order to improve usmca by the way it could go further usmca is not perfect either but it s indicating the movement that we can go in terms of labor in terms of enforceability and increasingly in terms of environment where if we want any kind of action domestically to be meaningful we re going to have to incorporate that especially the carbon picture into our trading relationships cavanaugh can i follow up specifically on this point donald trump told the midwest that he would bring back manufacturing and that would lift the economy what do you tell people in the midwest advertisement buttigieg well for one thing we are in a manufacturing recession the only economic promise i ve seen this president keep was the giant tax cut that s it and whether you re a worker seeing a manufacturing recession or a farmer seeing the way that he s jerked around in particular corn it s not just soybean farmers suffering from things like the china trade war it s also the total inconsistency around ethanol and these so called small refinery waivers going to giant operations so he just has not delivered for my part of the country i m glad unemployment is low that s great cavanaugh but what do you tell people when they say how do we lift up our economy in the midwest what is your simplistic answer buttigieg well my simplistic answer make sure you get paid more i mean there s a lot of complicated things going on globalization automation technology but also the biggest problem in our economy is blindingly obvious and abundantly simple and it s that people aren t getting paid enough that s especially true in real terms if you think about how wage increases are generally swallowed by increases in the cost of higher education health saving for retirement advertisement most people get this the simple fact that one job is not enough that there is not one county in the country where someone living on minimum wage can afford a two bedroom apartment look the house that i started out in as a child talk about affordable housing just changed hands for about 60 000 you get a good decent house in that neighborhood for about half of that and we still have folks experiencing homelessness and we still have folks experiencing profound housing insecurity we ve got to make sure people get paid more garza even before you get to try out your foreign and domestic policies you re going to have to get through the primaries buttigieg mm hmm affirmative garza i know that in this well in every primary but this one in particular democrats are racked with fears and indecision the big question they re asking themselves is who s the best candidate your campaign asks a lot of people it says here are all these old vets you know a former vice president senators but you should take a chance on me a relatively unknown young small town mayor why should they take a gamble on you advertisement buttigieg well first of all we begin with this is it important to you to beat donald trump i always think of the most colorful way i heard this question put was a new hampshire voter i said my whole piece for the backyard classic new hampshire kind of event did my thing first question he says you seem great but i d vote for my neighbor s dog if i thought that s who could beat donald trump so since winning is so important to all of us my party anyway and increasingly independents and some republicans too let s think about this in the last 50 years every single time my party has won the white house certain things have been true about the nominee it s been somebody who was new on the national scene had not run for president before was calling the country to its highest values did not work in washington or if they did had not for very long and was ushering in a new generation of leadership now we ve gone different ways many years but those were the years we ve come up short every time advertisement garza and one thing they were also male that s another issue buttigieg regrettably that one i m fine with seeing some change goldberg but not this time around buttigieg i mean i am who i am but look that pattern is strong enough that you might call it a law so i recognize this is not how everybody thinks about electability but i would say you might want to look at that pattern and think about it you add to that the value of again coming from the kinds of places that the president has appealed to and i think not at all because his policies are better for those places and the opportunity to have a new and different vocabulary and to call people together in a different way with real meaningful progressive policies that would make me the most progressive president in half a century but we talk about it in a way that includes as many people as possible in that effort and again i think it s one of the reasons we see a lot of independents and some republicans showing up at my events that s the way i think we actually get this done not just in order to win but in order to govern well i think those two things are connected and i ll leave it at that advertisement goldberg so we re running low on time but if we could get carla and scott hall i ll just do this really quickly nick asked if you d ever been discriminated against because you re gay as you go through this campaign do you feel that you re going to see discrimination from whole groups of people who think he s great but he s gay and i don t think america s ready for a gay president buttigieg i don t think so i mean don t get me wrong we ve seen our share it s strange right when you go to an event you re being picketed not because of a decision you ve made but just for existing but i ve got to tell you that s been a tiny minority of the encounters that we ve had i would also point to my experience back home when i decided to come out it was a reelection year the timing was largely because i d gotten that far in my life but after the deployment i just kind of got to a different place personally and was done not having a dating life for me at least that was a prerequisite to having a dating life so i had to come out i ll never forget the look on my campaign manager s face when i asked him over for breakfast and i said hey i got to tell you something and it s going to make your job a little more complicated advertisement we didn t know what would happen it s not like you can run a poll right if you knew mayor pete was gay would you i mean it was a leap of faith mike pence was the governor of indiana at the time and we didn t know what would happen it s a democratic city but it s a socially conservative city across all kinds of different groups from east european ethnic catholics to black evangelicals we didn t know what was going to happen and i got 80 i got more on the reelect than i did the first time around if that can happen in mike pence s indiana then i think it s further evidence that voters are just asking that question how s my life going to be affected and if we have the best answer on that the rest is noise martelle i don t know if we have enough time for this one but all the democratic candidates have climate change programs i read through yours over the past couple of days and i was struck that you point out that experts say within 10 years of being on the cusp of a point of no return if you win and win reelection you ll leave office when we re at that cusp and your plans have horizons of 2025 2035 2050 advertisement buttigieg mm hmm affirmative martelle from a pragmatic standpoint is it too late to do anything effectively and conversely does america have the political resolve and will to make the kind of changes and sacrifices that we need to get to that point buttigieg it s not too late in my view but i often point out that if the ipcc deadline is 2030 then the political deadline is 2020 because we ll never get to 2030 without a president who s committed to these things now by their nature if we re talking about a carbon neutral economy by 2050 some of these things get achieved further out but we talk about the immediate actions right rejoining paris right away as you said martelle which wasn t enough buttigieg it s table stakes this is the very beginning as you pointed out 2025 is quite soon but we can double the amount of renewables going into the grid by then other things in terms of heavier transportation getting that carbon free that s further out right but we ve got the roadmap to get to 2050 i think the distinctiveness of our plan is its answer to your other question which is how do we actually get it done because we ve been talking about some of these ideas since the 90s and the question is what does it look like to actually mobilize the whole country into this advertisement and i think what it ll take is for people from the auto worker in my neighborhood to a farmer to see where they fit i think there are a lot of americans whole categories of americans who feel like they re being beaten over the head told they re part of the problem which means just as a matter of basic psychology they have been made to feel like accepting climate science would be a defeat for them morally we have to change that for the politics to change so you ve already examined all the kind of technical dimensions in my plan the most important thing politically here and psychologically is that people are called into it it s why my national service program has a big plank on a climate corps i m thinking about the kid in shenandoah iowa this is a way western very conservative area who s coming to my event sticking up his hands from a rural community saying how can we be part of the solution on this it turns out there are huge opportunities in farming for example and soil management and carbon capture advertisement there are huge opportunities in industry of course a lot of the net new jobs i m talking about are not exotic green jobs designing electric aircraft some of them are union carpenters and glaziers and insulators building trades jobs we understand perfectly well right now and are going to need more of in order to do the building retrofits so if this feels like something that we re calling everybody into and people feel recruited rather than scolded that s where it begins to take on the feel of a national mobilization our country always does better when we have a national project here s one waiting to be done that doesn t even involve fighting other people and if we can change the way it feels to think about climate from a sense of guilt or a sense of fear or a sense of doom to a sense of pride then it becomes a lot easier to ask of people the different changes we ve got to go through as a society to get there without it i don t think we can get it done goldberg why do you say it doesn t require fighting with other people my recollection from 2012 is that all the republican candidates stood up and said one after another they don t believe in climate change and you ve got to fight the oil and gas industry i mean there s a huge battle ahead advertisement buttigieg what i m talking about is that we have a national project available to us that doesn t involve violence martelle is that on the table buttigieg no there will be a political battle of course there ll be a political struggle goldberg i mean would you say is this a top priority for you buttigieg yeah absolutely goldberg would you agree that climate change is the most serious and dangerous problem facing buttigieg i think it s the global security threat of our time goldberg and how will you deal with the republican senate on that issue buttigieg so again this is why this has to become something where everybody sees where they fit including people in constituencies that have often not felt like there is any reason for them to embrace climate science often though those are the same constituencies with the most to lose i mean again farming has the most to lose and this is no longer theoretical right it s not just coastal communities i mean obviously wildfires in california sea level rise in florida but i ve had to activate our emergency operations protocol for a once in a millennium flood and do the emergency management for that in our river city and then two years later had another one this is no longer something that you have to do a lot of arm waving to get people to see is there the senate gop is a little different from the american people and again this comes back to that question of how we make senators more responsive to their constituents advertisement goldberg last question pearlstein could you sort of a form of reverse speed dating just give a sentence or two on biden sanders warren and bloomberg and why you think besides a place of birth and age that you would be a better president than each of them buttigieg reverse speed dating pearlstein well just a sentence or two you want to distance yourself from them not embrace them buttigieg my approach is different right we share a lot of common goals but my approach is that of somebody who is on the ground in the middle of the country with an executive mentality whose relationship to the middle class is that i m in it i think i m the only person you mentioned that s not a millionaire and who is determined to bring about the kind of generational change change in style as well as change in politics that our white house needs that official washington needs and that i think the country needs so that we are not simply repeating the same arguments and often recycling the same voices that have been discussing the same issues with distressingly little effect for literally the entire time i ve been alive and at a moment like this where we see by the way around the world a new generation stepping forward from places like new zealand to france to finland even ones that we don t like north korea or are concerned about in saudi arabia what all of them have in common is they re the same age or younger than i would be on taking office maybe the u s ought to be leading that kind of trend instead of catching up advertisement goldberg kind of answered your question right great thank you so much for coming in appreciate it buttigieg same here thanks for having us

nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the pea based on these mineral resources will be realized mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability b2gold is

summation differences between tonnes grade and contained metal content pea overview the gramalote project is located in central colombia approximately 230 kilometres km northwest of bogota and 120 km northeast of medellin in the province of antioquia which has expressed a positive attitude towards the development of responsible mining projects in the region the pea was prepared by b2gold and evaluates recovery of gold from a an open pit mining operation that will move up to 143 000 tonnes per day tpd 50 0 mtpa with a 30 137 tpd 11 0 mtpa processing plant that includes crushing grinding flotation with fine grinding of the flotation concentrate and agitated leaching of both the flotation concentrate and the flotation tails followed by a carbon in pulp recovery process to produce doré bullion the pea is based solely on production from the gramalote ridge deposit and does not include potential production from the nearby trinidad deposit which has a current inferred mineral resource estimate see above and the monjas west zone the mineral resource estimate for gramalote ridge that forms the basis for the pea includes indicated mineral resources of 70 110 000 tonnes grading 0 92 g t gold for a total of 2 070 000 ounces of gold and inferred mineral resources of 79 030 000 tonnes grading 0 79 g t gold for a total of 2 010 000 ounces of gold the pea updates and enhances the previous studies on the gramalote project in several areas including for gramalote ridge additional drilling has been completed and a new mineral resource model has been developed the pea is based solely on gramalote ridge mineral resources where previous studies included mining and processing ore from the trinidad deposit and the monjas west zone deposit and the monjas west zone recent metallurgical test work has resulted in slightly lower processing costs and improved economics the new mineral resource model for gramalote ridge includes new interpretations of higher grade ore zones and has allowed more efficient mine optimization which has resulted in higher grade ore being fed to the plant during the first years of production significantly improving project economics due to better defined high grade zones in gramalote ridge in the block model the overall gold grade for the pea is 0 85 g t which is significantly higher than previous studies accelerated mining is planned in the early years of production to provide higher grade feed to the plant while stockpiling lower grade material the final four years of plant feed are from low grade stockpiles and oxide ore oxide ore which only makes up about 3 of the plant feed will be stockpiled and processed at the very end of the project life as blending this material with the fresh ore does not yield optimal gold recoveries the pea assumptions include revenues using a gold price of 1 350 per ounce and current prices for fuel reagents labour power and other consumables the key parameters of the pea are

2 16 average lom processing cost t processed 5 61 based on the positive results from the pea b2gold believes that the gramalote project has the potential to become a large low cost open pit gold mine subject to completion of ongoing infill drilling and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020 the gramalote project has several key infrastructure advantages including reliable water supply high rainfall region and located next to the nus river adjacent to a national highway which connects directly to medellin and to a major river with port facilities capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 km of the site and to a major river with port facilities capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 km of the site proximity to the national electricity grid with ample low cost power and a stable record of hydroelectric power skilled labour workforce within colombia in addition b2gold expects the gramalote project to benefit from several key operational advantages including excellent metallurgical characteristics of the ore which results in high recovery rates at low processing costs relatively low strip ratio in the mine 1 9 1 ability to mine and process higher grade ore in the initial years of the mine life resulting in improved project economics the pea is subject to a number of assumptions and risks including among others that a modified environment impact study and a modified project implementation plan will be approved within the required timeline all required permits and other rights will be obtained in a timely manner the gramalote project will have the support of the local government and community the regulatory environment will remain consistent and no material increase will have occurred to the estimated costs

steps b2gold and aga have agreed on a budget for the feasibility study on the gramalote project of approximately 37 million through the end of 2020 this budget will fund 42 500 metres of infill drilling to convert existing inferred mineral resources to the indicated category and 7 645 metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure the company currently expects to complete all drilling by the end of may 2020 in addition the budget will fund feasibility work including an updated mineral resource estimate detailed mine planning ongoing environmental studies additional metallurgical test work engineering and detailed economic analysis the gramalote joint venture will continue to advance resettlement programs establish coexistence programs for small miners work on health safety and environmental projects and continue to work with government and local communities on social programs b2gold as manager plans to continue the feasibility work with the goal of b2gold completing a final feasibility study by december 31 2020 due to the amount of work completed by aga over the past several years including extensive testing programs the work with local communities and small miners and the high level of engineering performed in 2017 for an internal study the work remaining to reach final feasibility is not extensive the main work program for feasibility is infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the inferred mineral resources to the indicated category the environmental impact study and project implementation plans for the gramalote project have been fully approved by the national authority of environmental licenses of colombia due to the desired modifications to the processing plant and infrastructure locations a modified environment impact study and a modified project implementation plan were submitted and are currently in the final approval process if the final economics of the feasibility study are positive and the joint venture makes the

iraq and lebanon have been rocked once again by mass protests and violent repression under conditions in which discredited caretaker governments in both countries have failed to meet any of the social and political demands made by hundreds of thousands who have taken to the streets the resurgence of the street demonstrations which broke out in both countries last october followed a lull in the wake of the us drone missile assassination of iranian gen qassem suleimani on january 3 at baghdad s international airport and the mass outpouring throughout the region against the american war crime at least five demonstrators were reported killed in the course of protests that swept baghdad and other cities on monday as security forces fired live rounds into the crowds in baghdad three people died from wounds suffered in the protests two from gunshots and a third who had been felled by a tear gas canister fired directly at his head a fourth demonstrator was shot to death by police in the central iraqi city of karbala southwest of baghdad and a fifth was killed in the northeastern city of baqubah two policemen were also reported killed in the southern city of basra the center of the country s oil industry when a panicked motorist trying to flee the scene of a violent confrontation drove his car into them the brutal repression of the iraqi demonstrations has seen more than 500 killed since october 1 and another 25 000 wounded beginning on sunday and continuing into monday protesters sought to block the main highways and bridges in baghdad and the south of the country with barricades and burning tires we blocked the road to demand our rights the rights of young people to get a job one of the protesters in the iraqi capital told al jazeera another protester denounced the violent repression telling the news agency for months no one listened to our demands they are killing us it s just bloodshed the government headed by prime minister adel abdul mahdi who resigned two months ago but has stayed on as a caretaker with the iraqi parliament still unable to choose a successor has taken a hard line against the renewed protests describing those blocking highways as outlaws the spokesman for the commander of the iraqi armed forces adel karim khalaf said that security forces had absolute authority to repress such protests iraq s mass demonstrations grew out of earlier scattered actions by university graduates protesting the lack of jobs under conditions of a more than 25 percent unemployment rate for younger workers repression of the initial protests led to their mushrooming into a generalized uprising against the conditions of poverty the failure of essential social services and the endemic corruption in the sectarian based regime created by the american military occupation that began with the criminal us invasion of 2003 popular anger has been driven by the glaring social inequality in a country that boasts the third largest oil exports in the world bringing in over 1 trillion in revenue since 2005 these vast resources have flowed into the coffers of foreign corporations and banks along with baghdad s politically connected oligarchy while seven million of iraq s 38 million people live below the poverty line and 53 percent are vulnerable to food insecurity similar social and political contradictions have motivated the mass protests in lebanon which also resurged over the weekend with at least 540 people wounded in violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces in beirut over the weekend while the media focused on an alleged shift toward violence by protesters the lebanese government turned beirut into an armed camp ringing the parliament building with razor wire and deploying heavily armed elite us trained special operations troops including some carrying rocket launchers there were reports of snipers deployed on rooftops and government thugs throwing rocks from nearby buildings into the crowds below security forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas canisters directly at the demonstrators police went so far as pursuing people and attacking them inside hospitals and mosques the weekend s protests came in response to a call for a week of rage over the government s failure to meet any of the demonstrators demands or to create an acceptable replacement to the regime headed by prime minister saad hariri a political stooge of saudi arabia who resigned last year in the face of mass opposition driving the protests are the country s deteriorating economic and social conditions as lebanon faces its worst crisis since the end of the 1975 1990 civil war the lebanese protests have been accompanied by attacks on some 300 banks and atms across the country the banks have become the target of public ire people have seen their savings destroyed as the value of the lebanese currency has been cut in half over the past three months meanwhile the banks have imposed limits on how much money depositors can withdraw in an attempt to prevent financial collapse these restrictions are waived for the wealthy and politically connected but enforced on the broad masses of the population bank workers have remained on an extended strike in part over concerns for their own safety the devaluation of the lebanese pound has led to the soaring of imported food prices together with the near halving of real wages the country s minimum wage which was the equivalent of 450 a month is now barely 270 the world bank has warned that continuing devaluations will lead to the rise of the portion of lebanon s population living in poverty from one third to one half in many industries employers have stopped paying salaries leading to strikes hospitals have run out of essential medicines and gasoline is being rationed lebanon s mass protests were triggered on october 17 of last year after the government announced a tax on popular messaging applications including whatsapp the action triggered a mass revolt against all of the austerity measures imposed over the previous period together with the conditions of growing poverty and unemployment crumbling infrastructure and social services and rampant corruption as in iraq the driving force behind the demonstrators anger was the ever widening social inequality that constitutes the essential feature of lebanese society the latest upsurge has been further fueled by the announcement that lebanon s outgoing foreign minister gebran bassil is to attend this week s world economic forum in davos switzerland to speak on unrest in the arab world bassil is president michel aoun s son in law an online petition has called for the forum to rescind his invitation declaring that he should not be invited to speak on behalf of a nation that has rejected him and accuses him of flagrant corruption as in iraq a caretaker administration headed by president aoun has proven unable to cobble together a new government since hariri resigned on october 29 hezbollah together with its fellow shiite movement amal and other allies holds a majority in parliament and appears poised to put together a cabinet led by the former education minister and professor at the american university of beirut while the demonstrations have advanced the demand for a government of independent technocrats the bourgeois order set up along sectarian lines in the wake of the country s civil war is incapable of jumping out of its skin whatever government is formed by the existing bourgeois parties in lebanon will be tasked with the speedy implementation of a sweeping agenda of additional austerity measures in order to meet the demands of the international monetary fund the world bank and major power creditors in return for a rescue package of 11 billion pledged at an international conference last year most of this money will go to meet debt obligations to the international banks as early as 2016 interest payments on the country s debt consumed fully half of the lebanese budget hezbollah which is aligned with iran had initially taken a hostile stance toward the demonstrations suggesting that they were being fostered by washington saudi arabia and israel to further imperialist interests in the region on several occasions the shiite movement staged counterdemonstrations clashing with protesters more recently however hezbollah has sent its representatives to meet with protest leaders expressing agreement with their demands and offering them support undoubtedly with the hope of quelling the mass upheavals social tensions within both iraq and lebanon have been exacerbated by us imperialism s drive to assert its hegemony over the region and roll back iran s influence by means of crippling economic sanctions and criminal military violence washington and its regional allies are undoubtedly attempting to manipulate these tensions to further their regional aims tehran has responded by supporting repression on the part of both the iraqi and lebanese governments in an attempt to defend the influence of the shiite sectarian movements with which it is allied iraqi protesters have expressed hostility to the prospect of the country being turned into a battlefield for a us iranian war washington meanwhile has rejected the iraqi government s demand that it withdraw the 5 000 to 6 000 us troops that are deployed in iraq in both iraq and lebanon the popular protests have expressed a mass rejection of sectarian politics making clear that in both countries as all over the world the decisive dividing line is class not religion ethnicity or nationality the demands of the masses of lebanese and iraqi workers and youth like those of workers who have risen in revolt by their millions across the planet cannot be resolved outside of the struggle for the overthrow of capitalism and the building of socialism on a world scale

northeast of medellin in the province of antioquia which has expressed a positive attitude towards the development of responsible mining projects in the region the pea was prepared by b2gold and evaluates recovery of gold from a an open pit mining operation that will move up to 143 000 tonnes per day tpd 50 0 mtpa with a 30 137 tpd 11 0 mtpa processing plant that includes crushing grinding flotation with fine grinding of the flotation concentrate and agitated leaching of both the flotation concentrate and the flotation tails followed by a carbon in pulp recovery process to produce doré bullion the pea is based solely on production from the gramalote ridge deposit and does not include potential production from the nearby trinidad deposit which has a current inferred mineral resource estimate see above and the monjas west zone the mineral resource estimate for gramalote ridge that forms the basis for the pea includes indicated mineral resources of 70 110 000 tonnes grading 0 92 g t gold for a total of 2 070 000 ounces of gold and inferred mineral resources of 79 030 000 tonnes grading 0 79 g t gold for a total of 2 010 000 ounces of gold the pea updates and enhances the previous studies on the gramalote project in several areas including for gramalote ridge additional drilling has been completed and a new mineral resource model has been developed the pea is based solely on gramalote ridge mineral resources where previous studies included mining and processing ore from the trinidad deposit and the monjas west zone deposit and the monjas west zone recent metallurgical test work has resulted in slightly lower processing costs and improved economics the new mineral resource model for gramalote ridge includes new interpretations of higher grade ore zones and has allowed more efficient mine optimization which has resulted in higher grade ore being fed to the plant during the first years of production significantly improving project economics due to better defined high grade zones in gramalote ridge in the block model the overall gold grade for the pea is 0 85 g t which is significantly higher than previous studies accelerated mining is planned in the early years of production to provide higher grade feed to the plant while stockpiling lower grade material the final four years of plant feed are from low grade stockpiles and oxide ore oxide ore which only makes up about 3 of the plant feed will be stockpiled and processed at the very end of the project life as blending this material with the fresh ore does not yield optimal gold recoveries the pea assumptions include revenues using a gold price of 1 350 per ounce and current prices for fuel reagents labour power and other consumables the key parameters of the pea are

subject to completion of ongoing infill drilling and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020 the gramalote project has several key infrastructure advantages including reliable water supply high rainfall region and located next to the nus river adjacent to a national highway which connects directly to medellin and to a major river with port facilities capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 km of the site and to a major river with port facilities capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 km of the site proximity to the national electricity grid with ample low cost power and a stable record of hydroelectric power skilled labour workforce within colombia in addition b2gold expects the gramalote project to benefit from several key operational advantages including excellent metallurgical characteristics of the ore which results in high recovery rates at low processing costs relatively low strip ratio in the mine 1 9 1 ability to mine and process higher grade ore in the initial years of the mine life resulting in improved project economics the pea is subject to a number of assumptions and risks including among others that a modified environment impact study and a modified project implementation plan will be approved within the required timeline all required permits and other rights will be obtained in a timely manner the gramalote project will have the support of the local government and community the regulatory environment will remain consistent and no material increase will have occurred to the estimated costs

steps b2gold and aga have agreed on a budget for the feasibility study on the gramalote project of approximately 37 million through the end of 2020 this budget will fund 42 500 metres of infill drilling to convert existing inferred mineral resources to the indicated category and 7 645 metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure the company currently expects to complete all drilling by the end of may 2020 in addition the budget will fund feasibility work including an updated mineral resource estimate detailed mine planning ongoing environmental studies additional metallurgical test work engineering and detailed economic analysis the gramalote joint venture will continue to advance resettlement programs establish coexistence programs for small miners work on health safety and environmental projects and continue to work with government and local communities on social programs b2gold as manager plans to continue the feasibility work with the goal of b2gold completing a final feasibility study by december 31 2020 due to the amount of work completed by aga over the past several years including extensive testing programs the work with local communities and small miners and the high level of engineering performed in 2017 for an internal study the work remaining to reach final feasibility is not extensive the main work program for feasibility is infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the inferred mineral resources to the indicated category the environmental impact study and project implementation plans for the gramalote project have been fully approved by the national authority of environmental licenses of colombia due to the desired modifications to the processing plant and infrastructure locations a modified environment impact study and a modified project implementation plan were submitted and are currently in the final approval process if the final economics of the feasibility study are positive and the joint venture makes the

related follow up during the q a period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue now i will turn the call over to jeff jeff miller thank you abu and good morning everyone 2019 solidified the pivot from growth to capital discipline in north america and marked another step on the road to recovery in the international markets iâ m pleased with the way the halliburton team executed our value proposition delivered exceptional safety and service quality and stayed focused on generating healthy returns and strong free cash flow i thank our outstanding halliburton employees for their hard work and execution the entire year 2020 opens a new decade and a new century for halliburton it brings new opportunities that i will address in a few minutes but first some headlines for the full year and fourth quarter of 2019 we finished 2019 with total company revenue of 22 billion and adjusted operating income of 2 1 billion i m pleased with the continued recovery in our international business we increased revenue 10 outgrowing the international rig count for the second year in a row north america revenue declined 18 as a result of customer activity and pricing reductions and our decision to focus on those customers that provide the best returns systematically improving our service delivery immediate cost reductions and the growth in non frac product lines allowed us to stem the margin erosion we delivered over 900 million of free cash flow for the full year demonstrating our ability to generate consistent free cash flow throughout different business environments finally 2019 was an exceptional year for our safety and service quality performance our total recordable incident rate and nonproductive time both improved by over 20 historical bests across our business this is a result of our employeesâ continued commitment to safety and process execution and now a few points about the fourth quarter we finished the quarter with total company revenue of 5 2 billion a 6 sequential decrease and adjusted operating income of 546 million an increase of 2 quarter over quarter our completion and production division revenue declined 13 sequentially and operating margin remained essentially flat our drilling and evaluation division delivered a strong quarter we grew revenue 4 and improved operating margin 300 basis points sequentially d e international margins grew significantly offset by margin decline in north america while our north america business declined due to the significantly lower activity in u s land internationally we delivered 10 revenue growth this quarter this underscores the versatility and global reach of our business in the fourth quarter we took a 2 2 billion largely non cash impairment charge and made strategic decisions to market for sale our pipeline services and well control product lines as i mentioned 2020 brings plenty of opportunities the oil price is more constructive as we enter the year the imminent global recession fears have abated with the help of economic easing from the leading central banks u s production growth is slowing because of constricted capital flows the increase in non u s non opec supply coming into the market is limited the geopolitical instability in the key oil producing regions of the world should add an incremental risk premium to the commodity prices in the near term that said oil prices are still supported by the opec plus cuts and will fluctuate based on the groupâ s resolve to continue limiting production gas prices in the u s are below breakeven levels u s drilling and completions activity may be biased lower due to the consolidation and restricted access to capital halliburton is no stranger to navigating choppy waters we entered 2020 and our next century with a clear sense of purpose we will continue to do what we do best collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize our customersâ asset value while generating industry leading returns and sustainable cash flow for our shareholders we will do this with attention to the sustainability of our business minimizing environmental impacts and acting as a responsible corporate citizen the international markets presented plenty of growth opportunities in 2019 we grew revenue 10 year over year closing stronger than anticipated all regions increased revenue led by asia pacific latin america and europe both our divisions meaningfully contributed to the international growth completion and production led the charge with 13 expansion due to higher activity in mature fields in europe and unconventionals in argentina the uae and australia drilling and evaluation grew international revenues 8 as we increased activity levels in all markets specifically in norway mexico china and nigeria in 2020 we expect the international spend by our customers to increase by mid single digits making it the third consecutive year of spending growth we have the right footprint and an enhanced technology portfolio to compete and win across the international markets we expect to grow at or above the market rate this year consistently focusing on profitable growth and improving our international margins continued gas activity expansion in the middle east resolution of political issues in latin america and several pending project awards may enable us to outgrow the market again in 2020 our drilling and evaluation division is poised to grow faster as we get the benefit of the full year in our norway integrated contracts the icruise directional drilling platform rollout continues and new offshore drilling activity starts up around the world the international revenue growth should follow the historical cyclicality in the first quarter we expect international revenue to decline due to normal seasonality and the elimination of yearend sales thereafter we should see steady growth that would peak in the fourth quarter this year we expect to increase our international margins we anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the north sea and asia pacific our project pipeline is strong and the incremental activity will help tighten tool availability and absorb the existing cost structure we intend to be prudent with capital allocation driving our organization to have the right pricing discussions with customers given the tool tightness in some product lines and geographies we re strategically reallocating assets to the best returning opportunities pricing in certain international regions is improving and we expect this momentum to continue throughout 2020 about one third of our book of business is awarded every year the remaining two thirds are existing contracts and contract extensions we are gaining pricing traction on new work and contract renewals and we re making strategic choices about the work we pursue i believe the capital and pricing discipline across all geographies will allow halliburton to deliver rational returns driven growth in the international markets turning to north america the u s shale industry is facing its biggest test since the 2015 downturn with both capital discipline and slowing leading edge efficiency gains weighing down activity and production as expected in the fourth quarter customer activity declined across all basins in north america land affecting both our drilling and completions businesses the rig count in u s land contracted 11 sequentially and completed stages had the largest drop we have seen in recent history while holidays and weather were the usual factors other reasons for this air pocket in activity included our customersâ free cash flow generation commitments and an oversupply of gas market with this backdrop halliburton followed our playbook and continued to proactively manage our fleet count as announced last quarter we also proactively cut costs and started the implementation of the strategy to sustainably improve our service delivery those actions allowed us to curb margin declines in north america and deliver lower decrementals year on year even though the industryâ s sequential activity drop was much more severe than in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter the market saw clear public evidence of the long awaited equipment attrition this is just the beginning we believe a lot more equipment will exit the market as lower demand increasing service intensity and insufficient returns take their toll as service companies cannibalize idle equipment for parts and new sideline pumps to beef up working fleets the available horsepower supply in the market may be smaller than something halliburton has continued doing what we said we were doing stacking equipment to improve our returns we exited 2019 with 22 less available fracturing horsepower we have rationalized our equipment supply to the anticipated level of demand in 2020 the size and scale of our business in north america gave us the ability to right size without sacrificing our market leadership position and the value that comes with it in the fourth quarter we started the implementation of our 300 million annualized cost savings and service delivery improvement strategy we moved quickly to execute the initial personnel reductions and real estate rationalization all with an eye to improving our near term financial performance weâ ve achieved about 200 million in savings on a run rate basis in the fourth quarter while this impacts our business globally the majority of the savings are geared towards north america we re looking at 2020 with pragmatism early indications are that are u s land customers will reduce capital spending approximately 10 from 2019 levels i believe that the current level of ducks in the market will allow operators to spend less money on new well construction and direct more of it to completions depressed gas pricing is negatively affecting the activity outlook in the gassy basins which will likely bear brunt of the activity reductions in 2020 in the first quarter operators will reload their budgets and we expect modest improvement in completions activity as a result that said the calendar cadence where some operators are biased to spend more earlier in the year will likely remain halliburton will continue to be proactive in taking actions to generate industry leading returns and strong free cash flow in this environment here are the more significant actions after systematically rationalizing equipment in 2019 to adjust to changing activity levels in 2020 we plan to provide the capacity that maximizes the returns on our overall fleet this should also allow us to be efficient about our workforce and maintenance planning and to achieve higher utilization of existing fleets throughout the year pricing pressure was considerable during the year end tendering season consistent with our capital discipline approach we ve taken on contracts that are expected to allow our portfolio to earn acceptable returns and declined those that are not i like the slice of the market that weâ re choosing to participate in this year our high graded customer portfolio gives us confidence in a more sustainable demand level and the mix of pricing and volume that generates returns for halliburton make no mistake we will continue developing technologies whose value accrues to halliburton and not just to our customers our integrated completions offering and the icruise rotary steerable system are prime examples of such technologies they should allow us to reduce our capital outlay and deliver better margins all with the purpose of generating strong returns we plan to continue strategically growing our share of services per well by increasing the competitiveness of our non hydraulic fracturing businesses in north america our wireline and perforating artificial lift and specialty chemical product lines all posted strong double digit revenue growth in 2019 despite the overall market softness in u s land we intend to keep this momentum and spread it to other services finally we will continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy halliburton is redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services in order to lower our unit costs and improve margins and returns in the long run 2019 closed the decade of the shale revolution that transformed the united states into the world s top hydrocarbon producer halliburton was an early participant in this development and has been investing in it and innovating ever since hand in hand with our customers as unconventionals enter maturation phase halliburton is committed to the north american market and taking appropriate actions to thrive in the new environment i will now turn the call over to lance to provide more details on our financial results then i will return to discuss digitalization a topic that will define the next decade for our industry lance lance loeffler thank you jeff and good morning let s begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2019 total company revenue for the quarter was 5 2 billion a decrease of 6 and adjusted operating income was 546 million an increase of 2 during the fourth quarter we recognized 2 2 billion of pretax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions these charges consisted largely of non cash asset impairments mostly associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment they also included approximately a 100 million of cash costs primarily related to severance as a result of the charge in the fourth quarter we recognized a benefit of approximately 35 million from a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense which reflects two months of dd a impact the after tax impact of this reduction in the fourth quarter is approximately 0 03 of eps of which 0 02 is included in our completion and production results and the remainder in drilling and evaluation numbers as jeff mentioned we ve also accomplished a significant portion of our intended annualized cost reductions with the remainder to come in the first quarter let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail in our completion and production division revenue was 3 1 billion while operating income was 387 million both decreased 13 reduced activity and pricing in multiple product service lines primarily associated with stimulation services in north america land coupled with lower activity for stimulation services in latin america and well intervention services in the middle east drove our results these declines were partially offset by higher pressure pumping activity in the eastern hemisphere coupled with year end completion tool sales globally in our drilling and evaluation division revenue was 2 1 billion an increase of 4 while operating income was 224 million an increase of 49 these results were primarily driven by increased activity in all product service lines in the middle east asia coupled with higher drilling activity in europe africa cis and yearend software sales globally these improvements were partially offset by lower drilling activity in north america and reduced testing activity in latin america moving on to our geographical results in north america revenue was 2 3 billion a 21 decrease this decline was mainly due to lower activity and pricing in north america land primarily associated with pressure pumping and well construction this decline was partially offset by higher yearend completion tool sales in the gulf of mexico in latin america revenue was 598 million a 2 decrease resulting primarily from lower activity in multiple product service lines in argentina coupled with decreased testing activity across the region these results were partially offset by higher activity for all product service lines in colombia increased project management activity and cloud infrastructure installations in mexico and higher yearend completion tool sales across the region turning to europe africa cis revenue was 883 million a 6 increase resulting primarily from increased well construction activity in the north sea coupled with increased activity in multiple product service lines in algeria these improvements were partially offset by lower pipeline services across the region in middle east asia revenue was 1 4 billion a 19 increase sequentially largely resulting from increased activity in multiple product service lines across the middle east india and china higher pressure pumping activity in australasia and higher year end incompletion tool sales across the region these results were partially offset by lower well intervention services in the middle east in the fourth quarter our corporate and other expense totaled 65 million and we expect it to be the same in the first quarter of 2020 net interest expense for the quarter was 141 million and should remain approximately the same for the first quarter our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 22 based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix we expect our 2020 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 21 with a projected full year tax rate of approximately 23 we earned approximately 1 2 billion of cash from operations during the fourth quarter as expected we improved our working capital and generated strong free cash flow of approximately 827 million for the quarter delivering approximately 1 billion of free cash flow for the full year excluding the cash impact of the restructuring charges i discussed earlier as a result we ended the year with 2 3 billion in cash capital expenditures during the quarter were 340 million with our 2019 full year capex ending just above 1 5 billion as we look ahead to this year we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by approximately 20 to 1 2 billion we believe this level of spend will still allow us to invest in our anticipated international growth while continuing to rationalize our business to the current market conditions in north america within this reduced capex budget we will continue investing in and growing our production group businesses namely constructing a chemical manufacturing plant in saudi arabia and expanding our artificial lift footprint we will also move forward with the icruise system global rollout but at a more normalized pace than what we accomplished over the last couple of years our digital efforts and new technologies aimed at improving our efficiency and reducing our operating costs will also get an appropriate share of spend we believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors regardless of the market environment finally let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out as is typical our results will be subject to weather related seasonality and the roll off of year end sales which will mostly impact our international business north america will see a modest increase in completions activity as jeff described earlier we will continue to pull the levers that allow us to mitigate margin declines across the business this quarter as such in our completion and production division we expect sequential revenue to increase 2 to 4 with margins declining 125 to 150 basis points for our drilling and evaluation division we anticipate sequential revenue will decline 4 to 6 with margins decreasing 200 to 250 basis points i ll now turn the call back over to jeff jeff jeff miller thanks lance one of the key trends that will define the new decade in our industry is digitalization the next 10 years will see digital technologies and artificial intelligence going mainstream just like the smartphones did in the last second in the oil and gas industry digitalization unlocks the potential to structurally lower cost shorten the time to first oil increase optionality in exploration and production and enhance performance across the entire value chain digital is not a separate strategy at halliburton rather it is an integral part of our value proposition our ability to collaborate engineered solutions and maximize customersâ asset value is evolving through the seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations digital permeates everything we do and has the same goal as our business strategy deliver value for our customers and returns for our shareholders at halliburton we are hard at work on the next frontier solutions that will shift the balance in the people process technology triad by replacing labor and reducing capital investments through automation and self learning processes we believe this will allow us to harness the transformative power of digitalization and make a quantum leap in productivity similar to going from horses to horsepower it takes time to build the scalable software and hardware infrastructure required to fully capitalize on digital solutions we re well along that path and have been building up our digital capabilities for a number of years with the long term view of how digitalization will evolve i m pleased with the internal and customer adoption weâ re seeing halliburton is in a unique position to reap the benefits of the industry s move towards digitalization our landmark product line is an established leader in petrotechnical software with the powerful cloud enabled decisionspace 365 software platform in 2019 the cloud native software was our fastest growing business within landmark increasing revenues 50 year over year landmark provides us with solid foundation established through decades of investment in software development people domain expertise and processes to create and scale digital solutions this benefits all of our product lines in addition we have strategic partnerships with accenture microsoft aws and schneider electric all of which validate and expand both our vision and our capabilities we now have over 100 customers with thousands of users across the globe leveraging our ienergy digital ecosystem to integrated software and workflows across their organizations regardless if they re halliburton s third party or internally developed this open architecture platform is unique in the industry and in our view is a necessary condition for the successful adoption and scaling of digital solutions true to our d a we are also bringing to market practical smart and interconnected products and services that help unlock value for us and our customers we are pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding well construction and reservoir recovery let me spend a few minutes on each first we transformed subsurface understanding using big data digital frameworks and evergreen models we ve created a unique geological model of the entire earth to provide insights into the origin and productivity of reservoir once drilling starts we deliver improved field measurements with next generation wireline and logging while drilling tools fiber and sensors we then translate these measurements into faster and more informed decision making using a new class of models made possible by digital technologies for example our earthstar ultra deep resistivity sensor automatically feeds into our industry first scalable earth model that updates in real time customers can now make faster decisions about their development programs and reduce cycle times by a factor of 10 second we improve well construction through collaborative well engineering and drilling automation landmarkâ s digital well program enables seamless collaboration between operators and service companies across a multitude of software platforms the icruise drilling system increases the number of built in sensors by a factor of 5 and offers self guiding capabilities working with our rig partners our digital twin technology delivers better collaboration and faster decision making all of these solutions boost efficiencies and lower costs while demanning the process of well construction last but not least we improved recovery and production by using our digitally enabled tools to connect customersâ assets and leveraging this to monitor and enhance performance outcomes in completions we use our intelligent completions for monitoring production trends and connecting them to broader reservoir management studies in artificial lift we leveraged digital to monitor esp health and extend run life in simulation we use our industry leading fracture modeling software and full scale asset simulator to model fracture propagation and frac hits these are examples of how we deliver digital innovation today with a focus on specific domains and aligned with the customersâ buying behavior they provide immediate value to customers increased customer loyalty and generate returns for halliburton over time we believe digitalization will seamlessly connect subsurface drilling and production enabling customers to make asset level decisions at the speed of execution we have a solid foundation the tools the open architecture and the domain expertise to successfully deliver this vision let me summarize what weâ ve talked about today in 2020 halliburton is focused on delivering margin expansion industry leading returns and strong free cash flow in our view international growth will continue increased activity disciplined capital allocation pricing improvements and our ability to compete for a larger share of high margin services we believe will lead to international margin expansion in 2020 as north america customer spending declines again this year halliburton will continue to execute our playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow we plan to provide the service capacity that we believe will maximize the returns on our overall fleet continue to invest in technologies that improve margins keep strategically growing our non hydraulic fracturing product service line and continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy we believe digitalization will define this decade in our industry halliburton continues to move full steam ahead on the digital journey and is uniquely positioned to reap its benefits and now let s open it up for questions question and answer session operator our first question comes from the line of james west with evercore isi your line is now open james west so jeff towards the end of your prepared comments you ve talked a lot about international and international margin progression i wonder if we could dig into a little more detail there with mid single digit it sounds like growth you may be able to outpace that a touch here as well plus you re seeing some pockets of pricing strength how should we think about the margin expansion as we go through the year what type of incremental should we be expecting jeff miller yes thanks james look i think i spent a fair amount of time on the catalysts themselves obviously activity improving rational project choices and technologies i think the key is it s going to be shaped we re starting at a higher point going into q1 than we certainly did last year and then i would expect the shape of that to look similar where we start and it moves up a little just that shape of the international margins should stay consistent but obviously starting from a higher point james west and then maybe for lance here on the free cash flow next year looks like it s going to be pretty significant based on some growth but also lower capex here how should we think about when we re going to see the free cash flow start to show up will it be similar to this year or it should be backend loaded or would it be more even throughout the year lance loeffler yes look i think you re right in terms of the expectations to grow free cash flow this year you re right around the i don t think that the our ability to drive sort of the working capital consumption is going to remain in the first half of the year like it has historically for us i expect some of the extreme volatility that we saw last year to not repeat this year but there still is a consumption of cash from a working capital perspective but overall with the reduction in capex the improvement around margins and some stability around our working capital we expect free cash flow to grow in 2020 operator our next question comes from sean meakim with jp morgan your line is now open sean meakim so you touched on the margin progression internationally can you maybe just talk about how that translates into d e in 2020 so we had the margin ramp in 4q maybe 70 basis points or so comes from the d e benefit that will help year on year in â 20 but can we see 2020 margins on a full year basis get back to 2017 2018 levels do we think we can get back to a double digit type of outcome for the year iâ m just curious how you think investors will get comfortable with the trajectory like that just given itâ s been a difficult business to forecast last couple of years jeff miller yes sean it has been difficult to forecast but we ve done a lot of things during that time so the platform around icruise technology and earthstar has been rolling out at the same time we re seeing a lot of international choppiness that we see some recovery sort of happening which obviously lends itself towards d e and so i think these are multi year efforts that we and we view them that way iâ d say digital as well will contribute to probably early days to d e for all of those reasons i don t think it s unreasonable also to expect that we get back to i think 2018 looking kind of number or beyond sean meakim got it okay thank you for that and then so on the digital strategy competitors made a lot more noise about their strategy maybe than you have so far but the contracts sound pretty similar in terms of the offering could you maybe just expand a little bit in terms of the scalability that you see for those types of avenues maybe across a broader set of customers and where you see the most opportunity jeff miller yes i think i tried to describe today our vision around digital and then the mechanics for realizing that vision which then quickly becomes in today s market what are the things we actually do so i used an example of some of the tools that are in the market as we integrate those obviously the moat expands around those so i think it will take many forms over time again it will be big projects which weâ ve talked about a few of those where it s either a cloud infrastructure and the cloud environment that we either install or operate and weâ ve got examples of each of those but equally important will be the day in day out march around how this work really gets done which is around drilling production and reservoir filling in those spaces with tools they all contribute to that vision and so i think that there is a lot of scalability here and i think what s most important is really the production capital that halliburton has invested in landmark that really makes it scalable in fact to do these things at scale there s a lot of discipline and practice and agile devops that are required at scale to reliably develop software and then operate maintain and then ultimately continue to advance and we have that so and iâ m really confident in how that rolled out over the longer term and i think the thing to focus on is what are those tools that weâ re doing now that deliver returns obviously they contribute to the vision operator our next question comes from the line of angie sedita with goldman sachs your line is now open angie sedita so just on c p specific to north america could you talk a little bit about the cost cutting that s unwinding here you said you have a 100 million left is there more that could be done beyond that 100 million itâ s for jeff or lance and then maybe you could talk also about the pricing have you seen the market starting to stabilize on the frac side for pricing are you still seeing pressure in frac and across the other product lines jeff miller yes thanks angie look the 300 million in savings and we ve moved quickly on that and i think the 200 million that we ve taken out on an annualized basis already expect to get the rest of that done in q1 and i think that really speaks to how that team in north america executes and we execute very quickly and with a lot of purpose and so obviously that contributes beyond that we ve talked about our playbook and how we expect to execute our strategy in north america and i think over time that continues to drive improvement in margins less concentrated in a moment but obviously a set of activities that yield value over time from a pricing standpoint itâ s still very itâ s competitive information obviously q4 was quite competitive and so i think the market in spite of attrition is still oversupplied what s important though is that we make our own choices around how to maximize fleet profitability and by virtue of doing that i view it as more stable in that respect lance loeffler angie i might add a comment too on the 300 million in cost savings just to be clear too to add to jeff that s sort of cash structural savings jeff miller yes angie sedita okay thank you that s helpful and then maybe staying along the themes on pricing it s obviously the reverse internationally maybe you could talk a little bit or give more color on the pricing power or momentum youâ re seeing in the international markets is it fairly widespread is it by specific regions or product lines and do you think there could be a little bit of momentum going into 2020 or is it slow and steady jeff miller look i d more describe it as slow and steady angie i think what the key is that the setup is constructive and so managing capital in a more prudent way focusing on profitable growth as opposed to growth all of those things conspire to create an environment where we re able to get better pricing is it widespread i d say itâ s generally widespread but there is probably pockets who are more concentrated than others sometimes driven by availability and complexity of work and things that would normally and rationally drive our pricing and so i think that s what we re seeing in the market and yes it is getting traction operator our next question comes from bill herbert with simmons your line is now open bill herbert thank you good morning lance you talked about it conceptually but i d like to kind of refine it if you will with regard to the discussion of the evolution of working capital for this year less pronounced seasonal trends you were a huge consumer cash working capital was in the first half of 2019 a nice contributor to cash in the second half i m trying to kind of peg the order of magnitude of the reduction in cash consumption during the first half of this year versus the first half of last year lance loeffler yes i think what you see bill is sort of a year over year comparison as we don t have i mean last year we were carrying a lot of inventory associated with the boost in the icruise rollout and in some of our c p product lines that i don t think that you see that consumption taking place again this year as we consume more of that inventory as opposed to build it the collection cycle is still going to be very similar albeit as the international business becomes a bigger part of our business that typically has longer dsos so we may see some impact there but still a view where we build receivables early in the year and then unwind those as we get into the later part of the year bill herbert okay and so just to take a stab at it would you expect that your cash consumption from working capital in the first half of this year would run it like half of what it did in 2019 i mean is that a reasonable starting point lance loeffler i think that s probably a reasonable starting point bill herbert okay and then secondly again a lot of moving parts but it s kind of a 20 reduction in capex you should have better working capital improvement for this year net income should be up as well so at least from my numbers i m getting to kind of a free cash flow yield assuming a 24 stock price of kind of 7 to 8 which is getting pretty sporty and i m just curious with regards to priorities of the deployment of that surplus cash flow is it still a reduction of net debt first and foremost lance loeffler yes i think it is i think with the excess cash i think we do have a near term priority on reducing debt the reality is bill is while we re focused on that debt reduction in the near term what it does and what it offers us as we continue to chip away at it is give us more flexibility to return cash to shareholders in the future and i think today our business we need to address the 3 8 billion of debt that we have coming due over the next six years so i think we ll do that do some of that in the near term but also with an eye on ultimately returning cash to shareholders operator our next question comes from scott gruber with citigroup your line is now open scott gruber kind of staying on a similar line of questioning lance you mentioned the 1 2 billion of capex in 2020 which is good to see could you just provide some color on how you think about the sustainability of capex around that level there is a few moving pieces year on year in 20 and there will be a few more in 21 in particular with the saudi chem supplying investment now recurring but just how should we think about kind of broad strokes on that level of capex and feel free to frame it as a percent of sales if itâ s easy jeff miller yes scott this is jeff i think the key is around prioritization and we are focused on the best returning opportunities but we were able to fund international growth in 2019 and expect with that level of capex can continue to fund the growth that we see in 2020 so it isn t that we are starving anything the reality is we re feeding things appropriately and around our return expectations we think about spending this year it s probably two thirds international a third u s but in our view very sustainable and so we re comfortable with that level of capex and also what it means to making better returns lance loeffler yes i would add in an environment an increasing pricing environment that generates the appropriate returns we may spend more but it will be commensurate with the focus on returns and overall driving better free cash flow scott gruber got it and then just a question circling back on the domestic frac market with pricing hopefully stabilizing here in early 2020 and jeff you had mentioned a focus on maximizing returns on the frac fleet but broad strokes does that strategy likely mean that your frac business trends with the market in 2020 or they had lagged the market to a degree in 2020 would be focused on returns how should we think about it jeff miller yes i think that it will yes i would expect we stay consistent with the market but we don t feel like we have to just because we mostly focus on the returns and free cash flow out of that business but i wouldn t think we would be out of the market at any point in time but that said weâ re focused on the slice of customers that make the best returns for us which gets to a number of factors efficiency but also calendar cadence piece of spend this year going into q1 for example weâ re 95 committed on the fleet which is the best we ve been since the downturn operator our next question comes from david anderson with barclays your line is now open david anderson hi good morning jeff going back to your comments on the digital side as we move beyond the proof of concept and it becomes more broadly accepted you kind of talked about sort of two different types of customers out there i guess as sort of maybe on the e p side as those who have kind of realized they can do themselves and you provide certain discrete operations different applications like you just mentioned on some of your tools on the other side you have other bigger broader customers which you can implement your ecosystem across the organization kind of the announcements you made today how do you see those two sets of customers evolving over the next let say next several years is it fair to assume just kind of the former and then the former is the majority of that business and then hopefully it kind of evolves more into more the broader implementation can you just talk about how you see the customersâ acceptance jeff miller yes look i think customers do this at the pace at which they can digest it realistically and that is the reason why i think you see that bifurcation today it s more apparent just because customers that can actually operate and execute at that level of integration are fewer and far between today and i kind of view it that way it gets implemented at the pace it could be absorbed thatâ s why i tend to talk about the vision and then bring it down to okay here are the more digestible groupings being drilling production and reservoir and then even down into the tools because the reality is number of these tool donâ t have to be integrated but they can be and they are more effective when integrated and so if i use a fairly simple example like in earthstar tool itâ s a tool itâ s metal it runs in the well itâ s fantastic tool but what s most important about it is the answer product which is the 3d inversion and now that 3d inversion becomes even more valuable when integrated in an earth model and likely yet again more valuable when integrated into the entire ecosphere but thatâ s difficult for everyone to do that at one time and it s very hard to do that given sort of the proliferation of different systems so the key in my view is we continue to advance the platform the ecosystem as you described it while at the same time driving immediate returns around these tools and they re available to be integrated into that ecosystem i hope that s helpful david anderson that makes a lot of sense jeff thanks now the other side of digital here is that it appears to be deflationary to traditional oilfield services going forward your customers can do more with less would you agree with that and do you think that future digital revenue to halliburton presumably it comes at higher margins itâ s more sustainable can that more than offset this deflation over the next several years jeff miller i think it can because i think what s missing in this deflation discussion is the moat that comes in around our equipment that allows so much cost savings on the client side part of the business that weâ ll be able to reap better margins and better returns on those assets to deliver those solution and obviously at the same time weâ ll likely be reducing our own costs as we work through this so i think it will be deflationary in some ways but i think the value and the returns on the not just the componentry but how that componentry is part of that ecosphere really winds the moat that may be isn t there is prevalent today but i think we will see that widen and that ultimately drives better returns for us in spite of what might be deflationary in a number of other areas of the business operator our next question comes from chase mulvehill with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open chase mulvehill hey good morning i guess i want to come back to the capex question and ask it maybe a different way if we think about that 1 2 billion of capex what s the split between d e and c p lance loeffler yes chase this is lance i would say that itâ s very similar to the 60 40 split that we talked about between nam and international is a good proxy chase mulvehill okay so 60 c p is that what you re saying lance loeffler no no no 60 d e chase mulvehill got it okay all right if youâ re 40 i think that puts you sub 4 of c p revenues if we think about capex as a percentage of revenues obviously lower than kind of what you did in 2016 as a percentage of revenues if we look over the next couple of years and kind of call it a sluggish modest growth north america environment how should we think about c p capex over the next couple years and maybe frame it on a percentage of revenues lance loeffler yes look i think structurally lower as we described it based more on the market and the opportunity set that we see but we are really careful not to we don t peg this to percents of revenues and others things because then when get sort of odd answers when we see markets growing and i don t think growth is geared that way to our capex necessarily and so we will continue to focus on the best returning opportunities where we see those but the idea that it s going to have to move the capex is going to move as percentage with revenues is really not that s not how we approach that chase mulvehill okay that makes sense and then coming back to frac you talked about 22 less frac horsepower is that the amount that you ve actually retired is that the amount that you ve actually taken out of the market from an active fleet reduction and then a quick one follow up to that you talked about improvement in frac utilization in 2020 for your active fleets do you care to kind of quantify that how much improvement in utilization across your active fleets you think you can get in 2020 jeff miller look i ll start with the first question the 22 that we described is out of the market sold by the pound retired but thatâ s done some good things for us i mean the reality is that we re 90 q10s at this point our costs are lower our service quality is the best it s ever been so that s how we view that the activity i guess is as we look out at the balance of the year or in terms of utilization part of maximizing profitability of that fleet and the returns on that fleet is keeping it busy and as i described earlier we started the year 95 committed which is the best weâ ve been in sometimes so i m encouraged by that outlook based on the fleet that we have operator our next question comes from kurt hallead with rbc capital markets your line is now open kurt hallead i was kind of curious first and foremost on the international front when we look at 2020 where do you think the best relative growth prospects are for halliburton you mentioned that asia pac was a major contributor here in â 19 so just kind of curious on how you see the regional dynamics play out for 2020 jeff miller look i think it s again led by asia pac in 2020 europe cis continues to be strong as we get into a full year of activity on a number of the contracts we talked about in the past africa grows but it will be a bit more choppy as it works through exploration and regulatory sort of resetting in that market middle east remains robust but obviously starts at a fairly high point as the market itself and latam likely brings up the rear kurt hallead okay i appreciate that dynamic and then i just want to get a little bit better understanding here on just the guidance you provided for first quarter on the margin progressions for c p and d e and i want to try to get in this context for c p when you look at the margin degradation on a quarter on quarter basis could you give us some general sense of how much is that related to the absence of the tool sales versus market dynamics lance loeffler yes kurt this is lance yes itâ s definitely impacted by just a non recurring nature of year end product sales in the c p division which were probably up 10 to 15 versus what we saw in 2018 so we had a good fourth quarter at our c p division in terms of year end equipment sales kurt hallead okay and then can the same be said for d e lance loeffler i m sorry kurt hallead i ll let you continue lance sorry lance loeffler no and then and that is obviously those margins are accretive so what we see replacing that in the first quarter in terms of activity largely in the resumption of our pressure pumping business in north america is coming at lower margins and so you see offset of that kurt hallead okay can the same be said for d e lance loeffler yes same can be said for d e probably more comparative flattish year over year in terms of year end product sales in our d e division operator the next question comes from the line of marc bianchi with cowen your line is now open marc bianchi jeff you were talking about oversupply still in the frac market and with your retirements and what we ve heard from the others there has been pretty significant reduction so far what do you think is needed from here to kind of balance the market and what do you think the timeline is for that jeff miller yes look i think what s most important is that that attrition is real i get this question a lot and i think a quarter ago i said i thought it was 20 which was viewed as high turns out that s right in the fairway so that attrition is in fact occurring and the market forces or the forces that drove that attrition haven t changed at all in terms of amount of sand pumps number of stages per day all of those things that drive that attrition haven t changed and so i suspect we continue on a pace thatâ s at least consistent with that as far as the timeline of when we see it it happens at some point it doesn t change the way we go to the market today and so we are so focused on delivering our strategy around cost reduction and our service delivery improvement that when that happens it will be terrific and we will see a great boost from that i think in the meantime weâ ve got a plan to deliver solid free cash flows and return sort of in any market marc bianchi okay thanks for that maybe someone related weâ ve got the guidance here for first quarter for c p margins which includes the full benefit of all the cost cutting you are doing where do you think those margins can get absent any kind of pricing recovery for the frac side of business is there just through the self help i think youâ re talking about a bogey that you would point to over the next number of quarters jeff miller look no i mean i think weâ ve provided guidance on q1 i view strategy as something that we executed and we continue to see the value and benefit from and so weâ re taking a very long view of this business and the actions that weâ re taking beyond q1 to continue to contribute and improve the business and i think that we will continue to outperform like we have the highest margins today in north america and we will continue to add to that operator and that will conclude today s question and answer session iâ d like to turn the call back to mr miller for closing remarks jeff miller thank you liz before we wrap up iâ d like to close with a few points first i expect that halliburtonâ s international growth will continue in 2020 and that the combination of capital discipline pricing improvements and technology will lead to margin expansion second halliburton will continue executing our north america playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow and finally i believe digitalization will define the next decade and halliburton is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits look forward to talking to you again next quarter liz please close out the call operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect

project is located in central colombia approximately 230 kilometres km northwest of bogota and 120 km northeast of medellin in the province of antioquia which has expressed a positive attitude towards the development of responsible mining projects in the region the pea was prepared by b2gold and evaluates recovery of gold from a an open pit mining operation that will move up to 143 000 tonnes per day tpd 50 0 mtpa with a 30 137 tpd 11 0 mtpa processing plant that includes crushing grinding flotation with fine grinding of the flotation concentrate and agitated leaching of both the flotation concentrate and the flotation tails followed by a carbon in pulp recovery process to produce doré bullion the pea is based solely on production from the gramalote ridge deposit and does not include potential production from the nearby trinidad deposit which has a current inferred mineral resource estimate see above and the monjas west zone the mineral resource estimate for gramalote ridge that forms the basis for the pea includes indicated mineral resources of 70 110 000 tonnes grading 0 92 g t gold for a total of 2 070 000 ounces of gold and inferred mineral resources of 79 030 000 tonnes grading 0 79 g t gold for a total of 2 010 000 ounces of gold the pea updates and enhances the previous studies on the gramalote project in several areas including for gramalote ridge additional drilling has been completed and a new mineral resource model has been developed the pea is based solely on gramalote ridge mineral resources where previous studies included mining and processing ore from the trinidad deposit and the monjas west zone recent metallurgical test work has resulted in slightly lower processing costs and improved economics the new mineral resource model for gramalote ridge includes new interpretations of higher grade ore zones and has allowed more efficient mine optimization which has resulted in higher grade ore being fed to the plant during the first years of production significantly improving project economics due to better defined high grade zones in gramalote ridge in the block model the overall gold grade for the pea is 0 85 g t which is significantly higher than previous studies accelerated mining is planned in the early years of production to provide higher grade feed to the plant while stockpiling lower grade material the final four years of plant feed are from low grade stockpiles and oxide ore oxide ore which only makes up about 3 of the plant feed will be stockpiled and processed at the very end of the project life as blending this material with the fresh ore does not yield optimal gold recoveries the pea assumptions include revenues using a gold price of 1 350 per ounce and current prices for fuel reagents labour power and other consumables the key parameters of the pea are presented in the following table 100 basis production profile contained gold ounces processed moz 4 082 gold recovery 94 3 average gold grade g t 0

a large low cost open pit gold mine subject to completion of ongoing infill drilling and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020 the gramalote project has several key infrastructure advantages including reliable water supply high rainfall region and located next to the nus river adjacent to a national highway which connects directly to medellin and to a major river with port facilities capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 km of the site proximity to the national electricity grid with ample low cost power and a stable record of hydroelectric power skilled labour workforce within colombia in addition b2gold expects the gramalote project to benefit from several key operational advantages including excellent metallurgical characteristics of the ore which results in high recovery rates at low processing costs relatively low strip ratio in the mine 1 9 1 ability to mine and process higher grade ore in the initial years of the mine life resulting in improved project economics the pea is subject to a number of assumptions and risks including among others that a modified environment impact study and a modified project implementation plan will be approved within the required timeline all required permits and other rights will be obtained in a timely manner the gramalote project will have the support of the local government and community the regulatory environment will remain consistent and no material increase will have occurred to the estimated costs economic sensitivities gramalote is a large low grade low cost project

on the gramalote project of approximately 37 million through the end of 2020 this budget will fund 42 500 metres of infill drilling to convert existing inferred mineral resources to the indicated category and 7 645 metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure the company currently expects to complete all drilling by the end of may 2020 in addition the budget will fund feasibility work including an updated mineral resource estimate detailed mine planning ongoing environmental studies additional metallurgical test work engineering and detailed economic analysis the gramalote joint venture will continue to advance resettlement programs establish coexistence programs for small miners work on health safety and environmental projects and continue to work with government and local communities on social programs b2gold as manager plans to continue the feasibility work with the goal of b2gold completing a final feasibility study by december 31 2020 due to the amount of work completed by aga over the past several years including extensive testing programs the work with local communities and small miners and the high level of engineering performed in 2017 for an internal study the work remaining to reach final feasibility is not extensive the main work program for feasibility is infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the inferred mineral resources to the indicated category the environmental impact study and project implementation plans for the gramalote project have been fully approved by the national authority of environmental licenses of colombia due to the desired modifications to the processing plant and infrastructure locations a modified environment impact study and a modified project implementation plan were submitted and are currently in the final approval process if the final economics of the feasibility study are positive and the joint venture makes the decision to develop gramalote as an open pit gold mine b2gold would utilize its proven

ben holland bloomberg news washington in a memorable exchange at davos last year tech billionaire michael dell was explaining how higher taxes on the rich had never done much good anywhere when he was contradicted actually said erik brynjolfsson a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology they d worked pretty well within living memory in his own country the united states for an executive crowd that s thrived under 40 years or more of policies based on freeing up business and markets the observation was a reminder that older versions of western capitalism didn t always look like that and a warning the next incarnation might not either rather than a hands off approach governments are gearing up for a more active role in steering economies through the big challenges of the coming decade from global warming and inequality to the great power race for a technological edge perhaps unsurprisingly politicians from europe asia and even the u s are embracing the idea we re past peak laissez faire in many ways said adair turner former head of the u k s bank regulator and a davos regular we passed it in the financial system 10 years ago when we nearly blew up the world economy he said it s taken longer in other areas but people are realizing there s a need for strategic direction in areas like climate change on plenty of other issues too managed trade in the u s both republicans and democrats increasingly want to manage international trade instead of leaving it to markets donald trump broke that mold and his would be opponents aren t inclined to take a less interventionist line when democratic contenders for this fall s presidential election were asked in a debate if they d remove china tariffs on day one none of them said yes indeed the initial trade agreement signed last week suggests the more successful the deal the greater the drift toward more state managed economies in both china and the u s according to a bofa global research note democrats meanwhile are itching to intervene in health care if obamacare was about structuring private markets the next overhaul may involve direct public spending paid for with the higher taxes objected to by dell founder of the eponymous computer giant there s been a similar shift on higher education even one of trump s senior student loan officials described the american way of financing college degrees with private debt as nuts trump has delivered tax cuts for companies and individuals sticking with a republican orthodoxy since the administration of ronald reagan who was president when the world economic forum first met in 1988 high stock prices and profits are celebrated as evidence america is thriving common good but on some issues republicans don t sound as reflexively business friendly as they used to sharpening competition with china which for trump has been mostly about trade has spurred some republicans into a broader rethink one idea taking hold is that if its chief rival has a government directed industrial policy america may need one too republican senator marco rubio has made that case in a series of reports and speeches while the market will always reach the most efficient economic outcome at times that result can be at odds with the common good and the national interest he said last month in europe germany and france which coined the term dirigisme as well as entrepreneur are pushing for mergers to create continental champions able to compete globally in fields such as car batteries golden age prime minister boris johnson s government wants freedom from european union competition and subsidy rules to be able to aid u k industry as it sees fit johnson has promised a post brexit golden age helped by state funding for infrastructure and health tech giants are in the political crosshairs everywhere u s lawmakers have been hauling tech bosses into hearings and threatening them with antitrust actions european regulators have taken the fight further opening lawsuits levying billions in fines and threatening tech companies with a new digital tax the energy industry too is under more direct pressure in europe where leaders have backed ambitious goals for reducing carbon emissions the revival of activist government isn t confined to western economies the world over nation states are reasserting themselves presenting new risks to the capital and assets of corporations eurasia group said in a report on 2020 developments the success of the state led chinese economy may be one underlying reason half the story china s breakout has been characterized as a movement in the direction of markets said dani rodrik an economics professor at harvard this gets only half the story right it completely overlooks the other half which has to do with management of the currency the role of the state and promoting new industries even the international monetary fund traditionally an advocate of light touch government is working on a new framework that will allow more space for policy makers to manage flows of capital and intervene in currency markets economists at the imf and elsewhere also see a bigger role for governments to manage economies with fiscal policy for most of the davos era central banks have taken the lead by tweaking the price of credit but interest rates have been stuck at rock bottom levels for more than a decade and businesses and households are maxed out anyway politicians unlike central bankers have the power to address inequality directly governments can raise tax rates for top earners without sacrificing economic growth imf chief kristalina georgieva a davos attendee wrote in a blog post this month the question may arise again at this year s wef where one of the themes is fairer economies just don t expect the discussion to be comfortable the classic davos man answer is to say there s lots to be done but don t tax the rich more said turner the more thoughtful ones realize that can t be quite true

loan growth and the net impact from higher rates was offset by an increase in interest bearing deposits as well as wholesale funding the provision increased from a very low level in 2018 and reflected continued solid credit quality where 21 basis points of net charge offs were only 4 basis points excluding energy we repurchased 18 6 million shares during the year reducing our average share count by 11 and together with an increase in our dividend returned 1 8 billion to shareholders in summary we achieved record earnings per share and continue to enhance shareholder value turning to slide 5 fourth quarter earnings were 269 million or 1 85 per share these results demonstrate our ability to drive solid returns with an roe of nearly 15 and an roa of 1 5 despite declines in interest rates broad based deposit in non interest income growth strong credit quality and continued active capital management were positive contributors to our performance compared to the third quarter average loans remain relatively steady as expected mortgage banker continued to benefit from robust refi activity also in commercial real estate and environmental services maintained their growth trends this was offset by declines in general middle market as well as national dealer which was partly due to lower inventory levels the tone of recent conversations i ve had with customers and colleagues across our markets is optimistic and we continue to see slow steady economic expansion we are focused on employing new customer acquisition cross sell and retention strategies that we have launched over the past year and we continue to make the customer experience a corporate priority as we seek to raise the expectations of what a bank can be while loans were relatively slow deposit growth was robust increasing 1 5 billion relative to the third quarter with almost every business line contributing the mix of the growth was favorable with over 40 coming from non interest bearing deposits in conjunction with this growth we have reduced higher cost brokered deposits by nearly 700 million our interest bearing deposit costs declined 7 basis points to 92 basis points in the fourth quarter we are closely monitoring the competition and with the recent fed rate cuts we have taken action to adjust deposit pricing by carefully managing our deposit rates we are attracting and retaining relationships our strategy is working and is clearly demonstrated by our deposit growth the increase in relationship deposits allowed us to reduce higher cost wholesale funding and helped reduce our loan total funding cost to 71 basis points also our loan to deposit ratio decreased to 88 of note the u s treasury recently announced that we will continue to be the exclusive financial intermediary for the direct express government benefits card program for another five years the economics of this program include attractive retail deposits that should continue to grow and our ability to leverage a third party platform for processing and servicing as far as net interest income over 80 of our loans are floating rate and primarily tied to 30 day libor which on average declined 39 basis points during the quarter lower rates were the primary driver for our net interest income decline to 544 million resulting in a net interest margin of 3 2 we added 750 million of swaps in october and additional 1 billion in early january our strategy is to continue to build our hedging program over time closely monitoring the markets and then taking advantage of opportunities as they arise credit quality remained strong in the fourth quarter with net charge offs of only 16 basis points charge offs continue to primarily consist of valuation impairments on select energy credits as capital markets for this sector remain stalled excluding energy net charge offs were only 2 million non performing assets declined and were only 43 basis points of total loans and the provisions decreased to 8 million a 10 million increase in non interest income helped offset the more challenging rate environment we had strong growth in customer derivative income as well as a gain from the sale of our healthcare savings or hsa business along with incremental growth in several other categories expenses increased as expected primarily related to higher compensation outside processing and seasonal occupancy this is in line with the outlook we provided for full year expenses to remain flat excluding 2018 restructuring costs we maintain our targeted 10 cet1 target we returned 246 million in capital to shareholders through our dividend which currently provides almost a 4 return and by repurchasing 2 1 million shares under our share buyback program and now i will turn the call over to jim james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide 6 as curt indicated average loans were stable in the fourth quarter with increases in commercial real estate mortgage banker and environmental services offset by decreases in general middle market and national dealer relative to the fourth quarter last year average loans were up 1 7 billion total commitments as of quarter end were stable compared to the third quarter with growth in commercial real estate equity fund services u s banking and general middle market offset by reductions in energy dealer and technology and life sciences our pipeline remained solid our loan yields were 4 43 a decrease of 40 basis points from the third quarter this was a result of lower interest rates primarily one month libor in addition to a 3 million decline in non accrual interest from an elevated third quarter level slide 7 provides details on deposits average balances increased 1 5 billion with growth across all three of our markets non interest bearing deposits increased over 600 million while customer interest bearing balances increased 1 45 billion we ve managed our higher cost brokered deposits down about 700 million as far as deposit costs with the decline in interest rates we adjusted deposit pay rates throughout the quarter together with the decline in brokered deposits we achieved a 7 basis point decrease in our interest bearing deposit costs this is at the high end of the guidance we had previously provided as you can see in slide 8 our mbs portfolio is stable and the yield on the portfolio held steady yields on recent purchases have been around 2 4 we have had a modest increase in prepays in the back half of the year but this is not had a significant impact on our duration or the unamortized premium which remains relatively small turning to slide 9 net interest income was 544 million and the net interest margin was 3 2 loans had a negative impact of 55 million or 31 basis points to the margin the major factor was lower interest rates which had a 46 million impact and 28 basis points on the margin also contributing to the decrease were lower balances of the client and non accrual interest from elevated levels and to a lesser extent other portfolio dynamics including lower loan fees fed deposits added 3 million but had a 7 basis point negative impact to the margin higher balances added 7 million that resulted in a 5 basis point drag on the margin the lower fed rate had an impact of 4 million or 2 basis points lower rates improved deposit costs by 3 million or 2 basis points on the margin and reduced wholesale funding costs by 7 million adding 4 basis points to the margin in summary given the nature of our portfolio our loans repriced very quickly therefore the net impact of lower rates including a full quarter impact of the july and september rate cuts along with october s was the primary driver of our net interest income in the fourth quarter assuming rates remain steady going forward we believe the bulk of impact from lower rates is behind us credit quality was strong as shown on slide 10 our net charge offs were 21 million or 16 basis points excluding energy net charge offs were only 2 million total non performing assets declined to 43 basis points one of the lowest levels since 2006 and criticized loans comprised only 4 of total loans as of quarter end as far as energy while charge offs were lower in the fourth quarter than the previous two quarters we continue to see impairment of select energy loans with valuations of a few liquidating energy assets impacted by volatile oil and gas prices as well as weak capital markets energy non accrual loans decreased 31 million however we have seen a moderate amount of negative migration as criticized energy loans increased 146 million therefore we increased our reserve for energy which remains at a very healthy level our reserve ratio for total loans held steady at 1 27 and resulted in a provision of 8 million a decline of 27 million from the third quarter as far as our adoption of cecl as of january 1 our implementation process has been successful and is virtually complete given the relatively short duration of our commercially weighted portfolio and the expectation of a fairly benign economic environment we expect the change in reserve will be a decrease of 0 to 5 and therefore will have little impact on our capital ratios non interest income increased 10 million as shown on slide 11 customer derivative income increased 7 million including the rate impact on the credit valuation adjustment commercial lending fees increased 2 million with robust syndication activity we also had small increases in several other categories including investment banking brokerage fees and securities trading this was partly offset by a 5 million decrease in card fees as a result of the mix shift in the transaction volumes of government cards as well as two fewer business days in the quarter impacting corporate and merchant card volumes also fiduciary income decreased 1 million mainly due to tax preparation fees received in the third quarter during the quarter we sold our hsa business for a gain of 6 million of note deferred comp asset returns which are offset in non interest expenses were 3 million the same level as the third quarter turning to expenses on slide 12 salaries and benefits increased 4 million this was a result of higher incentive compensation and commissions tied to performance as well as seasonal healthcare expense in addition outside processing increased 4 million due to a better transition fee and seasonality drove a 2 million increase in occupancy expenses as well as several other categories we continue to carefully manage costs as we invest for the future as evidenced by our efficiency ratio of 55 which is well below the third quarter peer average in the fourth quarter we repurchased 150 million or 2 1 million shares under our share repurchase program as shown on slide 13 together with dividends we returned 246 million to shareholders our goal is continue to return excess capital back to shareholders and maintain our cet1 ratio at approximately 10 turning to the rate environment on slide 14 assuming interest rates remain at the current levels the net impact from rates is estimated to be 10 million to 15 million on our first quarter net interest income relative to the fourth quarter this includes the full quarter effect of the recent fed cuts combined with the actions we ve taken to lower deposit rates of course actual results will vary depending on a variety of factors such as libor movements as far as the remaining three quarters of 2020 if rates hold steady we expect to see a relatively smaller residual effect from rates as longer dated assets and liabilities reprice in addition continued hedging activity could have a modest negative impact we continue to work to gradually moderate our asset sensitivity we added 750 million to our hedging portfolio on october and 1 billion in early january we currently have about 5 5 billion in interest rate swaps with an average remaining tenure of about three years and are currently in the money overall we remain positive and constructive on the u s economy and we plan to make steady progress in building our hedging portfolio over time slide 15 provides our outlook for 2020 which assumes a continuation of the current rate and economic environment we expect average loans to grow approximately 2 to 3 in 2020 relative to 2019 we anticipate continued slow steady economic expansion yielding growth in most business lines this is expected to be partly offset by a decline in mortgage banker from elevated levels as refi volumes normalize and a modest reduction in national dealer services driven by predicted reduction in auto sales as far as the first quarter we expect loan growth for most business lines will be mostly offset by a decline in mortgage banker due to seasonality combined with the slowdown in refi activity we expect average deposit growth of 1 to 2 we believe we will have the normal seasonality through the year including the typical first quarter decline our goal is continue to attract and retain long term customer relationships by offering superior products and services along with the appropriate pricing as i discussed on the previous slide the rate impact on net interest income is expected to be mostly absorbed in the first quarter with an additional modest effect for the remainder of the year also the full year expense of higher wholesale funding will have an impact in addition we expect a 6 million to 8 million decrease in non accrual interest recoveries from the elevated level we saw in 2019 loan growth is expected to provide a partial offset we believe our portfolio will continue to perform well resulting in net charge offs similar to 2019 in the 15 to 25 basis point range given the new cecl accounting standards which became effective january 1st and assuming the current economic backdrop we expect provision should be slightly above net charge offs after taking into consideration our loan growth outlook note that this new standard may cause greater volatility in our provision as far as non interest income we expect growth of about 1 led by card and fiduciary fees our expectation includes declines in certain key categories that had strong growth in 2019 such as customer derivative and warrant income also deferred comp which totaled 9 million in 2019 it s hard to predict and is not assumed to repeat as far as the first quarter keep in mind that the fourth quarter included the gain on the sale of the hsa business in addition we had strong derivative income in syndication fees as well as deferred comp of 3 million all of which were dependent on market conditions and therefore may not continue at these levels expenses are expected to increase approximately 3 year over year we expect to see a rise in outside processing tied to fee income growth and increase in technology investments as we execute on revenue and efficiency related projects that are in place in addition we expect inflationary pressures on items such as annual merit staff insurance and marketing as a result of lower discount rate pension expenses increasing about 7 million also recall the first quarter includes elevated salaries and benefits expense due to share annual share compensation and associated higher payroll taxes which are expected to be mostly offset by seasonally lower marketing and occupancy expenses our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23 and as far as capital we expect to maintain our cet1 target of approximately 10 now i ll turn the call back to curt curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank thank you jim the outlook we have provided reflects our expectations for continued moderate u s expansion through 2020 a cooler world economy and the strong value of the dollar remain a headwind for u s trade however many sources of uncertainty that accumulated through 2019 such as china mexico and canadian trade agreements have been or may soon be resolved the interest rate environment looks stable for the year ahead and the labor market in the u s remains strong and will continue to support the consumer sector we believe this backdrop should benefit us and our customers as the year progresses over our 170 year history we have managed through many economic and interest rate cycles with our efficiency ratio in the mid 50s and an roe of nearly 15 we are better positioned to weather changes in the economy or interest rate environment we remain focused on controlling the things we can control to maintain our solid performance our 2019 results demonstrate our ability to grow revenue while maintaining favorable credit metrics and well controlled expenses our key strengths provide the foundation to continue to enhance long term shareholder value specifically our geographic footprint which includes faster growing diverse markets combined with our relationship banking strategy is expected to result in growth of loans deposits and fee income we continue to maintain our prudent expense discipline as we invest for the future also our conservative consistent approach to banking including credit and capital management has positioned us well now we ll be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator our first question will come from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst good morning i guess why don t we start off in terms of the nii outlook i just want to make sure i really understand what you re trying to say here the way i read it is that first quarter s obviously down 10 million to 15 million and then the rate impact is going to be negative on nii so dollars go lower in each subsequent quarter throughout 2020 but then you have presumably you have the asset growth offset to that are you trying to say that nii from a dollar basis is going to be lower than first quarter throughout the year or like how do you see the net impact of all the different factors affecting nii after first quarter thanks curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank do you want to take it jim james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah thanks for the question we will see progressively lower impact from rates as we go through the year i mentioned the 10 million to 15 million in the first quarter it will be a much smaller amount in the second quarter as of now it might be call it the 5 million to 7 million range then it becomes closer to a negligible number in the third and fourth quarter even though we will see some impact all the way through the year and of course i had mentioned to the extent we had hedges and depending on the rates there that will obviously have an impact also we ll obviously pickup the volume as the year goes on and you heard me mention the non accrual impact that overall will be an impact on 2020 compared to 2019 ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst sorry i guess because you i m sure you guys do very detailed modeling for the year is it right to assume that your nii if you look at say fourth quarter of 20 is that going to be lower or higher than first quarter of 20 james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer you should see volume overtake rate once we get beyond the first quarter to answer your question so most of that rate impact is felt in the first quarter and then you are right volume does start to step up and the rate impact starts to decline so you start to see a crossover once you get into the second and third quarters ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst got you okay all right that s helpful i guess maybe just like a second question in terms of fee income you mentioned in i guess in your guidance that assumes things essentially no what is the right word no returns on deferred compensation assets and that s part of the assumptions driving your 1 can you just explain that and is it possible that your fee growth is more than 1 if you do get returns on those assets james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer well obviously deferred comp is a bit of a wild card depends on the market and the market returns on deferred comp so it can actually positive or negative so i d be very hesitant to assume there is going to be any kind of return there in fact it could go the other direction ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst got it understood ok and then just if i could sneak one last one in in terms of your loan growth obviously 2 to 3 i think last quarter you talked about something around nominal gdp and i guess my interpretation of nominal gdp was closer to 4 can you just comment are you seeing weakness or any kind of deterioration i mean presumably you are seeing some weakness and your expectation for loan growth this quarter versus last quarter and what s driving that thanks peter l sefzik executive vice president business bank ken this is peter i think the 2 to 3 that we had communicated we feel good about we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in the fourth quarter and i think we listed the businesses that where we ve seen that there have been some sort of interesting timing on what we ve had in dealer and mortgage but going into 2020 we feel good about our ability to accomplish the 2 to 3 that we ve communicated ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst okay all right great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank john good morning john pancari evercore isi analyst good morning and then also on the nii topic so i guess this outlook implies probably that we got some incremental compression in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter and then could you talk about how the margin should progress beyond that is it fair to assume stable or some incremental compression from there as we move through second third and fourth quarter of 2020 thanks james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer okay yeah happy to answer that we have a couple of factors that we will be netting against each other we did note that we have about 5 bps of compression due to the higher balances plus the excess liquidity that you saw in the fourth quarter when you bring up the net against that the 10 million to 15 million guidance that i offered in the first quarter and progressively smaller amounts after that and so if you do the simple math on that it would imply a modest reduction than the current 3 20 having said that we re always hesitant to provide nim percentage guidance just because it is so impacted by excess liquidity which based on our customer profile is very hard to predict john pancari evercore isi analyst okay got it and then on the expense front you indicated in your guidance that you your expense outlook is impacted in part by higher outside processing expenses related to revenue and you mentioned in your comments too it seems like maybe fee revenue can you talk about what that is and then separately can you talk about what expense levers you may have incrementally as you look at 2020 given the tougher revenue backdrop and any consideration for pulling back even harder on the expense side thanks curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank okay jim you want to start james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah very specific to the outside processing fees so we actually do have some good core growth there a number of line items in 2020 one of those is card income and of course we have associated outside processing fees with that now some of these strong core line item growth areas that we have will be offset by some of the items that i mentioned the very strong year we had in 2019 with syndications warrants derivatives and of course the deferred comp item that we talked about earlier but we do expect a strong card year and we will have some outside processing fees associated with that regarding your second question on where could we pull back we are always very focused on expense control i think we have to keep in mind that we re starting again from a very strong position with 55 efficiency ratio but we do feel it s important to make the proper investments in technology and make sure that we re pushing forward in terms of moving the company to where it needs to be so we are going to continue to invest in technology and don t anticipate pulling back on that at this point in time john pancari evercore isi analyst okay got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jp morgan steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst hey good morning everybody curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank hey steven steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst to follow up first on john s question on expenses so if you look at the 3 expected increase in 2020 is there anything unusual you would call out i mean pension sounds like it was 7 million or do you do you think that s a good run rate for the company here as you continue to reinvest james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah pension would be the only real unusual item there i would say normal inflation including merits would be the largest item so nothing too unique in terms of what makes up that expense base going forward i d be hesitant to call that a run rate what we re really focused on is really operating leverage going forward we do have a bit of a transition year at some of the pension expense and some of the strong non interest income headwinds that we talked about earlier but we re really more focused on positive operating leverage and that s where we expect to get in the future steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay that s helpful and i just was looking for color you guys put up really strong growth in deposits in the quarter do you have more color on why it was so strong james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah it was a very strong quarter we were very pleased with it we talked about being up 1 5 billion but keep in mind we ran off about 700 million brokered cds so the way i look at it is we actually are up around about 2 2 billion or so on deposits so we are very pleased there there is a very concerted effort to go out and deposit gather we priced appropriately where we needed to these are relationships that we poured into the bank none of these were stand alone deposits now i will say that probably at least half of this is seasonal and it s always hard to tell when this money might bleed out during the first quarter but approximately half maybe a little half from what i can tell is seasonal but there is a strong component of it that i think is core and will stick with us through of the year even if we see a minor decline in the first quarter curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank this is curt i might add steven that the relationship component that jim talked about we made a deliberate strategy not to chase sort of hot money or transactional deposits but heavily leveraged our deposit pricing in programs that we ve had in place like our cd program around new client acquisition and acquiring additional deposits from existing customers which i think is the right strategy for us longer term and very consistent with our relationship based approach steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay that s helpful maybe just one final one curt your comments recently about comerica potentially being an acquirer got quite a bit of attention i m curious are you actively having conversations with targets or is this something you re just thinking of really over the longer term thanks curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank yeah steven i think maybe first thing i would say is that if you read the text of anything that has been written on me there is no change in any of our strategies there were few headlines that maybe were i think a little bit misleading and we are very focused on organic growth as we have been for a long time we ve done two acquisitions in the last 20 years and what we said and what i ve said and ralph before me is that if there is something that makes sense in texas and california that would be a good strategic fit and one of the major metropolitan areas and major right economics for our company and for our shareholders we take a look at it but that lands us fairly narrow and so sort of day in and day out we continue to focus on organic growth steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay terrific thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with suntrust curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank good morning jennifer jennifer demba suntrust analyst good morning curt question on asset quality looks like the increase in criticized loans was energy driven just wondering if you guys think charge offs will be higher in that sector this year or lower and are you seeing any other underlying weakness in any other sector in your portfolio thanks james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yes jennifer so we re guiding 75 to 125 basis points in charge offs and if you take a look at 2019 only 4 basis points of ex energy charge offs i don t think that s sustainable so we would expect that ex energy we would see slightly higher charge offs than what we saw in 2019 and we re hopeful that that could be offset fully or at least partially by lower energy charge offs so that remains to be seen but that s where we get the outlook jennifer demba suntrust analyst okay are you seeing any any weakness at all in any other sectors or geography speed at this point james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer no we re really not 4 basis points of ex energy charge offs in 2019 and only 2 million in net charge offs ex energy in the fourth quarter our non accrual levels are very low levels and that includes energy so we re seeing a lot of strength particularly in 48 billion of the portfolio that is ex energy jennifer demba suntrust analyst okay one other question we saw a major transaction announced in texas recently just wondering if you guys are expecting any merger disruption opportunities from that transaction thanks curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank jennifer there s always disruptions that occur in markets when transactions occur but i would say in general there is nothing that strategically changes our focus as an organization and we are in some different segments and some different customer focused in a number of those transactions that have occurred jennifer demba suntrust analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank good morning mike operator mike you may be on mute curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank mike mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst can you hear me curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank yes we can mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst sorry about that so how much was your technology spending last year how much do you think it will increase and what are the areas of technology spending focus curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank yes we jim you want to start on that and then i ll add in around some of the areas of focus james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah mike we don t quote a specific number of technology spending simply because it s so difficult and challenging to get an apples and apples work with other banks and defining exactly what falls under technology budget but i will say we have a as implied in the expense outlook for 2020 we do have a modest increase in technology expense in 2020 over and beyond the strong spend in 2019 so it is something that we continue to invest in curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank and i might just add to that mike that we ve talked before about the gear up initiative having positioned us well from an overall technology spend we did a lot of work the last several years to rationalize many of our applications in some of our aging platforms i think we ve been a leader in terms of the cloud migration especially in non customer interfacing applications and there s a lot of the work we have done around that has helped free up capacity for us for new projects in the last 12 months that has included a new across the company loan origination and servicing platform a new companywide crm platform major investments in data analytics to help us in the marketing and servicing of our clients major upgrades for our call center technology and then for 2020 a number of key areas of focus and items that will be coming online related to upgrades to our atms major upgrades to our banking center infrastructure and technology including enabling all of our employees in the banking center with tablets to make them more mobile in their selling and servicing efforts a pretty major upgrade to our onboarding capabilities on the digital side for our consumer prospecting customers and then fairly significant upgrades to our treasury management platform in the payments area as well as a new portal for our wealth management clients so we continue to be very focused on things that i would put in a category of colleague and customer enablement and like most institutions we have a longer term roadmap we re working on but we feel like we are well positioned relative to our competitors and providing a really good experience to our customers mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and then one follow up i assume you would employ many vendors to help you with this transformation what took place with the vendor transition costs i guess you always have a balance getting vendors to help you facilitate the transition on the other hand there is always the risk of vendor lock in and during this quarter you had a vendor transition cost but can you describe the analysis that goes into selecting vendors how you prepare against too much vendor lock in versus the goal of transforming the company faster curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank i am going to take the sort of second part of your question and then i ll turn to jim for the more specifics around the expense in the quarter we do have a number of key vendor relationships like most institutions given the sales organization we are we try to strike the right balance between proprietary capabilities and leveraging third parties where it makes sense those third parties go through the exact same oversight process that we do as if we were building something or servicing something in house including robust oversight and we believe we ve gotten really good relationships that we can leverage and we try to get to a good point in terms of balance and trying to help concentration issues with any one single single vendor so jim you maybe want to talk about the specifics around the quarter james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah i would say that other than size there is actually nothing real unusual about this vendor transition we re always evaluating our vendors to do the right thing with both ourselves and the customers it s not unusual for us to have a vendor transition this one was a little bit larger but it is something that we re always evolving on in terms of looking at both quality and cost and capabilities and i would just say that this is a one time cost that s larger than typical it s not unusual we have had vendor transitions really every year and sometimes multiple times within a year so that s i think there is probably not a lot more to that other than the size mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst okay thank you curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank thank you mike operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank good morning ken ken usdin jefferies analyst hey thanks good morning question on the deposit cost side of things you mentioned that you saw the 7 basis point decline in costs and just wondering what happens from here in a stable rates environment how much do you continue to have of just natural resetting in deposit costs versus what else from here would have to be more negotiated with across the customer base as you ve talked about in the past thanks james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah happy to answer that we did reprice deposits throughout the fourth quarter as i ve mentioned so even though we saw the 7 basis points decline in the fourth quarter i would expect a continued decline in the first quarter just based off the efforts undertaken thus far the change in the first quarter will be a smaller amount the 7 bps that we saw in the fourth quarter i d probably characterize it based on actions taken to date as being kind of the lower single digits of bps but we will see where things play out there the two things that two or three things that would cause a further reduction one is we did see some mix shift in the fourth quarter the actions that we actually took in the fourth quarter probably would imply a little larger bps reduction but we did see some of our relationship deposits grow related to some of the higher priced accounts so whether or not some of that mix shift unwinds remains to be seen so that could be a tailwind then i would say it really depends on the competition and what happens in the competitive landscape i ve seen a little bit of follow the leader out there in terms of deposit pricing and i think that in turn for the industry will be driven by loan growth and the demand for funding that s certainly true specific to comerica but i think larger picture it affects the entire industry and we re not immune from that so we ll continue to watch the competitive landscape and do the right thing for our customers and for our balance sheet ken usdin jefferies analyst got it and one more question just on the mix of earning assets with all this good deposit growth that you have a lot of it ended up just sitting in cash and unfortunately 10 year still at 1 80 million or so so how do you sort of think about if this deposit growth continues or hangs around does it just stay in cash or given not much of an optionality versus securities book or do you start to flush it back into the securities book over time james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer well we do expect some of these deposits dilute in q1 as we mentioned the seasonality factors both in q4 and the typical q1 seasonality so how much liquidity and excess liquidity we have remains to be seen to the extent we do have excess liquidity i would say it really depends on the interest rate landscape in general we are happy with the size of our securities portfolio and the curve is flattened out but there s not a lot of percentage in tying up that liquidity at this point in time that s something we will continue to monitor but i would not anticipate growing our securities book in terms of size at this point in time ken usdin jefferies analyst all right great thanks a lot curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank thank you ken operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank good morning erika erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning i just wanted to follow up to your response to steve s earlier question on operating leverage obviously in 20 given the poor comparison to 19 nii that s obviously quite difficult but is the message that as we look out into 2021 there is more flexibility for the expense growth to be less than 3 or at least you have more levers to pull it lower than revenue growth curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank so erika this is curt i would say that when you look at the history of our company especially the last year we definitely have had a proven expense discipline and you look at the performance metrics they really are the top of our peer group and we expect them to be near the top of our peer group once everybody reports and especially the efficiency ratio so we know how to manage expenses we ve done a good job of that in our history we remain very focused on expense management there are a few dynamics in play in 2020 that jim talked about and we are going to continue to strike the right balance between managing expenses and investing the things that we need to invest in longer term to help our customers and to serve our customers appropriately and to grow the institution but you should expect for us longer term to remain focused on positive operating leverage and there s always additional levers that we can pull we don t believe strategically that sometimes these are the right things to do and again striking the right balance between investing in technology and things of that nature and that s for the overall expense growth numbers erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and my second question is you bought back almost 1 4 billion worth of stock which really helped in a year when the fed cut three times and with the cet1 ratio just 14 basis points above target how should we think about buyback appetite in 2020 curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank jim james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah we for us it s a pretty simple target in terms of we re simply calibrating what we need to support our loan growth support our dividend and then calibrate that against earnings generation and the goal is simply to come as close to 10 as we can and we ve been in that ballpark the last few quarters and i would anticipate saying plus or minus to that 10 throughout 2020 erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst just as a follow up question i think i ask you this every quarter but can you really just remind us what is your actual capital binding constraint because i m sure a lot of peer or a lot of investors look at the cet1 and its 150 basis points above the targets of some much larger regional banks but if you could remind us what your actual binding constraint is on capital james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah there s a couple of ways to look at that if you look at it from a pure stress testing standpoint the binding constraint would be tier 1 we obviously don t have preferred in our stack but there is another way of looking at it and that is we re always conscious of our constituents and rating agencies regulators customers and from that standpoint the cet1 is a very important ratio too so i m not sure i could say there s just one binding constraint it depends on what perspective you re looking at it from erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thank you curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank thanks erika operator your next question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank good morning michael michael rose raymond james analyst hey good morning just as we think about the efficiency and the technology expense there has been a lot of talk on this call is there any change to kind of the intermediate term profitability roe roa expectations just given the front loading some of the expenses in the revenue environment thanks james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer no we ve enunciated in the past that we expect to be in the low to mid roes we could drop to the more of a low double digit i m sorry just to clarify the low double digit and the double digit roe and we expect to stay in that range in the foreseeable future interest rates will be a significant impact and driver there we ll see where those go but we feel pretty good about the double digit roe going forward at this point still michael rose raymond james analyst okay and then just one housekeeping question just when i look at the npas how much of that is actually energy versus non energy when i look at the commercial bucket thanks james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer yeah mike i don t have that breakdown for you i don t think there is a page do you have the breakout darlene persons director of investor relations 22 james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer page 10 that s on page 10 so michael rose raymond james analyst all right james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer 3 million in energy 156 million in ex energy michael rose raymond james analyst okay sorry i missed that all right thanks for taking my question curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank thanks michael operator your next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson gary tenner da davidson analyst good morning i had a couple of questions one on the energy book as you as you gave your guidance for loan growth in 2020 obviously you highlighted dealer services and mortgage i m curious with the pretty significant decline this quarter in e p and what seems to be still a kind of a challenging outlook for that segment what the appetite is for new lending in that space in 2020 curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank peter peter l sefzik executive vice president business bank gary this is peter so i mean our appetite is that we are still looking for opportunities that i would tell you that they are more limited in this environment that we re in we re not seeing a whole lot of deal flow you re seeing consolidation in the space not a lot of capital coming into it but we re continuing to be a very important energy lender in the space we ve got really good relationships we re going to support our customers and to the extent there is new opportunities that makes sense for us we re pursuing them gary tenner da davidson analyst okay thanks and then secondly on the hsa business i assume that there were some associated deposits with that line of business if so can you just highlight what the amount was james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer you know look its jim those deposits were very negligible they won t even whatsoever that s a fairly small scale business for us gary tenner da davidson analyst all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank good morning peter peter winter wedbush securities analyst i was just wondering i was looking at average loan growth it seemed to have weakened a little bit from the mid quarter update and i m just wondering what drove that what gives you the confidence of the 2 to 3 loan growth in 2020 because first quarter is going to start off kind of flattish curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank thanks peter i will let pete peter w guilfoile executive vice president and chief credit officer i would just remind you again for last year we had 4 year over year loan growth it felt really good it was across kind of most of our businesses in the first part of the year we really saw good loan growth in middle market and i think as we got into the second half of the year we saw little bit really in california and michigan where middle market slowed down a little bit but nothing that overly conservative texas continued to perform really well so as we go into next year we feel like our pipelines in middle market and those markets look really good and we feel good about our specialty businesses again we did see a little bit of a dial back in dealer at the end of the quarter our efs business dialed back a little bit but we still feel really good about those going into 2020 and we feel like we re going to be able to achieve that 2 to 3 that we ve communicated peter winter wedbush securities analyst okay and then on a separate note just one housekeeping the guidance for net interest income in the first quarter of down 10 million to 15 million that does not include one less day count which i think is about 6 million to 7 million is that right james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer that is correct yeah we were simply guiding on the rate impact and we mentioned the 10 million to 15 million so drastically right there will be the one day impact peter winter wedbush securities analyst got it okay thanks very much curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank thanks peter operator your next question comes from the line of lana chan with bmo capital markets lana chan bmo capital markets analyst good morning lana good morning just couple of cleanup questions one on the fee income side the expectations for growth in 2020 from the fiduciary side it was kind of flat in 2019 what s driving growth expectations in 2020 curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank yeah fiduciary specifically lana chan bmo capital markets analyst yeah i think that was one of the drivers of the fee income growth in 2020 card and fiduciary curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank yeah i would say a couple of things related to fiduciary one that s a business that we ve been in for a long time and a business in which we have scale both in serving our existing clients or in the institutional trust business as well and then we have a third party trust platform where we provide trust services for many of the larger broker dealers in the u s and so we see growth opportunities kind of across all of those various budgets fiduciary is also one of those categories that is impacted by the market and so optimistic outlook on the equity and bond markets for 2020 the flattish nature to 2019 nothing unusual there we did have some repositioning with a number of different customers but over time that s a business that we have grown nicely and we would seek for the normal growth in 2020 lana chan bmo capital markets analyst okay thank you and the second question is can you remind me do you have a target dividend payout ratio james j herzog executive vice president and interim chief financial officer we do not our goal of the dividend is simply to make sure that it is sustainable that s really where our focus is and obviously you don t want the dividend payout ratio to get too high if you have a what i ll call a normal income stream which we consider the stream to be somewhat normal right now so simply sustainable and strong and we re comfortable with where it is right now curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank just so to add to that obviously the last four or five years we ve had very nice growth in dividend and returned to our shareholders so we ve been very focused on that and you know you would expect toward the rate of growth for the dividend to start to slow out for the year lana chan bmo capital markets analyst okay thank you appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank good morning brock vilas abraham ubs analyst hey guys this is vilas abraham for brock just a quick question on cecl if you guys could just give a little bit more color on the day two impact how you re thinking about that maybe specifically as it relates to the energy portfolio thanks curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank pete peter w guilfoile executive vice president and chief credit officer yeah so i think the day two of the impact for with regard to energy we have to look at a couple of different factors one is not just our the economic forecast or how the economic forecast would impact energy specifically and so we would expect that there would be modest growth in our reserves for energy just like it would be under the incurred model but we don t expect cecl would impact that to any larger degree than with what we see under the incurred model vilas abraham ubs analyst okay got it that s it from me thanks operator i will now turn the call back over to curt farmer president and chief executive officer for any further remarks curtis c farmer chairman and chief executive officer comerica incorporated and comerica bank as always we appreciate your questions we appreciate your interest in our company and i want to thank you for joining the call today have a very good day thank you operator duration 72 minutes call participants darlene persons director of

virginia democratic governor ralph northam revealed his proposed budget plan for the years 2020 2021 last month the 135 billion budget touted by the governor as the most progressive in virginia s history would consist of minor improvements in spending on education and healthcare largely funded through taxes on poor and working class people while ensuring a business friendly environment for major corporations last november the democratic party gained control of virginia s legislative bodies solidifying the party s control of the state government from the governor s office to the state senate and house of delegates the democrats trouncing of the republicans was both an expression of popular hostility to the fascistic politics of the trump administration as well as an expression of a significant shift of support in the state s wealthy suburbs from the republican party toward the democrats in comments to the washington post northam declared the budget would provide for jobs that can support themselves and their families with they said they wanted their children to have access to a world class education they want access to affordable and quality healthcare they want us to move toward renewable energy they want safe communities and that s what this budget addresses after northam s administration was nearly toppled in early 2019 when yearbook photos from the 1980s revealed what appeared to be the college aged northam posing in blackface the democratic governor has sought to recast himself as a racially sensitive politician in the current budget this takes the form of several minor programs such as a 22 million initiative toward combating mortality rates among minority women and an even tighter adherence to the principles of fiscal responsibility numerous democratic and republican commentators have praised the plan for working to protect the state s prized triple a bond rating in the words of the post it s the most progressive budget that virginia s ever seen but it preserves basic financial integrity governor northam has figured out a way to do both at the same time claims northam s spokesperson grant neely in the same article northam promises a doubling of cigarette taxes from 30 to 60 cents per pack and a 20 percent tax increase on all other tobacco products in order to pay for subsidizing rates that health insurance companies offer patients with more costly needs in addition it calls for a yearly increase in gasoline tax by 4 cents per gallon for the next three years also included in the plan are the cancellation of a republican planned 110 rebate to taxpayers halving the state vehicle registration fee and removing the requirement for annual vehicle safety inspections further transportation fee revamping is also planned in order to find ways to tax alternative fuel vehicles commenting on plans for funding of transportation an editorial in the washington post states under plan the burden of building and maintaining the state s transportation network would shift to the drivers who use highways the most including those from out of state rather than seeking to raise revenue through the minefields of income or sales tax increases northam promises nearly 1 2 billion in spending on education including a 145 million contribution from the state to award state teachers a meager 3 percent wage increase in 2021 over 800 million of this earmarked money would be used for routine expenses included in every state budget while an additional 400 million in funding would be a mere drop in the bucket compared to the total amount that has been stripped from schools since the 2008 2009 financial crisis according to a 2018 report released by rutgers university while virginia is the 12th wealthiest state in the united states it ranks in 49th place or almost dead last in terms of wage competitiveness for teachers likewise state spending per student from kindergarten to high school is down by 9 percent since the 2008 2009 school year while staff positions have fallen by over 1 200 even as the state s total enrollment has grown according to the commonwealth institute for fiscal analysis tellingly 145 million of northam s new budget would be earmarked toward providing free tuition to low income community college students on the condition they also perform community service several hours a week in effect community college students will be deployed as low wage forced labor in some cases replacing regular employees who would be laid off while teachers the poor and other sections of the working class will receive a pittance from northam s supposedly progressive budget business interests will continue to reap windfall profits in the commonwealth of virginia according to the top rating agencies the greater richmond counties are in the top 1 for bond assurances in the united states chesterfield hanover and henrico are triple aaa rated meaning they have received the highest credit rating from each of the major rating agencies in the u s states the website of the greater richmond partnership an economic development organization partnering with the state to direct investment into the region according to the partnership only 47 counties nationwide are triple aaa rated and 10 of them are in virginia this is the highest amount of triple aaa counties in any state followed by maryland with eight and north carolina with five while the state capital richmond is in the top 1 percent for highest bond ratings in the us according to the census bureau the city s population suffers from a 21 9 percent poverty rate as of 2018 much higher than the national average of 13 1 percent recently northam was applauded by state legislators when he was able to secure the deal for web commerce giant amazon s second corporate headquarters dubbed hq2 to be built in suburban northern virginia as part of the deal the state of virginia promised the company 750 million in tax rebates and subsidies for locating the headquarters in the commonwealth which in addition to raising the region s already high cost of living would serve to align the internet giant even more closely with the us military and intelligence agencies last january thousands of teachers descended on the capital city of richmond to demand better funding for education and living conditions part of an international upsurge in the working class led by educators which began in 2018 in opposition to austerity which has only accelerated since then another protest is set for january 27 with so many teachers taking sick leave for that date that richmond public schools will be closed in many of these struggles workers were forced to take action independently of and in opposition to the trade union apparatus who sought to tie workers initiatives to the bankrupt perspective of appeals to the democratic party and to remember in november to vote in supposed progressive legislators teachers were told this would address workers needs as with the democratic party in virginia s latest budget proposal workers were in no way able to find their needs addressed through the ballot box and the election of democratic party candidates instead workers are coming face to face with the reality that only a mobilization of workers and youth in opposition to the pro corporate democratic party and its trade union supporters armed with the perspective of revolutionary socialism and internationalism can their social demands be met

progress in us china trade talks and brexit have led to an improvement in risk sentiment but uncertainty remains on the fate of the us china trade talks plus there are also geopolitical risks in the

intraday bias remains neutral for the moment further fall is mildly in favor as long as 1 1172 resistance holds break of 1 1076 will resume the fall from 1 1239 to 1 0981 support decisive break there will confirm that whole corrective rise from 1 0879 has completed on the upside above 1 1172 will turn bias to the upside for 1 1239 instead in the bigger picture rebound from 1 0879 is seen as a corrective move at this point in case of another rise upside should be limited by 38 2 retracement of 1 2555 to 1 0879 at 1 1519 and down trend from 1 2555 2018 high would resume at a later stage however sustained break of 1 1519 will dampen this bearish view and bring stronger rise to 61 8 retracement at 1 1915 next economic indicators update
