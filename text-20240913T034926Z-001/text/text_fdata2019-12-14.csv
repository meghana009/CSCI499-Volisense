since the turn of the millennium there have been two global bank credit crises the first was the deflation of the dot com bubble in 2001 2 and the second the 2008 9 financial crisis that wiped out lehman brothers it was clear from these events that the debate over moral hazard was resolved in favour of supporting not just the banks but big business and stock market valuations as well furthermore america s budget deficits were becoming a permanent fixture this brings us to the current situation which increasingly appears to be on the edge of another cyclical crisis if so it marks the end of a period of far greater monetary and credit expansion than seen in previous cycles coinciding with a smoot hawley lookalike in the trade war between the two largest global economies the following big picture factors are relevant to the likely timing for a credit crisis global debt has accumulated to an estimated 255 trillion up from about 173 trillion at the time of the lehman brothers crisis an alarming proportion of it is unproductive being government debt consumer loans and funding for financial speculation as well as owed by unviable businesses with annual debt payments already accounting for most of the us budget deficit and that deficit getting larger any rise in dollar interest rates would be ruinous for federal government finances eurozone governments are in a similarly precarious financial position governments are ensnared in a classic debt trap an estimated 17 trillion of global bonds are negative yielding which is unprecedented this is a market distortion so extreme that it cannot be normalised without widespread financial disruption and debtor destruction there is no exit from this condition the repo market crisis in new york indicates the banking system is in intensive care the start of it coincided with the completion of the sale of deutsche bank s prime dealership to bnp it would be understandable if large deposits had failed to transfer with the business and gone to rivals instead the problem has continued indicating that senior bankers groupthink is already turning from greed to fear us bank exposure to collateralised loan obligations and the leveraged loan market comprised mainly of junk loans and bonds is the equivalent of most of the estimated 1 9 trillion sum of bank capital it confirms this article s thesis that the level of ignorance over banking risk is the late stage of the bank credit cycle and likely to be catastrophic the share prices of deutsche bank and commerzbank indicate they are not just insolvent but will need to be rescued and soon banks in other eurozone jurisdictions are in a similar situation however all eurozone countries have passed bail in laws and do not expect to bail out individual banks the upshot is at the first sign of a bail in being considered a flight of large deposits will very likely be triggered and bank bond prices for all eurozone issuers will collapse the room for error in crisis management by central banks is considerably greater than at the time of the lehman crisis eleven years ago an extreme amount of monetary creation over the last ten years and the us china trade war over the last two is horribly reminiscent of late 1929 when the combination of the end of the credit cycle and escalating trade protectionism combined to wreak financial destruction on a global scale even if a halt to the trade war between the us and china is agreed in the coming weeks the crisis has been triggered and our empirical evidence suggests it will get worse it appears that common sense on trade policies is unlikely to prevail because the conflict is far deeper than just trade with the hong kong riots part of the overall picture the chinese believe america has destabilised hong kong and with good reason the us treasury has become dependent on receiving the lion s share of international portfolio flows to support the dollar and finance the us budget deficit and china s own investment demands are a threat with the dollar s hegemony under attack and china seeking those same portfolio flows to invest in her own infrastructure projects through the hong kong shanghai connect link hong kong had to be destabilised for this and other reasons trade tariffs are only part of a wider financial war which is increasingly likely to escalate further rather than abate with his trade policies having backfired badly president trump is now under pressure with time running out before the election in a year s time he is threatened with impeachment by congress over the ukraine affair and his popularity ahead of an election year remains subdued he has even appealed to jay powell chairman of the fed to introduce negative interest rates to boost the economy backing down over china is unlikely because it would be a presidential policy failure what will the developing crisis look like clearly central banks will respond to the next credit crisis with an even greater expansion of money quantity than at the time of the lehman crisis eleven years ago the consequence of this monetary inflation seems certain to lead to an even greater rate of loss of purchasing power for fiat currencies than currently indicated by independent assessments of price inflation monetary inflation is likely to be directed at resolving two broad problems providing a safety net for the banks and big businesses as well as funding rising government deficits therefore the amount of quantitative easing which will be central to satisfying these objectives will soar the effect on markets will differ from being a rerun of the 1929 32 example in one key respect ninety years ago the two major currencies the dollar and sterling were on a gold exchange standard which meant that during the crisis asset and commodity prices were effectively measured in gold today there is no gold backing and prices will be measured in expanding quantities of fiat currency prices measured in fiat currencies will be determined ultimately by the course of monetary policy but in real terms the outlook is for a repeat of the conditions that afflicted markets and economies during and following the 1929 wall street crash a further difference from the depression years is that today western governments have extensive legal obligations to provide their citizens with welfare the cost of which is escalating in real terms add to this the cost of rising unemployment and a decline in tax revenue and we can see that government deficits and debts will increase rapidly even in a moderate recession this brings us to an additional problem likely to be evident in a secondary phase of the credit crisis as it becomes obvious that the purchasing power of fiat currencies is being undermined at a rate which is impossible to conceal through statistical methods the discounted value of future money reflected in its time preference will rise irrespective of interest rate policy consequently borrowers will be faced with rising interest rates to compensate for both increasing time preference and the additional loan risk faced by lending to different classes of borrowers besides closing off virtually all debt financing for businesses and increasingly indebted consumers this will play havoc with governments accustomed to borrowing at suppressed or even negative interest rates prices for existing bonds will collapse and banks loaded up with government debt to benefit from basel committee on banking supervision regulations will find their slender capital if they have any left quickly eroded the world of fiat currencies faces no less than its last hurrah indeed some of the more prescient central bankers appear concerned the current system is running out of road with the dollar as the world s reserve currency no longer fit for this purpose they want to find a means of resetting everything exploring solutions such as digitising currency through blockchains doing away with cash and finding other avenues to try to control the so called vagaries of free markets none of them will work because even a new form of money will require inflation to rescue government finances and prevent financial and economic failure the accelerating pace of monetary creation to address these problems will remain the one problem central to the failure of a system of credit and monetary creation the impossibility of resolving the debt trap that has ensnared us all just as germany found in 1923 monetary inflation as a means of funding government and other economic liabilities is a process that rapidly gets out of its control eventually people understand the debasement fraud and begin to dispose of the fiat currency as rapidly as possible it then has no value the ending of the fiat currency regime is bound to terminate the repeating cycles of bank credit legitimised since 1844 the socialism of money through inflationary debasement will be exposed as a massive fraud perpetrated on ordinary people
by f william engdahl for new eastern outlook moscow and vt and the institute of oriental studies of the russian academy of sciences a research institution for the study of the countries and cultures of asia and north africa paul volcker former chairman of the federal reserve during the 1980 s has died at age 92 major media are writing words of praise for the banker who killed inflation in the wake of the 1970 s oil crises and food price crisis volcker s true legacy is far less positive no one person did more to bring about the dysfunctional debt bloated financial system we have today than the former chase manhattan bank economist who spent most of his life in the employ of america s most powerful oligarch family two major events define the true volcker legacy first was in august 1971 when he was a senior official in the us treasury under nixon the second was as jimmy carter s fed chairman beginning in october 1979 these define the events that led to the deindustrialization of the united states and the economic collapse of most of the once developing world beginning four decades ago the break with gold during the 1960 s the us economy began a serious crisis of under investment the world class industries built up during and just after world war ii from steel to aluminum to detroit cars were all badly in need of modernization and investment europe had rebuilt its industry after the devastation of the war and especially germany and france were competing with us on the world market with often more advanced state of the art industry their economies were earning dollar surpluses for their exports the problem was that those us dollars were no longer backed by the world s strongest economy by the beginning of the 1960s as europe began to grow at rates outpacing that of the united states it was becoming clear to many that something had to change in the ﬁxed bretton woods arrangement but washington under the growing inﬂuence of the powerful new york banking community led by citibank and david rockefeller s chase manhattan bank refused to play by the very rules it had imposed on its allies in 1944 new york banks began to invest abroad in new sources of higher proﬁts this vast outﬂow of vital investment capital turned the decade of the 1960s into a succession of ever worsening international monetary crises new york s international banks were earning huge proﬁts by walking away from investing in america s future between 1962 and 1965 u s corporations in western europe earned between 12 and 14 per cent return according to a january 1967 presidential report to congress double that for us industry investment by the end of the 1960 s european central banks were holding large dollar surpluses from trade and investment urged by washington not to redeem them for gold as allowed under bretton woods french president charles de gaulle on advice from his economic strategist jacques rueff criticized the johnson administration for ignoring the 1944 bretton woods agreement by refusing to revalue the dollar price of gold rueff had proposed a 100 dollar devaluation to restore fairness and stability to the monetary order wall street and the washington administration rejected anything of the sort it would reduce the power of the us international banks bretton woods was a gold exchange standard which set every currency to the us dollar and only the dollar to gold at the fixed price of 35 it held since the great depression in the 1930 s in 1944 the us was by far the world industrial leader and held the vast majority of central bank gold so bretton woods was reluctantly accepted by other countries but by the 1960 s exploding us budget deficits mainly caused by costs of the growing war in vietnam in effect exported dollar inflation to us allies beginning the mid 1960 s major countries led by france and later germany began to demand the us federal reserve redeem their dollar trade surpluses in gold from the new york fed custodian for the us government gold in 1959 the external liabilities of the united states still approximated the total value of her ofﬁcial gold reserves by 1967 the us total of external liabilities had soared to three times that gold reserve at 35 an ounce european and other central banks began to redeem their dollars and demand gold from the us government in 1967 france determined to exchange its dollar and sterling reserves for gold leaving the voluntary 1961 group of 10 gold pool arrangement by 1971 with nixon as president the dollar crisis was growing untenable as official gold was down to only 25 of us foreign liabilities if all dollar holders demanded gold the us couldn t redeem with gold prices on world markets rising by the day dollar holders were demanding us gold for the paper jacques rueff continued to plead for a 70 gold price arguing that that would calm speculation and let the us redeem the eurodollar balances abroad without causing severe us economic damage it would have made us industrial exports far more competitive and sparked a revival of us industry as well he argued instead nixon followed the advice of his treasury and notably that of the under secretary for international monetary affairs paul adolph volcker volcker had come to the treasury from the post as vice president at david rockefeller s chase manhattan bank david rockefeller and volcker were to cross paths continuously in the coming decades on august 15 1971 nixon announced formal suspension of dollar convertibility into gold effectively putting the world fully onto a fiat dollar standard with no gold backing he unilaterally ripped up a us bretton woods treaty agreement and the world was forced to swallow the huge negative consequences of floating exchange rates four months later in a compromise known as the smithsonian agreement which nixon called the most significant monetary agreement in the history of the world sic the united states formally devalued the dollar a mere 8 per cent against gold placing gold at 38 instead of the long standing 35 a meaningless move wall street had beaten main street and us industry it was the actual beginnings of american deindustrialization in favor of what later would be called globalization years later volcker would call his role in the suspension of gold convertibility the single most important event of his career by 1973 nixon s secretary of state henry kissinger another rockefeller protégé orchestrated events that erupted in the october 1973 yom kippur war a war that was actually manipulated to trigger an opec oil embargo that would raise the price of the world s most valuable commodity by 400 in months the us dollar though few understood had gone from a gold backed currency to a petrodollar backed currency washington made sure opec would sell oil only in us dollars a pact that held until saddam hussein broke it decades later paul volcker s role in august 1971 to decouple the dollar free from gold was key to the petrodollar strategy saudi arabia iran and others in opec recycled their huge petrodollar gains to london where chase manhattan and other new york and london banks relent it to developing countries at low floating interest rates fed chairman kills inflation by 1979 the dollar was in a new crisis as the toppling of the shah in iran led to a second major oil price spike and a dollar crisis a troubled jimmy carter was convinced by his good friend david rockefeller to name paul volcker as chairman of the fed to calm markets and stabilize the dollar volcker had left washington in 1974 to become president of the new york federal reserve he was also one of the founding members of david rockefeller s highly influential and little known trilateral commission along with zbigniew brzezinski and a georgia peanut farmer named jimmy carter carter owed his presidency to david rockefeller and filled his cabinet with trilateral members when volcker took control of the federal reserve by october 1979 he unleashed a monetary shock that sent fed interest rates to 20 in weeks and plunged the us economy into the most severe collapse since the 1930 s he claimed it was necessary to squeeze inflation out of the system volcker blamed the inflation on trade unions and small producers who were simply struggling to keep up with soaring prices of energy and food when volcker convinced nixon to break with gold in 1971 that triggered the first rise of post 1945 inflation as the dollar s value plummeted making import prices higher nixon tried to stop it with wage price controls in 1971 that restricted business activity slowed growth before carter became president in 1977 nixon had ordered the fed to get rid of the effects of oil and food in the consumer price index the result was the fake number known as core inflation minus oil and food in his interest rate actions after october 1979 volcker never mentioned the true inflation came from david rockefeller s machinations in the 1970 s with opec instead he argued the population s rising living standard was the problem in defending his controversial monetary shock therapy volcker notably told the new york times david mcnally the american standard of living must decline decline it certainly did as the economy was plunged into deep recession from 1980 through 1982 with unemployment above 10 as bankruptcies across construction farming and industry deepened by 1982 the soaring dollar interest rates had devastated the entire world economy owing to the primacy of the dollar it triggered what came to be known as the third world debt crisis from mexico argentina brazil to yugoslavia poland and beyond the volcker interest rate policy combined with his decoupling of the dollar from gold set the stage for what has been the greatest inflation of all the world inflation from 1971 through today between 1971 and the early 1990 s shortly after volcker left the fed the volume of dollars in world circulation has expanded by more than 2 500 as gold no longer limited creation of dollars paul volcker should be remembered but for what he really did not the mythology invented by his backers on wall street his entire career like that of his long time associate kissinger was tied to the rockefellers volcker left the fed in 1987 and was named to the trust committee of the rockefeller group he was long time member of rockefeller founded bilderberg and trilateral commission groups as well as chairing the wall street investment firm wolfensohn co of james d wolfensohn who later became president of the world bank if we trace the actual actions of paul volcker from 1971 on we better understand the origins of the crisis the world economy is in today f william engdahl is strategic risk consultant and lecturer he holds a degree in

the us dollar remains at a critical juncture as fed policy will be on hold for the foreseeable future and as we start to see an economic rebound come out of europe the world s largest and strongest economy is likely to start to see economic growth slow in the fourth quarter further cementing the belief that the fed will have no changes in policy for the foreseeable future with europe starting to have some major macro events fall into place for them we could see the dollar react more to rebounding european data than to sluggish numbers from the us the overall tone with risk appetite will focus on both the aftermaths of the uk general election and the details with the phase one deal agreement between the us and china the focus will also fall onto the whether we see an improvement in china s november activity data and a plethora of rate decisions the boj and boe are widely to keep policy unchanged but we could see sweden s riksbank tighten policy while mexico s banxico cuts rates gbp whatever you think of the uk election result it s clear that this result partially lifts the cloud of uncertainty that s held back the currency and the economy for so long as the old adage goes the markets hate uncertainty as we know they re not too fond of brexit either but that s a discussion for another day for now no deal brexits have vanquished the upcoming boe meeting will be governor carney s last meeting and to be honest more attention will probably be paid on who boris johnson picks to be the next governor it will be interesting to see how much reference the policy statement provides regarding the election outcome eur the december flash pmi surveys and german ifo business confidence report could have serious impact on whether we see eur usd breakout higher if the bottom is in place for economic growth in the region we should see continue to see services remain resilient and upticks with the manufacturing readings oil from a macro economic perspective oil prices could rip higher after both trade and brexit uncertainty have been alleviated in the short term oil could still rally another 5 here despite oversupply concerns for the first half of 2020 because investors have been overly negative with their demand side forecasts gold gold has remained resilient throughout the 24 hour wave of global risk appetite because the dollar is finally breaking it seems remarkable that gold is higher after a phase one trade deal seems imminent brexit no deal risks have been wiped out and we are in the midst of a massive global stock market rally gold could see further momentum after the euphoria of this risk on move is faded investors will still have appetite for safe havens as we enter a very lengthy brexit transition phase and are not anywhere close to seeing a broader us china trade deal bitcoin bitcoin remains in consolidation mode again between 7 000 and 8 000 regulatory hurdles remain and fresh cryptocurrency frauds have kept bitcoin closer to the lower boundaries of its recent trading range volatility has somehow managed to avoid bitcoin over the past week but that should not last as we near the may halving event and as we continue to see strides made with mainstream acceptance mxn positive trade news boosted the mexican peso against the dollar this week the peso appreciated from weekly lows of 19 29 down to briefly breaking below 19 after a us china limited trade deal could be announced soon the usmca also got the necessary tweaks to get the rubber stamp from the democrats as the us mexico and canada representatives hammered out the revisions emerging markets in general are trading higher as risk appetite is on the rise after a potential truce is now close to a reality anonymous sources claim the deal could already be signed just waiting for an announcement before the december 15 tariffs kick in some of the positive momentum will be less next week as the mexican central bank is expected to cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points the rate cut is already priced in but in the last meeting two out of the five members voted for a 50 basis points cut economic data has been disappointing and although under less pressure if trade news is to be believed the mexican economy is struggling to get out of the technical recession it fell into earlier this year country hong kong protests have kicked off again with record numbers turning out last weekend they were reportedly peaceful and this was the first demonstration that had been officially sanctioned warnings about a self imploding economy seem to be falling on deaf ears and tuesday s unemployment rate could turn nasty as always there is the risk that protests turn violent again which would be negative for the hk33 index usd hkd is still in the upper half of the trading band china we re still waiting for an announcement regarding the phase 1 trade deal between the us and china both sides remain in constant daily contact reportedly and are always close to a deal china s export numbers released last weekend were dismal and may jolt china toward a faster deal recent talk is that the december 15 imposition of more tariffs by the us will be either postponed or suspended on monday we see china s industrial production and retail sales data ip has been surprisingly robust but the weak exports data might suggest the downside is vulnerable india indian equities have been sliding since the rbi failed to cut its benchmark rate last week there are no major data points to impact markets next week australia the next major focus for australia will be thursday s release of the november jobs report given that the rba has said it will be a major data point to influence monetary policy a weak number will push the rba toward a more dovish stance new zealand the nz economy appears to be steadily plodding along q3 growth data are due on thursday and expectations are for 2 0 y y after 2 1 in q2 a rebound in dairy prices has helped the kiwi but a weaker gdp print will be bearish for the local dollar latam politics latin american leaders might be breathing a sigh of relief at a us china tariff truce as the prolonged trade war took its toll in emerging markets which in turn heightened wealth inequality making social protests a common occurrence in the region the protests in santiago are ongoing and have taken the peso to record lows central bank and government intervention reduced the fall of the currency but it is only now with trade optimism that a recovery can begin the biggest risk is another disappointment when the two sides appear close to a deal this would not be the first time this has happened the urgency of the situation and the high political states for donald trump ahead of an election year could pave the way for a deal that if struck would boost risk appetite uk politics now that boris johnson has massive majority markets will look to see how hard of a brexit will he pursue brexit risks remain as we still could see eu trade talks completely fall apart a tremendous amount of nationalization risk has been lifted but now the clock begins for johnson to get all of their trading relationship agreements done next year business want certainty over the transition period and until we get that we could see limited rallies in sentiment and investment us politics now that the house judiciary committee is moving forward with two articles of impeachment against president trump we will see this get voted through in the house but ultimately this will not get voted through the republican held senate impeachment risks are still minimal for the president and his odds for re election are higher than ever key economic releases and events sunday december 15th 5 00 pm aud dec flash manufacturing pmi no est v 49 9 prior 7 30

overcame those frustrations i think he s gained more respect over time in this role said mark chandler head of canadian rates strategy at rbc capital markets poloz took over from carney at a time when the country was climbing out of the deepest recession in decades a prolonged period of low interest rates had pushed household debts to among the highest of any developed nation leaving the governor tightly wedged between mediocre economic growth and fast expanding consumer credit i think he s gained more respect over time in this role mark chandler head of canadian rates strategy at rbc capital markets his first major test came when oil prices suddenly collapsed in mid 2014 sending the wider economy into a tailspin poloz shocked the market with a sudden rate cut in early 2015 followed by a second cut months later reducing the overnight rate to 0 5 per cent the move both solidified what proved to be a prescient move by poloz while also laying bare the limits of monetary policy in the

bank shortly after the appointment four years before the end of his term but poloz gradually won the confidence of bay steet in part through a communication style that unlike his predecessor would readily convey the unknowns and uncertainties in the bank s economic models it s part of his aw shucks we don t know everything that the previous guy knew communication style ragan said he probably trades on that a little bit and that s okay he would say there are things the bank doesn t know things that i as a governor don t know things that the economics profession doesn t know and i think that s extremely healthy another of his trademarks was a stand against debt poloz was uncommonly outspoken about rising consumer debt levels across canada and often expressed his worries over a heated housing market advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s something that s reasonably different than what other governors have done in the past said jean françois perrault chief economist at scotiabank unfortunately that also muddles a little bit the approach to monetary policy he added some analysts have disagreed with poloz s decision to continue holding rates especially in recent months when trade rifts between the u s and china kicked off a wave of cuts at central banks around the globe over the last few weeks one could make a very good case that there was a need for lower interest rates in canada to guard against risks perrault said scotiabank had predicted the bank would cut rates in october or december the wisdom of poloz s move remains to be seen particularly with canada s current interest rate of 1 75 per cent being the highest among advanced economies meanwhile consumer debts have continued to rise canada s household debt in 2018 averaged 181 per cent of total income well higher than the united states 109 per cent germany 95 per cent and others according to the organisation for economic co operation and development that could be among his more unfortunate legacies at the bank rbc s chandler said concerns about household debts had already begun to surface when poloz took over from his predecessor when the canadian economy was taking its long slow climb back to health seven and a half years later debt levels are even higher chandler said so if that

former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan called paul volcker the most effective chairman in the history of the federal reserve but while volcker who passed away december 8 at age 92 probably did have the greatest historical impact of any fed chairman his legacy is at best controversial he restored credibility to the federal reserve at a time it had been greatly diminished wrote his biographer william silber volcker s policies led to what was called the new keynesian revolution putting the fed in charge of controlling the amount of money available to consumers and businesses by manipulating the federal funds rate the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other all this was because volcker s shock therapy of the early 1980s raising the federal funds rate to an unheard of 20 was credited with reversing the stagflation of the 1970s but did it or was something else going on less discussed was volcker s role at the behest of president richard nixon in taking the dollar off the gold standard which he called the single most important event of his career he evidently intended for another form of stable exchange system to replace the bretton woods system it destroyed but that did not happen instead freeing the dollar from gold unleashed an unaccountable central banking system that went wild printing money for the benefit of private wall street and london financial interests the power to create money can be a good and necessary tool in the hands of benevolent leaders working on behalf of the people and the economy but like with the sorcerer s apprentice in disney s fantasia if it falls in the wrong hands it can wreak havoc on the world unfortunately for volcker s legacy and the well being of the rest of us his signature policies led to the devastation of the american working class in the 1980s and ultimately set the stage for the 2008 global financial crisis the official story and where it breaks down according to a december 9 obituary in the washington post mr volcker s greatest historical mark was in eight years as fed chairman when he took the reins of the central bank the nation was mired in a decade long period of rapidly rising prices and weak economic growth mr volcker overcoming the objections of many of his colleagues raised interest rates to an unprecedented 20 drastically reducing the supply of money and credit the post acknowledges that the effect on the economy was devastating triggering what was then the deepest economic downturn since the depression of the 1930s driving thousands of businesses and farms to bankruptcy and propelling the unemployment rate past 10 mr volcker was pilloried by industry labor unions and lawmakers of all ideological stripes he took the abuse convinced that this shock therapy would finally break americans expectations that prices would forever rise rapidly and that the result would be a stronger economy over the longer run on this he was right contends the author soon after mr volcker took his foot off the brake of the u s economy in 1981 and the fed began lowering interest rates the nation began a quarter century of low inflation steady growth and rare and mild recessions economists attribute that period one of the sunniest in economic history at least in part to the newfound credibility as an inflation fighter that mr volcker earned for the fed that is the conventional version but the stagflation of the 1970s and its sharp reversal in the early 1980s appears more likely to have been due to a correspondingly sharp rise and fall in the price of oil there is evidence this oil shortage was intentionally engineered for the purpose of restoring the global dominance of the u s dollar which had dropped precipitously in international markets after it was taken off the gold standard in 1971 the other side of the story how the inflation rate directly followed the price of oil was tracked by benjamin studebaker in a 2012 article titled stagflation what really happened in the 70 s we see that the problem begins in 1973 with the 73 75 recession that s when growth first dives in october of 1973 the organisation of petroleum exporting countries declared an oil embargo upon the supporters of israel western nations the 73 75 recession begins in november of 1973 immediately after during normal recessions inflation does not rise it shrinks as people spend less and prices fall so why does inflation rise from 73 75 because this recession is not a normal recession it is sparked by an oil shortage the price of oil more than doubles in the space of a mere few months from 73 74 oil is involved in the manufacturing of plastics in gasoline in sneakers it s everywhere when the price of oil goes up the price of most things go up the spike in the oil price is so large that it drives up the costs of consumer goods throughout the rest of the economy so fast that wages fail to keep up with it as a result you get both inflation and a recession at once terrified by the double digit inflation rate in 1974 the federal reserve switches gears and jacks the interest rate up to near 14 the economy slips back into the throws of the recession for another year or so and the unemployment rate takes off rising to around 9 by 1975 then in 1979 the economy gets another oil price shock this time caused by the revolution in iran in january of that year in which the price of oil again more than doubles the result is a fall in growth and inflation knocked all the way up into the teens the federal reserve tries to fight the oil driven inflation by raising interest rates high into the teens peaking out at 20 in 1980 y 1983 the unemployment rate has peaked at nearly 11 to fight this the federal reserve knocks the interest rate back below 10 and meanwhile alongside all of this ronald reagan spends lots of money and expands the state in 82 83 why does inflation not respond by returning because oil prices are falling throughout this period and by 1985 have collapsed utterly the federal funds rate was just below 10 in 1975 at the height of the early stagflation crisis how could the same rate that was responsible for inflation in the 1970s drop the consumer price index to acceptable levels after 1983 and if the federal funds rate has that much effect on inflation why is the extremely low 1 55 rate today not causing hyperinflation what fed chairman jerome powell is now fighting instead is deflation a lack of consumer demand causing stagnant growth in the real producing economy thus it looks as if oil not the federal funds rate was the critical factor in the rise and fall of consumer prices in the 1970s and 1980s stagflation was just a predictable result of the shortage of this essential commodity at a time when the country was not energy independent the following chart from business insider australia shows the historical correlations the plot thickens but there s more the subplot is detailed by william engdahl in the gods of money 2009 to counter the falling dollar after it was taken off the gold standard u s secretary of state henry kissinger and president nixon held a clandestine meeting in 1972 with the shah of iran then in 1973 a group of powerful financiers and politicians met secretly in sweden to discuss how the dollar might effectively be backed by oil an arrangement was finalized in which the oil producing countries of opec would sell their oil only in u s dollars and the dollars would wind up in wall street and london banks where they would fund the burgeoning u s debt for the opec countries the quid pro quo was military protection along with windfall profits from a dramatic boost in oil prices in 1974 according to plan an oil embargo caused the price of oil to quadruple forcing countries without sufficient dollar reserves to borrow from wall street and london banks to buy the oil they needed increased costs then drove up prices worldwide the story is continued by matthieu auzanneau in oil power and war a dark history the panic caused by the iranian revolution raised a new tsunami of inflation that was violently unleashed on the world economy whose consequences were even greater than what took place in 1973 once again the sharp unexpected increase in the price of crude oil instantly affected transportation construction and agriculture confirming oil s ubiquity the time of draconian monetarist policies advocated by economist milton friedman david rockefeller s protégé had arrived the bank of england s interest rate was around 16 in 1980 the impact on the economy was brutal appointed by president carter in august 1979 paul volcker the new chief of the federal reserve administered the same shock treatment to the american economy carter had initially offered the position to david rockefeller chase manhattan s president politely declined the offer and strongly recommended that carter appeal to volcker who had been a chase vice president in the 1960s to stop the spiral of inflation that endangered the profitability and stability of all banks the federal reserve increased its benchmark rate to 20 in 1980 and 1981 the following year 1982 the american economy experienced a 2 recession much more severe than the recession of 1974 in an article in american opinion in 19179 gary allen author of none dare call it conspiracy the rockefeller files 1971 observed that both volcker and henry kissinger were david rockefeller protégés volcker had worked for rockefeller at chase manhattan bank and was a member of the trilateral commission and the council on foreign relations in 1971 when he was treasury undersecretary for monetary affairs volcker played an instrumental role in the top secret camp david meeting at which the president approved taking the dollar off the gold standard allen wrote that it was volcker who led the effort to demonetize gold in favor of bookkeeping entries as part of another international banking grab his appointment now threatens an economic bust volcker s real legacy allen went on how important is the post to which paul volcker has been appointed the new york times tells us as the nation s central bank the federal reserve system which by law is independent of the administration and congress has exclusive authority to control the amount of money available to consumers and businesses this means that the federal reserve board has life and death power over the economy and that is paul volcker s true legacy at a time when the fed s credibility was greatly diminished he restored to it the life and death power over the economy that it continues to exercise today his shock therapy of the early 1980s broke the backs of labor and the unions bankrupted the savings and loans and laid the groundwork for the liberalization of the banking laws that allowed securitization derivatives and the repo market to take center stage as noted by jeff spross in the week volcker s chosen strategy essentially loaded all the pain onto the working class an approach to monetary policy that has shaped fed policy ever since in 2008 09 the fed was an opaque accessory to the bank heist in which massive fraud was covered up and the banks were made whole despite their criminality taking the dollar off the gold standard allowed the fed to engage in the quantitative easing that underwrote this heist bolstered by opec oil backing uncoupling the dollar from gold also allowed it to maintain and expand its status as global reserve currency what was volcker s role in all this he is described by those who knew him as a personable man who lived modestly and didn t capitalize on his powerful position to accumulate personal wealth he held a lifelong skepticism of financial elites and financial innovation he proposed a key restriction on speculative activity by banks that would become known as the volcker rule in the late 1960s he opposed allowing global exchange rates to float freely which he said would allow speculators to pounce on a depreciating currency pushing it even lower and he evidently regretted the calamity caused by his 1980s shock treatment saying if he could do it over again he would do it differently it could be said that volcker was a good man who spent his life trying to rectify that defining moment when he helped free the dollar from gold ultimately eliminating the gold standard was a necessary step in allowing the money supply to expand to meet the needs of trade the power to create money can be a useful tool in the right hands it just needs to be recaptured and wielded in the public interest following the lead of the american colonial governments that first demonstrated its very productive potential this article was first posted on truthdig com
many people have the impression that recessions come from financial missteps such as the us subprime loan fiasco if energy is involved at all the problem comes from high oil prices as supply becomes inadequate to meet demand the real situation is different we already seem to be on the road toward a new crisis this crisis is likely to be much worse than the great recession of 2008 2009 this time a major problem is likely to be energy prices that are too low for producers last time a major problem was oil prices that were too high for consumers the problem is different but it is in some ways symmetric last time the united states seemed to be the epicenter this time my analysis indicates china is likely to be the epicenter last time the world economy was coming off a high growth period this time the world economy is already somewhat depressed even before hitting headwinds these differences plus the strange physics based way that the world economy is organized explain why the outcome seems likely to be worse this time than in 2008 2009 i recently explained what i see as happening in a presentation for actuaries recession likely expect a bend in trend lines this post is based on this presentation omitting the strictly insurance related portions the big thing that the vast majority of people do not understand is how important energy is to the economy because of this issue i started my presentation with this slide slide 4 larger image at this link using data from smil as well as more recent bp data we can estimate how fast energy consumption has been growing over a very long period nearly 200 years we can see that the highest energy consumption growth occurred in the 1961 to 1970 period the second highest growth occurred in the 1951 to 1960 period these are periods we associate with rapid gdp growth and prosperity on the next slide i show the same data displayed in a different way slide 5 larger image at this link on this slide i make two changes in the way the data are displayed the increases in energy consumption are split into two components a energy used to support population growth and b all other which i describe as energy used to support improvement in living standards a different graphing approach is used note that when population growth corresponds to the full amount of energy consumption growth in other words at times when there is no red area above the blue area energy consumption per capita is flat high growth in energy consumption per capita seems to correspond to rising living standards as occurred in the 1950s and 1960s while i label the all other category as if it is simply changes in living standards there are other components as well one breakdown might be the following true improvement in living standards additional energy investments required to offset diminishing returns increasing use of energy for overhead items that don t get back to individuals such as energy used to fight pollution or to allow globalization efficiency improvements allowing available energy to be more productive efficiency improvements item 4 will allow more energy to be available for improvement in living standards while items 2 and 3 in the above list act in the opposite direction we do not know to what extent these items really offset each other thus all other improvement in living standards is only a rough approximation we can see from slide 6 that whenever there is no red area above the blue area flat living standards or flat energy per capita adverse events seem to happen for example the us civil war 1861 1865 came at a time of low energy consumption growth the great depression of the 1930s came during another period of low energy consumption per capita growth world war i came at the beginning of this period and world war ii came at the end the collapse of the central government of the soviet union in 1991 ushered in a decade of low world energy consumption growth in part because of the loss of the central currency of the soviet union the china coal note at the end pertains to the way that china and its coal supply has helped pull the world economy forward since 2001 this benefit seems to be already declining slide 7 shows china s energy production by fuel coal production in red soared after china was added to the world trade organization in december 2001 beginning about 2012 china s coal production began to plateau depleting mines and low prices for coal have kept production flat imports can be used as substitutes to some extent but it is difficult to keep costs low enough and provide adequate total supply with the loss of growth in china s coal production its economy has had to cut back each year we read about coal mine closures and miners needing to find new jobs we know that china discontinued its paper and plastic recycling business as of january 1 2018 china has also been cutting back on solar subsidies leading to fewer jobs installing solar panels all of these types of changes reduce the number of people who can afford to buy high priced goods such as new homes vehicles and smart phones it is becoming increasingly clear that china is being forced to cut back on heavy industrialization because of its coal difficulties slide 8 shows automobile purchases for six large economies china is by far the largest of these economies in terms of auto sales china s auto sales began to slide in 2018 and are sliding further in 2019 about 11 if we look back at the time of the 2008 2009 recession we see that auto sales of the us dropped precipitously the united states was the country that led the world into recession the inability of us citizens to buy cars was a sign that something was seriously wrong now we are seeing a similar pattern in china china has reported that its gdp growth rate has been slightly lower during 2019 but we really don t know how much lower the amounts it publishes are too smooth to be believed the actual gdp growth rate is believed to be lower than the recently reported 6 0 but no one knows by precisely how much figure 8b gives a little more information about recent car sales by country we can see from this chart that based on data through october 2019 world automobile sales are expected to fall by about the same percentage 3 in 2019 as during the recession year of 2008 i find this disturbing we can also see the huge impact that china has had on keeping world private passenger auto sales rising the world economy looked like it was headed into recession in january 2016 when world oil prices were very low but a spike in china s automobile sales at that time helped keep total world automobile sales rising and allowed world oil prices to rise from their low point in the next sections i provide some background regarding this story slide 10 shows the way that i visualize the world economy self organizing and growing the economy grows by adding new layers of businesses products consumers and laws unneeded products such as buggy whips are dropped from the bottom unprofitable businesses close in some sense the economy is hollow because of these deletions it cannot easily go backward because for example the support services for widespread use of transport using horses are lacking energy is used to operate all aspects of the system one part of the system is a self organizing financial system that helps decide through wage levels who gets the benefit of the goods and services that are made this financial system includes self organizing interest rates and self organizing commodity prices the most important connection within the economy is the one i show at the center as consumers employees consumers are very dependent on their wages as employees if the economy is to continue to operate workers must receive high enough wages to purchase the goods and services the economy produces even the lower paid workers need to be able to afford food housing and transportation or the economy will tend to collapse when we look back through the history on slides 4 5 and 6 we see that the growth of energy consumption is very important in how economies operate the theories of ilya prigogine explain why this is the case when adequate flows of energy are available self organizing systems are able to grow few economists today include energy consumption in their models however economic theory has grown over time in its own ivory tower like other academic subjects it depends on early theories and the process of peer review the views expressed must also be pleasing to those in power who would like everyone to believe that politicians rather than the laws of physics are in charge there are many types of self organizing systems that grow they all directly or indirectly require energy plants and animals of all types are self organizing systems that grow hurricanes grow using the energy that they get from warm water governments grow from the tax revenue that they are able to collect they use the revenue to buy energy products such as electricity to operate governmental offices oil to build roads and operate police cars and natural gas to heat buildings advertisement the internet grows through the revenue collected to provide its services the internet uses revenue to buy computers made with energy products and electricity to operate those computers nearly all 0f the energy we use is hidden for example modern food production is very much dependent on energy consumption agricultural machines are made using energy products soil amendments including organic soil amendments are transported using fossil fuel energy refrigeration is possible through the use of energy hybrid seeds are only possible through energy consumption planting seeds by digging with a stick would only use human energy but such a process would be terribly inefficient most of us can easily recognize today s goods and services such as those listed promises of future goods and services act like promises of future energy supplies this happens because creating goods and services that people can actually use requires energy supplies of the appropriate type when people get cash or a check they expect to use it to buy goods and services creating these goods and services requires energy consumption if there is no energy of the right type available the goods and services won t be available to fulfill the promises promises of future goods and services tend to grow faster than actual goods and services because it is these promises that in some sense pull the economy along for example if a young person gets a loan s he can often buy a new car the fact that a new car is being purchased leads to more jobs in the supply line leading up to new car production or if a business takes out a loan or sells shares of stock it can use the proceeds to hire employees it is these growing wages that keep the system operating as long as the economy is growing rapidly the mismatch between growing debt and actual output doesn t become apparent as the economy slows some workers find themselves working fewer hours some businesses become less profitable and lay off workers to try to restore profitability the catch is with fewer workers the economy slows even more it usually takes more debt at lower interest rates to get out of such an economic slowdown there is a lot of confusion about prices demand is what people through their wages and debt can afford as economists tell us price depends on supply and demand in the short term prices tend to bounce around a lot the short term buyers of oil are oil refineries they need to keep their employees busy if they see a shortage of oil they may bid up the price of oil to allow their workers to continue to be employed over the longer term prices of all energy products tend to depend on consumers ability to afford finished products like cars homes and cell phones producing these objects and shipping them takes energy they also use energy as they operate the various energy prices shown here are simply a few of the many many energy prices that we see around the world strangely enough prices of all energy products tend to fluctuate together over the longer term prices depend on affordability of end products such as cars homes computers food and clothing our problem since about 2012 has been lack of affordability of end products the primary way of raising affordability is by increasing productivity increased productivity is made possible by increasingly leveraging human labor with devices that are built with energy and are operated using energy for example a worker with a ditch digging machine is much more productive than a ditch digger with only a shovel an analyst is more productive with a computer and internet access than with only pencil and paper with higher productivity more goods are produced in total as long as not too much of this productive output is skimmed off the top by governments or by business hierarchy or to pay for the devices and their fuel it is possible for each worker to afford more goods and services raising total demand an alternative way of raising affordability is by adding more debt at ever lower interest rates this approach tends to make goods such as cars homes and factories appear more affordable because their monthly payments are lower this added debt approach only works as long as the economy is growing quickly enough if the economy slows too much the added debt leads to financial crashes of many types many people think that they know the amount of oil that can be extracted based on the current technology and the assumption that prices will eventually rise high enough to extract all of the fossil fuels that seem to be available for example the international energy agency has prepared reports in which it shows expected oil availability if oil prices rise to 300 per barrel the catch is that even if oil prices can bounce high it is not clear that they can stay very high the current price of oil is only in the 55 to 65 per barrel range a price of 300 per barrel will allow oil extraction using very advanced technology we don t have any evidence that oil prices can stay this high because demand comes primarily from wages prices cannot stay high without adequate support from wage levels of course the issue is not just oil prices staying sufficiently high natural gas coal uranium and electricity prices all have difficulty rising high enough and staying high enough commodity prices such as copper and steel have the same issue there are many people who say of course oil prices will rise oil is a necessity they forget that it is really a two way tug of war between producers getting a high enough price to be profitable and consumers getting a low enough price to be affordable there will be a winner and a loser people also forget that most commodity use is hidden we see the fuel we buy for our personal vehicles but there are a huge quantity of oil products required for shipping goods paving roads growing food and for many other uses that we are not aware of while we might be able to pay a little more to fill our gasoline tank most of us would not be able to simultaneously pay more for food transported goods of all kinds and road maintenance economists often assume that if energy prices rise wages will rise as well if we look at the data historically however it doesn t work that way at all what happens is the opposite average wages tend to rise as long as oil prices stay low once oil prices spike average wages tend to flatten out the amounts shown on slide 24 are average wages computed by taking the total inflation adjusted wages for the population in total and dividing by population when oil prices spike recession soon sets in the reason why average wages fall is partly because more people become unemployed other workers find it necessary to accept lower paying jobs many people focus on the run up in oil prices to july 2008 an equally important point is the fact that the world economy has not been able to maintain these high prices since july 2008 the general price trend has been downward the cuts by opec have not had a material impact citizens of the united states europe and japan are used to thinking of high energy prices as being a problem because they are from countries that require substantial imported energy to maintain their gdp for example greece will sell fewer trips on its tour boats if oil prices are high this will have an adverse impact on employment and the ability to repay debt with interest if a country is an oil exporting country low oil prices are an even worse problem this happens because oil exporting countries tend to earn a large share of their revenue from taxes on the sale of oil these taxes can be much higher if oil is selling for say 120 per barrel than if it is selling for 60 per barrel these tax dollars are used to provide subsidies to offset the high cost of imported food they are also used to build industry and infrastructure to provide employment to the population if oil prices are too low oil exporting countries will tend to cut back on oil production in fact this has been happening for opec for the entire year of 2019 similar problems occur if commodity prices of any kind coal natural gas uranium steel copper etc stay too low for an extended period producers go bankrupt or they stop production or they pay their employees so poorly that the employees go on strike sometimes they may even start rioting many of the riots around the world today are related to low commodity prices the world experienced spiking oil prices in the period leading up to mid 2008 these high prices caused a recession and much lower prices followed the chart on slide 28 gives a somewhat exaggerated
the great american shakedown the democratic party and its liberal supporters are perplexed they presented hours of evidence of an impeachable offense although they studiously avoided charging donald trump with impeachable offenses also carried out by democratic presidents including the continuation or expansion of presidential wars not declared by congress exercising line item veto power playing prosecutor judge jury and executioner to kill individuals including u s citizens anywhere on the planet violating due process and misusing executive orders because civics is no longer taught in most american schools theyâ devoted a day to constitutional scholars â who provided the civics 101 case for impeachment the liberal press cheerleading the impeachment process saturated the media landscape with live coverage interminable analysis constant character assassination of trump and giddy speculation and yet it has made no difference â public opinion remains largely unaffected article by chris hedges republished from truthdig com perhaps supporters of impeachment argue they failed to adopt the right technique perhaps journalists by giving voice to opponents of impeachmentâ who do indeed live in a world not based in factâ created a false equivalency between truth and lies maybe asâ bill grueskin a professor at the columbia university journalism school writes impeachment advocates should spend 1 million to produce a kind of movie trailer for all those who did not sit through the hours of hearings to â boil down the essentials of the filmâ and provide â a quick but intense insight into the characters setting the scene with vivid imageryâ to entice people to come back to the theatre a month later for the full movie â or perhaps they need to keep pounding away at trump until his walls of support crumble the liberal class and the democratic party leadership have failed even after their defeat in the 2016 presidential election to understand that they along with the traditional republican elites have squandered their credibility no one believes them and no one should they squandered their credibility by promising that the north american free trade agreement nafta would as claimed by president bill clinton create 200 000 new well paying jobs per year instead several million jobs were lost they squandered it by allowing corporations to move production overseas and hire foreign workers at daily wages that did not equal what a u s unionized worker made in an hour a situation that obliterated the bargaining power of the american working class they squandered it by allowing corporations to use the threat of â offshoringâ production to destroy unions suppress wages extract draconian concessions and push millions of workers into the temp and gig economies where there are no benefits or job security and pay is 60 or less of what a full time employee in the regular economy receives they squandered it by forcing working men and women to take two or three jobs to support a family jacking upâ household debtâ to 13 95 trillion they squandered it by redirecting wealth upward so that during the clinton administration alone 45 percent of all income growth went to the wealthiest 1 they squandered it by wiping out small farmers in mexico driving some 3 million of them off their lands and forcing many to migrate in desperation to the united states a human tide that saw the u s right wing and president trump direct mounting rage toward immigrants they squandered it by turning our great cities into urban wastelands they squandered it by slashing welfare and social service programs they squandered it by supporting endless futile wars that have an overall price tag of between 5 trillion and 7 trillion they squandered it by setting up a surveillance system to spy on every american and then lying about it they squandered it by catering to the big banks and gutting financial regulations precipitating the 2008 economic meltdown they squandered it by looting the u s treasury to bail out banks and financial firms guilty of massive financial crimes ordering the federal reserve to hand over an estimated 29 trillion to the global financiers responsible for the crash they squandered it by not using this staggering sum instead to provide free college tuition to every student or universal health care repair our crumbling infrastructure transition to clean energy forgive student debt raise wages bail out underwater homeowners form public banks to foster investments in our communities at low interest rates provide a guaranteed minimum income and organize a massive jobs program for the unemployed and underemployed whose ranks are at least double official statistics they squandered it by cutting child assistance programsâ most drastically during the clinton administrationâ resulting in 16 million children going to bed hungry every night they squandered it by leaving over half a million americans homeless and on the streets on any given day they squandered it by passing laws that keep students burdened by massive college loan debt that has climbed to 1 4 trillion debt they cannot free themselves from even if they declare bankruptcy they squandered it by militarizing police and building the worldâ s largest system of mass incarceration one with 25 of the worldâ s prison population they squandered it by revoking due process and habeas corpus they squandered it by passing massive tax cuts for the rich and for corporations many of whichâ such as amazonâ pay no federal income tax ballooning theâ federal deficit now at 779 billionâ and climbing they squandered it by privatizing everything from intelligence gathering to public education to swell corporate bank accounts at taxpayer expense they squandered it by permitting corporate moneyâ an estimated 9 9 billion will be spent this presidential election cycle on political advertisingâ to buy politicians in a form of legalized bribery that sees corporate lobbyists write legislation and create laws they squandered it by doing nothing to halt the looming ecocide the problem is not messaging the problem is the messenger the mortal wounds inflicted on our democratic institutions are bipartisan the traditional republican elites are as hated as the democratic elites trump is vile imbecilic corrupt and incompetent but for a largely white working class cast aside by austerity and neoliberalism he at least taunts the elites who destroyed their communities and their lives the shakedown that trump clumsily attempted to orchestrate against the president of ukraine in the hope of discrediting joe biden a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election pales beside the shakedown orchestrated by the elites who rule over americaâ s working men and women this shakedown took from those workers their hope and more ominously their hope for their children it took from them security and a sense of place and dignity it took from them a voice in how

welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up we ll hear a truly fascinating interview with keith weiner of monetary metals and the gold standard institute keith tells us what led him to devote his second career to developing a new gold standard as a solution to our nation s monetary problems keith also explains why the dollar or federal reserve note is deeply immoral so don t miss a wonderful interview with keith weiner coming up after this week s market update gold and silver markets edged up this week but remain mired within a longer term consolidation phase last friday it appeared that silver was at risk of breaking down below its trading range for this fall but prices recovered early this week and finished thursday right back at the 17 00 level where silver has been drawn to like a magnet so the bullish scenario suggested by us and our guest expert greg weldon during last week s podcast is still in play we had noted that gold and silver mining stocks were breaking to the upside and outperforming the metals that outperformance continued again this week especially in the silver miners spot silver currently checks in at 16 95 per ounce up 1 7 since last friday s close and gold is up 0 8 for the week to trade at 1 473 an ounce bigger gains are being posted by base metals and pgms copper prices jumped nearly 3 this week to hit a 7 month high platinum despite giving back nearly 20 so far today still shows a weekly gain of 3 3 to trade at 930 and finally palladium continues to defy gravity up 2 2 for the week to reach another record high at 1 929 per ounce it has fallen though today after threatening to reach nearly 2 000 an ounce in early day trading here on friday industrial metals are benefiting from on again off again now on again trade progress with china they are also reflecting rising inflationary pressures in the economy bolstered by the federal reserve s latest and most explicit policy messaging yet on wanting to engineer higher rates of inflation fed chairman jerome powell is now talking up inflation in ways that nobody in his position ever has before at a press conference on wednesday powell went so far as to call for a significant and persistent move up in inflation jerome powell in order to move rates up i would want to see inflation that s persistent and that s significant a significant move up in inflation that s also persistent to move inflation expectations up from where they are which appears to be a bit below 2 will not happen overnight it ll have to happen over time as credibility is built the fed has great inflation credibility but inflation expectations are anchored at about their 25 year average which is a few ticks below 2 and that underscores i think the challenge of getting inflation to move up the committee has wanted inflation to be at 2 squarely at 2 for ever since i arrived in 2012 and it hasn t happened and it s because of disinflationary forces around the world and they ve been stronger than i think people understood them to be but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate under appropriate policy for reasons they have never made clear to the public powell and company are upping the inflation ante from 2 to 2 plus overshoots why are they are so obsessed with making sure the value of the u s dollar goes down at a more rapid pace well the obvious but unspoken reason is because they want to promote spending and consumption punish savers and bail out debtors the largest debtholder being the u s government it needs more dollars to be created somehow since tax revenues are falling far short of spending commitments including interest payments owed on more than 23 trillion in outstanding debt uncle sam and his partners at the fed would like to see the real value of debt diminished through inflation without triggering a corresponding increase in interest rates one way to help achieve that objective is to convince the bond market to anchor its inflation expectations to an understated measure the fed has convinced everyone that inflation is running persistently under 2 because the inflation gauge it uses produces a lowball number the central bank s preferred core personal consumption expenditures index is running at an estimated 1 6 year on year but inflation as measured by the consumer price index is running at 2 1 annually according to the latest data reported by the bureau of labor statistics on wednesday other alternative measures show consumer costs rising at a much faster clip for example analysis from gordon haskett research advisors showed that a basket of 76 typical items from walmart and target has gone up by about 5 this year housing rents are now climbing at a 5 4 rate medical and education costs are also each rising by over 5 annually when you consider that the fed s balance sheet is now surging at a double digit rate thanks to the new quantitative easing program that the fed refuses to call qe we seem to have a serious inflation problem that threatens to spill over into the economy the fed would have us believe it s a problem of too little inflation jerome powell can continue to say that with a straight face only so long as hard asset prices remain depressed but when gold follows palladium s lead to new record highs the fed s inflation mask will come off well now to hear about how gold can play a key role in restoring sound money to our monetary system and much more let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in keith weiner ceo and founder of monetary metals and president of the gold standard institute usa keith is a hard money advocate who has been an outspoken proponent for the gold standard and restoring sound money to our nation s monetary system keith has a phd from the new austrian school of economics and his articles have appeared in numerous publications on internet sites throughout the globe and it s a real pleasure to have him on with us today keith thanks so much for taking the time and welcome keith weiner hey mike thanks for having me on mike gleason well keith i think a good place to start would be to have you explain a little bit about your efforts to bring about the restoration of a gold standard as a primer give us some background on why you believe it s necessary in returning confidence in the dollar and what kind of change it would bring to our nation s finances which as we both agree is quickly running off the rails so how did you get to the point why are you so passionate about this cause and ultimately why is it needed keith weiner so i was a classic computer nerd at one of the computer science school dropped out because i got bored wanted to build a software company which i did from 1994 2008 sold my software company which is called diamondware to a little company called nortel networks the transaction was august 19th 2008 that happened to be the last acquisition that nortel ever did they immediately right after that began spiraling out of control and entered bankruptcy by january 2009 and then i closed my transaction with a cash deal heading into the fall of 2008 the first it seemed very surreal to me if i was setting in 100 cash profession and too big to file banks watching everything go on sale but then as things continued to go on i began to become more and more alarmed and realized that the standard explanations for this didn t make any sense i dove deeper and deeper into markets and economics just to understand and protect myself the deeper i got in the more i realized how serious the problem was and it clicked for me that i wanted my next venture to be part of the solution and it was obvious even before i started to study economics too much it was obvious that the solution had something to do with gold if it was a normal world my next venture would have been another software company but given the world as it is i wanted to be part of the solution and that was that was gold mike gleason now as many listening may already know we are fellow travelers and with the sound money defense league a money metals public policy project we ve been working on removing the sales and capital gains taxes on gold and silver at the state level among other things you were deeply involved in the success in arizona so you know it can be an uphill battle but success is possible one of our allies in this cause is congressman alex mooney from west virginia now you recently wrote an open letter to congressman mooney about hr5404 the bill he introduced which would define the dollar as a fixed weight of gold in that letter you outlined why defining a dollar in terms of the fixed weight would be akin to price fixing and therefore dangerous but you certainly support sound money so is there a practical way to relink the dollar to gold what would a workable gold standard look like keith or would a different approach be better keith weiner so if you look back to 1792 the first coinage act the dollar was not linked to gold the dollar was a definition of a certain weight of gold or silver and so we ve had a series of evolutions or maybe arguably call them de volutions in the century since 1792 the net result of which is that by 1971 nixon infamously and if you haven t seen by the way there s a youtube of him in his little speech in 1971 infamously severing the last link between a dollar and gold so for the last 47 years the 47th anniversary will be coming up august next month after 47 years the dollar has been a pure irredeemable paper product that has no relationship whatsoever to gold to put this in perspective what that means is when somebody borrows a dollar or somebody lends a dollar there is no expectation that gold has anything to do with the transaction how do you come along and retroactively declare that actually it was a gold transaction we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us and so i think in my letter i m trying to remember what i said and what i didn t say to congressman mooney if you borrow let s say 100 000 and the government comes along and retroactively says now the dollar is linked to gold that means effectively your repaying gold so if the gold price was set low let s say a 100 that means it ll take you 1 000 ounces of gold to get out of debt you ll be working the rest of your life and your sons lives and their sons lives and probably never get out of debt on the other hand if the gold price was 50 000 then would take only two american gold eagles that you hand over to your creditor and you re out of debt and so i think it ll be the biggest worthy lobbying that washington has ever seen with all the creditors and this in counterintuitive all the creditors wanting a very low price of gold meaning that it would take lots and lots of ounces they would be paid lots and lots of ounces for debtor to get out of debt and all the debtors would want a very high price of gold which means it would take very few ounces to get out of debt so i think i said to him i applaud your intentions i applaud where you re trying to go with this obviously but i don t think that s a practical mechanism for getting there mike gleason yeah certainly sounds pretty dangerous just like you described now it seems pretty far fetched frankly to be talking about a return of some sort of gold standard yes congressman mooney introduced a bill but we doubt many of his peers in the mainstream are anywhere near supporting this kind of measure in what context do you think congress might actually pass an honest money bill keith is it going to take a total collapse in the dollar or do you sense there is the makings of a viable political movement here keith weiner all i can say of a total collapse i pray it never happens if you look at 476 ad it was pretty horrific and the recovery took about 1 500 years before the world was back to the level achieved under rome in u s history there s been a number of cases where we ve had a bad or evil institution and americans without necessarily having that crisis had come to realize is wrong and repealed it the first doesn t quite fit my criteria that being the end of slavery obviously there was a war over that but in more recent decades you had end of prohibition and you had the end of jim crow and now we are having i believe were having i think there letting them allow the end of marijuana prohibition and also what s called right to try for terminally ill patients to get access to drugs that haven t been fda approved yet in each of these cases i think it was cato institute published a book called bootleggers and baptists the analogy being the baptists are the moralizers who provide cover for an evil institution lets says prohibition as being a little bit less emotional charged and there was whole temperance movement the idea being if you drink it was sinful and so forth and there s a bootlegger that profiteer off of it and if alcohol is in the free market that s an above margin product like any agricultural commodity it s like bottled water or bottled soda there s not a lot of money to be made on it but if you make it illegal then suddenly alcohol becomes a very expensive commodity and so according to this cato book bootleggers and baptists have this unholy alliance working together to keep something illegal and yet something happened and what happened was the american public finally came to realization that this was wrong that you can t just make alcohol illegal it has all kinds of damaging consequences to doing it the government doesn t have the right to do that and when the questions starts getting made and people start coming on board with the idea that this needs to end then it comes to end and that came to its end and then subsequent to that was jim crow and now marijuana and i think generally same drivers and so could that happen with money i think it could provided people come to that same realization that what we currently have is outrageous it s unfair it s immoral when people come to that realization it will change and probably not a minute before mike gleason expand on that what s immoral about it keith weiner so when they pass a series of laws and we ll broadly call them legal tender laws we are forced to use their debt as if it were money so think about that what we call money is a dollar it says federal reserve note on the dollar bill bill being an old word for credit a note being a word for credit a promissory note we re using their debt as if it were money now fdr did this in 1933 when he made gold illegal to possess as in criminal as in go to prison for possessing gold the way it is for cocaine today when he made it illegal for people to possess gold that forces people to treat the government bond as if that was a conservative risk free asset in fact if you ask any regulated financial professional today what s a risk free asset they ll say the government bond and so it forces everybody to turn to the government and become a lender government as if that was a risk free proposition and of course i think it s probably pretty well known in your audience that the federal reserve right on their website says that their stated policy target is two percent debasement per annum so you re forced to save enough paper and they have a monetary policy of stealing two percent per year so i called it immoral because first of all you have no right to force people to use something and secondly if you do force them to use something you have no further right to then try to rob them at two percent per year mike gleason very good explanation there and it kind of leads me into my next question you spoke about bonds and i wanted to ask you about one of the benefits of gold in your view is the idea of gold bonds please explain this concept for folks who may not be familiar and tell us why you believe that states and individuals both should start adopting the issuance of gold bonds keith weiner so bonds is are the payment of interest on gold and i think sort of the broader answer to everything we ve been talking about today so far my response to congressman mooney would be if you want gold to begin circulating you have to issue a gold bond you have to pay interest on gold interest is the one thing that would pull gold out of private hoards and into circulation people have been hoarding gold for at least 5 000 years they have been hiding it from their governments and from their neighbors i had an interesting experience a couple of years ago i was giving this talk about the gold hoard and how nobody talks about how much gold they have so i was at a club called the phoenix roadrunners they re this group of gold prospectors who literally go up in dem there hills looking for gold i know they find some because at the start of the meeting they gave away like three nuggets one that somebody had contributed to the newsletter one to somebody who was really helpful with the new members and one to a third person for something or other then it was my turn to talk so i said raise your hand if you have some gold any amount of gold raise your hand you know mike not a single hand went up and there was i think 250 300 people in the room including the three people that just got handed gold nuggets not a single hand goes up so i said thanks for proving my point that people have been hiding this from everybody for thousands of years traditionally this was the sort of thing fathers didn t even tell their kids until on their deathbed they would summon their oldest son and say son we have ten ounces of gold under the kitchen floorboards under the stove or whatever they would do because it was so dangerous i mean the government could take it the government could declare you to be a criminal or a traitor your neighbors could come steal it or slit your throat in the middle of the night it was the sort of thing nobody wanted to talk about nobody wants to acknowledge having it and the thing that will pull it out is interest if you say to somebody lend me your gold i ll pay zero then the answer is i don t have any gold if you talk to somebody and said lend me your gold i ll pay you five percent well there was a semi famous incident involving j p morgan around one of the banking panics i believe it was 1907 i haven t found the documentation for that if somebody comes up to you and says mr morgan mr morgan there s a crisis in new york there s a shortage of gold what are we going to do and so he said raise the interest rate four percent he said will draw it off the continent and if you think about it in those days steamships and the costs and risks and time to get gold from europe to new york five percent he said will pull it down off the moon and so what he was doing was first of all illustrating the principle of how interest draws gold into the market and secondly bracketing it and saying four percent of hyperbole five percent is fantasy so in a talk i gave recently and i put this in one of my papers i saw a picture of a gold bond hanging on the wall of the harvard club in new york this was a railroad bond issued in 1905 it had a 92 year maturity and it paid three and a half percent interest obviously gold and so interest is the thing that makes the gold flow for a state government such as nevada and i ve been in a lot of discussions with the nevada government about this there s a completely different proposition and a very practical one actually two number one so the state has a lot of gold mining going on in nevada it s the number one state for gold mining in the u s they produce about 160 tonnes of gold here every year so the state gets i believe its five percent royalty or tax on the gold production so the state has a gold income and that s really the key to the whole thing now the state of course sells the gold or has the miners sell the gold and so the state has the dollar proceeds from the sales of the gold and the state obviously is servicing conventional dollar bonds with this gold income which means the state has a mismatch it has a gold income servicing a dollar bond or dollar liability which means if the price of gold ever goes down the state suddenly has an unexpected budget shortfall a budget deficit so the first proposition to refinancing its paper bonds with gold bonds is it will eliminate the risk of this deficit eliminate the gold price risk that it is currently incurring the second thing that i think is the more interesting one and that is the gold bond provides a mechanism to get out of debt and that mechanism is when the state options off the gold bond my proposal is don t sell it for dollars you re not trying to raise dollars if you want to raise dollars sell regular bonds and don t sell it for gold you re not trying to raise gold gold itself is not really a use to you if you re the state of nevada tell the buyers that they have to bid in existing nevada dollar bonds that is they have to tender go to the market and buy some nevada paper and then tender that redeem that ultimately for the gold bond in exchange so it s a mechanism to redeem one form of debt which is dollars which is irredeemable debt normally and exchange that for the new gold bond which the state can amortize because it has a gold income the mining tax that we just talked about now what this does is it sets up an exchange ratio between paper bonds and gold bonds so let me put some numbers to this and make this pretty straightforward so today that gold price is around 1 250 an ounce let s say the state were to sell 1 000 ounce gold bond that means that bond a thousand ounces is worth 1 25 million dollars so what you d expect to happen in the first option is that buyers say okay you re giving 1 25 million dollars worth of gold we will buy and bring it to you 1 25 million dollars worth of outstanding paper bonds to exchange for the gold bond however we re not talking about gold delivered today this is a bond we re talking about gold or dollars payable in 10 or 20 or 30 years so now you start to think the dollar s being debased at two percent per year that s the fed s target and of course they can over shoot what is that dollar going to be worth in 10 or 20 or 30 years versus what is the gold going to be worth and so what i expect will happen is the market will then offer more than 1 25 million dollars worth of outstanding nevada bonds in exchange for a thousand ounce gold bonds that as the market will retire existing nevada state debt at a discount in order to get the gold bond so that mechanism of retiring the debt at a discount is a huge benefit to the state if the state ends up retiring its debt at a 20 percent discount that s a huge benefit the state couldn t get any other way mike gleason yeah it s very fascinating hopefully something that will actually gain more traction there s some tremendous advantages in all of that as you just explained as we begin to wrap up here keith give us your take on the markets today about whether or not you think we have honest price discovery and where we go from here in the metals keith weiner the broadest thing is no we don t have honest price discovery because the government teaches us their propaganda from the age of two that gold is just a volatile commodity and the dollar is money but in a narrower sense i think anybody who wants to buy physical gold or gold futures can do so and i think there s a market that provides the clearing price for that at any given moment mike gleason well i certainly want to thank you for your time it was a very enjoyable conversation and we definitely support your efforts in pursuing and getting more traction to see sound money restored to our nations monetary system and more and more people will hopefully look at gold and silver as a solution to the global financial problems so keep up the good work and i hope we can speak with you again and follow this as it continues to develop take care keith keith weiner thanks i look forward to it mike mike gleason well that will do it for this week thanks again to keith weiner of monetary metals and the gold standard institute for more information the web addresses are monetary metals

the outcome of britain s recent parliamentary elections should not come as a surprise to anyone the british prime minister boris johnson and the conservative party had sought a clear mandate from the people to get brexit done with 364 seats they got it hopefully now cooler heads should prevail and do a stock taking of what the economic cost of this vote will add up to as one would expect there will be some short term costs which could be justified by countervailing long term benefits the margin of the tory victory was a surprise though while all polls leading up to the vote were indicating that the pro brexit ruling party was ahead of the labour party by 10 12 points the quantitative extent was not anticipated britain s effort to get out of eu was handicapped by the slim majority that the conservative party won in 2015 under david cameron the majority then disappeared in the 2017 election which the next pm theresa may had called in the hope of increasing the lead in the house of commons since margaret thatcher s 1987 victory with 376 seats which was termed a landslide the tories never attained the same level of popularity until now what does all this mean for the british economy barring a major revolt or a palace coup in the victorious conservative party uk will leave eu on january 31 2020 between today and the new brexit day we might see three immediate impacts the british pound will get stronger against the euro and could attain the 1 20 level against it a benchmark reached immediately after the 2016 referendum consumer confidence during the christmas season will lead to a major boost in retail sales finally one should not be surprised if trade talks between uk and non eu countries get a jump start a beneficial fallout for the british economy is the significant reduction in uncertainty in the short run i e until december 31 2020 the brexit uncertainty was crippling the british economy in the medium term there will still be a degree of leftover uncertainty driven by the need to work out a trade deal with eu before the transition period ends on december 31 2020 knowledgeable authorities are sceptical about the pm s contention that there is absolutely zero prospect of the uk being forced to leave without a trade deal with eu in 11 months our experience with trade talks indicates that these often drag on for years uk also will now embark on trade negotiations with the rest of the world and there might be uncertainty there too progress in negotiations with the usa china uae japan and south korea may depend on britain s long term relationship with the eu and they may want to wait to see what that looks like before spending a lot of time and effort on negotiating with the uk there will be some hard bargaining between uk and eu in three areas trade migration and regulatory alignment brussels chief brexit negotiator michel barnier has already voiced concerns indicating that uk eu negotiations could last maybe two three four years for some areas to rebuild everything that is having to be unpicked as a result of the desire of those who wanted brexit the long term prospects for boris johnson s dream of reshaping the uk economy into a low regulation singapore on thames will depend on how accommodating the european leaders are in this regard there are already signs of discomfort in european capitals including paris and the hague barnier has privately voiced fears about johnson s desire to undercut the eu s level playing field in state aid and tax regulations a move that would hinder any tariff free trade agreement however uk s economy which grew at its slowest annual pace in nearly seven years in october will get a shot in the arm the tory election manifesto made a swath of promises to convince the voters that a new era will emerge if johnson gets the votes he sought a few of these were part of his brexit roadmap and others to broaden the electoral base for the party for example he assured the electorate that he will promote a buy british campaign once uk was unbound from eu rules that will obviously be a direct benefit of brexit another spill over effect from brexit is the possibility of helping out struggling british industries to boost domestic demand post brexit uk can freely adjust fiscal and monetary policy including rate cuts quantitative easing benefits under social programmes additional capital spending and reduction in vat samuel tombs an economist with pantheon macroeconomics opined that even though the economy was growing more slowly than expected the promises of looser fiscal policy by the main political parties would reduce the need for lower interest rates the tory party in a break with the past has offered a programme to channel money for expanded public services and investment for infrastructure projects outside london to narrow the divide between the northern and southern regions this is a major departure from its own creed of thatcherism under the conservatives britain has cut its budget deficit from 10 percent of the gross domestic product gdp in 2010 to about 2 percent now johnson s hope that brexit will unleash a great tide of investment into britain may take a little while to materialise but liam fox the international trade secretary declared my department will continue to promote the strengths of the uk as a great inward investment destination with an open liberal economy world class talent and business friendly environment boris johnson has pitched two ideas to support british agriculture and industry one of them is to provide incentives to buy british agricultural products he also pledged to use brexit to introduce new state aid rules change state purchasing policies and reform farming so that pubic bodies aim to buy british goods the second policy reversal for johnson is the promise to come to the aid of industries in trouble this is a clear break from long held thatcherian policy to let the ill and sick industries die under eu rules a subsidy to a failing industry is considered unlawful since the free market principle implies that factories that cannot compete must be allowed to close or regain competitiveness on its own johnson announced that he will change state aid rules to make it faster and easier for the government to intervene to protect jobs when an industry is in trouble other changes in the offing are lower vat on fuel stricter immigration rules and tax cuts for construction and research industries incidentally it is not clear what the impact of reduced immigration from eu might be the director general of confederation of british industry has warned that johnson s plans to reduce immigration risked a skills shortage what are the risk factors affecting the cheery picture i painted above there are four i the failure to reach a deal with eu by the end of 2020 ii the inflationary effects of the burgeoning public debt iii stalled negotiations with the rest of the world on trade technology and climate change and iv lower gdp growth due to global uncertainty and slowing economic growth as an american newspaper the washington post cautioned the victorious pm untangling 45 years of integration with europe not only on trade finance migration and manufacturing but also on security intelligence aviation fishing medicine patents and data sharing will take another year or more of hard fought negotiations with europe and will almost certainly dominate headlines and consume the agenda in westminster dr abdullah shibli is an economist and works in information technology

purpose i look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy they provide a good nowcast of the economy and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available they also are an excellent way to mark your beliefs to market in general i go in order of long leading indicators then short leading indicators then coincident indicators a note on methodology data is presented in a just the facts ma am format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized where relevant i include 12 month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right all data taken from st louis fred unless otherwise linked a few items e g financial conditions indexes regional fed indexes stock prices the yield curve have their own metrics based on long term studies of their behavior where data is seasonally adjusted generally it s scored positively if it s within the top third of that range negative in the bottom third and neutral in between where it s not seasonally adjusted and there are seasonal issues waiting for the year to year change to change sign will lag the turning point thus i make use of a convention data is scored neutral if it is less than half as positive negative as at its 12 month extreme with long leading indicators which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole there s an additional rule sata is automatically negative if during an expansion it has not made a new peak in the past year with the sole exception that it s scored neutral if it s moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high recap of monthly reports november data started out with a blockbuster employment report including the unemployment rate the blue collar wage growth and the leading metrics in the report ism manufacturing however remained in contraction and services were more weakly positive auto and truck sales improved october data

the economists hour is quite a fascinating book by binyamin appelbaum that traces the major influences of well known economists on policy making economists have traditionally not been regarded highly for policy making and often lawyers were given precedence they were valued for their ability to think but not quite for being able to do practical things it was probably the depression and its aftermath which gave them practical importance and since the second world war they have had their hour while being concentrated in the us geography as well as political history following the world war up to contemporary times the author explains how economists like milton friedman arthur laffer and george stigler etc wielded considerable power over policy making such was their influence that they were able to have considerable impact in countries like the uk which is not surprising but also china chile and taiwan where economists with such leanings were imported to formulate policy in fact these countries had used the services of economists including friedman to formulate their approach for economic development and hence a lot of economic liberalisation could be attributed to their theories alexander cairncross was welcomed in china while margaret thatcher had no use of his work in britain the common thread in their prescriptions was that markets should determine everything as the government everywhere was the problem therefore from the period 1969 to 2008 which is almost four decades us policy in particular was directed at deregulation which was looked as a panacea for all economic ailments keynes and his economics dominated post depression years in 1964 under president johnson walter heller got in the three major government programmes that are now followed in several countries in different forms medicare and medicaid health issuance of food stamps and subsidies heller agreed active management was not good but intervention was required for sure under president nixon too it was keynes that prevailed with high levels of spending that led to inflation it was then that the wheels turned and the new breed of economic values got ingrained friedman steered policy making and his brand of monetarism which came to be called fresh water school as against salt water school covering harvard princeton and columbia etc where the existing order was espoused the basic premise is that the market does better than what several bureaucrats sitting together can do and the underlying theme was in markets we do trust interestingly two specific arguments which flowed from market economics of friedman which affected american society were in areas of conscription and rent he looked at conscription as a tax on humanity which did not pay well and was analogous to the dictates of the pharaohs of ancient egypt who used slaves to build their pyramids with constant lobbying he had these rules annulled and the youth joined the military out of patriotism and were supported by market based pay similarly rent controls were used as an argument for preserving equality but led to housing shortage as the rich did not buy property to rent out because of these controls removing them helped in reviving the housing market he was supported by economists like frederich hayek who attacked any action that would potentially lead to socialism president jimmy carter got in paul volcker as head of the federal reserve and reversed the spending principle and blamed excess profligacy while ronald reagan blamed government spending volcker on his part blamed the unions for higher wages and inflation he therefore continued to increase interest rates which choked growth when president reagan ruled arthur laffer had his hour with the supply side phenomenon which became very popular as tax cuts and expenditure increases became reganomics and across the atlantic uk under thatcher followed the same principles laffer used taxes as tool but got support from friedman as it meant less government intervention through lower taxation which is what the market wanted economists also had their way with corporate policies and the author highlights the anti trust legislation which was used in the usa to curb monopolistic power companies like general electric ibm and microsoft have all been under the scanner the focus was always on ensuring that consumers get goods and services at the lowest prices here economist george stigler had his hour as he worked against such laws and propagated antitrust laws to control government intervention the premise was that that the government should not try to fix anything that is not broken by doing so the system was justifying unions and regulation which led to sub optimal states the same was extended to utilities by alfred kahn which ended up with significant deregulation while this is the good part of the story appelbaum towards the end highlights that such policy transformation during the economists hour has led to funnelling of the benefits to a small plutocratic minority this goes back to the theory of piketty which is now gaining acceptance across the world as the economic structure has gotten skewed in favour of the capitalist the financial crisis was the result of unbridled use of markets as a solution for everything the market is not right if it is controlled by the elite which has been the case in most countries the economists hour is very well researched and shifts across countries and time periods to blend the views of liberal economists with the prevalent regimes with a little bit about the background of the protagonists this should provide inspiration for economists who want to make a difference to look for new areas that need attention there is hope to stay relevant madan sabnavis

trillions of dollars are being plowed into high tech hospitals zero emission public transit and other megaprojects around the globe shiny new infrastructure is popping up virtually everywhere from australia to appalachia yet leaders aren t disclosing what taxpayers bills will be for this in the coming years they aren t even determining the maximum affordable amount for the infrastructure projects the majority of which are being delivered via public private partnerships p3s nor are any of the major political parties in canada or the u s calling for objective value for money analyses including studies of what the best greenhouse gas reduction bang is for each scarce public buck spent on green projects in addition government agencies don t always take such basic money saving steps as offsetting the cost of new subway or lrt stations by finding developers that will build and pay for extensive retail commercial and residential spaces on top of those stations this is despite already unprecedented levels of government debt and there are many other budget pressures just one example is the impending loss due to the switch to electric cars and trucks of the more than 16 billion of gas and diesel tax collected annually by the feds and provinces in canada the pressures will increase geometrically with the proliferation of infrastructure projects we never got into the world of p3s to solve a funding problem they aren t off balance sheet we don t kid ourselves who s funding infrastructure it s either users or taxpayers ultimately that are funding infrastructure ontario president and ceo ehren cory candidly commented nov 18 during a panel discussion at the canadian council for public private partnerships ccppp 2019 annual conference cory also is a ccppp director but while taxpayers are usually the ultimate payer for these projects money from non government sources increasingly is being used to finance construction this is paid back to the financiers at interest rates that while relatively low at the moment are higher than the governments themselves could get the money for and add up to huge amounts over the long durations of the projects contracts as result infrastructure and real estate can provide together with private equity the most solid and safe rates of return in the world so there s plenty of private financing available for example the 500 billion brookfield asset management has a large portion of its portfolio invested in these alternative investments the ontario municipal employees retirement system omers holds more than half of its 110 billion in them other major pension fund managers such as the 400 billion canada pension plan investment board are following fast priming the pump for very high cost infrastructure renewal are international organizations with tight connections to financiers for example the board president of c40 a group pushing major cities around the world to quickly take steps such as switching their public transit fleets to zero emission vehicles is michael bloomberg the billionaire owner of bloomberg news and former new york city mayor currently making a bid for the us presidency the un announced a few days ago that the uk s central banker mark carney will be its special envoy on climate action and climate finance and in october the international monetary fund the same agency that saddles countries with crippling debt and forces them to privatize their formerly public assets focused its 2019 fiscal monitor report on mitigating climate change boing boing asked shoshanna saxe assistant professor dean s spark professor sustainable infrastructure department of civil and mineral engineering university of toronto for a comment about the very high cost of the new infrastructure we as a society have to pay for our infrastructure and there is no way around that the myth that we can have good infrastructure for free cheap is just that a myth saxe replied via email so we have to take seriously coming up with funding including higher property taxes proposed by the mayor property taxes and service charges to home owners also are poised to rise sharply in vancouver boing boing also asked toronto region board of trade and ccppp s media relations for comment but no one was available however a vital fact that saxe and virtually everyone else either don t know or won t mention is that from 1938 to 1974 canada and other western countries did in fact get very good infrastructure for very cheap as documented by journalist murray dobbin during those four decades the bank of canada loaned massive amounts of money virtually interest free to all levels of government this same central bank function was exercised in the u s and the other g7 countries that s how we got massive projects like the war effort the trans canada highway and the st lawrence seaway as well as pools schools government buildings roads subways etc all without significantly increasing government deficits or debts then in 1974 under then prime minister pierre trudeau the central bank s issuance of very low interest bonds to fund federal and provincial governments slowed to a trickle that s because private lenders in canada and abroad took over that function the result was a significant slow down in the building and maintenance of infrastructure a charter of rights and freedoms challenge to reverse this went all the way to the supreme court however in mid 2017 the supremes declined to hear the case and governments had to pay much higher interest for the money they needed canada s national debt leapt from just over 20 billion in 1971 to more than three quarters of a trillion today this is accompanied by very high provincial debts such as ontario s 325 billion the largest sub national level debt in the world servicing the debt consumes the biggest single chunk of both provincial and federal budgets yet this historic very low cost bank of canada lending is being erased from our collective memory banks for example when an audience member at the toronto region board of trade s november 27 2019 delivering mega projects conference asked panelists why the city of toronto s megaprojects were much more cost effective in the 1950s and 60s than today the question was treated as a joke is that actually true pierre lavallée president and ceo of the canada infrastructure bank asked rhetorically eliciting laughter i think it may be more of a perception than a reality said dale clarke executive vice president for strategy and growth at snc lavalin who benefits from this reframing of reality there are already hundreds of billions of private dollars being invested across the continent on everything from new water and wastewater treatment facilities to new airports and schools alberta alone is spending more than 24 billion on infrastructure p3 projects between now and 2023 not to mention tens of billions more for similar clean energy and green projects in cities and town from coast to coast to coast including approximately 4 billion for electrifying the city of toronto s bus fleet another heavy hitter is nuclear the ontario government is spending 26 billion to refurbish some of its nuclear facilities ontario residents pay the difference between the low wholesale market price for electricity and the high price the provincial government pays nuclear and other power generators for their electricity that difference is rising fast with the single largest component of this rise being the high price of nuclear power including the refurbishments omers is financing part of the cost of the refurbishment of the bruce nuclear plant it is getting repaid with interest by the public on dec 1 the ontario new brunswick and saskatchewan governments agreed to work together to develop small modular reactors as a way to produce clean and low cost energy however these small reactors are much more expensive to build per unit of electricity produced than large reactors they also remain unproven and taxpayers will very likely be on the hook for this very expensive experiment on top of that ontario has the biggest new infrastructure pipeline of any sub national jurisdiction in north america if not the world for example tens of billions of dollars in transit projects alone including the highly controversial ontario line and scarborough subway extension projects in toronto over the next 10 years our government is investing and these are staggering numbers it s absolutely mind boggling 144 billion in strategic infrastructure projects ninety billion dollars of that is on transportation alone an incredible investment of 67 billion in public transit and 22 billion in a provincial highway network ontario premier doug ford said at the ccppp meeting in describing the p3 projects planned for the province something s got to give taxes are already going up and they re likely to climb much higher the public also will have to pay much more to use this infrastructure coughing up more coin for everything from more expensive public transit fares to tolls on every highway cory dubbed this user pay in his address at the ccppp meeting and you can bet that more and more infrastructure will be fully privatized there are plenty of precedents for this including the selling off of highway 407 and of a large portion of ontario hydro ask probing questions about this your politicians or you may well regret not speaking up image gone coastal cc by sa modified

zimbabwe austerity measures grind to a halt spread the love by dr masimba mavaza zimbabwe s minister of finance has declared the austerity measures officially over addressing the delegates to the zanu pf 18th national conference in goromonzi mthuli states that the government could afford to turn the page on austerity as he taburlated the success of the two years old austerity measures the minister claimed that a rise in spending this year and next would bring about a new life of renewal critics warned that his claims were overblown and that two years of spending cuts would continue to take their toll would it be correct that a line is being drawn under austerity the minister indicated that by 2023 zimbabwe will be operating under a budget of billions of united states dollars the minister has cast light into sources of the countries fortunes boasting of prospective income of over thirty billion dollars a year the minister rightly said the increase represented the largest increase in at least 30 years and was a turning point after two years of spending cuts he also topped up next year s capital spending by over six billion above the current and this would be in us dollars the annual public spending deficit the difference between government income and expenditure reached almost 200 in the wake of the financial crisis most of the traditional sources of advice the international monetary fund the oecd the governor of the reserve bank said government spending cuts were needed to balance the books under the old dispensation the treasury forced through measures that increased local authority spending by about 60 and imposed 40 over spending on many government departments public investment also came to a virtual standstill bringing to an end years of improvements to hospital and school buildings and any infrastructure the austerity measures then saw budgets not saved from mthuli s knife the nation experienced hardships which were never seen since records began mthuli s plan was supposed to spur growth and reduce the government deficit the gap between income and expenditure to zero by 2022 cuts to the schools budget were introduced two years ago leading to widespread staff lay offs and rising deficits especially in secondary schools to show the effect of diminished government funds being spread across more people with domestic debts being wiped out the economic crisis hurt businesses and the financial sector while the government used all of taxpayer funds to bail out some government projects much of which has subsequently been recouped the dramatic cuts in public spending meant ministers had reduced means to support households the bedrock of spending in the economy and the wider business community at the time he proposed maintaining public investment arguing that with borrowing rates at historic lows in the post crash period there was an opportunity to improve the infrastructure on the cheap with government unprepared to step in businesses remained nervous about the future and private investment failed to take off un employment jumped to a record high but without an increase in public or private investment productivity stagnated and wages rose more slowly than inflation leaving household incomes depressed the ispending plans were enough to reverse about two thirds of the real terms cuts to average day to day spending on public services since 2010 however this achievement is even less significant when the rising population is taken into account on a per capita basis only one third of the cuts are reversed the average rise also masks substantial variation within the total these are commitments that are likely to limit the scope for further increases in departmental or welfare spending reversing these cuts will take more than mthuli is prepared to offer in his spending review however one would review the government s fiscal rules which bind the treasury s ability to lift austerity because they curb spending the person in the street will be expecting life to be easier removal of austerity entails that basic life expectations are now expected there will be no hardships as the government will be chipping in where it becomes heavy as mthuli explained yesterday the treasury always keeps some cash aside so there is cash kept for the betterment of life as we know it austerity is a self induced suffering meant to make tomorrow better as of now cash will be trickling back into our cash machines for the next few months the government will be buying the rtgs from banks in exchange with the new currency the idea is to completely wipe out the rtgs in order to remove two sets of currencies which fuels inflation social services will now be fully subsidised and we expect a serious economic boom as for now zimbabweans sits in great expectations hoping to see the great times unfold before their own eyes share this post like this like loading

u s review ok monty let s go with door 1 door 2 and door 3 lawmakers and the administration made breakthroughs this week on deals to avoid the dec 15 tariffs likely pass the usmca and avert a government shutdown next week the ustr confirmed that sunday s tariffs will not go into effect and the 15 tariff on approximately 120b will decrease to 7 5 the fomc left rates unchanged this week and reiterated that it would need to see a material change in the outlook to adjust rates from here the inflation data this week showed no signs of a significant change with the core cpi remaining at 2 3 year over year while retail sales growth continued to moderate after a hot pace this summer let s make a deal or three wheeling and dealing was pervasive in washington this week first lawmakers are said to have reached a deal to fund the government ahead of next week s deadline averting another government shutdown second a long sought phase i trade deal between the united states and china crossed the finish line this morning the office of the u s trade representative released the details which avoided the additional tariffs on 156b in imports of chinese goods that were set to go into effect on sunday and scaled back the 15 tariff on about 120b to 7 5 in exchange for more agricultural purchases the 25 tariff on approximately 250b of imports from china remains and the deal still did not fully address some of the fundamental issues that sparked the trade war the finalization of the deal points to some upside for our current forecast third the passage of usmca the successor to nafta looks more assured house democrats this week endorsed an updated version of the bill that looks likely to pass the senate once taken up in 2020 the upcoming passage will remove a source of some uncertainty for affected industries particularly autos however since the deal tweaks rather than overhauls nafta we see it having little effect on growth beyond offering some clarity on policy that will allow businesses to proceed with some investment decisions as we anticipated the tariffs that have gone into effect thus far have had minimal impact on inflation the cpi goods categories that most align with the tariffs implemented to date have added only 0 05 percentage points to inflation over the past year which is about 0 1 points more than their contribution in the five years before the new tariffs went into place when those categories where on average a drag on inflation looking at all core consumer goods prices were unchanged in november after declining the prior two months driving core inflation higher however was a pickup in core services the underlying trend in inflation remains fairly steady overall consumer price inflation ticked up to a 2 1 year over year pace in november but the core index was stable at 2 3 the producer price index suggest that domestic inflation pressures remain generally tame the index was unchanged in november held down by a drop in services our preferred measure of core ppi inflation which excludes food energy and trade services measured in margins was also flat on the month but has slipped to 1 3 year over year a three year low as input costs have eased in fomc chair powell s press conference this week he noted he would need to see a significant and persistent increase in inflation before it would be likely that the committee would raise rates again while we expect the core pce deflator which has been running unusually cool relative to core cpi to move back up to 2 this spring this week s inflation data continue to show few signs of the trend in inflation breaking meaningfully higher anytime soon retail sales increased 0 2 in november holiday sales look off to a slow start with our measure increasing 0 13 last month we expect to see some pickup in december however given the stillsolid spending positions of households u s outlook housing starts resales tues thurs we expect residential activity will continue to modestly accelerate into the new year and next week we expect new construction and sales of existing homes to post gains in november we expect housing starts will rise to a 1 346k unit pace as lower mortgage rates firmer demand and rising builder optimism buoy the construction outlook the national association of homebuilders wells fargo housing market index is also published next week on monday this forward looking measure of the singlefamily market continues to augur strength for the housing market the index is sitting at 70 compared to just 56 during the market turmoil at the end of last year existing home sales should rise to a 5 55 million unit pace in november as rising mortgage applications for purchase and pending home sales point to solid demand in the pipeline previous 1 314k 5 46m wells fargo 1 346k 5 55m consensus 1 340k 5 45m industrial production tuesday our slightly above consensus call for a 1 rise in industrial production in november reflects to a large extent a bounce back from last month s ugly 0 8 the october data were dragged down by the gm strike but the underlying trend is weak as well penciling in our forecast for a monthly gain of around 1 still leaves the level of manufacturing output below where it was last year a bonafide trade deal with china could lift the industrial sector but for now we see output continuing to move more or less sideways fresh regional surveys next week will provide some color on manufacturing across the mid atlantic northeast and midwest the empire manufacturing survey prints on tuesday along with the philly fed survey on thursday and the kansas city fed survey on friday renewed strength should be viewed with caution however as the regions have varying exposures to china that do not line up perfectly with the nation as a whole previous 0 8 wells fargo 1 0 consensus 0 8 month over month personal spending friday we expect personal spending to rise a solid 0 4 in november but a below consensus print for retail sales for the same month introduced some downside risk to that forecast still solid consumer fundamentals should support spending growth through year end we expect personal income to post a similarly solid 0 4 rise in november while consumer sentiment we also get the final print for the university of michigan measure on friday next week the preliminary reading showed a hefty 2 4 point rise remains elevated the third and final estimate of q3 gdp also released on friday should confirm that pce rose at a 2 9 pace we are forecasting a slight moderation in growth to 2 1 in q4 a large reason we have overall gdp growth slowing to 1 5 in q4 from 2 1 previous 0 3 wells fargo 0 4 consensus 0 4 month over month global review u k general election in the spotlight it was a busy week for international data and events in the united kingdom conservative party leader boris johnson secured his position as prime minister winning a comfortable majority in the house of commons the pound surged after johnson s win but has since eased a little at the first monetary policy meeting for christine lagarde the european central bank held monetary policy steady as expected and made minimal changes to its economic projections meanwhile sweden s inflation figures exceeded expectations as cpif inflation firmed in november ecb keeps rates steady the european central bank ecb opted to hold rates steady in line with market expectations and made minimal changes to its economic projections at its december monetary policy meeting in the accompanying statement the ecb reiterated that rates will stay at present levels or lower until it sees the inflation outlook reach a level that is close to but below 2 it also stated that the governing council will continue its asset purchase program until shortly before it starts raising rates following the statement markets closely watched the subsequent press conference the first for new ecb president christine lagarde in her comments she said that downside growth risks still remain but are less pronounced adding that there are initial signs of stabilization in growth and mildly firmer underlying inflation although lagarde seemed a bit more upbeat on the eurozone economy we are not convinced that the economy is fully out of the woods yet instead looking for a further slowdown in gdp growth in q4 2019 and perhaps into q1 2020 as well meanwhile despite the recent tick higher in underlying inflation inflation expectations remain subdued and the ecb s inflation target remains a long way off at this point accordingly we still expect the ecb to cut its deposit rate an additional 10 bps to 0 60 in q1 2020 boris johnson wins by a landslide the conservative party won a majority of seats 364 out of 650 in the house of commons and boris johnson will remain the prime minister largely in line with expectations the main opposition labour party under jeremy corbyn won only 203 seats while scottish national party and liberal democrats won only 48 and 11 respectively the pound surged after johnson s landslide victory but has since eased a little for the next steps the conservatives will likely ratify the withdrawal agreement and leave the european union with a deal by january 31 2020 as we have noted in past reports this would not mark the end of the brexit process but the beginning of longer term e u u k trade talks which should begin in late q1 2020 or in q2 the current withdrawal agreement provides a transition period of only 11 months which in our view is unlikely to be enough time to finalize a deal therefore we expect both sides to extend deadlines in order to continue conducting trade talks which could be a downside risk for the u k economy sweden s november inflation suggests riksbank hike sweden s latest inflation report printed higher than expected in november with cpif inflation rising in line with the riksbank s projection to 1 7 year over year from 1 5 in the previous month although inflation in sweden remains below the central bank s 2 target rate the riksbank still projects cpif inflation will pick up further reaching 2 by the beginning of the new year meanwhile cpif inflation excluding energy prices quickened to 1 8 year over year also beating consensus estimates 1 7 the uptick in november s inflation data is consistent with our expectation that the central bank will raise its repo rate 25 bps to 0 00 at the december 19 meeting global outlook bank of england policy decision thursday the bank of england boe announces its latest monetary policy decision next week and is widely expected to hold its bank rate steady at 0 75 in its november announcement the boe held rates steady but two officials unexpectedly voted for a rate cut the committee s comments following the announcement suggest it is split on the next monetary policy action price pressures eased in october as u k s headline cpi figure rose just 1 5 year over year dipping to a near three year low while core cpi inflation held steady at 1 7 year over year still below the central bank s 2 target meanwhile u k gdp stagnated in october suggesting a slow start to the fourth quarter given the soft inflation and growth figures combined with some uncertainties on longer term e u u k trade talks now that the conservative party secured a majority in parliament we expect the boe to remain on hold for the foreseeable future previous 0 75 wells fargo 0 75 consensus 0 75 riksbank policy decision thursday the riksbank caught markets off guard with its surprisingly hawkish announcement in october still signaling a rate increase in december to bring the key policy rate to 0 00 the monetary policy minutes suggested that all policymakers supported the forecast path of the repo rate but one member expressed hesitation about raising rates by the end of the year policymakers also noted that the swedish krona has been unexpectedly weak over the past month policymakers have highlighted that recent data have been largely in line with the central bank s expectations supporting its plan to end negative interest rates by year end given these comments in addition to sweden s november inflation report printing better than expected we think the riksbank will raise the repo interest rate at its policy meeting next week but then keep it unchanged for an extended period previous 0 25 wells fargo 0 00 consensus 0 00 banxico policy decision thursday the bank of mexico opted to ease monetary policy at its last meeting in november cutting its main policy rate another 25 bps to 7 50 the accompanying policy statement was relatively dovish in our view signaling additional rate cuts could be coming mexico s november cpi eased to 2 97 year over year while the core cpi eased to 3 65 year over year providing additional rationale for the central bank to lower interest rates further in the months ahead as the mexican economy remains subdued in addition to the dovish signals from policymakers we expect the central bank to cut rates another 25 bps at next week s meeting and continue the easing cycle into the new year that said however we would not be surprised if policymakers moved forward with a 50 bps cut next week given how weak growth and inflation are at present currently markets are pricing in 143 bps of additional easing over the next year by the bank of mexico previous 7 50 wells fargo 7 25 consensus 7 25 point of view interest rate watch little drama in fomc meeting as universally expected the fomc decided unanimously at the policy meeting on december 11 to keep its target range for the fed funds rate unchanged at 1 50 to 1 75 furthermore the statement that was released at the conclusion of the meeting was little changed from the last statement suggesting that the fomc s assessment of the economy has remained essentially unchanged over the past six weeks in its summary of economic projections sep the fomc members median gdp growth forecast for 2020 is 2 0 top chart which is close to our own projection of 1 8 and our inflation forecasts are very similar as well the dot plot which plots individual members forecasts of the fed funds rate shows that most committee members believe the most likely outcome will be to keep the fed funds rate unchanged through the end of next year with only one 25 bps rate hike in 2021 middle chart our currently published forecast looks for the fomc to cut rates another 25 bps in the first quarter of 2020 this view was predicated on our assumption which we had maintained for some time that a meaningful trade deal would continue to elude u s and chinese negotiators since financial markets appeared to be priced in for a deal if a deal was not reached we expected markets would weaken and credit spreads would widen in that event in our view the fomc would want to offset some of this financial tightening by guiding shortterm interest rates lower this morning s announcement from the office of the u s trade representative disclosed that the 15 tariff on approximately 156b of imports from china will not go into effect this sunday and the 15 tariff on about 120b will be reduced to 7 5 with the deal now officially reached the case for further monetary easing early next year is not as compelling whether or not the fomc cuts rates 25 bps early next year is not overly important in our view rather we think the point to stress about our forecast is our view which is also reflected in the fomc s dot plot that rates likely will remain low for an extended period of time credit market insights financial health of household sector the financial health of the u s household sector remains strong on thursday the federal reserve board released its q3 update of the financial accounts of the united states the extensive report covers the balance sheets of households nonprofits businesses and the government total net worth of u s households notched another gain in the third quarter up 573 6 billion discounting the fourth quarter of last year when a selloff in equity markets weighed on net worth q3 marked the smallest gain since q3 2015 liabilities rose at a faster rate than assets in the quarter but not to a worrying degree household liabilities continue to grow at a moderate rate but as a share of total assets are at their lowest level since the mid 1980s unfortunately we have not yet received an updated read on the distributional financial accounts which provide the distribution of u s household wealth data through the second quarter however suggest the gain in net worth has been seen across the income spectrum and as we have written recently is helping provide those most hurt by the great recession the necessary financial cushion to withstand the next downturn healthy balance sheets paired with rising wages should continue to support consumer spending similarly while low interest rates may increasingly entice consumers to borrow lower financing costs will likely free up some cash flow which can ultimately be a tailwind to consumer spending topic of the week a monetary giant paul volcker who as chairman of the federal reserve from 1979 to 1987 broke the back of inflation in the united states and brought about a new era of monetary policymaking passed away on sunday at 92 recognizing the pernicious effects of spiraling inflation on the economy volcker took unprecedented and immediate action just two months after taking the helm at the eccles building by calling a surprise saturday press conference where he announced a new more aggressive restriction of money supply growth in order to rein in prices in a little more than a year volcker s fed allowed the fed funds rate to go from around 10 to nearly 20 or 1 000 bps the results were swift the year over year rate of cpi inflation peaked in march 1980 at 14 8 but fell below 3 by 1983 there were significant costs however by january 1980 the united states had fallen into a sharp recession as the surge in interest rates curtailed the flow of money through the economy volcker was harangued by democrats republicans and the media but his policy consistency ultimately killed runaway inflation and ushered in an era of relative macroeconomic stability today interest and inflation rates in the double digits seem as antiquated as smoking a cigar while testifying to the senate banking committee indeed current fed chair powell has had to contend with inflation that is too low meanwhile interest rates or the compensation that bond investors demand for the risk of inflation have steadily declined for the past 40 years as inflation and the volatility of inflation have both dramatically subsided we have less benefit of hindsight regarding the efficacy of the volcker rule the post crisis financial reform that volcker proposed to the obama administration but current fed officials regularly attest to the strength of the banking system where volcker s legacy is clearer sub 2 inflation has allowed powell to put more emphasis on the growth side of fed s dual mandate and deliver 75 bps of insurance cuts this year to counteract trade uncertainty without much fear of a breakout in inflation

roger baxter the ceo of the minerals council is an optimistic kind of guy he stoutly believes for instance that south africa s economic recovery can be found in the revitalisation of its mining sector but even he is finding it hard to keep the faith sometimes this is now a matter of urgency he said in a minerals council statement in november a reference to the impending downgrade of sa s sovereign debt by credit rating agency moody s investors service a substantial turnaround was needed in six months preferably through a series of economic reforms if sa was to avoid moving a peg down the world s economic ladder it s true sa mining is on the edge new investments of the fresh capital greenfields type can be counted on the fingers of one hand but don t tell the investment market that a quick glance from macroeconomics to share price performance and you ll notice the sa mining sector had a bit of a banner year according to a survey by financial services firm pwc sa mining companies returned r27bn in dividends between july 2018 and june 2019 for most of this year the jse s mining index matched the hsbc mining index a performance based on solid indisputable metrics such as the fact that the industry s revenue exceeded r500bn double the level of 2009 the higher revenue was largely down to the performance of dollar metal and mineral prices globally but not entirely certain metals languished platinum for instance it traded up 130 oz from its january start about 16 at the time of writing but was nonetheless at a 1 000 oz discount to its sister metal palladium the export coal price dwindled to around 65 t roughly 34 down in 12 months average diamond prices fell an estimated 35 below 2014 to 2017 levels it clearly wasn t a uniformly good year the denominator in jse performance however was the rand at the time of writing at the end of november 2019 the rand was 3 weaker against the dollar against its january start in august however it was 6 9 weaker this elevated yet further buoyant dollar metal prices and provided a degree of insulation for metals and minerals that weren t faring as well baxter is right however there s a storm coming rand benefits are likely to be matched on the downside by mining inflation the impact of the current rand against the dollar will have a massive impact on revenues according to pwc s africa energy utilities and resources leader andries rossouw but it s probably a short term cash boost the global climate outside sa s immediate environs is a global commodities market in foment but deceptively so on the one hand metal and mineral prices are strong gold in dollar terms for instance is currently around 1 450 oz nearly 300 oz higher than its january start but fundamental questions about the nature of commodity markets are being asked according to goldman sachs economist jeffrey currie mining companies have continued to lose about 34 cents for every dollar invested despite recent efforts to rehabilitate their balance sheets pay dividends and take a conservative approach to volume growth this is not as bad a performance as the oil and gas sector nevertheless a new conservatism among holders of capital including the chinese who have generally stopped financing loss making enterprises has made it harder for mining firms to raise capital in addition questions about the role of mining in society has made production expansion and greenfields investment more difficult to achieve sovereign wealth funds have become less accommodating even unwelcoming of the old world economy in the context of a carbon neutral future that s why the transformation of china from a commodity hungry investment economy to a consumer driven economy hasn t hit commodity prices too hard demand may have softened but the ability of the commodity market to respond to supply deficits when they occur is much diminished this has been evident in statements made for instance by iron ore producers bhp rio tinto and fortescue metals whose chairman andrew forrest said in november it was not possible to turn up the dial on iron ore production this was despite the supply deficit caused by brazilian firm vale following an iron ore dam burst in january 2019 which killed hundreds of people and led to a halt in production while it is tempting to blame the trade war and other political uncertainties on this sharp decline in capex we believe such uncertainties only reinforced a trend that was already in place said goldman sachs currie mining and society is a double edged sword however on the one hand the world s mining sector is in need of an image makeover backed by actual substantial improvement in how it tackles environmental societal and governance esg issues many asset managers now employ an esg officer whose job it is to keep close tabs on how mining firms treat communities employees and the ecology i would rather report back to my investors on a bad operating quarter than a big esg issue said a chief investment officer of one of the uk s large mutual funds in a miningmx interview in june that s a career ender the sand is shifting beneath our feet said mark cutifani ceo of anglo american in october if we cannot make a demonstrable positive contribution to society and do so without it being seen and understood our businesses will not be sustainable according to a recent report by the united nations environment programme delaying action on climate control by a year will mean emissions need to be cut even faster and at greater cost with a dwindling chance of success according to sky news the forces against new mining projects couldn t be greater with 2019 surely going down as the year in which decarbonisation became embedded in popular consciousness aided by the visceral speeches of greta thunberg herein lies the opportunity for the mining sector copper has properties not found in other major elements providing thermal and electrical conductivity greater safety than other conductive metals and recyclability according to the european copper institute adding one tonne of copper can reduce up to 7 500 tonnes of co2 emissions annually according to paul gait an analyst for new york bank bernstein the expected tripling in wind farm capacity from the current 600gw in output in the next decade equates to 330 000 tonnes of new copper demand a year assuming a 9 compound average growth rate over the next 10 years in other words we should be expecting almost 1m tonnes per annum of incremental copper demand coming from wind power alone in 2029 said gait in a report published in october set against this is whether the world has developed enough copper reserves to meet this potential demand given the increased reticence of lenders to finance new projects it seems likely that deeper lower grade copper reserves will have to be developed on a brownfields basis a development that will only call for improved incentive pricing our conclusion is that to meet the government s 2030 emission targets copper needs to be priced at 8 800 t or a 40 uplift from today s prices said gait for rapid decarbonisation the price implications are extreme he said the greta scenario describing net zero carbon emissions by 2025 requires copper prices to rise to 20 000 t or even higher he said it s easy to see in this context why the likes of sydney and johannesburg listed copper and zinc exploration and development firm orion minerals is so bullish about its r3 8bn prieska copper project in sa s northern cape instructively however it s a brownfields project highlighting how little incentive there is in the country for new greenfields mining developments regardless of the societal and macroeconomic forces encouraging it even new projects such as vedanta resources gamsberg project may not reach full fruition a concentrate mine has been built also in the northern cape at a capital cost of 400m but further investment to build processing facilities are hanging by a thread owing to the failure of government to guarantee the regulatory framework for the electricity the project requires if we can t make it work here we will have to look at other geographies said deshnee naidoo ceo of vedanta zinc international in a recent interview with reuters my concern is about government s ability to deliver power this article originally appeared in the

bank of canada governor stephen poloz s 1982 ph d thesis the demand for money in a multicurrency world generated three separate journal articles an uncommon achievement that helped him win a job at the central bank straight out of university poloz is wrapping up his professional career the way it began related stories the governor who will retire when his term ends in june has been spending considerable time at a keyboard churning out an uncommon amount of academic analysis for someone whose day job comes with a full daily calendar last month poloz published a paper that argues that the embrace of artificial intelligence ai is leading a so far undetectable productivity boom this week he supplemented that idea with a second paper that will hopefully be passed around in ottawa the provincial capitals and as many c suites as possible in the weeks and months ahead we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us stephen poloz the new paper is based on remarks he made in september at the annual spruce meadows changing fortunes roundtable a discrete gathering of carefully selected members of the global elite in calgary poloz imagines where canada could end up years from now as digital technology protectionist politics and unprecedented levels of debt converge to generate forces that will be unfamiliar to executives investors and policy makers the point of the exercise is to suggest that the future should turn out fine if different provided we don t get hung up on what barack obama might call stupid shit along the way this topic reflects my concern that we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us poloz wrote in the new paper by exercising the muscles of understanding alternative projections we can build the ability to adapt to whatever comes our way poloz reckons executives and investors should prepare an extended period of suboptimal policy he told reporters after a speech in toronto this week that the actual finalization and the ratification of the new north american free trade agreement is crucial for restoring business confidence and investment the backing of the democratic majority in the u s house of representatives and the subsequent signing of an updated agreement this week was positive but the process chilled investment for the better part of two years and unlike most trade agreements from the postwar era the new nafta restricts trade instead of making it broadly freer if this is the template for dealing with the world s largest economy then it s reasonable to predict that the growth rates to which we had accustomed during the most recent phase of globalization will no longer be possible therefore expectations should adjust accordingly as some growth is better than none at all by way of example poloz mentioned hurdle rates the return on an investment that executives require to justify the risk of deploying precious capital companies that are still working with hurdle rates from 10 years ago will find fewer investment opportunities that exceed those rates poloz wrote the implication is that companies need to adjust hurdle rates downward to reflect the new reality and then seek ways to manage elevated risk besides if they don t lower investment spending means slower economic growth now and it means that the economic potential of our economies will grow more slowly over the long term as well poloz has bought into the notion that we are in the early stages of an industrial revolution akin to the eras created by the steam engine electrification and the computer chip it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern the previous three industrial revolutions ended in misery as euphoria over the possibilities fuelled asset price bubbles that brought calamity when they burst but canada s central bank governor is a techno optimist even if some professions vanish overall employment always trends higher he also observes that policy makers have been getting better at managing the economy the third

stephen poloz the new paper is based on remarks he made in september at the annual spruce meadows changing fortunes roundtable a discrete gathering of carefully selected members of the global elite in

executives investors and policy makers the point of the exercise is to suggest that the future should turn out fine if different provided we don t get hung up on what barack obama might call stupid

the risk of deploying precious capital companies that are still working with hurdle rates from 10 years ago will find fewer investment opportunities that exceed those rates poloz wrote the implication is that companies need to adjust hurdle rates downward to reflect the new reality and then seek ways to manage elevated risk besides if they don t lower investment spending means slower economic

american opinion has moved away from its once benign view of china that older view still favored by many business people held that a prosperous china would threaten its neighbors less than a poor china and anyway would offer the united states great economic advantages accordingly this view recommended that the west engage china in a friendly way and accommodate beijing as much as possible the newer view has responded to overwhelming evidence that chinese development is far from benign that china flaunts common trade practices steals technological secrets on a huge scale and spies outrageously moreover this new view contends that beijing acts aggressively in asia seems to have set itself on a thinly veiled imperialist project that it calls the belt and road and shows no regard for human rights in hong kong and still more outrageously in its xinjiang region this new view frequently paints china as a dangerous economic military and diplomatic juggernaut so unstoppable in fact that the united states short of a disastrous military confrontation has little choice but to engage china in disarming ways and accommodate it where it can while this new perspective strangely lands on pretty much the same advice as the older more benign businessman s take it would be a mistake to view china in this way to be sure it is duplicitous and aggressive and it presents a formidable economic military and diplomatic challenge but it is far from irresistible as some seem to believe on the contrary china suffers from a number of economic vulnerabilities and weaknesses that will impede its ambitions the country for one has little chance of returning to its former stellar rates of economic growth especially in light of the trade war with the united states china s dependence on exports no longer looks like the winning strategy it once did worse beijing s top down approach to economic management will become increasingly ineffective now that china has passed onto a more advanced stage of development moreover failure in hong kong will further limit the country s economic potential by choking off the conduit for much of its investment capital while over the longer run china s aging demographics will constrain growth and cause financial strains one need not forecast economic collapse which in any case is unlikely to see that china is far from the irresistible dragon described frequently by the western media trump s trade war with beijing has highlighted some of china s more immediate weaknesses it has become increasingly clear that beijing by making exports the engine of growth has put its economy at the mercy of foreigners before this dispute began the united states absorbed fully one quarter of china s exports since foreign sales accounted for some 20 percent of china s gross domestic product gdp fully 5 percent of its entire economy was vulnerable to trade with the united states in contrast only some 12 percent of the u s economy depended on exports and china sales amounted only to some 8 percent of that figure leaving only some 1 percent of the u s economy vulnerable to china as trump s tariffs squeezed a relatively large part of china s economy beijing tried to bring similar pain to the united states with tit for tat tariff increases but of course china bought too little from america to make that work making matters worse for beijing some 30 percent of its imports from the united states are components for chinese assembled products that the country then exports mostly computers and smartphones beijing could hardly impose tariffs on these goods china s economy has suffered accordingly businesses have decamped their home country for other locations mostly elsewhere in asia where the trump tariffs do not apply the loss of business has hurt not just exports but also domestic chinese sales official figures issued by the beijing government have long been held as suspiciously optimistic but other measures show a troubled economic situation independent data on auto sales show a steep decline by as much as 50 percent in some regions parcel deliveries in 2019 have run 2 percent behind previous years levels and that understates the drop in overall sales since e commerce otherwise makes up a larger proportion of all retail sales furthermore china s employment growth has also slowed though official figures still show a relatively robust situation with unemployment at about 4 percent of the labor force a survey of want ads shows a 20 percent drop in technology positions even optimistically biased official gdp statistics show real growth slowing to about 6 percent a year the worst growth rate in decades china s devaluation of the yuan has helped sustain sales in america by reducing the dollar price of chinese products but it has also limited the dollar return to chinese producers who effectively wind up paying the trump tariffs for their american buyers china has deeper problems than its disadvantages in this trade standoff its entire development model is flawed using low wages to orient its economy toward exports has allowed rapid growth as it did for japan in the decades following world war ii this model has indeed allowed china to steal productive power from europe and america as innumerable commentaries have described and as japan did decades ago but as is now fully evident the approach has also left chinese prosperity highly vulnerable to foreign actions over which beijing has no control true a more balanced approach to development one that cultivated a larger consumer sector and that promoted investment spending on more than just infrastructure and production for export might have slowed china s growth and let foreign producers sell more products in china however a balanced policy would also have left the chinese economy less vulnerable to the trump white house and by extension decisions yet to be taken in london berlin tokyo and new delhi additionally china is not nearly as strong financially as some western commentaries suggest a popular line spreads fear that beijing might sell its huge holdings of u s government debt and so disrupt america s financial system yet since china holds only some 5 percent of the outstanding debt of the united states beijing would seem to lack the resources to cause such havoc five percent is a large chunk of the total but far from enough to overwhelm a financial system even if beijing were to try it would inflict more pain on itself than on the united states none can doubt that if beijing sold its u s bond holdings suddenly bond prices would fall and accordingly interest rates in the united states would rise but unless beijing s action created a panic which is unlikely the pressure on u s markets would ease as soon as beijing sold all it had then prices and interest rates would head back to their earlier levels in other words beijing would have incurred losses and at the same time giving others the chance to acquire the bonds at bargain prices a winning strategy for these others perhaps but not for beijing hong kong s troubles add yet another dimension to beijing s financial vulnerability aside from territorial ambition and national solidarity beijing wanted hong kong for two reasons first hong kong s wealth would implicitly offer the average chinese a promise in the existing system second and more immediately important hong kong offers global connections and the human capital to use them things china otherwise lacks china s banks may rate among the largest in the world but they have neither the expertise nor the investment banking connections of hong kong rebellion in the city s population has threatened both these purposes at the same time beijing faces unaccustomed constraints in how it can handle the matter should china s leadership play too rough carrying out a tiananmen square redux for instance or worse the horrific tactics beijing has employed in xinjiang they would destroy that promise of wealth for their people and also convince the worlds investment bankers brokers and traders to depart depriving china of this critical financial center many financial firms have already begun to transfer their operations to singapore beijing may yet decide that stamping out the resistance is worth such a huge cost but either way the hong kong matter has weakened china finally then there are china s aging demographics which further impair beijing s ambition of dominance for decades the chinese government imposed a law under which families were allowed only one child the country s leadership did this out of concern that population growth might outstrip economic resources to feed clothe and house all those people what it has done however is slow the entry of young workers into the country s labor force this is because since the one child policy was adopted growing prosperity in china and medical advances have increased life expectancy in the large generation born before the one child rule as a result china today faces a huge overhang of retirees just as the entry of young workers to support that elderly population has slowed this demographic pressure has yet to bite but it will in time and irresistibly so according to united nations figures china s working age population will decline from some 70 percent of the total population today to 60 percent by 2030 and 57 percent by 2040 the number of workers available to support each retiree will drop from about 8 5 today to only 3 by 2030 and to barely over 2 by 2040 this shortage of workers will limit the pace of china s economic growth by imposing a constraint on a crucial economic input in ways that robotics and ai can only partly remedy the shortage of working taxpayers relative to the dependent retired population will strain china s public finances even though that country is far less generous to its elderly than are the west and japan still more the relative labor shortage will push up chinese wages stealing from that economy a key basis on which it has supported its export oriented growth strategy recently beijing rescinded its one child policy and now allows two per family even if chinese families respond quickly to this new freedom to build a family it would take some 20 years before the adults of that effort flowed into the workforce a long time to wait for a nation bent on world dominance
in argentina it is normal for students of economics to be taught the example of two countries the year is 1950 one country is hugely abundant in resources with an educated population of go getting immigrants living in peace with its neighbours the other has no natural resources and must import all its energy while its culture has made it impervious to outside influences and its industry had been decimated you would think that today the first country would be wealthy and the second country would struggle the first country is argentina the second is japan back in the 1930s argentina was the seventh richest country in the world today it is the 77th the second world war destroyed japan two atomic bombs were dropped there and it was an international pariah yet the japan of the 1950s from the ashes became one of the wealthiest places on earth maybe poor countries remain poor because they are forced to play by rules set by others argentinian students are given a checklist of economic mistakes their country has made the lesson being that successive argentinian governments have done much harm while all the time suggesting they are acting in the national interest read more this is the sort of educational self flagellation that many developing countries put themselves through when it comes to explaining why they have either become or remained poor i am not sure it s that simple maybe poor countries remain poor because they are forced to play by rules set by others a thorough and honest self assessment of domestic culpability is necessary for every country as it is for any individual if you want to figure out how you ended up where you are however when it comes to global economics it s clear that the playing field is not level the cards are stacked against poorer countries once you get into a downward spiral it s difficult to get out latin america feels like that i am writing from argentina where a new peronist president promising to kickstart argentina is yet again being sworn in alberto fernandez is the president but it is the vice president and former president cristina kirchner who is the real power she is under numerous investigations for corruption has already ruled for two traumatic terms and was thought to be politically dead in the water but she is back the outgoing president mauricio macri beloved of the west and the imf made a total hames of things despite being propped up by the biggest loan the imf has ever extended any country christine lagarde hailed him as the market friendly saviour of argentina today inflation is running at 50 per cent the currency is collapsing today i changed money on the street at 20 per cent discount to the official dollar exchange rate and while unemployment and poverty are surging the bars and cafes are jammed every night creativity in the arts has never been more vibrant and the whole place has a weimar feel to it as people spend spend spend everyone is worried about what comes next so they appear to be living for today it is easy to blame the argentines for the mess but all over latin america from mexico to chile ecuador to bolivia venezuela to brazil people are up in arms lurching from one political axis to the other we need to examine the economic system in which these poorer countries operate this brings me to the death this week of paul volcker the former head of the federal reserve eulogies across the international press hailed a great man who tamed inflation volcker raised american interest rates to 20 per cent to wring inflation out of the system in what was a wonderful example of a central bank standing up to government this precipitated a 40 year period of deflation in the west where taking on more and more debt made sense ushering in a bull market in stocks and bonds and an era of global financial capital where money sloshed around the globe driven by banks private equity firms and hedge funds if you are from a developing country particularly a latin american one volcker is not associated with prosperity but with years of financial pain in the 1970s latin american governments borrowed heavily from us banks the us banks got this money from arab countries awash with cash following the 1973 oil shock the money had to be lent and up stepped the latin countries when volcker jacked up interest rates to rectify us governments inflationary policy mistakes latin americans faced a massive increase in their interest bill in time they defaulted because the rules and terms of the loans had been changed unilaterally by the us latin american paid for the sins of north america such boom bust cycles with money gushing in and out of a country cause massive instability in that country s currency this was called the volcker shock and it knocked latin america completely off course over the years there have been many deals done and many new loans extended but ultimately the notion that the creditor and the debtor both pay when a loan goes bad has been abandoned instead most western initiatives have been driven by the desire to protect the lender who is the lender the rich guy of course another volcker legacy is the free movement of short term loans in and out of developing countries this has turned the financial markets of these countries into little more than casinos for traders where money floods in on so called good news such as a change of government only to rush out again when that government doesn t hit financial targets because the economy as we all should know is not a predictable machine but an erratic sociological phenomenon such boom bust cycles with money gushing in and out of a country cause massive instability in that country s currency which in turn undermines any form of long term planning reinforcing the initial instability these huge financial swings have clattered into fragile countries and they tend to follow the same pattern of over lending and over optimism followed by a crash the volcker inspired global financial deregulation simply exacerbates existing patterns in 1890 another argentinian crisis nearly bankrupted barings bank and of course nick leeson finished the job it also nearly broke the bank of england again over lending saw 1 billion flow into argentina between 1872 and 1889 money poured in and inflation went up as demand went through roof the bank of england fearing that too much english money was heading out of the country raised rates precipitating a default in the place most of the money had ended up precisely because rates like in the us in 1982 had gone up undermining the terms of the original investments haughty attitudes to latin american countries are exemplified by de gaulle who on a return from an official trip to brazil announced that brazil is not a serious country strolling around this magnificent city of buenos aires listening to locals worry about what is happening throughout the continent it s easy to see that the stories we tell ourselves about flaky developing counties don t capture the full picture in the process not only do we do them a disservice but we do it to ourselves too
families of victims of alleged extra judicial killings in president rodrigo duterte s so called war on drugs display placards and portraits of their slain relatives as they call on the united nations human rights council unhrc to investigate the killings july 9 2019 in suburban quezon city northeast of manila philippines rule of law matters for economic development and protecting the sanctity of contracts and upholding human rights are both part and parcel of the rule of law it seems odd to have to write an article asserting this point but such are the times we are in my target audience for this piece include all those fellow economists who seem to believe the philippines can still pursue development even under a regime that fails to uphold the rule of law and more specifically fails to protect human rights according to some as long we protect the sanctity of contracts our economy will grow this is a false dichotomy and an overly narrow and shallow understanding of the rule of law and institutions a holistic institutional environment that fails to protect human rights also fails to uphold contracts the downward spiral involving failure to protect both human rights and contractual rights is something the philippines has seen before during the initially welcomed and later widely condemned rule of dictator ferdinand marcos in the 1970s and 80s it probably bears reiterating even more recent evidence if people have forgotten rule of law and the economy in a recent opinion piece the case for citira s lowering the corporate income tax raul fabella of the up school of economics very succinctly summed up the international evidence on factors boosting foreign direct investments fdi it is clear from the literature however that lowering the corporate income tax rate is not the main constraint the philippines presently needs to address instead the focus should be on infrastructure high power costs red tape also known as the lack of ease of doing business and unstable and often captured regulatory regimes as well as weak rule of law presumably some progress is being made on infrastructure and energy notwithstanding severe delays and in may 2018 president rodrigo duterte signed the anti red tape law which in turn created the anti red tape authority arta as part of other efforts to lessen red tape and increase efficiency in the public sector yet perhaps the area with the least progress or even recent regression is the rule of law law and order underpins any well functioning economy in recent research law refers to the sturdiness and impartiality of the legal system while order refers to the widespread observance of the law in canonical models of the market economy upholding the rule of law as well as respecting property rights and contractual rights are some of the key ingredients for the efficient functioning of markets an already large body of literature asserts that weak rule of law is associated with anaemic foreign investment flows for instance in a recent international survey of over 300 major multinational corporations by the economist intelligence unit the rule of law was among the top three considerations in making fdi decisions with almost 90 percent of respondents indicating it as essential or very important it is interesting to note here the recent brouhaha over the decision by water concessionaires manila water and maynilad to waive the 10 8 billion philippine peso payment from the philippine government based on the recent arbitration ruling in singapore the arbitration tribunal decided the philippine government should pay manila water p7 4 billion and maynilad p3 4 billion due to losses they incurred when they were prevented from raising water rates in the past as noted by at least one private sector official the decision to waive the ruling was a direct result of duterte s public rant against the concessionaires regardless of how one assesses the tribunal decision these extralegal maneuvers by the president sent the private sector into panic with the philippine stock market losing almost p130 billion over 2 5 billion during the week of duterte s rant the entire episode was a potentially reputation damaging precedent casting a shadow over the sanctity of contracts and the rule of law in the philippines human rights matter sanctity of contracts is one thing but what about human rights there is now growing evidence that the importance of rule of law to economic development is not merely limited to its direct application to property rights in particular upholding human rights is critically important to boosting investments and development hence this dramatically expands the canonical view of economic theory which often only has a narrow emphasis on rule of law for contract enforcement recent research on fdi inflows uncovered evidence that human rights violations may provide a highly negative signal for foreign investors in a panel data analysis of 165 countries during the period 1977 2013 krishna chaitanya vadlamannati et al find evidence that condemnations by the un human rights commission and council tend to diminish fdi inflows the results suggest that countries condemned by the unhrcc are associated with a roughly 49 decline in fdi inflows the authors further note these results suggest that shaming by the unhrcc is a major driver of the negative effects on fdi possibly because of the high visibility of condemnations by an international body like the un and the connected harsh pressure of resolutions on business reputation bottleneck effect as well as effects from isolation of the host county in the international community outcast effect clearly condemnation on human rights violations could create knock on effects in other areas notably trade and investment flows security partnerships and perhaps even development assistance both conceptually and in practice it is difficult to imagine how one can cherry pick the development of institutions to produce the rule of law indeed countries with generally poor human rights records often also have generally weak institutions and as illustrated by a simple cross plot of fdi and law and order indicators for asian economies in figure 1 weak institutions and sub par investment performance often go hand in hand scanning data on asian economies only china india and singapore tend to buck the trend significantly outperforming peers at their level of law and order law and order here is as defined previously the law sub component assesses the strength and impartiality of the legal system and the order sub component assesses popular observance of the law it is possible that these other countries possess other factors that also attract investments such as population size for china and india and strong governance and human capital for tiny singapore in no way do these facts weaken the economic argument for strengthening the rule of law particularly for countries like the philippines the argument here by institutions scholars is that institutions reinforce each other and are able to produce end results like sustained and inclusive development only because the entire architecture of institutions provides the stable platform to produce such results put simply in a democratic setting such as in the philippines it is difficult to imagine citizens holding their leaders accountable when they must continuously depend on patrons for assistance with education health social protection and other wants and needs in an environment meanwhile that lacks many public goods and services disempowerment of citizens is also palpable under a judicial system that fails to uphold human rights much more effectively how much more so if citizens are worried for their very safety and fear the state and their leaders in economic development discussions the strength and independence of the judiciary is often left out of conversations as if one can operate a strong sustained economy with inclusive growth without a functioning efficient and trustworthy judiciary again this is a false dichotomy a professional and independent judiciary that can uphold human rights is likely the same one that stands to uphold the sanctity of contracts most effectively poor quality institutions poor quality investments as a final note some analysts and media have been flagging anemic investment flows into the philippines in november 2018 july 2019 and most recently in december 2019 various factors may be behind this including domestic and international reasons and adding more concerns over the philippines rule of law does not help and an additional point here even if investment flows held steady it is critically important to start monitoring not simply the levels of investment but also their nature the problems attached to investments into chinese pogos philippine online gambling operations further emphasize that the net benefits from certain types of investments are weaker than others pogos don t create many jobs they are now increasingly associated with crime e g kidnapping prostitution and drugs and they as yet do not contribute significantly to tax revenues on the other hand in tanauan batangas a world class export zone managed by the lopez group of companies is home to investments like murata electronics from japan and collins aerospace from the united states murata manufactures several million ceramic microchips every day which end up in regional supply chains for making state of the art smart phones and television sets collins aerospace manufactures aircraft cabin interior products including cabin seating lighting oxygen systems food and beverage preparation and storage equipment galleys and lavatories these are the types of manufacturing related investments that not only create many jobs but they also provide important opportunities to break into major export markets fueling growth and expansion and enable rapid technology catch up collins has begun to attract many filipino engineers previously working abroad to repatriate and apply their skills to the company s manufacturing designs the next time you board a boeing 737 or an airbus 350 note that parts of these aircraft are now proudly made in the philippines and perhaps more importantly designed by filipino engineers one key reason we emphasize the importance of investment type here is that more likely the most development friendly investments i e job creating technology transferring export market opening sustainability respecting fdi are also likely much more sensitive to the rule of law environment these types of investments typically come from countries with relatively stronger institutions for good governance mining investors from canada for instance are bringing stronger community partnerships experience due to the institutions they built to regulate mining activities in their home country and they are pushing for more transparency and citizens oversight toward sustainable mining in the philippines in close partnership with the philippine chamber of mines and different stakeholders moreover investors from industrial countries with anti corruption laws and anti bribery protocols are compelled by their countries laws and policies to eschew corruption these characteristics make them allies for domestic stakeholders pushing for good governance and greater freedom of information on the other hand not all investors and their investments imply such benefits it is well known that there are rising concerns over investments from countries that have much weaker institutions much has been written about china s corrosive capital which a growing number of analysts see as a threat to fragile democracies in latin america analysts have already begun to question whether china is a partner or a predator in the philippines it remains to be seen whether and to what extent chinese investments will shed the initial negative press generated by pogos many of these nuances are unappreciated as the media and the less informed typically just look at headline fdi figures and yet higher quality investments matter critically to the nation s development goals and these types of investments often come from countries with strong rule of law and high quality institutions conditions that make them more sensitive to these same investment environment factors in the countries where they invest restoring balance perhaps daron acemoglu and james a robinson capture it best in their new book the narrow corridor they emphasize the tricky balance between despotism and anarchy with many developing countries trying to navigate the narrow pathway in between the two extremes in many cases society needs to catch up with an ever growing and increasingly powerful state and elite often to assert their rights and provide the necessary checks and balances to keep their country on a balanced development path that is only possible if the rule of law is strong and if it includes not simply upholding contracts but perhaps even more importantly respect for human rights ronald u mendoza ph d is dean and professor of

shoppers walk through the king of prussia mall in pennsylvania us photo reuters file us retail sales increased less than expected in november as americans cut back on discretionary spending despite a strong labor market raising fears the economy was slowing a bit faster than anticipated in the fourth quarter the report from the commerce department on friday bucked a recent raft of fairly upbeat data on the labor market housing trade and manufacturing that had suggested the economy was growing at a moderate speed in spite of headwinds from trade tensions and slowing global growth the federal reserve on wednesday kept interest rates steady and signaled that borrowing costs were likely to remain unchanged at least through next year amid expectations the economy would continue to grow modestly and the unemployment rate remain low just as the fed was in the middle of a victory dance convinced they have returned the economy to a position of strength after just three rate cuts the consumer waves a red flag said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel in chicago any signs the consumer is waning could have sizeable negative consequences for growth at year end and into next year retail sales rose 0 2 percent last month data for october was revised up to show retail sales increasing 0 4 percent instead of climbing 0 3 percent as previously reported november s sales gains were meager despite reports from retailers of brisk black friday business some economists blamed a late thanksgiving this year compared to 2018 which pushed cyber monday shopping into december the late thanksgiving could also have thrown off the model that the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data holding back sales economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales would accelerate 0 5 percent in november compared to november last year retail sales increased 3 3 percent excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales edged up 0 1 percent last month after rising by an unrevised 0 3 percent in october these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of the economy even accounting for the thanksgiving related distortions retail sales have slowed considerably after rising by an average of 0 7 percent per month in the first eight months of this year economists believe sales are cooling as wage growth has stalled despite the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century as we have been asking is this just noise or an early sign that cracks in the strong consumer story are starting to form said michelle girard chief us economist at natwest markets in stamford connecticut we are watchful it is the latter consumer spending grew at a 2 9 percent annualized rate in the third quarter november s slim gain in core retail sales left economists to expect that consumer spending would rise at around a 2 0 percent rate in the fourth quarter but slowing consumer spending is boosting inventories at retailers which could limit the downside to fourth quarter gdp growth in a separate report on friday the commerce department said retail inventories excluding autos which go into the calculation of gdp increased 0 7 percent in october after rising 0 2 percent in september growth estimates for the fourth quarter now range from as low as a 1 3 percent rate to as high as a 2 0 percent pace the economy grew at a 2 1 percent pace in the third quarter economists did not expect a de escalation in trade tensions between the united states and china to materially change the outlook for the economy in 2020 arguing that it would take a long time to reverse the damage caused by the 17 month trade war on sectors like manufacturing and agriculture president donald trump and chinese officials said on friday they had agreed to a phase one trade deal that included cutting us tariffs on chinese goods stocks on wall street were mixed in volatile trade with investors confused on the status of the us china deal the dollar fell against a basket of currencies while us treasury prices rose it is unlikely that the so called phase one agreement with china will change things significantly in the short run said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania there is little expectation that the next phase where the real deals are supposed to be made will happen and if they do when that would be the case last month auto sales increased 0 5 percent after rising 1

bank of canada governor stephen poloz s 1982 ph d thesis the demand for money in a multicurrency world generated three separate journal articles an uncommon achievement that helped him win a job at the central bank straight out of university poloz is wrapping up his professional career the way it began related stories the governor who will retire when his term ends in june has been spending considerable time at a keyboard churning out an uncommon amount of academic analysis for someone whose day job comes with a full daily calendar last month poloz published a paper that argues that the embrace of artificial intelligence ai is leading a so far undetectable productivity boom this week he supplemented that idea with a second paper that will hopefully be passed around in ottawa the provincial capitals and as many c suites as possible in the weeks and months ahead we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us stephen poloz the new paper is based on remarks he made in september at the annual spruce meadows changing fortunes roundtable a discrete gathering of carefully selected members of the global elite in calgary poloz imagines where canada could end up years from now as digital technology protectionist politics and unprecedented levels of debt converge to generate forces that will be unfamiliar to executives investors and policy makers the point of the exercise is to suggest that the future should turn out fine if different provided we don t get hung up on what barack obama might call stupid shit along the way this topic reflects my concern that we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us poloz wrote in the new paper by exercising the muscles of understanding alternative projections we can build the ability to adapt to whatever comes our way poloz reckons executives and investors should prepare an extended period of suboptimal policy he told reporters after a speech in toronto this week that the actual finalization and the ratification of the new north american free trade agreement is crucial for restoring business confidence and investment the backing of the democratic majority in the u s house of representatives and the subsequent signing of an updated agreement this week was positive but the process chilled investment for the better part of two years and unlike most trade agreements from the postwar era the new nafta restricts trade instead of making it broadly freer if this is the template for dealing with the world s largest economy then it s reasonable to predict that the growth rates to which we had accustomed during the most recent phase of globalization will no longer be possible therefore expectations should adjust accordingly as some growth is better than none at all by way of example poloz mentioned hurdle rates the return on an investment that executives require to justify the risk of deploying precious capital companies that are still working with hurdle rates from 10 years ago will find fewer investment opportunities that exceed those rates poloz wrote the implication is that companies need to adjust hurdle rates downward to reflect the new reality and then seek ways to manage elevated risk besides if they don t lower investment spending means slower economic growth now and it means that the economic potential of our economies will grow more slowly over the long term as well poloz has bought into the notion that we are in the early stages of an industrial revolution akin to the eras created by the steam engine electrification and the computer chip it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern the previous three industrial revolutions ended in misery as euphoria over the possibilities fuelled asset price bubbles that brought calamity when they burst but canada s central bank governor is a techno optimist even if some professions vanish overall employment always trends higher he also observes that policy makers have been getting better at managing the economy the third industrial revolution computer chips ended with the great recession a terrible outcome and yet an improvement on the depression of the 1930s poloz said central banks and others have studied the mistakes of the past few decades and have adjusted their approaches accordingly that doesn t mean there will never be another big recession but it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern if canada s economy crashes in the near future it probably won t be because the central bank raised interest rates too high too fast if policy mistakes were the trigger for previous recessions and policy makers have learned how to limit such mistakes then it s conceivable the current expansion could extend longer than those that have come before in poloz s previous paper he said the productivity gains from ai should allow central banks to leave interest rates relatively low for longer because inflation will remain contained that would help cushion the bumpy transition to a new economy in other words if canada s economy crashes in the near future it probably won t be because the central bank raised interest rates too high too fast a more likely cause would be debt at almost 180 per cent of disposable income canada s household debt will be a vulnerability for a long time arguably for a generation or at least until mom and dad leave behind their real estate and savings to help millennials pay off their debts poloz said the burden is manageable as servicing costs are reasonably low still the weight of it could cause voters and their elected representatives to seek ways to lighten the load poloz warned that a renewed tolerance for inflation could emerge something for which markets appear ill prepared we should at least consider the possibility of a confluence of incentives between indebted households and indebted governments to tolerate another inflationary episode like that of the late 1970s and 1980s poloz said financial markets appear to be attaching very low weight to this risk today poloz stressed that he could be wrong about where the arc of history is headed but his thinking makes for a good frame for bank of canada policy canadian policy makers surprised many on bay street by leaving interest rates unchanged this year as almost every other central bank cut one reason for the disconnect appears to be that the central bank is taking inflation more seriously than investors and yet poloz has sent a clear signal that he s comfortable letting the economy run a little hotter than rules designed for a pre revolutionary economy might allow in a way he s showing us we needn t fear the future call it a parting gift email twitter carmichaelkevin copyright postmedia network inc 2019

congress in what amounted to a parliamentary coup in 2016 an international campaign to free lula finally succeeded in november but far too late for him to run against bolsonaro lula is free and

military thirteen us members of congress sent a dear colleague letter condemning the administration s support for military backed regime and silence on violent repression contributes to spiraling crisis this letter stands in stark contrast to the close association of key figures behind the coup with allies in washington the oas secretary general s embrace of coup leader luis fernando camacho

new year 2019 marked the inauguration of jair bolsonaro as president of brazil the election of hard right bolsonaro called the trump of brazil by friends and foes alike was a major reversal from the previous left leaning workers party governments brazil has by far the biggest economy in latin america and the eighth in the world and is part of the brics bloc including russia india china and south africa with a sycophant of trump heading brazil both hemispheric and world geopolitics suffer the loss of a countervailing element to us hegemony brazil voted with the us and israel for continuing the us blockade on cuba and against 187 other un members former left leaning president lula da silva would have easily beaten bolsonaro if the polls were any indication but corrupt judge sergio moro sent lula to prison on evidenceless charges the judge was rewarded by ironically being made minister of justice in the new bolsonaro government similarly dilma rousseff who was lula s left leaning successor as president of brazil had been deposed on a technicality by the right leaning congress in what amounted to a parliamentary coup in 2016 an international campaign to free lula finally succeeded in november but far too late for him to run against bolsonaro lula is free and fighting now but could be incarcerated again bolsonaro went about dismantling social welfare measures firing government workers and rewarding multinational corporations while the amazon burned predictably the popular sectors arose leading to an uncertain political situation in brazil chile the chilean people launched a general strike against austerity with slogans such as neoliberalism was born in chile and will die here reacting to the privatization of everything the uprising this fall has been truly

transition a brief flourishing of democracy ended in haiti when the us brazenly kidnapped president jean bertrand aristide and flew him into exile in 2004 since then a series of dubiously elected presidents some literally installed and all propped up by the us have produced human rights and social welfare conditions worse than under the dictatorships billions in relief after the 2010 earthquake and in petrocaribe funds from venezuela have largely disappeared into the pockets of corrupt politicians in response the ever restive haitian populace has yet intensified the uprising of

against the largely indigenous population taking some 200 000 lives have not been healed but continue to be reinforced by harsh neoliberal measures and a regime of impunity fueling the exodus to the

bank of canada governor stephen poloz s 1982 ph d thesis the demand for money in a multicurrency world generated three separate journal articles an uncommon achievement that helped him win a job at the central bank straight out of university poloz is wrapping up his professional career the way it began related stories the governor who will retire when his term ends in june has been spending considerable time at a keyboard churning out an uncommon amount of academic analysis for someone whose day job comes with a full daily calendar last month poloz published a paper that argues that the embrace of artificial intelligence ai is leading a so far undetectable productivity boom this week he supplemented that idea with a second paper that will hopefully be passed around in ottawa the provincial capitals and as many c suites as possible in the weeks and months ahead we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us stephen poloz the new paper is based on remarks he made in september at the annual spruce meadows changing fortunes roundtable a discrete gathering of carefully selected members of the global elite in calgary poloz imagines where canada could end up years from now as digital technology protectionist politics and unprecedented levels of debt converge to generate forces that will be unfamiliar to executives investors and policy makers the point of the exercise is to suggest that the future should turn out fine if different provided we don t get hung up on what barack obama might call stupid shit along the way this topic reflects my concern that we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us poloz wrote in the new paper by exercising the muscles of understanding alternative projections we can build the ability to adapt to whatever comes our way poloz reckons executives and investors should prepare an extended period of suboptimal policy he told reporters after a speech in toronto this week that the actual finalization and the ratification of the new north american free trade agreement is crucial for restoring business confidence and investment the backing of the democratic majority in the u s house of representatives and the subsequent signing of an updated agreement this week was positive but the process chilled investment for the better part of two years and unlike most trade agreements from the postwar era the new nafta restricts trade instead of making it broadly freer if this is the template for dealing with the world s largest economy then it s reasonable to predict that the growth rates to which we had accustomed during the most recent phase of globalization will no longer be possible therefore expectations should adjust accordingly as some growth is better than none at all by way of example poloz mentioned hurdle rates the return on an investment that executives require to justify the risk of deploying precious capital companies that are still working with hurdle rates from 10 years ago will find fewer investment opportunities that exceed those rates poloz wrote the implication is that companies need to adjust hurdle rates downward to reflect the new reality and then seek ways to manage elevated risk besides if they don t lower investment spending means slower economic growth now and it means that the economic potential of our economies will grow more slowly over the long term as well poloz has bought into the notion that we are in the early stages of an industrial revolution akin to the eras created by the steam engine electrification and the computer chip it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern the previous three industrial revolutions ended in misery as euphoria over the possibilities fuelled asset price bubbles that brought calamity when they burst but canada s central bank governor is a techno optimist even if some professions vanish overall employment always trends higher he also observes that policy makers have been getting better at managing the economy the third industrial revolution computer chips ended with the great recession a terrible outcome and yet an improvement on the depression of the 1930s poloz said central banks and others have studied the mistakes of the past few decades and have adjusted their approaches accordingly that doesn t mean there will never be another big recession but it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern if canada s economy crashes in the near future it probably won t be because the central bank raised interest rates too high too fast if policy mistakes were the trigger for previous recessions and policy makers have learned how to limit such mistakes then it s conceivable the current expansion could extend longer than those that have come before in poloz s previous paper he said the productivity gains from ai should allow central banks to leave interest rates relatively low for longer because inflation will remain contained that would help cushion the bumpy transition to a new economy in other words if canada s economy crashes in the near future it probably won t be because the central bank raised interest rates too high too fast a more likely cause would be debt at almost 180 per cent of disposable income canada s household debt will be a vulnerability for a long time arguably for a generation or at least until mom and dad leave behind their real estate and savings to help millennials pay off their debts poloz said the burden is manageable as servicing costs are reasonably low still the weight of it could cause voters and their elected representatives to seek ways to lighten the load poloz warned that a renewed tolerance for inflation could emerge something for which markets appear ill prepared we should at least consider the possibility of a confluence of incentives between indebted households and indebted governments to tolerate another inflationary episode like that of the late 1970s and 1980s poloz said financial markets appear to be attaching very low weight to this risk today poloz stressed that he could be wrong about where the arc of history is headed but his thinking makes for a good frame for bank of canada policy canadian policy makers surprised many on bay street by leaving interest rates unchanged this year as almost every other central bank cut one reason for the disconnect appears to be that the central bank is taking inflation more seriously than investors and yet poloz has sent a clear signal that he s comfortable letting the economy run a little hotter than rules designed for a pre revolutionary economy might allow in a way he s showing us we needn t fear the future call it a parting gift email twitter carmichaelkevin copyright postmedia network inc 2019
wall street closed out a listless day friday with tiny gains and more record highs for the s p 500 and nasdaq the u s and china revealed they have reached an initial deal in their long running trade war the phase 1 agreement means that the u s won t impose new tariffs on chinese goods that had been set to kick in this weekend investors anxiety over the prospects of such an escalation in the trade war contributed to a sluggish start for the market this month president donald trump and chinese officials made separate statements confirming the agreement friday media reports signaling that a deal was close spurred a rally a day earlier that sent the s p 500 and the nasdaq to record highs that likely led to the muted reaction in the markets friday people obviously were excited about what they heard yesterday and now what you re seeing is a consolidation now that it s actually been confirmed said lisa erickson head of the traditional investment group at u s bank wealth management technology companies which rely heavily on china for sales as well as parts led the gainers friday outweighing losses in banks energy stocks and elsewhere bond prices rose pulling yields lower the s p 500 index added a mere 0 23 points or less than 0 1 to reach an all time high of 3 168 80 the dow jones industrial average inched up 3 33 points or less than 0 1 to 28 135 38 the nasdaq which is heavily weighted with technology stocks rose 17 56 points or 0 2 to 8 734 88 the russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell 6 84 points or 0 4 to 1 637 98 optimism over the possibility of a trade deal helped stocks rebound after a downbeat start to the week the s p 500 ended the week with its third straight weekly gain with less than three weeks left in 2019 the benchmark index is up 26 4 for the year the stock indexes were little changed through most of friday as investors weighed the implications of the trade deal the costly trade conflict and the threat it could escalate at any moment has been the biggest source of uncertainty for wall street this year the dispute has also hurt manufacturing around the world and caused u s businesses to hold back on making investments the saving grace for the economy has been a strong job market and consumer spending word that washington and beijing were pursuing a limited deal helped allay some of those concerns this fall which helped spur the market higher after a sharp pullback this summer but investors grew anxious earlier this month as the dec 15 planned rollout of u s tariffs on 160 billion worth of chinese imports neared in addition to canceling the new tariffs the u s also agreed to reduce certain existing import taxes on about 112 billion in chinese goods from 15 to 7 5 in return trump said on twitter the chinese have agreed to massive purchases of american farm and manufactured products as part of the initial deal it s unclear how much the partial trade deal removes the uncertainty over another escalation in the dispute which has had more than a few swings since it started 17 months ago we got something but until we have a full fledged deal it may be tough to get excited said jj kinahan chief market strategist for td ameritrade the latest development in trade relations didn t have much of an impact on the market because it is essentially just a tariff truce according to jamie cox managing partner for harris financial group the next phase of the agreement will have to tackle some of the larger issues to provide relief from existing tariffs it s going to be a bigger lift in large part because the president doesn t really want to take the tariffs off cox said that s going to require much more give on the chinese part than what is currently in the offer technology sector stocks were the biggest winners

inflation stagflation onion prices headline inflation onion negative industrial and manufacturing growth combined with risingand unemployment is a worrying trend that needs to be arrested soon the termwas coined in the mid 1970s when the american economy experienced a strange phenomenon of high inflation and high unemployment ie low economic growth the reason this was a strange phenomenon is that until then conventional economic theory did not anticipate such a situation it was considered to be inconsistent if not impossible the reasoning was as follows if unemployment is high then people will be willing to accept a job even with a lower pay excess supply of labour would cause wage disinflation and indeed overall inflation to be very low or negative if gdp growth was slow it would mean goods and services were not selling well and aggregate demand was low and companies would offer discounts prices would be slashed for all things from washing machines to clothing and air tickets causing inflation to fall basically low growth meant low inflation conversely when inflation was high it would mean producers were charging a high price which means there must be excess demand so inflation meant an overheated economy ie growing too rapidly until the mid 1970s the developed world had not experienced low growth and high inflation simultaneously the oil crisis of mid 1970s caused by the middle east cartel caused oil prices to skyrocket leading to massive inflation this also coincided with recession in the united states which also spread to europe the oil price induced inflation could not be controlled domestically and deficit spending could not get the economy out of recession ergo a new word was coined stagflation usually the causes of stagflation which is made up of two words stagnation plus inflation are supply shocks inducing price spikes and recession like conditions causing gdp slowdown or even a recession that is the situation india may find itself in unless gdp growth picks up in the next three or six months the inflation in india is not caused by an external shock like oil prices emanating from the middle east but by food prices mainly onions the inflation inlast month was as high as 120 per cent causing overall consumer inflation to start inching towards 6 per cent in december thiscould cross 7 per cent as well of courseprices are notoriously fickle and can fall abruptly by 50 per cent in the coming months in fact two years ago onion inflation had crossed 200 per cent during november 2017 the overall consumer price index is calculated on the basis of prices of hundreds of items and the weight of onion price in the overall index is just a tiny 0 64 per cent yet onion prices have great headline value and have been known to have brought tears to the eyes of many politicians the most remarkable thing is that last financial year which ended in march 2019 witnessed the lowest food inflation in nearly two and half decades this meant that food producers ie farmers received an adverse terms of trade vis a vis other sectors of the economy if food inflation is now rising and is the chief reason behind rising overall inflation the silver lining is that the food producers and rural economy are doing well hopefully while urban consumers curse the rising inflation rural consumers purchasing power is increasing but there are other worrying trends last month industrial production was down 3 8 per cent manufacturing output was down 2 1per cent overall electricity generation was down 12 2 per cent more than 133 coal fired power plants have already shut or are about to be shut not because there is no coal available but because of lack of demand electricity production is a sure shot indicator of industrial activity in the whole economy other correlated indicators like air and rail cargo movement also indicate slowdown gdp growth itself has been coming down for several quarters and reached a six year low of 4 5 per cent the growth in bank credit from commercial banks is almost 90 per cent down in the first six months of this fiscal year as compared to last year unemployment is high too private capital spending is still stagnant it is one of the main drivers of growth and needs to pick up soon the animal spirits of the private sector need to be awakened all eyes are therefore naturally on the upcoming budget in two months for a signal from the government towards a big fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts or infrastructure spending of course the stock market is at an all time high and the country s foreign exchange reserves are highest ever but that alone is not cause for complacency as we urgently need to move away from the low growth and rising inflation trajectory

bank of canada governor stephen poloz s 1982 ph d thesis the demand for money in a multicurrency world generated three separate journal articles an uncommon achievement that helped him win a job at the central bank straight out of university poloz is wrapping up his professional career the way it began related stories the governor who will retire when his term ends in june has been spending considerable time at a keyboard churning out an uncommon amount of academic analysis for someone whose day job comes with a full daily calendar last month poloz published a paper that argues that the embrace of artificial intelligence ai is leading a so far undetectable productivity boom this week he supplemented that idea with a second paper that will hopefully be passed around in ottawa the provincial capitals and as many c suites as possible in the weeks and months ahead we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us stephen poloz the new paper is based on remarks he made in september at the annual spruce meadows changing fortunes roundtable a discrete gathering of carefully selected members of the global elite in calgary poloz imagines where canada could end up years from now as digital technology protectionist politics and unprecedented levels of debt converge to generate forces that will be unfamiliar to executives investors and policy makers the point of the exercise is to suggest that the future should turn out fine if different provided we don t get hung up on what barack obama might call stupid shit along the way this topic reflects my concern that we tend to be overly occupied with short term issues and can miss the big slow moving forces that are coming at us poloz wrote in the new paper by exercising the muscles of understanding alternative projections we can build the ability to adapt to whatever comes our way poloz reckons executives and investors should prepare an extended period of suboptimal policy he told reporters after a speech in toronto this week that the actual finalization and the ratification of the new north american free trade agreement is crucial for restoring business confidence and investment the backing of the democratic majority in the u s house of representatives and the subsequent signing of an updated agreement this week was positive but the process chilled investment for the better part of two years and unlike most trade agreements from the postwar era the new nafta restricts trade instead of making it broadly freer if this is the template for dealing with the world s largest economy then it s reasonable to predict that the growth rates to which we had accustomed during the most recent phase of globalization will no longer be possible therefore expectations should adjust accordingly as some growth is better than none at all by way of example poloz mentioned hurdle rates the return on an investment that executives require to justify the risk of deploying precious capital companies that are still working with hurdle rates from 10 years ago will find fewer investment opportunities that exceed those rates poloz wrote the implication is that companies need to adjust hurdle rates downward to reflect the new reality and then seek ways to manage elevated risk besides if they don t lower investment spending means slower economic growth now and it means that the economic potential of our economies will grow more slowly over the long term as well poloz has bought into the notion that we are in the early stages of an industrial revolution akin to the eras created by the steam engine electrification and the computer chip it does challenge the persistent notion that we re due for a downturn just because that s the historical pattern the previous three industrial revolutions ended in misery as euphoria over the possibilities fuelled asset price bubbles that brought calamity when they burst but canada s central bank

wall street closed out a listless day friday with tiny gains and more record highs for the s p 500 and nasdaq the u s and china revealed they have reached an initial deal in their long running trade war the phase 1 agreement means that the u s won t impose new tariffs on chinese goods that had been set to kick in this weekend investors anxiety over the prospects of such an escalation in the trade war contributed to a sluggish start for the market this month president donald trump and chinese officials made separate statements confirming the agreement friday media reports signaling that a deal was close spurred a rally a day earlier that sent the s p 500 and the nasdaq to record highs that likely led to the muted reaction in the markets friday people obviously were excited about what they heard yesterday and now what you re seeing is a consolidation now that it s actually been confirmed said lisa erickson head of the traditional investment group at u s bank wealth management technology companies which rely heavily on china for sales as well as parts led the gainers friday outweighing losses in banks energy stocks and elsewhere bond prices rose pulling yields lower the s p 500 index added a mere 0 23 points or less than 0 1 to reach an all time high of 3 168 80 advertising the dow jones industrial average inched up 3 33 points or less than 0 1 to 28 135 38 the nasdaq which is heavily weighted with technology stocks rose 17 56 points or 0 2 to 8 734 88 the russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell 6 84 points or 0 4 to 1 637 98 optimism over the possibility of a trade deal helped stocks rebound after a downbeat start to the week the s p 500 ended the week with its third straight weekly gain with less than three weeks left in 2019 the benchmark index is up 26 4 for the year the stock indexes were little changed through most of friday as investors weighed the implications of the trade deal the costly trade conflict and the threat it could escalate at any moment has been the biggest source of uncertainty for wall street this year the dispute has also hurt manufacturing around the world and caused u s businesses to hold back on making investments the saving grace for the economy has been a strong job market and consumer spending advertising word that washington and beijing were pursuing a limited deal helped allay some of those concerns this fall which helped spur the market higher after a sharp pullback this summer but investors grew anxious earlier this month as the dec 15 planned rollout of u s tariffs on 160 billion worth of chinese imports neared in addition to canceling the new tariffs the u s also agreed to reduce certain existing import taxes on about 112 billion in chinese goods from 15 to 7 5 in return trump said on twitter the chinese have agreed to massive purchases of american farm and manufactured products as part of the initial deal it s unclear how much the partial trade deal removes the uncertainty over another escalation in the dispute which has had more than a few swings since it started 17 months ago we got something but until we have a full fledged deal it may be tough to get excited said jj kinahan chief market strategist for td ameritrade the latest development in trade relations didn t have much of an impact on the market because it is essentially just a tariff truce according to jamie cox managing partner for harris financial group the next phase of the agreement will have to tackle some of the larger issues to provide relief from existing tariffs it s going to be a bigger lift in large part because the president doesn t really want to take the tariffs off cox said that s going to require much more give on the chinese part than what is currently in the offer advertising

when president trump and china confirmed on friday that they had reached an initial trade deal it helped defuse tensions in a 19 month trade war and avoided another round of punishing tariffs scheduled for this weekend but a trade deal that took nearly two years to reach and inflicted global economic damage in the process does little to resolve the united states biggest concerns about china s trade practices including its use of industrial subsidies and state owned enterprises to dominate global industries like steel and solar panels if signed the deal would increase chinese purchases of american farm and energy products place limits
although i am generally supportive of trade deals over no trade deals usmca appears to be particularly bad rw by daniel j ikenson president trump famously called the north american free trade agreement the worst trade deal ever made bygones the need to debate that claim has been mooted by the fact that nafta s likely successor the united states mexico canada agreement now holds that distinction there s a reason that neither free nor trade appears in the agreement s name there isn t much of any new trade liberalization in the deal then again an agreement pursued with import reduction and supply chain repatriation as its main objectives was never going to be an exemplar of enlightened trade policy instead the deal reflects the shared objectives of the administration s economic nationalists and congress s labor left which were to strengthen the enforcement provisions and discourage companies from investing and operating factories in mexico these inducements come by way of the agreement s streamlined labor and environmental provisions onerous rules of origin requirements unorthodox sunset provision and the scaling back of investment and intellectual property protections to be sure free trade and free trade agreements are very different animals free trade is an economic ideal and is a condition characterized by the absence of trade barriers free trade agreements are political creations built atop mercantilist fallacies and are not about free trade per se these deals include rules that simultaneously liberalize divert and stymie trade capital and labor flows liberalization is usually the organizing principle but the specifics tend to constrain the liberalization trade barriers are lowered or eliminated in some provisions while protectionism is baked into the others free trade is about removing impediments that benefit some at the expense of others so that each of us individually has the fullest battery of choices to decide how best to use our own resources free trade agreements are about managed trade and labyrinthine rules intended to distribute particular benefits to particular interests no agreement illustrates these distinctions as clearly as the usmca does to be fair usmca does modernize nafta to include rules restricting protectionism in digital trade which wasn t on our radars back in 1994 before the internet and e commerce took off the deal secures better access to the canadian market for u s dairy farmers and winemakers and nearly all goods trade within the region will remain tariff free there are also a few improvements efforts to rein in protectionism in other areas of the agreement which my colleagues simon lester and inu manak address here notably the deal doesn t include any significant new u s market opening provisions which really is unprecedented for a u s trade agreement despite u s consumers spending 9 2 trillion on services in 2017 a mere 550 billion 6 was spent on imported services by comparison over 57 percent of the 4 1 trillion americans spent on goods in 2017 was imported that large disparity betrays some significantly protected u s services markets which usmca does nothing to address instead the deal reaffirms bans on foreign competition in maritime shipping commercial air services and trucking the absence of foreign competition across our transportation services industries as well as in our education health care and professional services industries suggests that the usmca could have been much more liberalizing the u s market is generally open to foreign investment already but investment restrictions persist in certain industries including financial services commercial air services communications and mining the usmca provides no significant new access to foreign investors in the united states likewise it does nothing to open any wider the estimated 1 7 trillion u s government procurement market to bids from canadian and mexican companies the absence of competition of course raises the cost of every government procurement project and ensures that taxpayer dollars get needlessly wasted but worse than the absence of liberalization is the abundance of provisions intended to raise the costs of investing in and importing from mexico let s start with the streamlined labor and environmental provisions opposition over the years to enforceable labor and environmental provisions in trade agreements has been predicated on concerns that demands for those kinds of provisions were not motivated by altruism or humanitarian aspirations but by protectionist desires for access to triggers that could impede trade the looming threat of an allegation of a labor provision violation against a mexican factory which could result in that factory suffering lost or impeded access to the u s market would deter investment and retard the cultivation of business relationships that s not a frivolous concern consider that for many u s and other western companies that contract out manufacturing their biggest assets are their brand names they don t want to risk being associated with factories that engage in bad labor practices or that have big environmental footprints nor do they want to be vulnerable to allegations that the factories they are using are socially irresponsible mere allegations can affect the bottom line the labor and environmental provisions in the usmca seem to be designed to be easily accessible the burden of proof is reversed so that the factories accused of violations have to demonstrate how they have not breached commitments or if they have breached how that breach doesn t significantly affect trade among other things this reversal of the burden of proof reduces the cost to u s labor unions for example to render accusations that could lead to trade restrictions this makes those accusations more likely and that in turn makes more fraught more uncertain and more expensive any decisions by u s businesses or business from other countries to set up operations in mexico the same is true for the usmca s rules of origin especially with respect to trade in automobiles under current nafta rules in order to qualify for duty free treatment at least 62 5 percent of the cost of the automobile must come from regional u s canada mexico labor material and overhead cars that don t meet this requirement are assessed a tariff of 2 5 percent of the total cost under the new rules in usmca the benchmarks are much higher 75 percent of the cost must originate in the region moreover 40 percent of that 75 percent a total of 30 percent must be made with labor earning at least 16 per hour for reference mexican wages in auto assembly and production average in the single digits per hour furthermore under usmca an additional rule to qualify is that 70 percent of the steel used in the automobile must come from the region in aggregate these rules contrary to expectations of a trade agreement encourage less efficient production processes and virtually ensure higher costs and higher priced products and that perversely could result in more producers shifting north american production to asia and elsewhere and relying more on imports from outside the region paying a 2 5 percent tariff instead of zero tariffs with much higher production and compliance costs might be the profit maximizing alternative the usmca also includes an unorthodox provision that calls for the agreement to automatically terminate unless the parties affirmatively agree to continue the deal agreement to continue can come as early as year 6 when discussion is open to air concerns and possibly negotiate changes to the provisions if agreement is not reached the parties will go through the process again annually through year 16 if agreement to continue isn t reached before then if no agreement is reached after year 16 the deal terminates this provision needlessly injects a great deal of uncertainty into the agreement how will investors and businesses that may be considering trans national production evaluate their expected costs and projected revenues over a multiyear horizon if one the terms are subject to revision and two the whole deal could be terminated this provision seems intended to discourage investment outside of the united states finally although i find investor and intellectual property protections to be unnecessary or at least too protectionist in typical u s trade and investment agreements the considerable scaling back of these protections is also intended to raise the costs of investing in mexico vis à vis the united states there are greater risks to investing abroad than in the united states and these kinds of provisions tend to mitigate those costs ambassador lighthizer considers these rules to be subsidies for outsourcing which the usmca seems designed to snuff out several editorials and articles recently expressed surprise and delight and marveled at the fact that lighthizer was deft enough to actually produce a trade agreement that not only attracts bipartisan support but also the affirmative endorsement of organized labor labor hasn t supported a major trade deal since the legislation implementing the kennedy round of gatt negotiations in 1967 and a democratic majority hasn t voted in favor of a trade agreement since the legislation implementing the uruguay round of gatt negotiations in 1994 so this is indeed pretty rare but this outcome should not be viewed through the typical partisan prism it s not your traditional anti trade democrat vs pro trade republican situation it s labor left and economic nationalist right who strongly agree on managed trade outcomes and rules that keep investment and all jobs in the united states it wasn t very difficult for robert lighthizer and afl cio chairman richard trumka through his proxy house speaker nancy pelosi two peas in a pod in their skepticism about trade to agree on major provisions in a deal that has very little to do about liberalizing trade but quite a lot to do about enforcement protection and other inducements aimed at muting an imaginary giant sucking sound there should be little doubt that the usmca will win the approval of congress the democrats are on board and while the old republican party would object to this deal trump s gop will not the only remaining question is when
hong kong two of the biggest hurdles constraining the world economy have just been cleared dogged for most of 2019 by trade tensions and political risk that hammered business confidence the outlook for global growth will enter 2020 on a firmer footing after the us and china struck a partial trade deal and outlook for brexit cleared somewhat the china trade deal and uk election result have taken out a major tail risk overhanging markets and companies said ben emons managing director for global macro strategy at medley global advisors in new york business confidence should see a large boost that could see a restart of global investment inventory rebuild and a resurgence of global trade volume like financial markets most economists had factored in some kind of phase one trade agreement between the world s largest economies when projecting the world economy would stabilise into 2020 after a recession scare earlier this year but at a minimum the agreement between president donald trump and president xi jinping means some of the more dire scenarios being contemplated just a few months ago now appear less likely bloomberg economics estimated in june that the cost of the us china trade war could reach 1 2 trillion by 2021 with the impact spread across the asian supply chain that estimate was based on 25 per cent tariffs on all us china trade and a 10 per cent drop in stock markets the phase one deal nevertheless leaves some complicated issues unresolved paving the way for fresh clashes as trump runs for reelection next november still to be dealt with are us complaints over the vast web of subsidies ranging from cheap electricity to low cost loans that china has used to build its industrial might trump said talks over a phase two deal will start immediately a trade deal that takes tariffs back to may 2019 levels for the us that would mean 25 per cent on 50 billion in china imports and 10 per cent on another 200 billion and lowers uncertainty could boost global gdp for 2020 by 0 6 per cent a breakdown in talks and higher tariffs still a possibility given how past agreements have broken down would drag global output down 0 1 per cent said tom orlik chief economist bloomberg economics as for brexit the sweeping election victory by prime minister boris johnson s conservative party means britain is set to leave the eu on january 31 bloomberg economics says the result puts a growth rebound in play which coupled with looser fiscal policy means activity should accelerate over 2019 at the same time johnson must now negotiate a new trade deal with the eu by the end of next year meaning fresh uncertainty could emerge brexit could continue to weigh on economic activity as the difficult task of forging the u k s new trading relationships is just beginning said simon wells chief european economist at hsbc holdings plc the twin developments come amid broader signs that demand across much of the world is stabilising as key manufacturing gauges trough the international monetary fund had flagged upside risks to its recent outlook if major trade tensions were resolved policymakers have also sounded more upbeat this week european central bank president christine lagarde said the eurozone s economic slowdown was showing signs of bottoming out and federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the prognosis for the us remains favourable the chinese government said it would improve the effectiveness of fiscal policy in 2020 while japan is planning new fiscal stimulus
japan has not recovered fully from the lost decade of the 1990s the asian financial crisis was exacerbated by the dot com crash and then a few years later the global economic collapse tokyo has tried everything to combat anemic growth and deflation and resolve the zombification of the japanese economy through an immense buildup of government debt and a dramatic loosening of monetary policy including subzero interest rates this has become known as japanification in recent years europe has seen its own japanification and now it looks like the united states could mirror it too inflation expectations this past summer federal reserve chair jerome powell rejected unsound advice from some of the world s top economists when he dismissed a proposal to raise the inflation target rate from the current 2 percent to 4 percent proponents of this policy say it would allow the central bank to cut interest rates before they slide to zero which would create a whole new set of problems for the central bank and the overall economy powell conceded that it was not a practical alternative and wondered how credible that would be it looks like some fed minds found a compromise temporarily boosting the inflation target rate since it listed 2 percent as the key rate to hit in 2012 the fed has had a difficult time meeting that objective policymakers are getting fed up with the fed s inability to get inflation to reach their target despite the unemployment rate hitting a fifty year low as part of its annual review of monetary policy tools the fed is contemplating increasing its aim to grapple with its lackluster inflation the financial times reported citing current and former fed policymakers the newspaper suggests that the fed is thinking about temporarily raising its goal when it misses its inflation target this would allow the fed to make up for lost inflation and prevent prolonged low us price growth how are current and former fed officials reacting reactions ex fed chair janet yellen thinks it is a worthwhile thing to discuss positing that it would be similar to its forward guidance used in the early post recession days at the time the central bank informed markets that it planned to keep short term rates low for a significant period before finishing her tenure at the fed she admitted that she was open to the possibility of raising the 2 percent range former fed vice chair stanley fischer conceded that he opposes a 4 percent target rate because unions would want to tie their wages to inflation lael brainard a member of the fed board of governors stated that she prefers something a bit more flexible recommending that the range increase from 2 to 2 5 percent after several misses as long as you are communicating to the public financial markets households and businesses about what you are doing the rules could work effectively she noted but brainard also believes that the subject is presently too complex to share with the public fed bank of boston president eric rosengren says that it is important to let markets know that you cannot have readings only below 2 percent to meet the target inflation rate he also believes that this formulaic approach would concern financial markets this is why i prefer something that is a little bit more flexible maybe not as constraining but makes it a little clearer that we should be having over 2 percent rosengren told the times are negative rates next everything about the way governments and central banks report inflation is egregious they usually underreport so price inflation is likely higher than what is being touted for the sake of analyzing what the fed is doing let us suppose that the inflation rate is what the establishment says it is a key argument against raising the inflation target rate is that the fed funds rate is already at historic lows in the next recession monetary policy would largely be ineffective unless it torches long term sustainability by introducing subzero interest rates to spur growth this would be the death knell of the world s largest economy since negative rates signify that the fed has exhausted all tools at its disposal others make the argument that inflation expectations would be lower under this scheme could the united states experience its own japanification despite a myriad of monetary stimulus measures to reverse these trends nearly everything employed has failed it appears that negative rates will not stave off japan s upcoming recession instead these efforts have sent bond yields lower created bad bank loans and increased debt levels an empty tank is the tank empty as with the european central bank ecb and the bank of japan boj everything the fed does will largely be ineffective during the next recession during the boom phase of the business cycle the central bank has cut rates expanded the money supply and relaunched quantitative easing qe by scooping up billions in treasuries and injecting credit markets with cash what else can the fed do negative rates seem the next logical step what is clear is that the fed is making up strategies as it goes along sacrificing long term gains for immediate survival and instant gratification originally published at libertynation

white house principles for child care reform increasing access to affordable high quality child care in america washington dc today more americans are working than ever before virtually every demographic is achieving historic low unemployment rates as the trump administration s policies continue to fuel economic growth we have seen millions of americans come off the sidelines and rejoin the workforce in fact job openings have exceeded the number of job seekers for well over a year maintaining that growth will require strengthening policies to support working families including increasing access to affordable high quality child care this administration is focused on making sure the u s is the best place in the world to conduct business work and raise a family since january 2017 there has been significant progress in implementing the president s working families agenda including doubling the child tax credit from 1 000 to 2 000 per child and expanding refundability establishing bipartisan consideration of national paid family leave and signing into law the largest ever increase in funding for the child care and development block grant ccdbg representing a major new investment in child care affordability the president s budget requests have prioritized child care and paid parental leave to support working families but there is more work to do how families balance work and raising children is a deeply personal choice every parent should have the freedom to make the best decisions for his or her family this administration is prepared to chart a new course that promotes strong families and celebrates their individual needs one that honors respects and empowers both working and stay at home parents and caregivers for parents who choose to or must work for compensation obtaining child care is often a prerequisite for entering and advancing in the workforce over the past 44 years the labor force participation of women with children under 18 has grown from 47 percent in 1975 to nearly 72 percent in 2019 women are now the sole or primary breadwinners in 40 percent of american households with children under age 18 and approximately two thirds of mothers with children under age 6 are employed meanwhile the average cost of center based child care ranges from over 11 000 for infants approximately 10 000 for toddlers and more than 9 000 for 4 year olds in 30 states and the district of columbia the average cost of center based child care for an infant is more than in state college tuition and fees at a public university evidence on the effects of child care costs on labor supply suggest that some parents particularly women would enter the workforce or increase their work hours if the cost of child care was lower one study found that a 10 percent increase in child care costs is associated with a 7 4 percent decline in women s labor force participation policies that reduce the cost of child care can help bring more americans off the sidelines and into the workforce increasing opportunities for families and ensuring that our country s strong economic growth is inclusive and sustained in the future the impact of high child care costs extends beyond families to communities and businesses employee absences and turnover resulting from lack of child care can cost employers and impact overall economic development by reducing productivity and constricting the labor market several states have estimated the impacts on their economy in lost revenue and economic activity finding losses between 1 2 billion annually due to child care related absenteeism and turnover meaningful child care reform that improves access to child care would have positive results for families communities and employers there is also a growing concern about the importance of ensuring child care settings are places of learning that promote and enhance healthy child and youth development and well being high quality child care is a rare investment that pays off now by enabling parents to work and later by supporting children s development and success in school and life research has shown that high quality early learning environments are important for the cognitive language and social development of young children and that investments have the potential to generate economic returns in the long run child care licensing and regulatory systems put in place a foundation to ensure the basic health and safety of child care settings in addition many states have implemented quality rating and improvement systems to provide parents with transparent information on the quality of child care and include additional tiered requirements to help providers strive toward higher quality the administration s reform principles are designed to improve access to affordable high quality child care and support working families by taking steps to increase investment build the supply of child care cultivate the child care workforce and improve options for families across a range of high quality settings principles for child care reform put parents first parents play the leading role in choosing the care that is best suited to their child s needs their own values culture work schedules and budget policymakers should directly engage parents in the design of policies and strategies for improved access to consumer education resources and support including by providing the right level of information through a variety of venues such as community based hubs and agencies consumer education websites and child care resource and referral services this includes promoting shared engagement and local partnerships and highlighting best practices and collaborations child care providers live in and support communities which include children as well as parents who work there and businesses that employ them improving access to child care will necessarily involve the input and feedback of stakeholders from all sectors and requires us to put parents at the center of our efforts reauthorize and reform the child care and development block grant ccdbg act the ccdbg act authorization will expire in fy 2021 the administration believes this is an opportune time to revisit the authorizing statute to make reforms that reflect lessons learned from implementation of the 2014 reauthorization and to better support access to high quality child care for low income families these include address the child care cliff the child care cliff is a widely recognized problem too often the child care subsidy system penalizes parents for moving up the economic ladder when taking a raise or working more hours federal and state level policies should ensure that working parents benefit from their hard work so that they are not penalized with a reduction or loss of child care benefits that erodes the value of their increased earnings the u s department of health and human services recently published a series of briefs on marginal tax rates i e benefit cliffs across several public assistance programs and found that those families just above the poverty line receiving child care subsidies had the highest marginal tax rate among public assistance programs noting that a 5 000 annual earnings increase is associated with a median marginal tax rate of 73 percent leaving families with a net increase of only 1 350 states should strengthen policies to address the sudden loss of child care assistance due to a wage increase or acceptance of a higher paying job this may include gradually adjusting co payments using a sliding fee scale as family income increases to help families transition from child care assistance without experiencing a sudden drastic loss of benefits for example some states have established benefit phase outs in which subsidies are reduced by one dollar for every three additional dollars earned so that work always pays coordinating with other public assistance programs where possible and keeping in mind other sources of support such as tax credits to stagger eligibility thresholds and phase outs so that families will not lose multiple benefits at the same time improve flexibility to address local circumstances and special populations states territories and tribes play a key role in developing policies to support affordability of child care and to make sure child care is a safe high quality early learning environment for young children while states have made significant progress in incorporating provisions of the 2014 reauthorization into their programs there are federal requirements that have presented challenges to meeting the unique needs of families allowing more flexibility in specific areas would allow states to better tailor their child care policies to provide the most effective services for their families strengthen health and safety and increase child care availability through improved implementation of background checks the introduction of the background check requirements in the 2014 reauthorization was driven by a desire to ensure that our nation s children are being cared for in safe environments while the intent of the new requirements remains laudable full implementation has proven to be a challenge due to specific language in the law that does not comport with the realities of state criminal justice and child abuse and neglect systems lessons learned from states have demonstrated a need to strengthen the infrastructure for conducting background checks and address state implementation hurdles across multiple programs and between states concepts for consideration include allowing increased state flexibility to implement alternative but equally effective approaches where there is demonstrated overlap or duplication between the background checks multiple components or where necessary for alignment with other state programs such as background checks for early childhood teachers in state pre kindergarten programs addressing delays in hiring new child care staff due to background check requirements including the current requirement to obtain the results of a fingerprint check before staff can begin working provisionally under supervision improving quality of fingerprinting to avoid delays expanding automation to increase efficiencies and facilitate interstate background checks and promoting portability of results and other solutions that avoid unnecessary repeated checks build the supply of child care providers and increase choices for families since 2005 the overall number of licensed child care providers in the u s has decreased by 30 percent this drop is almost entirely attributable to a decline in home based licensed family child care providers which decreased by half from nearly 200 000 providers in 2005 to less than 100 000 in 2017 the loss of these family child care providers is the equivalent of approximately 540 000 slots for children family child care is an important option for working families to have particularly those with infants where care is expensive if available at all in addition family child care is often a better option for parents who work non traditional hours outside of 9 00 am to 5 00 pm on weekdays when child care centers are typically open many parents choose family child care because it better fits their cultures backgrounds and values families with lower incomes families needing care for infants and toddlers and families who are hispanic or african american are more likely to use home based family child care than center based care we should provide funding aimed at building the supply of child care for underserved populations and in rural areas to improve the number and types of child care settings and arrangements including faith based and family child care providers this includes supporting the development of family child care providers as a small business and entrepreneurship opportunity explore new incentives for businesses looking to offer child care benefits to their employees many businesses are recognizing that policies such as paid parental leave child care and other family friendly workplace policies are important ways to recruit and keep a talented workforce especially for parents looking to balance their dual responsibilities of caregiving and supporting their family this could include offering access to back up child care child care referral services or flexible spending arrangements to offset the costs of child care by banding together by geography or industry small and medium sized businesses can more cost effectively offer child care as a benefit by leveraging employer groups and associations all businesses can benefit from a better understanding of the child care needs of their employees beyond current tax credits technical assistance around employer sponsored child care models and best practices as well as general information about employee parent child care needs and return on investment from family friendly policies could be more widely distributed promote innovation and modernize the child care business model we need to pioneer better business models that enable child care providers both to thrive as small businesses and meet the needs of american families we should seek to make best use of providers experience expertise and passion and improve the availability of child care across the full spectrum of child care arrangements such as through the use of shared services alliances child care center hubs or family child care networks for example shared services alliances can be used to help providers share costs and deliver services in a more streamlined way by pooling resources and hiring centralized staff for operations and business support this should include developing innovative financing models and public private partnerships including philanthropy and the private sector that utilize multiple funding sources to meet the needs of working families increase the availability of high quality child care across settings high quality child care is a multi dimensional concept and may vary based on setting such as center based care or family child care homes many states have implemented quality rating and improvement systems that provide parents with information on the quality of care available in their communities and help child care providers strive for high quality however these systems often give a single rating to a child care setting generally focused on center based care quality requirements that fail to address dimensions of quality that are unique to the setting such as faith based family or home based providers and or that fail to reflect the preferences and needs of parents and children can drive providers out of the market and reduce options for working families respecting the role that parents play in choosing the care that is best suited to their child s needs their own values language culture and work schedules is critical one size fits all directives on what constitutes high quality child care can be counterproductive if there are few child care providers left in the market from which to choose child care policy and quality ratings systems should be designed to be inclusive of all provider types including home based family child care to enable the full array of safe nurturing child care options and settings ensure common sense aligned regulations for child care providers licensing regulatory and monitoring frameworks are the basis for ensuring that child care settings are healthy and safe for children however policies to regulate the health and safety of child care are created separately at the federal state and local levels this can result in an overlay of contradictory policies and procedures and the imposition of unnecessary and burdensome requirements as well as multiple visits from regulatory officials and program monitors at many levels of government some regulatory practices such as local zoning laws inadvertently drive up price and reduce availability but do not necessarily create a more safe or nurturing environment for children the federal government as well as states and localities should ensure that regulatory frameworks requirements and monitoring practices are not duplicative and or unintentionally drive up the cost of providing care reduce availability or push different types of providers such as faith based or home based family child care providers out of the market address the child care workforce shortage an important component of high quality child care particularly for young children is ensuring a nurturing responsive relationship with caregivers a college degree alone is at best an uncertain proxy for quality child care requiring child care staff in a child care setting center or home based to have a college or other degree can increase costs unnecessarily burden already low paid providers with unnecessary student loan debt and drive others out of the profession policies should encourage skills based hiring to ensure that providers bring the competencies and skills needed to provide quality care irrespective of academic degrees making it easier for educators and caregivers to gain the skills and competencies they need to provide high quality care that promotes healthy development and learning can encourage more providers to enter and stay in the workforce removing barriers and creating multiple pathways to enter and advance in the field is critical as is ensuring that compensation aligns with market demands promote child care apprenticeships compensation for child care providers especially for those workers who care for infants and toddlers is generally very low but policymakers at the federal and state level have increased credentialing and degree requirements over time apprenticeship models provide a viable credentialing option for the early childhood education workforce at least eight states currently offer early childhood registered apprenticeships we should establish child care apprenticeship models highlight industry best practices for professional development that do not require providers to incur student loan debt and explore competitive grants to expand apprenticeship access in child care the president s budget has prioritized expansion of apprenticeships in other sectors which is a model that could be applied to child care and early education for example the u s department of labor s employment and training administration is working to replicate texas early childhood apprenticeship program in other states develop recommendations for creating a rational financing framework for child care in america financing for child care and early education in the united states involves multiple programs and funding streams with different eligibility requirements governance structures and quality standards this creates challenges to families and communities in navigating these differences and can lead to overlap gaps in services and wasteful spending figuring out how to make programs work better together multiple funding streams with similar goals often intersect in a way that makes the child care problem worse not better for example many states have invested in expanding pre kindergarten care to 3 and 4 year olds this is a well intended investment but can be problematic for child care providers who often rely on care provided to 3 and 4 year olds to subsidize the high cost of providing infant care to make their business model viable ideally public investments would complement each other and the private market not undermine it an independent working group would make recommendations to congress for more efficient use of the nearly 40 billion in child care and early education funding that american taxpayers provide each year including exploration of a federal and state financing structure that reduces overlap and fragmentation and effectively supports affordability of child care and early education in america so long as federal and state funding continues to be fragmented across multiple divergent delivery systems the gap in funding to ensure more children and families can access high quality and affordable care will persist public support for child care and early learning has grown at both the federal and state level and as future investments are contemplated more attention

the sahiwal coal power project transformed the agricultural heartland of punjab and the lives of those living around it during the groundbreaking of the sahiwal coal power project in 2014 then prime minister nawaz sharif had told locals they were being rewarded for standing by the pml n five years later the farmers of the region tell a different story as the world reconsiders its dependence on environmentally hazardous coal fired power will pakistan follow suit composed and animated by leea contractor not too long ago the residents of qadirabad a small town in sahiwal lived in blissful obscurity muhammad siddique owned 148 kanals over 75 000 square metres of agricultural land in the area and enjoyed a peaceful life away from the perils of industrialisation all this changed in 2014 when then prime minister nawaz sharif inaugurated the sahiwal coal power project today siddique leads a very different life he has great difficulty in walking and struggles with performing everyday tasks in 2017 the 43 year old learnt that his liver has been damaged and his spleen has enlarged the doctor informed me that this was caused by drinking polluted water he tells eos siddique blames the coal power plant for contaminating the groundwater resources of his village he has now stopped drinking tap water and instead gets drinking water from the water supply scheme in qadirabad i was advised complete rest along with heavy medication for six months he says i also had difficulty in breathing and constant headache during this time siddique says polluted water has affected other villagers as well his brother umer hayat s liver was also severely damaged and the doctors gave him the same reason for his illness consuming polluted groundwater doctors have advised him to take medication for the rest of his life villagers say the power plant has impacted not only their health but uprooted the life they once knew they remember the time when they were surrounded by green fields as far as the eye could see they remember what it felt like to breathe fresh air and they remember the sense of ownership they felt towards their land for residents like siddique this loss of ownership was literal one day government officials approached him with an offer to acquire his agricultural land to build the power plant soon he learnt that refusing this offer was not an option muhammad siddique right says drinking polluted water has impacted his health photos by the writer the coal power plant stands in the middle of sahiwal s agricultural land lost land siddique was livid when government officers approached him to buy his land it was our bread and butter where would we go after selling our land he asks siddique did not think he would ever consider the offer he claims he tore the property documents in front of the officials he also started collecting copies of other villagers national identity cards and worked towards stopping the transfer of land for the construction of the sahiwal coal fired power plant his efforts were quickly found out siddique claims a first information report fir with terrorism clauses was moved against him as a scare tactic he also says he was approached by a high ranking district government officer for mediation siddique says the officer made it clear to him that the government will acquire the land no matter what the stakes after all were very high with this project sahiwal had been carefully selected as the home for the coal fired plant after many other sites including sheikhupura muzaffargarh bhikki jhang and rahim yar khan had been considered sahiwal had been given priority due to the presence of a transmission line railway track and irrigation system nearby the 1 320 megawatt mw coal fired power plant would eventually cost 1 8 billon us dollars today the project stands tall with two 660 mw plants and is part of the china pakistan economic corridor cpec project the government buys electricity from the power plant at 8 3601 us cents kilowatt hour and touts the project as a major success aerial view of sahiwal before the construction of the power plant aerial view of sahiwal in february 2019 officers allegedly made the magnitude of the project clear to siddique years ago the farm owner felt dwarfed in comparison lacking the resources or time to fight for his legitimate rights he eventually gave in he still felt that being the main affectees the villagers of qadirabad were in a position to bargain we demanded access to clean drinking water free electricity a small hospital and sui gas and a functioning sewerage system he says siddique claims the officers assured the villagers that these demands would be met but years later none of the facilities have been provided to them it is difficult to cross check these details with the police many of the officers who the villagers speak of no longer work in the region but zeeshan javed deputy commissioner sahiwal tells eos the district administration refuted the allegation regarding adoptive coercive measures to acquire land in fact he says generous compensations were paid to all landholders landholders were also given enough time to harvest he says zaman rasheed wattu who is the station house officer of the noor shah police station located at about a 26 minute drive from the power plant cautions that the villagers claims may be exaggerated this is not possible as the people having land rights can go to courts and get a stay order he says sahiwal had been given priority due to the presence of a transmission line railway track and irrigation system nearby the 1 320 megawatt mw coal fired power plant would eventually cost 1 8 billon us dollars today the project stands tall with two 660 mw plants and is part of the china pakistan economic corridor cpec project wattu says however that he was posted to noor shah just this year and does not have complete details regarding the matter the villagers on the other hand claim to remember the details vividly rana ali hassan is another villager from chak 76 5r who says his luck ran out in 2014 when police marked his land with red flags warning that no one should enter it the police specified the area to mark down the boundaries of the coal fired power plant in qadirabad however hassan along with his fellow villagers mustered the strength to remove those flags they thought the police would not resist their move they were wrong the same night at around 11pm a heavy contingent of police raided our village and unlawfully entered the homes of some people he claims the police misbehaved with those who resisted we didn t want to give away our ancestral land but we had no other option hassan adds we had which we had to sell at the rate of 2 070 000 rupees per acre the farmers allege they weren t even given time to wait for the harvesting season to end i had to harvest the pre mature crop complains hassan unhealthy developments a medical camp was set up in the region in october this year the doctors at the camp report a significant increase in people suffering from breathing problems like siddique and hayat israr khan from chak 76 5r says the sahiwal coal fired power plant has been very detrimental for villagers health my mother is asthmatic now due to increasing air pollution caused by the plant says israr khan whose house is located a few metres away from the power plant dr abdul rauf a senior doctor working in lahore confirms that coal fired power plants can lead to lung diseases especially asthma pneumonitis inflammation of lung tissue and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd the poiso nous fumes and particulate matter emitted from a coal power plant can cause different skin diseases photosensitivity and allergic reaction to the face he adds communities living near the sahiwal coal fired power plant should be relocated he believes higher pollution levels will reduce the amount of oxygen in the local environment and reduce oxygen supply to the brain he says it s actually slow poisoning the adviser to the prime minister on climate change malik amin aslam terms the construction of the sahiwal coal fired power in the agricultural heartland of punjab as criminal neglect this not only affects the agricultural lands around the project he says but also creates issues of long distance transport of coal the environment protection department punjab is responsible for and mandated to monitor the situation and ensure that the project not only abides strictly with its environmental impact assessment but also with the national environmental quality standards for all emissions and effluents adds the minister but naseem ur rehman director eia maintains that air pollution caused by the sahiwal coal fired power plant is well within the limits while commenting upon the efficiency of the power plant he says the sahiwal coal power project uses the highly efficient electrostatic precipitator to control emissions epd punjab is ensuring that all the parameters are adhered we never found emissions to be increasing adds rehman water woes residents of qadirabad say the groundwater table has decreased by up to 15 feet over the last three to four years this could be the result of over pumping of groundwater for utilisation by the coal power says dr nabeel khan niazi a research scientist at the university of agriculture faisalabad the maximum groundwater abstraction for the coal power plant happens during the winter season when canal water is not available from january to march he adds dr niazi is an expert on arsenic dynamics in water he has been investigating the impacts of groundwater abstraction and the rising arsenic levels in sahiwal including nearby villages because of the coal fired power plant the doctor and his team collected up to 220 water samples from electric pumps and hand pumps around villages which were close to the power plant analysis of the samples showed that arsenic concentrations in 45 percent of the samples were above the world health organization s safe limits in drinking water 10 micrograms per litre worse still 30 percent of the well water samples contained arsenic levels above the pakistan epa safe limit which is set at 50 micrograms per litre other water quality parameters that include sulphate chloride and sodium were also higher in 30 to 40 percent of the samples dr niazi adds he says that while the information collected from the survey is preliminary it clearly indicates that there is a potential threat to groundwater quantity and quality in the vicinity of the sahiwal coal power plant which is posing a health risk to the people living there hammad naqi khan the director general of the world wide fund for nature pakistan wwf pakistan was disappointed that the sahiwal coal fired power plant was constructed in the heart of punjab s prime agricultural land it s an environmental disaster as coal has negative consequences on air quality is a water intensive technology and it could affect the fertility of agriculture plains and most importantly exacerbate climate change he says the adviser to the prime minister on climate change malik amin aslam terms the construction of the sahiwal coal fired power in the agricultural heartland of punjab as criminal neglect he insists the project makes little business sense how could you allow a coal power plant to be constructed in an agriculture zone where there are no coal reserves he questions such projects need to be investigated as these so called assets will become liabilities due to high operational maintenance and environmental costs and must not be allowed in the future aslam agrees punjab epd should ensure compliance for all parameters by the sahiwal coal power project and also investigate and duly address any unanticipated issues being faced by the locals including water depletion aslam stresses this project has unfortunately locked us into a long term and self inflicted ecological challenge he says at the moment we would like to ensure that the environmental impact assessment of the project would be strictly adhered to along with meeting the neqs on emissions and effluents of the plant rehman maintains that the environmental impact assessment of the project was conducted beforehand and says his department is ensuring that it has minimum impact on the environment the sahiwal coal fired power plant never violated the national environmental standards says the eia director regardless of the results of official assessments there is little denying the project s environmental impact with pakistan being ranked among the most water stressed countries in the world the sahiwal coal fired power plant that requires 60 000 cubic metres of water daily is not a healthy development the future is renewables a dry guava tree near the coal power plant coal fired power plants contribute up to 38 percent of global electricity according to the world coal association however after increasing awareness about the environmental impacts of coal investments in new coal fired power plants have reduced by 75 percent globally ushering in a new era in the energy paradigm according to a march 2019 energy innovation report in the united states solar and wind energy can replace 74 percent of its coal fleet by 2025 renewable energy would replace 86 percent of the country s coal energy renewables can provide the same amount of electricity more cheaply says the report plummeting cost of electricity generation from wind and solar has led clean energy to become a low cost option in many countries worldwide during may this year the united kingdom enjoyed its first week of not using electricity from coal fired power plants this seems to be the new normal or at least the future most of the world is aspiring towards in september this year when thousands marched around the world during the global climate strike one of their top demands was 100 percent renewable energy generation and exports protesters called for an end to coal dependency in australia chile germany ivory coast kenya kosovo and even pakistan it s not just activists who are demanding change a new coalition of governments and businesses has formed to protect the planet from the impacts of climate change by phasing out coal the powering past coal alliance ppca as 91 members including 32 national governments 25 subnational governments and 34 businesses curiously at a time when most of the developed world is moving towards renewable energy pakistan seems to be relying more heavily on coal powered energy according to the pakistan economy survey 2018 2019 the share of coal in the energy mix which remained stable in single digit percentages over the last two decades climbed to 12 7 percent in the 2018 the ppca was launched by the uk and canada in 2017 and aspires to achieve a transition from coal to renewable energy the coalition believes that a shift from coal power generation to a clean energy mix is vital to limit global temperature rise below two degrees celsius this will further contribute to sustainable economic growth and a safer climate the ppca aims to phase out unabated coal fired electricity generation for the european union eu and organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries by 2030 and for the rest of the world by 2050 curiously at a time when most of the developed world is moving towards renewable energy pakistan seems to be relying more heavily on coal powered energy according to the pakistan economy survey 2018 2019 the share of coal in the energy mix which remained stable in single digit percentages over the last two decades climbed to 12 7 percent in the 2018 vaqar zakaria an environmental expert provides one possible explanation it s a 30 year agreement and pakistan is obliged to pay capacity charges to the power plant even if it doesn t produce electricity it s a two part tariff with a capacity charge and an operating charge on the subject of air pollution and emissions from power plants zakaria adds that there are control mechanisms but in pakistan the data on air emissions is not made public while pakistan s reliance on coal increased the share of renewables in the country s energy mix which was at 0 3 percent in 2015 rose to mere 1 1 percent in 2018 encouragingly however five wind energy projects of 246 6 mw capacity were completed in 2018 2019 all the plants are operational now what happens in paris in 2015 when construction on the sahiwal coal power project began the drafting of the paris climate agreement finished the agreement aimed to strengthen climate action by limiting global temperatures well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels and to make efforts to limit temperature rise further to 1 5 degrees celsius pakistan ratified the agreement on november 11 2016 the paris agreement was signed by 197 countries and it required every country to submit a plan of action also known as nationally determined contributions ndcs that entailed how every country planned to limit its carbon emissions and fight climate change science is clear on the fact that coal is exacerbating climate change which leads to catastrophic weather events such as glacial lake outburst floods cyclones and sea intrusion why then is the government of pakistan venturing into coal pakistan s ndc stated that the country s emissions are going to increase four fold by 2030 the document said that a reduction of up to 20 percent of pakistan s projected emissions by 2030 is subject to international support amounting to 40 billion us dollars this support would be in the form of financial grants technical assistance technology development and transfer and capacity building similarly the ndc document mentioned that pakistan needs approximately seven to 14 billion us dollars annually to adapt to the impacts of climate change the document further stated that pakistan needs to exploit all its domestic sources of energy including coal hydro wind and solar and that exploring nuclear and local coal based energy in the power sector would be inevitable in the future ground realities nazir second from right from chak 76 5r along with other locals standing in front of a guava orchard getting dry due to the power plant far from the world of international agreements and policymaking residents of qadirabad continue to struggle nazir a 65 year old villager from chak 76 5r says his maize yield has been impacted because of the coal power plant nazir whose agricultural land is right next to the power plant says that the floodlights that turn on at night at the plant destroy his crops these lights have been installed after every few yards along the walls of the power plant for security purposes along the boundaries of the power plant one can find different crops including maize wheat and rice the floodlights from the power plant affect the productivity of the crops the patches that come under the direct contact of flood lights don t give corn nazir says it s a complete loss for us complains the farmer dr abid mehmood director general at the agriculture department of punjab says that the high beams may be increasing the heat as well it is possible that the floodlights are leading to an increase in temperature in the area which is preventing the vegetative phase from occurring nazir further says that his guava orchard is getting dry the farmer is convinced that air pollutants emitted from the coal power plant are responsible for this tajdin another farmer in the area is facing the same problem 80 percent of guava trees in my orchard are getting dry due to the coal fired power plant he says the ash dumped in the power plant spreads to nearby areas with the wind and settles on guava trees some of these claims are difficult to verify but they indicate how the residents view the power plant it is the source of most of their troubles science is clear on the fact that coal is exacerbating climate change which leads to catastrophic weather events such as glacial lake outburst floods cyclones and sea intrusion why then is the government of pakistan venturing into coal contrary to the findings of the punjab epd the locals of qadirabad complain of bad air quality depleting and deteriorating groundwater and impacts on agriculture it is now up to the government to investigate the matter and address the environmental concerns that the local communities have been raising for years with additional reporting by shafiq

watch now u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin on saturday rejected the suggestion that the trump administration is weaponizing the dollar through its trade restricting policies with other countries let me be clear we are not weaponizing the u s dollar mnuchin told cnbc s hadley gamble at the doha forum in qatar if anything i would say the opposite i take great responsibility that people use the dollar as the reserve currency of the world and the dollar is quite strong sometimes the president says the dollar is too strong the dollar is strong because of the u s economy and because people want to hold dollars and the safety of the u s dollar so because of that we take sanctions responsibility very seriously as a matter of fact i personally sign off on every single piece of sanction that we do officials in china and europe have been actively promoting their currencies as substitutes for the dollar when it comes to both reserves and transactions particularly in the face of expanding u s sanctions and protectionist trade policies like tariffs the trump administration has imposed sweeping sanctions including on dollar trade with iran north korea and others in an effort to pressure state actors to rein in behavior that washington deems destabilizing and against its interests according to the treasury department there are 6 300 specially designated nationals and more than 20 countries against which some type of u s sanctions are in place watch now this has stunted the ability of european allies and others to trade with iran among other countries and entities so some states are therefore looking to euros and other alternatives including chinese renminbi and cryptocurrencies to carry out trade free of u s imposed restrictions earlier this year france germany and the u k set up the instrument in support of trade exchanges instex which uses euros to bypass u s sanctions on iran while it s not shown itself to be economically effective it s a sign that even allies are seeking dollar alternatives to rebel against u s policies they oppose russia s central bank has also been trying to reduce the number of transactions conducted in u s dollars either for domestic payments or foreign trade since 2013 and in 2016 china s renminbi was added to the international monetary fund s special drawing rights basket in 2016 along with the dollar euro yen and british pound something the imf said enhances the attractiveness of the rmb as an international reserve asset still just to highlight one sector 80 of european energy imports are settled in dollars something that european commission president jean claude juncker in 2018 called absurd an alternative for world military conflicts sanctions like those on iran mnuchin said are used in order to avoid potential war the reason why we re using sanctions is because they are an important alternative for world military conflicts and i believe it s worked the secretary said so whether it s north korea whether it s iran or other places in the world we take the responsibility very seriously there is debate as to whether the administration s maximum pressure policy on iran is working to meet u s objectives while it has certainly crippled iran s economy currency and its ability to export oil its involvement in conflicts around the middle east has not subsided and provocative attacks the u s and its allies have attributed to iran have increased watch now

we call them has been that if you started the decade with assets it s been a golden age if you started the decade poor you ve probably gone backwards while structural inequality has always been part and parcel of capitalism it was supercharged by the fallout from the global financial crisis we knew things were bad at the time in december 2009 we still had finance companies collapsing international banks were still teetering new zealand had just emerged from recession with annual gdp growth tipping into the positive territory 0 7 per cent for the first time in five successive quarters unemployment was 6 5 per cent on paper things were unambiguously worse what wasn t so clear then was how the solutions being put in place to prop up the financial and economic system would change the world for years to come interest rates were slashed money was printed inflation fell and productivity stalled and wage growth stagnated meanwhile capital poured into higher yielding assets property and shares driving an historic asset boom which stood in stark contrast to an otherwise sedated low growth global economy we got through it but there was a price to pay one we are still paying in political upheaval and intergenerational conflict a grim assessment well yes and no you should read the one i wrote last time it seems remarkable that another decade ends in 16 days you know you re getting old when you can look back through the archives and check what your reflections were the last time a 10 year mark ticked over the other sign for the record is having no sense of how fashion or music has changed since the dawn of the decade my message to readers in december 2009 was grim black humour a play on the impending zombie apocalypse survival was my word of the year

financial crisis had a huge bearing on the subsequent decade photo 123rf so things are better unless you re trying to buy your first house or until we get to that wealth divide the child poverty statistics the homeless the mental health issues and with it all the social conflict and the political upheaval new zealand is lucky in some countries people are rioting in the streets but even our placid little corner of the world still seems an uglier less friendly place in 2019 what happened social media and technology have played a role there has been a revolution in the way we talk to each other and in the way we work some blame the gig economy and the uberisation of the work force for low wages but a recent report by the productivity commission found that in this country at least the hype around the gig economy is much greater than its footprint i still think it is our economic settings that define our problems debt low productivity and low wage growth as much as they still keep us a float we re trapped in this high debt low growth asset bubble world and there doesn t seem to be a way out that doesn t involve another crash there are large structural forces at play chinese growth from which new zealand has undoubtedly benefitted there s american politics and the demographics of the largest single generation in history moving into retirement and focused hawk like on their savings and investments new zealand central banks don t really have freedom to run against the tide on monetary policy but in other ways new zealand has been able to milk the conditions more than most chinese demand for food free flow of foreign money into our housing market record rates of immigration have seen us outpace our global peers on economic growth it was the decade of the rock star economy did the john key government do enough to offset the widening wealth gap no of course not but to be fair its focus to begin with at least was on survival it might not have been quality growth but it was growth and we took it battling a recession and then crown accounts stretched by the christchurch earthquakes the government was forced into austerity mode it took too long to see that we were out of the woods now we are playing catch up but we re still battling our fears of recession of market meltdowns and property slumps hopefully something has to shift in the next decade perhaps fortune will favour the bold in the roaring 20s
imperial valley news center white house principles for child care reform increasing access to affordable high quality child care in america washington dc today more americans are working than ever before virtually every demographic is achieving historic low unemployment rates as the trump administration s policies continue to fuel economic growth we have seen millions of americans come off the sidelines and rejoin the workforce in fact job openings have exceeded the number of job seekers for well over a year maintaining that growth will require strengthening policies to support working families including increasing access to affordable high quality child care this administration is focused on making sure the u s is the best place in the world to conduct business work and raise a family since january 2017 there has been significant progress in implementing the president s working families agenda including doubling the child tax credit from 1 000 to 2 000 per child and expanding refundability establishing bipartisan consideration of national paid family leave and signing into law the largest ever increase in funding for the child care and development block grant ccdbg representing a major new investment in child care affordability the president s budget requests have prioritized child care and paid parental leave to support working families but there is more work to do how families balance work and raising children is a deeply personal choice every parent should have the freedom to make the best decisions for his or her family this administration is prepared to chart a new course that promotes strong families and celebrates their individual needs one that honors respects and empowers both working and stay at home parents and caregivers for parents who choose to or must work for compensation obtaining child care is often a prerequisite for entering and advancing in the workforce over the past 44 years the labor force participation of women with children under 18 has grown from 47 percent in 1975 to nearly 72 percent in 2019 women are now the sole or primary breadwinners in 40 percent of american households with children under age 18 and approximately two thirds of mothers with children under age 6 are employed meanwhile the average cost of center based child care ranges from over 11 000 for infants approximately 10 000 for toddlers and more than 9 000 for 4 year olds in 30 states and the district of columbia the average cost of center based child care for an infant is more than in state college tuition and fees at a public university evidence on the effects of child care costs on labor supply suggest that some parents particularly women would enter the workforce or increase their work hours if the cost of child care was lower one study found that a 10 percent increase in child care costs is associated with a 7 4 percent decline in women s labor force participation policies that reduce the cost of child care can help bring more americans off the sidelines and into the workforce increasing opportunities for families and ensuring that our country s strong economic growth is inclusive and sustained in the future the impact of high child care costs extends beyond families to communities and businesses employee absences and turnover resulting from lack of child care can cost employers and impact overall economic development by reducing productivity and constricting the labor market several states have estimated the impacts on their economy in lost revenue and economic activity finding losses between 1 2 billion annually due to child care related absenteeism and turnover meaningful child care reform that improves access to child care would have positive results for families communities and employers there is also a growing concern about the importance of ensuring child care settings are places of learning that promote and enhance healthy child and youth development and well being high quality child care is a rare investment that pays off now by enabling parents to work and later by supporting children s development and success in school and life research has shown that high quality early learning environments are important for the cognitive language and social development of young children and that investments have the potential to generate economic returns in the long run child care licensing and regulatory systems put in place a foundation to ensure the basic health and safety of child care settings in addition many states have implemented quality rating and improvement systems to provide parents with transparent information on the quality of child care and include additional tiered requirements to help providers strive toward higher quality the administration s reform principles are designed to improve access to affordable high quality child care and support working families by taking steps to increase investment build the supply of child care cultivate the child care workforce and improve options for families across a range of high quality settings principles for child care reform put parents first parents play the leading role in choosing the care that is best suited to their child s needs their own values culture work schedules and budget policymakers should directly engage parents in the design of policies and strategies for improved access to consumer education resources and support including by providing the right level of information through a variety of venues such as community based hubs and agencies consumer education websites and child care resource and referral services this includes promoting shared engagement and local partnerships and highlighting best practices and collaborations child care providers live in and support communities which include children as well as parents who work there and businesses that employ them improving access to child care will necessarily involve the input and feedback of stakeholders from all sectors and requires us to put parents at the center of our efforts reauthorize and reform the child care and development block grant ccdbg act the ccdbg act authorization will expire in fy 2021 the administration believes this is an opportune time to revisit the authorizing statute to make reforms that reflect lessons learned from implementation of the 2014 reauthorization and to better support access to high quality child care for low income families these include address the child care cliff the child care cliff is a widely recognized problem too often the child care subsidy system penalizes parents for moving up the economic ladder when taking a raise or working more hours federal and state level policies should ensure that working parents benefit from their hard work so that they are not penalized with a reduction or loss of child care benefits that erodes the value of their increased earnings the u s department of health and human services recently published a series of briefs on marginal tax rates i e benefit cliffs across several public assistance programs and found that those families just above the poverty line receiving child care subsidies had the highest marginal tax rate among public assistance programs noting that a 5 000 annual earnings increase is associated with a median marginal tax rate of 73 percent leaving families with a net increase of only 1 350 states should strengthen policies to address the sudden loss of child care assistance due to a wage increase or acceptance of a higher paying job this may include gradually adjusting co payments using a sliding fee scale as family income increases to help families transition from child care assistance without experiencing a sudden drastic loss of benefits for example some states have established benefit phase outs in which subsidies are reduced by one dollar for every three additional dollars earned so that work always pays coordinating with other public assistance programs where possible and keeping in mind other sources of support such as tax credits to stagger eligibility thresholds and phase outs so that families will not lose multiple benefits at the same time improve flexibility to address local circumstances and special populations states territories and tribes play a key role in developing policies to support affordability of child care and to make sure child care is a safe high quality early learning environment for young children while states have made significant progress in incorporating provisions of the 2014 reauthorization into their programs there are federal requirements that have presented challenges to meeting the unique needs of families allowing more flexibility in specific areas would allow states to better tailor their child care policies to provide the most effective services for their families strengthen health and safety and increase child care availability through improved implementation of background checks the introduction of the background check requirements in the 2014 reauthorization was driven by a desire to ensure that our nation s children are being cared for in safe environments while the intent of the new requirements remains laudable full implementation has proven to be a challenge due to specific language in the law that does not comport with the realities of state criminal justice and child abuse and neglect systems lessons learned from states have demonstrated a need to strengthen the infrastructure for conducting background checks and address state implementation hurdles across multiple programs and between states concepts for consideration include allowing increased state flexibility to implement alternative but equally effective approaches where there is demonstrated overlap or duplication between the background checks multiple components or where necessary for alignment with other state programs such as background checks for early childhood teachers in state pre kindergarten programs addressing delays in hiring new child care staff due to background check requirements including the current requirement to obtain the results of a fingerprint check before staff can begin working provisionally under supervision improving quality of fingerprinting to avoid delays expanding automation to increase efficiencies and facilitate interstate background checks and promoting portability of results and other solutions that avoid unnecessary repeated checks build the supply of child care providers and increase choices for families since 2005 the overall number of licensed child care providers in the u s has decreased by 30 percent this drop is almost entirely attributable to a decline in home based licensed family child care providers which decreased by half from nearly 200 000 providers in 2005 to less than 100 000 in 2017 the loss of these family child care providers is the equivalent of approximately 540 000 slots for children family child care is an important option for working families to have particularly those with infants where care is expensive if available at all in addition family child care is often a better option for parents who work non traditional hours outside of 9 00 am to 5 00 pm on weekdays when child care centers are typically open many parents choose family child care because it better fits their cultures backgrounds and values families with lower incomes families needing care for infants and toddlers and families who are hispanic or african american are more likely to use home based family child care than center based care we should provide funding aimed at building the supply of child care for underserved populations and in rural areas to improve the number and types of child care settings and arrangements including faith based and family child care providers this includes supporting the development of family child care providers as a small business and entrepreneurship opportunity explore new incentives for businesses looking to offer child care benefits to their employees many businesses are recognizing that policies such as paid parental leave child care and other family friendly workplace policies are important ways to recruit and keep a talented workforce especially for parents looking to balance their dual responsibilities of caregiving and supporting their family this could include offering access to back up child care child care referral services or flexible spending arrangements to offset the costs of child care by banding together by geography or industry small and medium sized businesses can more cost effectively offer child care as a benefit by leveraging employer groups and associations all businesses can benefit from a better understanding of the child care needs of their employees beyond current tax credits technical assistance around employer sponsored child care models and best practices as well as general information about employee parent child care needs and return on investment from family friendly policies could be more widely distributed promote innovation and modernize the child care business model we need to pioneer better business models that enable child care providers both to thrive as small businesses and meet the needs of american families we should seek to make best use of providers experience expertise and passion and improve the availability of child care across the full spectrum of child care arrangements such as through the use of shared services alliances child care center hubs or family child care networks for example shared services alliances can be used to help providers share costs and deliver services in a more streamlined way by pooling resources and hiring centralized staff for operations and business support this should include developing innovative financing models and public private partnerships including philanthropy and the private sector that utilize multiple funding sources to meet the needs of working families increase the availability of high quality child care across settings high quality child care is a multi dimensional concept and may vary based on setting such as center based care or family child care homes many states have implemented quality rating and improvement systems that provide parents with information on the quality of care available in their communities and help child care providers strive for high quality however these systems often give a single rating to a child care setting generally focused on center based care quality requirements that fail to address dimensions of quality that are unique to the setting such as faith based family or home based providers and or that fail to reflect the preferences and needs of parents and children can drive providers out of the market and reduce options for working families respecting the role that parents play in choosing the care that is best suited to their child s needs their own values language culture and work schedules is critical one size fits all directives on what constitutes high quality child care can be counterproductive if there are few child care providers left in the market from which to choose child care policy and quality ratings systems should be designed to be inclusive of all provider types including home based family child care to enable the full array of safe nurturing child care options and settings ensure common sense aligned regulations for child care providers licensing regulatory and monitoring frameworks are the basis for ensuring that child care settings are healthy and safe for children however policies to regulate the health and safety of child care are created separately at the federal state and local levels this can result in an overlay of contradictory policies and procedures and the imposition of unnecessary and burdensome requirements as well as multiple visits from regulatory officials and program monitors at many levels of government some regulatory practices such as local zoning laws inadvertently drive up price and reduce availability but do not necessarily create a more safe or nurturing environment for children the federal government as well as states and localities should ensure that regulatory frameworks requirements and monitoring practices are not duplicative and or unintentionally drive up the cost of providing care reduce availability or push different types of providers such as faith based or home based family child care providers out of the market address the child care workforce shortage an important component of high quality child care particularly for young children is ensuring a nurturing responsive relationship with caregivers a college degree alone is at best an uncertain proxy for quality child care requiring child care staff in a child care setting center or home based to have a college or other degree can increase costs unnecessarily burden already low paid providers with unnecessary student loan debt and drive others out of the profession policies should encourage skills based hiring to ensure that providers bring the competencies and skills needed to provide quality care irrespective of academic degrees making it easier for educators and caregivers to gain the skills and competencies they need to provide high quality care that promotes healthy development and learning can encourage more providers to enter and stay in the workforce removing barriers and creating multiple pathways to enter and advance in the field is critical as is ensuring that compensation aligns with market demands promote child care apprenticeships compensation for child care providers especially for those workers who care for infants and toddlers is generally very low but policymakers at the federal and state level have increased credentialing and degree requirements over time apprenticeship models provide a viable credentialing option for the early childhood education workforce at least eight states currently offer early childhood registered apprenticeships we should establish child care apprenticeship models highlight industry best practices for professional development that do not require providers to incur student loan debt and explore competitive grants to expand apprenticeship access in child care the president s budget has prioritized expansion of apprenticeships in other sectors which is a model that could be applied to child care and early education for example the u s department of labor s employment and training administration is working to replicate texas early childhood apprenticeship program in other states develop recommendations for creating a rational financing framework for child care in america financing for child care and early education in the united states involves multiple programs and funding streams with different eligibility requirements governance structures and quality standards this creates challenges to families and communities in navigating these differences and can lead to overlap gaps in services and wasteful spending figuring out how to make programs work better together multiple funding streams with similar goals often intersect in a way that makes the child care problem worse not better for example many states have invested in expanding pre kindergarten care to 3 and 4 year olds this is a well intended investment but can be problematic for child care providers who often rely on care provided to 3 and 4 year olds to subsidize the high cost of providing infant care to make their business model viable ideally public investments would complement each other and the private market not undermine it an independent working group would make recommendations to congress for more efficient use of the nearly 40 billion in child care and early education funding that american taxpayers provide each year including exploration of a federal and state financing structure that reduces overlap and fragmentation and effectively supports affordability of child care and early education in america so long as federal and state funding continues to be fragmented across multiple divergent delivery systems the gap in funding to ensure more children and families can access high quality and affordable care will persist public support for child care and early learning has grown at both the federal and state level and as future investments are contemplated more attention should be paid to our current system and whether it is the right foundation upon which to build current population survey

the most important consideration when investing in the stock market is the primary trend of the equity markets richard russell dow theory letters successful investors will all agree it is important to have a strategy a process and of course sticking to it completing the first part is much easier than the second things happen personal situations may change and have an effect on your investment ideas that is understandable and when those issues arise priorities can and will change any unforeseen issue will challenge the investment strategy that was in place maybe it is the constant bombardment of information investors have to endure these days that provokes the change i have noticed lately it seems many seasoned investors have altered their plans for no other reason than to cite the many outside influences as creating an unnatural environment for investing they claim their models don t work the same anymore and at times nothing seems to work so in addition to the importance of having a solid plan successful investors take that one step further by using a flexible approach to investing as well one can be steadfast in their investment ideas and stick to them but if they aren t working in the present environment then it is time to revisit that process during this bull market many investors failed because they decided to take the easy way out instead of tweaking and changing the process so they could react to what is in front of them it became easy to blame someone or something else it is one of the reasons so many did not buy into the bull market at the beginning or for that matter well after it was underway this equity market is no different than others and i expect that statement will draw the ire of the critics especially the army of people that cite the fed financial engineering etc as the reasons for their failures so be it there have been other periods where strategies didn t work this isn t the first time in history that it has happened that way and it won t be the last the idea is to play the cards that are dealt be flexible open minded and confident i stated this in other missives do you want to be right with your ideas or do you want to make money i also tell anyone that wants to listen lose this preposterous notion that anyone that has reaped the rewards by being bullish will give it all back you will give it all back if you â allowâ that to happen if you are in control and are watching the â trendâ that will not be the case at all we should always learn from our mistakes what we also need to do is learn from other people s mistakes the mistakes that i continue to bring up here week after week are examples of that some may take that approach as being â out of boundsâ and overly critical what the critics might want to consider iâ m not the one proving some of the outlandish theories that have been put forth as being incorrect the stock market is the final judge and jury the trading week opened with little change in

virtually gone unnoticed the chinese trade balance has been very stable in the last few quarters without large swings either way that might point to a rapid adjustment taking place given the fact that the us china bilateral trade balance has narrowed 5 5bn u s dollars per month after seasonal adjustment thatâ s a pretty good result as far as the pace of exports and imports changes go the last year or so has also been very stable without major swings suggesting again that trade war rhetoric isnâ t in alignment with actual changes in aggregate trade activity uk voters delivered a massive election

weeks prior 18x pe 0 43 42x the political scene the news of a phase one trade deal being complete and awaiting signature from both parties is a welcome sign what we can expect to hear now is all of the rhetoric of how nothing was accomplished etc the same analysts that sold a story that our economy was going into recession over tariffs are now sharing their wisdom on the deal same ridiculous analysis different day newsflash there was never going to be an all inclusive deal that would solve all of the issues that have been problems for decades in the amount of time that has passed anyone from any walk of life level of education etc that believes the opposite is selling an agenda a fantasy and needs to seek help more importantly they need to be ignored the amount of time spent on the minutia of the details of the phase one deal is mind boggling there is but one takeaway to concentrate on from an investment standpoint the probability for any â escalationâ is now extremely low to non existent all of this ridiculous worry over â uncertaintyâ which was questionable to begin with is now moved to the backseat our markets have already determined the insignificant impact tariffs have on the economy since we have already seen a rally in our markets i don t envision any near term spike over this deal what i can envision occurring this agreement could move the chinese markets in a positive fashion apparently the u s can negotiate trade deals with numerous trade partners at the same time and be successful it took congress about a year to figure that out as they finally decided to pass the all important usmca trade deal as a side note any u s china trade deal will not need congressional approval of any sort house democrats announce two articles of impeachment against president trump and they will vote on whether to impeach president trump on those two articles abuse of power and obstruction of congress the house judiciary committee voted on the articles this week the full house vote will take place next week this process continues to play out in the fashion i thought it would no meaningful impact on the markets in the last four months the 10 year treasury rate rallied off the low of 1 47 reaching an interim high of 1 94 the 10 year then settled into a trading range perhaps building a base for a run higher on the flip side those that live in fear of a global recession suggest this is a pause before the bottom 1 47 is tested again the 3 month 10 year treasury curve inverted on may 23rd and other than a brief one day change that curve remained inverted until october 10th the 2 10 treasury yield curve inverted on august 27th that inversion lasted for three days for some that means the countdown clock has started for a recession and the cycle peak in the s p 500 that crowd may be disappointed i maintained from the first day 2 10 treasuries inverted only a sustained inversion is a meaningful recession signal history then tells us on average a recession occurs 18 months after a sustained 2 10 yield curve inversion none of these yield curves are inverted today source u s dept of the treasury the 10 year treasury hit 1 90 this week before settling back to 1 82 the 2 10 spread started the year at 16 basis points it stands at 21 basis points today sentiment the weekly investor sentiment survey from aaii rose this week to 37 6 after dropping to 31 7 last week that only brings it back up towards the levels from one month ago when bullish sentiment peaked just above 40 while getting closer this week was also the fourth in a row in which bullish sentiment was below its historical average of 38 crude oil with domestic production pulling back to 12 8 mm bbl day from 12 9 mm bbls day the past two weeks and imports rising by the most since early september at 6 89 mm bbls day crude inventories rose slightly this week the weekly inventory report showed inventories increased by 0 8 million barrels from the previous week at 447 9

above the five year average for this time of year after a 6 rally in the prior week trading in crude oil followed the equity market by trading in a tight range closing at 59 76 up 0 59 for the week the technical picture there are two important gaps in the daily chart that we should focus on as possible levels that could come into play if we see some weakness creep in they are highlighted on the chart at 3094 and s p 3119 for those that may be unfamiliar with what i am referring to there are many technicians that believe all price gaps in a chart must be filled no need to get too wrapped in that this scenario all revolves around short term oriented analysis the quick three day decline we witnessed last week may seem large given the lack of any meaningful downside move in the prior six weeks but it barely registered in terms of any particular technical damage chart courtesy of freestockcharts com the daily chart of the s p continues to show strength in that the index remains above the very short term 20 day moving average green line as i keep reminding everyone until that support is broken there is little to discuss in terms of any market pullback no need to guess what may occur instead it will be important to concentrate on the short term pivots that are meaningful however the long term view the view from 30 000 feet is the only way to make successful decisions these details are available in my daily updates to subscribers short term views are presented to give market participants a feel for the current situation it should be noted that strategic investment decisions should not be based on any short term view these views contain a lot of noise and will lead an investor into whipsaw action that tends to detract from overall performance think our political bias doesnâ t influence our decisions think again one of the mistakes that some have made over the course of this bull market lies in the belief that the stock market is all a product of financial engineering stock buybacks money printing by the fed and low interest rates etc the facts seem to state the opposite of what is â perceivedâ it would appear the â fundamentalsâ have been the primary driver of the advance since 2010 stock market valuations have risen in lockstep with corporate profits this example falls right into the opening remarks about looking at the data and taking a â flexibleâ approach far too many missed these facts because they were obsessed with notions that the stock market was on shaky ground their minds were made up and nothing was going to change that others saw the data guess what group has been successful it continues to be truly amazing how so many spend an exorbitant amount of time â looking for issuesâ the slightest change in a statistic or a data point surfaces the phrase â watch outâ all too often equity strategy insights notes â there is no euphoria nor is there a rush to get into the stock market as cash in money market funds remain elevated as of october there is 3196 7b in institutional and retail money market funds up 20 9 y y and up 802 7b or 33 5 from the recent low in this cycle 2394b in february 2017 the conclusion many would be investors sat out 2017 and 2018 with a view the bull market had run its course coming into november money managers cash levels were also at the highest level since october 2009 and are only 375 5b below the 3572 2b as of march 2009 which was the stock market bottom of this bull market as evidenced by equity fund outflows and heavy short positions for much of this year the majority of investors remain incorrectly positioned to reap the rewards in a secular bull market that continues to surprise many a recent ubs survey of more than 3 400 global respondents finds that wealthy people around the globe are hunkering down with 25 of their average assets in cash theyâ re expecting a significant drop in markets before the end of next year with a u s china trade conflict their top geopolitical concerns and the upcoming presidential election another itâ s not just the ultra wealthy the money flow data all year confirms many are clearly mis positioned and keep jumping on any possible rationale to sell despite the best 3 week run of inflows in nearly two years equity fund flows for the year are still a net negative 189 billion all of this evidence creates a â wall of worryâ which is market supportive one can choose to ignore the impact it brings to the table or embrace it emotionally it feels as though the market is due for a pullback and for any skeptic or those sitting in cash a pullback is being hoped for consolidation in either time price or both would not be surprising and actually healthy for the next move higher it will occur at some point but unless you believe it will become a major event it is best not to get too wrapped up in all of that talk there is a reason to avoid getting obsessed over any periods of weakness after a robust rally it goes against what we â perceiveâ but overbought conditions during an uptrend tend to be indicative of better than average future returns and advances that have staying power another issue that investors struggle with low volatility is perceived as a warning sign instead history shows that low volatility tends to be an exclusive feature of bull markets here again we see how some investors want to use every data point to make a case against any rally we can find plenty of pundits myself included that say the s p can easily shed 3 5 just because i feel pretty good this week so despite some of the near term technical issues that are being pointed out let me say we can easily see a 3 5 gain from these levels i know that sounds like more mumbo jumbo double talk not at all in the short term anything can happen just ask the folks that have bet against this melt up here is the point a market participant should not be investing while being overly concerned about moves of that magnitude given the backdrop that is in place far too many believe they can navigate every 2 move many try the majority fail instead they should look to adjust making their personal situation more comfortable while giving plenty of thought to the present backdrop for equities in my case after reviewing the situation as it exists today the conclusion is staying the course with little to no adjustments that won t resonate with those that have their minds already made up they remind the bulls that the risk reward profile doesn t look positive to them now there was an army of investors that said the same thing when the s p made the first all time high in this secular bull market at 1 550 iâ m confident we can also review the same comment made at every new market high in the last 6 years let me remind everyone the s p reached a new high and closed the week at 3 169 staying long with no hedges in place has bagged the lions share of the gains the handwriting is on the wall people just need to step back and read it i would also like to take a moment and remind all of the readers of an important issue in these types of forums readers bring a host of situations and variables to the table when visiting these articles therefore it is impossible to pinpoint what may be right for each situation please keep that in mind when forming your investment strategy to all of the readers that contribute

new york united states the us and china said they agreed to the details of the first phase of a broader trade agreement in a move that will see the us reduce tariffs at least temporarily calm fears of an escalating trade war between the world s two largest economies the deal announced hinges on china increasing purchases of american farm goods such as soybeans and pork and making new commitments on intellectual property forced technology transfer and currency speaking to reporters in washington president donald trump said he expects china s agriculture buying to hit 50 billion annually pretty soon the us will also suspend new import taxes that were set to take effect on sunday covering 160 billion of products such as smartphones and toys us trade representative robert lighthizer told reporters friday the asian nation committed to increase imports of us goods and services by no less than 200 billion more than the 2017 level over the next two years he said that would be more than double the 187 billion in goods and services the us exported to china in 2017 in return trump agreed to reduce some existing us tariffs halving 15 percent duties on 120 billion of imports but maintaining a 25 percent levy on some 250 billion of chinese goods he said he would also delay new import taxes set to take effect on sunday on 160 billion of products such as smartphones and toys advertisement this is an amazing deal for all thank you trump said in a series of tweets that came as chinese officials announced the deal at a late night press conference in beijing lighthizer said he expected the 86 page agreement to be signed by him and his counterpart vice premier liu he in early january in washington and released publicly then lawyers for both sides will review the accord before signature and lighthizer expects it will come into effect 30 days after the signing the s p 500 index swung between gains and losses while treasuries rose and the dollar was steady as neither side delivered enough details to calm investors who sent stocks to records thursday on reports fresh tariffs due sunday have been averted washington and beijing have been in trade war for almost two years involving almost 500 billion in products shipped between the two nations hit by tit for tat tariffs step forward the deal is a very very important step forward that goes beyond just agricultural purchases and included meaningful commitments that are fully enforceable lighthizer said an enforcement mechanism to resolve disputes would allow either side to impose tariffs if the agreement was violated he added on agriculture the chinese made detailed commitments that would see them purchase at least an additional 16 billion annually in commodities on top of the pre trade war level of 24 billion and endeavor to buy as much as 50 billion annually lighthizer said he said the detailed purchase targets on each commodity won t be made public in an effort to assuage the fears of other countries from which china buys agricultural commodities ning jizhe vice chairman of the national development and reform commission stressed that increased agricultural purchases would comply with world trade organization rules expanding china us trade will not affect interests of other trading partners he said chinese officials said the text agreed by the two sides comprises nine chapters includes sections on intellectual property forced technology transfer food and agricultural products finance currency and transparency boosting trade bilateral assessment and dispute resolution advertisement us tariffs would be rolled back in stages they said though lighthizer disputed that saying that duties would only be reduced in the future if further phases of a larger agreement were concluded the interim deal with china which was announced as impeachment proceeding against trump progressed in congress on friday offers a short term political victory for the president and will allow him to claim that his tariffs have paid dividends it was hailed by trump supporters in congress as well as some former us officials who had tried their own hand at negotiating with china democrats quickly criticized the deal with senate minority leader chuck schumer saying trump sold out for a temporary and unreliable promise from china to purchase soybeans business groups immediately called for more negotiations on future phases to get under way this is an encouraging first phase that puts a floor under further deterioration of the bilateral relationship us china business council president craig allen said in a statement but this is just the beginning the issues facing the us and china are complex and multi faceted they are unlikely to all be resolved quickly phase two put off for later discussions are knotty issues such as longstanding us complaints over the vast web of subsidies ranging from cheap electricity to low cost loans that china has used to build its industrial might data localization cross border data flows and cyber intrusions will also form part of later stages a senior administration official said trump said on friday that negotiations on a second phase of the agreement would begin immediately advertisement china would like to see the tariffs off and we re ok with that he told reporters but they ll be used as a negotiating table for the phase two deal which they would like to start immediately and that s ok with me but lighthizer on friday said he had not yet identified what issues might be addressed in the second phase of negotiations or when those talks would start many analysts remain skeptical that trump will be able to conclude those talks on more intractable issues before the november 2020 election chinese officials have privately expressed skepticism that progress can be made past phase one as have some us business leaders that has raised questions about the effectiveness of trump s strategy and the tariffs that he has rolled out in a way not seen since the 1930s despite the deal announced on friday some analysts suggested that the limited scale of the deal may help trump weather criticism of it from china hawks and others and therefore contribute to the fragile peace holding the reason the president insisted phase two will start immediately is phase one is very small said derek scissors a china expert at the american enterprise institute who has advised the trump administration the positive side is that a small deal implemented slowly is much more likely to hold through the election versus a seemingly big deal falling apart deal pressure both trump and chinese president xi jinping have been under domestic political pressure to get at least a partial deal as a result of the impact of the trade war on both economies this year many economists have pinned forecasts for a global economic rebound next year on a cease fire china s gross domestic product rose 6 in the third quarter from a year earlier the slowest pace since the early 1990s the us is showing signs of downshifting too with a record long expansion weakening to a crawl this quarter as tariffs spread uncertainty across manufacturers and others whose supply lines run through china that damage has put particular pressure on trump who is pinning hopes for re election next year on a solid economy that boasts the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s he campaigned in 2016 promising to revive american s decaying manufacturing base a sector that s been among the most disrupted by tariffs by shawn donnan miao han jenny leonard with

by dr george venturini now it is time to progress to the libretto that will show how little questions of morality matter with howard and how much howard and his ministerial cabal should be trusted over the cosy relationship they had with saddam hussein al tikriti following the iraqi invasion of kuwait in 1990 the united nations imposed a financial and trade embargo on iraq it was intended to weaken the iraqi economy so that saddam could not build up weapons for further wars what it did weaken was the health of iraqi children it is estimated that about 150 children were starving to death every day because of the embargo throughout the 1990s australian ships aircraft and troops helped enforce the sanctions which caused widespread starvation in iraq leading to an estimated two million deaths after 1996 once these sanctions were modified to permit profitable oil for food deals the howard government was among the first in line to collaborate with the saddam hussein government through the australian wheat board a w b even as it prepared to go to war against iraq u n security council resolution 661 prevented all states and their nationals from making funds available to iraq these sanctions were widely effective leading to food shortages and international condemnation as the humanitarian crisis became clear in response to this the oil for food programme was begun it allowed iraq to sell oil to the rest of the world provided the returns from this were kept in a u n bank account this money could then be used by iraq with u n oversight to purchase a strict list of humanitarian supplies the oil for food programme however in itself faced criticism with many alleging that it was too expensive to administer and liable to abuse the programme was discontinued on the lead up to the invasion of iraq since 1948 an australian statutory authority established in 1939 had been supplying iraq with wheat during the oil for food programme it became the single largest supplier of humanitarian goods to iraq the authority was australian wheat board a w b it was a veritable monopoly to control and prevent competition among wheat growers by purchasing and selling at a single price beginning at mid 1999 officials of the cartel were informed that they would have to pay us 12 for each imported tonne the resulting sum to be passed onto as trucking fee to a bogus trucking company alia transportation trading co of amman jordan purportedly as fees for transporting inland 8 million tonnes of australian wheat in fact alia did not cart a single grain of wheat alia a front company majority owned by the khawam family a powerful iraqi clan living in jordan was established with 49 per cent of the shares owned by the iraqi transportation ministry and it simply took a cut and passed on the rest of a w b s payments to saddam s bankers the odd thing was that alia had no trucks a w b accepted the condition increased contract prices and began to send fraudulent information to the office of the united nations charged with supervising the enforcement of the sanctions under the sanctions regime third parties were prohibited from engaging with the iraq government unless they had security council approval by having the party exporting goods the humanitarian supplier to be the one to pay alia the iraqi government was able to disguise the operation naturally the u n office expected that the department of foreign affairs and trade certify that the contracts were not in breach of the sanctions the minister in charge of foreign affairs was the hon alexander john gosse downer ac with the co operation of the minister for trade and investment who was the hon mark anthony james vaile ao also deputy prime minister they both complied with numerous requests the arrangement for paying extra money by all definitions a bribe went on for two years the rate was increased first by up to 50 per cent until just before the invasion when it was between us 45 and us 56 per metric tonne the australian government was duty bound not to make any payment to iraq the bribes also breached the o e c d convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions the anti bribery convention of 1997 under australian law all shipments to iraq were banned unless the foreign minister that is downer was satisfied that permitting the exportation will not infringe the international obligations of australia the contracts were never checked even though an officer of the department of foreign affairs and trade had rung an alarm bell as to possible breaches of sanctions satisfaction was continuously guaranteed in the national interest during a period of about four years a w b passed on to iraq something like au 290 million in april 2001 an officer of the department of foreign affairs and trade attached to the united nations in new york sent a cable informing that a w b had been asked by iraq to pay port fees of us 50 cents per tonne as port fees and alerting that that was in breach of the u n sanctions the addressees of the cable howard downer and vaile would later declare that they had not seen the cable senior public servants in several other departments of the howard government were instructed to comply howard would later insist that the cable did not actually prove that the government knew illicit payments were being made in fact howard and his ministers had no intention of doing anything which could jeopardise lucrative australian wheat sales to iraq again the national interest the national interest that is the fixing of the market was the howard government s paramount consideration in joining the iraq war securing the commercial diplomatic and strategic interests of the australian corporate élite which controlled it and that could be done first and foremost by lining up closely with the united states it meant taking advantage of the operation iraqi freedom and in the process getting as close as possible to oil rights construction contracts and agricultural markets but the united states had similar undeclared interests and more clout when they got to baghdad their xtf 75 iraq survey group and similar organisations got down to work with a view amongst others to retrieve and preserve valuable contracts and commercial opportunities the phony contracts guaranteeing the bribes fell into the hand of the pullulating american organisations documents unearthed in the iraqi ministries after the invasion had confirmed in detail the bribes paid to the iraqi government and disguised as trucking fees port charges after sales service fees and surcharges in late may 2003 the minister for trade and investment mark vaile went to the united states at the head of a delegation of executives from ten major australian construction engineering and oil and gas companies for talks with american officials and corporate executives senior executives of the companies australian power and water b h p clough engineering multiplex santos woodside petroleum and others held discussions with american firms awarded reconstruction contracts from u s a i d the united states agency for international development there could be agreement on many fields but the howard government could not resist the pressure from australian farming groups to ensure that the valuable iraqi market was not lost to the united states before the first gulf war the united states exported almost one million tonnes of wheat annually to iraq but these shipments were cut off under the sanctions imposed on baghdad australian growers then took advantage of the 1996 oil for food programme to recapture two thirds of the iraqi market worth au 839 million to australia in 2002 behind the high sounding words of liberating iraq and exporting democracy the reality was brought to light with the establishment of the coalition provisional authority when words came to action the american administration nominated daniel gordon amstutz a government official and grain trading industry senior executive of cargill corporation the largest grain exporter in the world and former president of the north american grain export association to lead the authority s agricultural section the howard government nominated two senior a w b executives chairman trevor flugge and senior executive michael long they had both been compromised in the bribes paid to the iraqi government their view of the national interest was to guarantee contracts worth more than us 250 million which had been signed by a w b before the invasion and to keep a w b s position in the iraqi wheat market the last two contracts that a w b signed before the invasion contained the biggest bribe of all worth a total of about us 73 million on the basis of us 45 50 per metric tonne for trucking fees and another ten per cent surcharge of the whole value of the contract in part these contracts were designed to divert a further us 8 8 million from the u n held funds to be delivered to tigris petroleum a company linked to b h p and headed by richard baker a thoroughly disreputable man with no commercial morality tigris oil chief a disreputable man the age 28 november 2006 the company had sent wheat shipments to iraq in breach of u n sanctions in 1995 seeking to secure oil drilling concessions in september 2003 a report by the u s defence contract audit agency cited evidence that illicit surcharges kickbacks were standard practice for oil for food contracts the report named australia and estimated overpricing in one a w b contract at nearly us 15 million the american wheat lobby then launched a letter writing campaign to president bush and other politicians charging that a w b reaped an additional us 56 million gold mine at the expense of the iraqi people on top of their already excessive prices nevertheless with the help of the howard government and its representatives in baghdad the a w b managed to salvage its contracts in 2004 iraqi daily al mada published a list of 270 persons and entities who were given oil vouchers for helping saddam hussein the report alleged clear violation of the agreements of the oil for food programme established fourteen years earlier and ending the year before in response to this the united nations launched an independent inquiry into the programme headed by former u s federal reserve chairman paul volcker its terms of enquiry were to collect and examine information relating to the administration and management of the oil for food programme including entities that have entered into contracts with the united nations or with iraq under the programme the final report was released on 27 october 2005 volcker report manipulation of the oil for food programme by the iraqi regime independent inquiry committee into the oil for food programme the volker committee identified more than 2 200 international firms which knowingly or unwittingly paid a total of more than a billion dollars in kickbacks to saddam hussein s régime while the rollcall of global corporations included pharmaceutical giant glaxosmithkline other well known such as daimlerchrysler volvo siemens and the chinese state owned industrial conglomerate sinochem were right near the top of the list along with australian wheat board that was so not just a consequence of a w b starting with an a sorting the list by the amount of money which made its way back into saddam hussein s pocket one would find a w b right at the top of the list the volker report disclosed that a w b was responsible for kickbacks totalling over us 250 million out of an estimated us 1 8 billion of illicit payments to saddam hussein s régime during the us 35 billion u n oil for food programme in 1997 2003 the report accused almost half of the companies operating in iraq during the time of the oil for food programme to have paid either bribes or illegal surcharges to secure iraqi business in special reference to a w b it stated that little doubt remains that a w b made large numbers of payments to alia and these payments in turn were channelled to the iraqi regime the report named a w b as the major abuser it said that a w b had covered 90 per cent of the iraqi market before its practices were questioned in 2005 had sold 6 8 tonnes of wheat to iraq for us 2 3 billion and had paid us 221 7 million au 290 million in trucking fees during the u n oil for food programme in 1997 2003 the australian government repeatedly said we knew nothing but expert whistleblowers said that competent officials must have known from 2000 to 2005 michael joseph thawley was australian ambassador to the united states of america while thawley was in the role the australia united states free trade agreement was established ensuring greater access to the u s market for australian products in 2004 he successfully lobbied to convince a u s senate committee to drop investigations into allegations that a w b had paid kickbacks to the saddam hussein régime in iraq g polya australian corruption and 20 000 iraqi infant deaths countercurrents 15 february 2006 the successor to mr thawley mr dennis james richardson former head of the australian security intelligence organisation would reassure the americans that the australian government was not previously aware of the scandal the australian government would insist that it simply did not know about the kickback scandal in response to the u n report on 31 october 2005 the howard government appointed an inquiry not quite a royal commission into the allegations headed by the hon terence cole q c a former judge of appeal of the new south wales supreme court terence rhoderic hudson cole and john winston howard had been together at the law school of sydney university in the 1950s they both graduated in 1961 there they had not been very close they were both keen debaters but while cole captained the debating team with considerable enthusiasm howard was in the second string line up cultivating in the process a sense of ordinariness which would characterise his life and define his public figure even though the two men were not close still they could be regarded as two tributaries of the same great river pond which is the westminster system albeit of the sub tropical version the prime minister s oratory skills have improved since university and he would have needed them if he were to be called and examined by counsel assisting the inquiry john agius s c cole was a politically safe appointment he had already been chosen as commissioner of the 2000 2003 royal commission into the building and construction industry this time the appointment was slightly different perhaps a sign that a more confident howard wanted to keep an eye on the proceedings this time it was mr cole not commissioner cole the inquiry was given very limited terms exclusively to a w b it is said with a considerable degree of certainty that prime minister howard himself had a hand in narrowly drafting the terms of reference by letters patent issued on 10 november 2005 mr cole was asked to inquire into and report on 1 whether any decision action conduct payment or writing of any of the three australian companies mentioned in the final report manipulation of the oil for food programme by the iraqi regime of the independent inquiry committee into the united nations oil for food programme or any person associated with one of those companies might have constituted a breach of any law of the commonwealth a state or territory and 2 if so whether the question of criminal or other legal proceedings should be referred to the relevant commonwealth state or territory agency the stage was set the inquiry would in time call to the stand many prominent members of the government including howard the first australian prime minister to face a judicial inquiry in more than twenty years testimony and documents presented to the inquiry revealed that in nearly twenty occasions a w b executives had informed government ministers and or their advisers about the payments silence on 16 january 2006 former a w b chief executive murray rogers was the first witness at the inquiry mr rogers denied any knowledge of how the kickback payments were arranged or where the iraq money was going but the inquiry was told it was impossible to believe a w b s claims that it did not know that some au 300 million of its money was being funnelled to saddam a w b was maintaining that it was the unwitting victim of an elaborate ruse and had no idea that inflated trucking fees it paid to a jordanian company alia were ending up with the dictator the inquiry senior counsel john agius s c said that a w b s claims that its payments to alia were for genuine transport costs were contradicted by evidence including documents evidence will be called to the effect that a w b always knew that alia was a conduit for the payment of money to iraq mr agius told the inquiry these matters were always known to a w b to be in breach of the u n sanctions on iraq mr agius repeatedly asked mr rogers why no a w b board minutes or financial reports spelt out the fees in the iraq contracts and asked whether this was done deliberately mr rogers repeatedly answered i cannot remember or i cannot recall but mr rogers confirmed that the first contracts containing the inflated transport fees the kickbacks were discussed with foreign affairs officials in canberra he recalled that a w b official mark emons and others went to canberra to talk to dfat and that s about the only thing i can ever remember documents and witnesses uncovered by the inquiry would clearly reveal that a w b executives had misled the u n s investigation into the oil for food scandal by suppressing documents evidence had also emerged that officials from austrade in washington and the australian u n mission in new york discussed with a w b executives complaints by canada s wheat board that a w b was paying kickbacks in iraq the australian trade and investment commission or austrade is the australian government s trade investment and education promotion agency it is a statutory agency within the foreign affairs and trade portfolio with offices in overseas embassies and consulates and representative arrangements in some other locations mr agius also questioned mr rogers on a w b s dealing with a company called ronly he produced a letter from an a w b chartering manager michael watson to ronly s london office arranging for it to pay a fee directly to the iraqi régime in violation of u n sanctions in turn a w b agreed to pay ronly us 300 000 mr rogers said that he was very disappointed by the letter but that he had never seen it before the inquiry also raised fresh evidence about a deal between b h p and a w b over the sale of au 5 million worth of wheat to iraq on credit in 1995 while b h p was able to say that it was a humanitarian gesture mr agius indicated that the inquiry would explore the deal because the credit was repaid to a b h p related company tigris petroleum through an inflated wheat contract between iraq and a w b m wilkinson iraq scandal heat shifts to canberra the melbourne age 17 january 2006 before the inquiry an a w b spokesman in melbourne peter mcbride said that the wheat board was completely unaware of any corruption our contracts were completely under the terms provided by the un mr mcbride said that the u n insisted that the wheat board s contracts with iraq include the use of a third party to provide inland transport that is trucks to get the wheat around iraq saddam s iraqi grains board provided the a w b with the name of its preferred company and the a w b used that company a jordanian trucking company for all its contracts mr mcbride said that questions about the legitimacy of this company were questions for the un the u n security council had named a three person independent panel to investigate allegations that u n officials mishandled the oil for food programme allowing saddam to pocket billions of dollars illegally the allegation is that saddam s government used the programme to extract billions of dollars from companies which wanted to do business with iraq leaving his people short of food and medicines while blaming the u n sanctions for those shortages one of saddam s schemes was to order vendors to inflate their prices by 10 per cent and kickback the excess to his government one of the contracts which became available to australian newspapers showed that three months before the war the a w b signed a deal to provide 525 000 tonnes of wheat to iraq for 280 then a 455 a tonne u s wheat industry sources who examined the contract said that in 2006 the price was about us 30 equivalent to a 41 a tonne higher than world wheat prices at the time mr mcbride explained that the price might seem high because it included the cost of paying a third party the unnamed jordanian trucking company to transport the wheat to mills around iraq contracts which involved third parties were of particular interest to the oil for food programme investigators since an iraqi oil ministry official faleh khawaji had told the new york times that iraq would make a deal with a supplier then say give us another 10 per cent the western companies would say i can t do it i ve got a board how do i get around the auditors mr khawaji said and somebody would tell them there are companies in jordan willing to do this for you mr mcbride said that the a w b had never agreed to kickback money to saddam s régime directly or indirectly we used a jordanian trucking company to do that transport wheat on our behalf he said that he was unaware of any relationship between them and the saddam régime i actually do not know what their relationship was all we did was pay them a reasonable fee to transport the grain in iraq he said that the trucking company had the approval of the un after saddam was deposed coalition forces examined outstanding oil for food contracts and asked many vendors to take 10 per cent off their prices mr mcbride said that australia had been asked to renegotiate some of its wheat contracts but they are commercial in confidence so we don t discuss what happened to the price a w b whistleblower dominic hogan testified about a w b corruption and that the australian government could have spotted the kickbacks five years before simply by checking the price of wheat in any daily newspaper the united states was charging us 140 a tonne with freight bringing this up to us 170 a tonne but australia was receiving us 214 a tonne from the iraqis the melbourne age 7 february 2006 on 10 february 2006 on a b c tv s asia pacific focus programme warren reed a former australian security and intelligence service a s i s agent and others were interviewed over the a w b scandal for the transcript of australian wheat exporter goes against the grain see asked about the a w b scandal prime minister howard s fixed line would be i did not know mr downer did not know mr vaile did not know and on the information that i have and based on the advice that i have received i do not believe that anybody in the departments were told however when warren reed was asked whether it was possible that australian intelligence would not have known about the a w b kickbacks to saddam hussein reed replied absolutely impossible that they did not know in fact if you look at the core part of the governmental system in canberra that has to do with our international survival our role on the global stage particularly trade wise foreign affairs even eaves dropping the whole intelligence apparatus that s geared to knowing these things there is no way absolutely no way those sorts of people didn t know so the government did know and i would defy the prime minister on oath to say he d never heard anything about it he had no knowledge at all that this could occur if mr downer and mr vaile and our prime minister had not an inkling that this sort of thing was going on then they should be shot at dawn they are unfit to hold these positions that s the extent to which everybody would know about it warren reed was further asked the cole inquiry has implicated the wheat board there has been talk of kickbacks not only to iraq but to pakistan to indonesia to bangladesh in your experience 10 years out in the field how widespread is the payment of kickbacks in the region warren reed replied oh so widespread i couldn t think of one circumstance where they would not pay it s expected while australian politicians and media were concerned with the corruption aspects of the scandal who did what who knew what who said what to whom there had been very little concern expressed over the human cost of the potential diversion of hundreds of millions of dollars from humanitarian purposes in iraq of course australian media and politicians would simply not report or acknowledge the horrendous civilian excess mortality in post invasion iraq upper estimate of the human cost of australian corruption in iraq was 20 000 iraqi infant deaths using the widely quoted australian estimate of about us 225 million for the money diverted by australians from the u n oil for food programme one can estimate that the maximum amount of money diverted from medical expenditure would have been us 225 million 26 9 million iraqis in 2003 us 8 4 per capita continued wednesday our mate saddam hussein al tikriti part 3 previous instalment

the us and china said they agreed to the details of the first phase of a broader trade agreement in a move that will see the us reduce tariffs and at least temporarily calm fears of an escalating trade war between the world s two largest economies the deal announced hinges on china increasing purchases of american farm goods such as soybeans and pork and making new commitments on intellectual property forced technology transfer and currency speaking to reporters in washington president donald trump said he expects china s agriculture buying to hit us 50 billion annually pretty soon the us will also suspend new import taxes that were set to take effect on sunday covering us 160 billion of products such as smartphones and toys us trade representative robert lighthizer told reporters friday the asian nation committed to increase imports of us goods and services by no less than us 200 billion more than the 2017 level over the next two years he said that would be more than double the us 187 billion in goods and services the us exported to china in 2017 in return mr trump agreed to reduce some existing us tariffs halving 15 per cent duties on us 120 billion of imports but maintaining a 25 per cent levy on some us 250 billion of chinese goods he said he would also delay new import taxes set to take effect on sunday on us 160 billion of products such as smartphones and toys this is an amazing deal for all thank you mr trump said in a series of tweets that came as chinese officials announced the deal at a late night press conference in beijing mr lighthizer said he expected the 86 page agreement to be signed by him and his counterpart vice premier liu he in early january in washington and released publicly then lawyers for both sides will review the accord before signature and mr lighthizer expects it will come into effect 30 days after the signing the s p 500 index swung between gains and losses while treasuries rose and the dollar was steady as neither side delivered enough details to calm investors who sent stocks to records thursday on reports fresh tariffs due sunday have been averted washington and beijing have been in trade war for almost two years involving almost us 500 billion in products shipped between the two nations hit by tit for tat tariffs step forward the deal is a very very important step forward that goes beyond just agricultural purchases and included meaningful commitments that are fully enforceable mr lighthizer said an enforcement mechanism to resolve disputes would allow either side to impose tariffs if the agreement was violated he added on agriculture the chinese made detailed commitments that would see them purchase at least an additional us 16 billion annually in commodities on top of the pre trade war level of us 24 billion and endeavor to buy as much as us 50 billion annually lighthizer said he said the detailed purchase targets on each commodity won t be made public in an effort to assuage the fears of other countries from which china buys agricultural commodities ning jizhe vice chairman of the national development and reform commission stressed that increased agricultural purchases would comply with world trade organization rules expanding china us trade will not affect interests of other trading partners he said chinese officials said the text agreed by the two sides comprises nine chapters includes sections on intellectual property forced technology transfer food and agricultural products finance currency and transparency boosting trade bilateral assessment and dispute resolution us tariffs would be rolled back in stages they said though mr lighthizer disputed that saying that duties would only be reduced in the future if further phases of a larger agreement were concluded the interim deal with china which was announced as impeachment proceeding against mr trump progressed in congress on friday offers a short term political victory for the president and will allow him to claim that his tariffs have paid dividends it was hailed by mr trump s supporters in congress as well as some former us officials who had tried their own hand at negotiating with china democrats quickly criticised the deal with senate minority leader chuck schumer saying mr trump sold out for a temporary and unreliable promise from china to purchase soybeans business groups immediately called for more negotiations on future phases to get under way this is an encouraging first phase that puts a floor under further deterioration of the bilateral relationship us china business council president craig allen said in a statement but this is just the beginning the issues facing the us and china are complex and multi faceted they are unlikely to all be resolved quickly phase two put off for later discussions are knotty issues such as longstanding us complaints over the vast web of subsidies ranging from cheap electricity to low cost loans that china has used to build its industrial might data localisation cross border data flows and cyber intrusions will also form part of later stages a senior administration official said mr trump said on friday that negotiations on a second phase of the agreement would begin immediately china would like to see the tariffs off and we re ok with that he told reporters but they ll be used as a negotiating table for the phase two deal which they would like to start immediately and that s ok with me but mr lighthizer on friday said he had not yet identified what issues might be addressed in the second phase of negotiations or when those talks would start many analysts remain skeptical that mr trump will be able to conclude those talks on more intractable issues before the nov 2020 election chinese officials have privately expressed skepticism that progress can be made past phase one as have some us business leaders that has raised questions about the effectiveness of mr trump s strategy and the tariffs that he has rolled out in a way not seen since the 1930s despite the deal announced on friday some analysts suggested that the limited scale of the deal may help mr trump weather criticism of it from china hawks and others and therefore contribute to the fragile peace holding the reason the president insisted phase two will start immediately is phase one is very small said derek scissors a china expert at the american enterprise institute who has advised the trump administration the positive side is that a small deal implemented slowly is much more likely to hold through the election versus a seemingly big deal falling apart deal pressure both mr trump and chinese president xi jinping have been under domestic political pressure to get at least a partial deal as a result of the impact of the trade war on both economies this year many economists have pinned forecasts for a global economic rebound next year on a cease fire china s gross domestic product rose 6 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier the slowest pace since the early 1990s the us is showing signs of downshifting too with a record long expansion weakening to a crawl this quarter as tariffs spread uncertainty across manufacturers and others whose supply lines run through china that damage has put particular pressure on mr trump who is pinning hopes for re election next year on a solid economy that boasts the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s he campaigned in 2016 promising to revive american s decaying manufacturing base a sector that s been among the most disrupted by tariffs

workers and investors got an early christmas gift with a blowout november jobs report that showed the u s economy is still capable of creating jobs and sustaining wage gains above the rate of inflation but the fly in the ointment is persistent trade war worry it indicates that the labor market is defying gravity as we enter the end of the year said glassdoor com senior economist daniel zhao economists said the addition of 266 000 new jobs nearly all of which 254 000 came from the private sector reflected how the labor market is pulling the disengaged and underemployed off the sidelines the labor market continues to be more than robust enough to continue to absorb new workers the unemployment and underemployment rates are going down at the same time said sameer samana senior global market strategist at the wells fargo investment institute the two numbers often have an inverse relationship he said moving in tandem is an indication that there is a demand for more workers and that the labor force is meeting that demand at 63 2 percent the labor force participation rate has tracked at roughly the same level for the past four months it shows you there s a quite a bit of dynamism in the u s labor market samana said job seekers need to take advantage of it there s definitely pockets of growth and there s going to be pockets of decline said irina novoselsky ceo at careerbuilder com the supply and demand trends are very different in different zip codes she said those uneven rates of job growth could be holding back wage gains at an annualized 3 1 percent wage growth is still slightly below what many economists would consider a healthy range of 3 5 to 4 percent although market observers said the persistently low rate of inflation helps mitigate that it s faster than the rate of inflation greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com said of the wage growth rate we are seeing some growth in consumer buying power albeit modest he said if you look at the six month average you can see that there s been a continued deceleration in payrolls growth especially in manufacturing there s been a clear deceleration in wage growth samana said although he added that this trend does have a silver lining for companies when you start to meaningfully accelerate north of 3 percent that s when profit margins come under pressure he said market experts worried that a looming tranche of tariffs on 156 billion in chinese made consumer goods could drive up corporate expenses in unpredictable ways and more importantly hurt consumer buying power those tariffs are much more geared towards the u s consumer and if the u s consumer were to start to feel their costs rise meaningfully most people don t have a lot of excess savings samana said the consumer spends until they start to worry about their financial situation when combined with the cost pressures of tariffs a tight labor market could create inflation more quickly than demand for workers alone we re pretty concerned about the overall impact on inflation said john bredemus chief investment officer at allianz investment management higher inflation could drive up mortgage rates and contribute to a rising dollar a headwind for u s multinational firms for this reason some economists were less sanguine about the longer term outlook in spite of november s outsized job gains questioning whether the positive reading was too good to be true it seems like a candidate for a big downward revision said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics who characterized the report as an outlier in a client note a repeat of this performance in december would be a different story but we think downside correction is more likely he said economists said that while the effects of new tariffs wouldn t be immediate they would be hard to mitigate once set into play that does bear watching as we move into 2020 any tariffs that take effect and particularly those that hit the consumer pocketbook do pose a stiffer headwind mcbride said with consumer spending the key driver of today s economy in the face of anemic corporate investment anything that makes americans less willing or able to buy goods and services could spread the trade war s impact far beyond the manufacturing sector i think the concern is that as the dec 15 tariffs roll around if we don t have a trade agreement in place by then there is the potential that the trade war spills over into other sectors zhao said
senator elizabeth warren is overestimating the proceeds of her wealth tax by at least 1 trillion according to a new study raising questions about the democratic presidential candidate s plans to fund her sweeping proposals to reshape the u s economy warren s tax would raise 2 3 trillion to 2 7 trillion over a decade far short of the 3 75 trillion her campaign has said the levy on the accumulated wealth of millionaires and billionaires would raise in that period according to new estimates from the penn wharton budget model the estimate calls into question the massachusetts senator s frequent assertion that taxes on the wealthiest americans would be sufficient to cover her plans for universal childcare college tuition and erasing student debt with about 1 trillion allocated toward paying for her 20 5 trillion medicare for all health care plan economists on the right and left have cautioned that she may be relying on overly generous estimates of her taxes and low balling how much the new programs could cost warren has dismissed any suggestion that she would need to raise taxes on the middle class to finance her proposals the key reason for the difference between warren s estimate and the one from the penn wharton budget model is that the authors of the new study have factored in what they believe is a likelihood that more people than warren expects will avoid the tax whether legally or illegally said kent smetters a professor of business economics and public policy at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school the line between the kind of tax reducing or tax avoiding behaviors that will be allowed and those that could result in an irs penalty or worse isn t yet known said smetters who is also the faculty director of the penn wharton budget model there s a lot of gray area of what is allowed that won t be known until the tax court rules on it he said warren s tax 2 percent on fortunes in excess of 50 million and 6 on wealth above 1 billion is one of her campaign s mainstays she says it s needed to raise revenue for new social programs and to help reduce wealth inequality this analysis does not study elizabeth s actual plans it does not account for the strong anti evasion measures in her wealth tax and does not even attempt to analyze the specific investments elizabeth is committed to making with the wealth tax revenue saloni sharma a spokeswoman for warren campaign said thursday in an email this is an analysis of a different and worse plan than elizabeth s using unsupportable assumptions about how the economy works and its conclusions are meaningless skeptics including some democrats in congress say the tax could be difficult to enforce easy to avoid and could potentially face a constitutional challenge warren developed the tax plan with the help of two economists at the university of california at berkeley gabriel zucman and emmanuel saez who have studied wealth and income inequality they say the 3 75 trillion figure is realistic if the internal revenue service has a strong enforcement strategy and congress doesn t write any loopholes into the law additionally the study says the tax would shrink the economy between 0 9 percent and 2 1 percent by 2050 depending on how the revenue is spent investments such as those in education or those that make the workforce more productive could counteract some of the negative effects the study added an investment in early childhood education might lead to additional labor market dynamics that boost the economy the penn wharton study said at the same time the authors said a considerable amount of wealth inequality in the united states has historically been driven by entrepreneurship a factor that has received very little attention in tax models and analysis the policies of a warren administration would ultimately be scored by the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation and the congressional budget office which estimate costs of legislation warren may have to adjust her expectations if she s elected and the jct and cbo are the final arbiters of her plan s price tags said kyle pomerleau a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute said i think she will find that the jct is not as optimistic as gabriel zucman pomerleau said laura davison bloomberg news michael bloomberg is also seeking the democratic presidential nomination bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of bloomberg lp the parent company of bloomberg news
the euro dollar rate spirals into weekend after trump lifts greenback with china trade deal image adobe images eur slumps after trump announces u s china trade deal sunday tariffs cancelled but other tariffs are set to remain deal is a reprieve for u s china and the global economy more negotiations ahead but differences tariffs remain eur weakness and usd strength may not last says mufg the euro spiralled into the weekend on friday after president donald trump said he has agreed a phase one deal with china that averts another volley of tariffs that had been due for implementation sunday boosting the dollar renminbi and safe havens but crushing most other major currencies president donald trump said late friday via his twitter account that sunday s tariffs are cancelled in light of a very large phase one deal with china he claims china has agreed structural changes to its regulatory infrastructure and to purchase large amounts of agricultural products china s ministry of commerce confirmed some of the details in a press conference according to the south china morning post but neither side is yet able to say when the agreement will formally be signed the penalty tariffs set for december 15th will not be charged because of the fact that we made the deal we will begin negotiations on the phase two deal immediately rather than waiting until after the 2020 election this is an amazing deal for all thank you donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 13 2019 the united states trade representative ustr said separately that structural changes agreed to by china include modifications of intellectual property regulations as well as technology transfer agriculture financial services and currency and foreign exchange however the ustr also says that other tariffs will remain in place which is not great news for those hoping the much vaunted deal would lead to a recovery in global trade and economic growth the united states will be maintaining 25 percent tariffs on approximately 250 billion of chinese imports along with 7 5 percent tariffs on approximately 120 billion of chinese imports says u s trade representative robert lighthizer above euro to dollar rate shown at 4 hour intervals trump had been due to clobber all of china s remaining exports to the u s with a 30 tariff on sunday which would have dealt another blow to the chinese and global economies while also impacting u s households because the goods targeted in the final volley of tariffs were all consumer goods the looming deadline and fact the next tariffs were aimed at consumer items had stoked fears for the u s economic outlook as well as the for other economies which may have helped to weaken the dollar the euro is helped by decreasing trade clouds and progress on brexit though domestic economic weakness remains the albatross round its neck says kit juckes chief fx strategist at societe generale in an earlier note to clients both sides have been warring with tariffs for around 18 months after president trump pledged to confront the world s second largest economy over its unfair trading practices when on the campaign trail back in 2016 but damage resulting from the trade war has not been confined to just its two protagonists instead it s slowed growth the world over and dealt an especially severe blow to the manufacturing intensive eurozone relief at the cancellation of the u s tariffs combined with lingering uncertainties over whether the pact will ever even be signed not to mention endure for very long at all drove the dollar higher and other currencies including the euro lower late in the noon session friday the fall in the euro has for the time being at least scuppered the single currency s attempt at regaining the 1 12 handle but

a sustainable and inclusive growth agenda since the mid 1980s durable reforms coupled with prudent macroeconomic management have brought steady progress to the south asia region making it one of the world s fastest growing regions real gdp growth has steadily increased from an average of about 3 percent in the 1970s to 7 percent over the last decade although growth trajectories varied across countries reforms supported strong per capita income growth in the region lifting over 200 million people out of poverty in the last three decades today south asia accounts for one fifth of the world s population and contributes to over 15 percent of global growth over the recent decades bhutan s economic development has benefitted from increased economic integration with its neighbors supportive government policies and planning have enabled the development of fdi financed hydropower and improvement in infrastructure that can support a gradual diversification of the economy fdi liberalization also facilitated higher value added tourism macro policies have prioritized external stability revenue mobilization financial inclusion and diversification moreover as the only net carbon neutral country in the world bhutan has laudably placed a high priority on sustainable growth a newly released paper by the imf s asia and pacific department finds that south asia is poised to play an even bigger role in the global economy going forward in both relative and absolute terms south asia s contribution to global growth is set to increase over the medium to longer term while more mature economies decelerate greater economic diversification with an expansion of the service sector improvements in education and a still sizable demographic dividend are among the key elements underpinning this performance bhutan has benefited from initial diversification from agriculture into hydropower electricity and tourism but sustained progress in diversification supported by continued improvement in skills education financial inclusion and infrastructure is critical to deliver job rich growth that can reduce poverty and inequality as prioritized in the 12th five year plan based on demographic trends more than 150 million people in the region are expected to enter the labor market by 2030 this young and large workforce can be south asia s strength if supported by a successful high quality and job rich growth strategy amid a changing global economic landscape south asia will need to leverage on all sectors of the economy in a balanced way supporting improvements in agricultural productivity and a sustainable expansion of manufacturing while promoting higher skill services to achieve this goal in bhutan around 60 percent of workers are engaged in farming activities in this context higher agricultural productivity can improve the lives of many in bhutan furthermore relative to its large south asian neighbors bhutan can leverage its small size to meaningfully benefit from specialization including in high value added agriculture and services during its middle income transitions to build on the strong performance to date and allow for growth to take off in earnest the countries in the region will need to step up their policy and reform agenda south asian economies can further open up to trade and foreign direct investment fdi improve governance and infrastructure and foster financial development to enable more efficient allocation of resources to the private sector and reduce the still significant state footprint in the economy the region will also need to prepare its workforce for the challenges of the twenty first century to be able to fully reap the benefits of its demographic dividend investing in human capital and addressing the large informal sector taking significant steps to strengthen women s economic empowerment and labor force participation and support the youth would bring sizable economic gains to the region sustained structural reform efforts including successfully harnessing its young and large workforce alongside substantial trade and fdi liberalization could bring india s real gdp per capita to nearly 50 percent that of the united states by 2040 with important spillovers to the region under a full liberalization scenario south asia could contribute about a third of global growth by 2040 with real gdp growth surpassing 6 5 percent compared to nearly 6 percent under the current baseline and 5 percent in a downside scenario where the benefits of the demographic dividend cannot be secured the region s robust economic performance and recent elections in most south asian economies offer a propitious window of opportunity to accelerate this reform agenda in bhutan the strong parliamentary majority of the newly elected government offers an opportunity to implement reforms that can deliver strong and inclusive economic growth cross country evidence finds a higher likelihood of achieving more reforms at lower cost in the first two years of a government office a frontloaded reform program is also more likely to succeed as it provides more time to see the reforms bear fruit clear communication on the benefits of the reforms and prioritization based on their expected macrostructural impact are key to building reform momentum stronger social safety nets are especially important to supporting the most difficult structural reforms notably to labor markets minimizing their distributional impact on the most vulnerable segments of the population and promoting strong and inclusive growth to ensure the region s growth path remains as strong as sustainable new policies and initiatives need to remain mindful of fiscal financial and environmental risks in this context we welcome the government s continued commitment to implement the goods and services tax gst strengthen management of hydropower projects and their revenues and improve budgetary processes to ensure that fiscal policies remain supportive of inclusive and sustainable growth contributed by faisal ahmed he is the imf s mission chief for bhutan

brianna childers bchilders cjonline com perry it s barely 7 a m and there s only a soft glow from the sun peaking over the horizon front street is quiet as this small town located between topeka and lawrence on us 24 highway is still waking up sitting in a small block of businesses is shear style salon and while it isn t yet open for the day inside there already are signs of life the men inside aren t there to get their hair cut but instead are there to start their morning with friends and have a cup or two of coffee this tradition that about 10 men have participated in is a long standing one they started out meeting for coffee at the local pizza joint then spent about five years doing the same at the perry lecompton thriftway grocery store before it closed late last year the group consists of a farmer a former highway patrol officer a former goodyear employee a retired math teacher and a truck driver the men meet every morning except sunday to share stories and a pot of folgers when the thriftway closed they weren t sure where they were going to go but among the uncertainty and frustration that comes when a small town loses its only grocery store these men found an impromptu meeting spot for their early mornings you can tell we leave politics and that stuff alone said glen herschell the men make sure to credit issy higgins owner of shear style salon for allowing them to use her place before she opens to the public higgins said it was a pretty easy decision i worked at the bar here for like 10 years so i met a lot of them just eating dinner and they have always been kind to me higgins said i wasn t using it and they would take a key and i didn t have to be here at 6 30 in the morning higgins said she can remember going to the thriftway early in the morning and hearing the men there anytime you drove by thriftway that parking lot was packed full of trucks higgins said you knew that they were always in there if i ever forgot some snacks and had to go in there early morning you could usually hear them laughing i think that store is a little missed handwriting on the wall thriftway which closed in december 2018 served the community for more than 40 years giving residents a place to shop socialize over a cup of coffee and even check out library books the closure of thriftway 609 cedar st left frustration confusion and uncertainty in its wake a year later this town of just over 900 people is still suffering some of the ramifications of the loss but is learning to cope with what many have concluded is the future of perry the past year has been filled with a lot of work from those who created a grocery store committee following a february meeting that drew a large crowd of people questioning what was next what started out as hopefulness that the community would be able to find a replacement for its grocery store has led perry resident wayne ledbetter to now feel we are at the end of the line ledbetter who served on the grocery store committee has been spearheading efforts to find a new grocery store or store owner for the community ledbetter said part of the reason efforts stalled is due to dollar general located at 11282 us 24 highway expanding its offerings to include produce the fact dollar general has expanded their inventory offerings and so forth i think it would be in my own opinion next to impossible for a grocery store to compete with them given our proximity to topeka and lawrence ledbetter said i just don t think a store in that environment will be able to produce the traffic necessary to keep it viable while ledbetter makes sure to note that dollar general which opened in perry in 2013 and is located about 1 500 feet northwest of thriftway wasn t the sole reason the local grocery store closed he said he thinks it was the last straw rusty spencer said he could see the closure coming spencer served as manager of the perry lecompton thriftway for about 10 years but he left in 2017 for a job managing meriden s country harvest store because thriftway s struggles were conspicuous the community wasn t supporting it spencer said it was more of a convenience store customers weren t buying all of their groceries and they just didn t have the money to keep it going ledbetter said he thinks most community members experienced issues that led people to believe the store would soon close i think everyone was seeing the handwriting on the wall ledbetter said there was a lot of empty shelf space i had a couple of conversations with the folks that were at thriftway and it s a fair statement they said there s some fault on both sides pretty devastating as evidenced by the coffee club at shear style salon thriftway served a purpose greater than groceries for many of the 206 residents over the age of 65 according to the u s census bureau it was much more than a grocery store to our senior citizens perry resident paula hladky said they had a certain time of day they would start walking over from the senior citizens complex to go to the store buy their groceries take their time and enjoy themselves that s all gone ruth ellis has been a perry resident for about 60 years when the store first closed it was pretty devastating for us ellis said the store was a convenience for those who didn t have all of the ingredients to fix a meal ellis said i could just run over to the grocery store and get them ellis said i can t do that now i kind of have to plan ahead and then when we get to lawrence or topeka we stock up and try to figure out what you re going to be cooking ellis said when the grocery store was open she still did the majority of her grocery shopping in topeka and lawrence because it was more economical according to ellis the dollar general has been a godsend if we didn t have that to fall back on it would be terrible she said while she would rather see a grocery store back in perry she said she doesn t see it happening anytime soon i just don t know if it would ever survive or not ellis said people are so used to getting their groceries in lawrence and in topeka i imagine the only reason they would use it is like me if i m wanting to fix something and don t have all the ingredients bill culver has been living in perry since 1976 he said he used the thriftway a lot when it was open and now has to plan more so the next time he makes it to topeka or lawrence he can go grocery shopping culver said he has been going to dollar general out of necessity we don t have a choice culver said it s that or casey s and casey s doesn t carry a lot of stuff at least dollar general started carrying perishables in there to help us out a little bit if a grocery store were to find its way back to perry culver said he would support it ledbetter and hladky agree the closure of thriftway affects every community member whether you do the majority of your shopping here or not it s really inconvenient when you go to make something and you don t have an item ledbetter said there s no place to get it i think when you lose a grocery store it impacts every shopper but i think it also impacts things like property values and it isn t just perry residents who have felt the loss we had a lot of loyal shoppers from the lecompton area who came over and bought all of their groceries there hladky said i think they have all been affected by this they certainly have had to change their lifestyle it puts a whole new slant on making a list and checking it twice when you re going somewhere to shop a risky investment the journey to try to bring a new grocery store to perry started by looking at those who might be interested in making such an investment ledbetter said the committee began approaching individuals within a two county radius according to information provided to the topeka capital journal from the jefferson county appraiser s office the building that housed the thriftway was built in 1975 and currently is owned by bcb real estate llc after hitting roadblocks and talking to potential buyers the committee concluded the former home of the store needed too much work so talk then began about constructing a new building what if we built a 10 000 square foot building instead of a 15 000 square foot and you could save all this money on electricity because this one certainly would not be efficient with the cooler issues ledbetter said ledbetter said one potential buyer who seriously considered the investment told him it would be too difficult to compete in a small town with a dollar general and that the investment was too risky there s just no way to guarantee enough traffic to put a million dollars into a project like that ledbetter said and that s what it s going to take the committee also contacted kansas building systems to get an estimate of what it would cost to construct a building of the required size it takes 150 000 just to stock the shelves so you re looking at probably a 1 25 million investment and that s difficult to justify ledbetter said every effort seemed to reveal another roadblock to the end goal the committee even created a survey and distributed it to community members we had almost 700 responses to a survey ledbetter said that is amazing if you get 5 to 10 percent or 7 percent you have a pretty good sample it really communicated the desire of the people to have something ledbetter said committee members also considered a number of different funding and incentive programs to support a potential investor financially cooperatives and community owned stores were also considered ledbetter said after almost a year of working the grocery store committee is no longer meeting ledbetter said he thinks the committee would still be working to get a grocery store if dollar general hadn t added produce i just think there was an awareness after all the meetings we had that there wasn t any place for us to continue on in the path to getting our own grocery store hladky said ledbetter emphasized he doesn t blame dollar general for the loss of the grocery store even if dollar general closed and left today he said he feels perry would still have a difficult time getting a store back i don t want to make dollar general out just to be this community devouring ogre that comes in ledbetter said others may have a different opinion i know from visiting with folks who were associated with thriftway there had been declining sales for a while filling a need perry s dollar general remodeled its store in october according to company spokeswoman crystal ghassemi dollar general which has more than 16 000 stores nationwide added produce and extra cooler space to transform it into a traditional plus store model currently we have about 600 stores that have produce ghassemi said we expect that in 650 stores by the end of january 2020 and then we recently announced plans to add it to 250 additional stores next year the cooler expansion includes a wide assortment of everyday food needs including milk bread cheese yogurt and frozen vegetables and fruits ghassemi said the traditional plus model features an additional 16 feet of produce including potatoes apples oranges grapes avocados lemons limes onions tomatoes strawberries blueberries spinach salad mix cauliflower and clementines perry s dollar general format doesn t include fresh meat the company does have a market format that offers meat but it accounts for less than 1 of dollar general s stores choosing a location to remodel to a traditional plus format isn t an easy one ghassemi said part of it has to do with the customer need and customer demand she said i think the biggest emphasis that we look at is that our customers are at the center of everything that we do ghassemi said the amount of employees at dollar general varies depending on the individual needs of the store on average it s around six to 10 with at least three of those being full time positions ghassemi said while dollar general is expanding to include produce in some stores ghassemi said the company s stores are a complementary and alternative option to a grocery store and i think ultimately we want to see a grocery store in towns ghassemi said i think we work really well when it comes to working side by side with a grocery store but i think in this case particularly with perry there was a need to be filled as it relates to offering some of those healthier options and we have the bandwidth and that ability to do so and certainly we wanted to be able to help that community and that was part of the reason that we remodeled the store and added produce to our product mix small town challenges scott stanley entered the meriden community 21 years ago when he opened country harvest apple market 7312 k 4 highway since then he has become owner of country harvest grocery stores in valley falls and mclouth all three locations are facing the same challenges as rural grocery stores across the nation but the meriden store is about to face a challenge that has stanley worried a dollar general is going in across the highway from country harvest every single item that is taken out of dollar general that is not taken from the grocery store that has supported the community for umpteen years and for myself the last 21 years that s just that much less we are going to be able to sustain to donate to thrive to improve to remodel according to ghassemi meriden s dollar general will follow the company s traditional floor model and won t carry produce to adapt in a changing business climate stanley has replaced light bulbs at the meriden store with led lights and put all refrigerated items behind closed doors adding the leds and closed door coolers has helped bring down stanley s electricity bill which reached nearly 10 000 at one point low margins pose a big challenge to rural locally owned grocery stores if we are able to hit 20 profit we are feeling pretty good stanley said stanley said meriden s store typically sees 2 500 to 3 000 people a week what makes reopening a grocery store difficult is the investment and he is hoping he can figure out how to stay open stanley said i feel very strongly about working with the community and in the community stanley said we try to keep our pricing on city pricing so people don t feel like they have to go somewhere to save a dollar or two obviously we rely on employees and we have a lot of good employees that s a big determinant or a big factor in how we ve been successful up to now as well spencer the meriden store manager said he doesn t see as many customers at meriden s country harvest using the store simply as a convenience as he did in perry there is some of them that do that spencer said i walk out there and i carry out the groceries and there s dillons and walmart sacks in the car already and dollar general sacks they just kind of catch us on the way home but most of the elderly people use it for a main grocery store because they don t want to drive clear to topeka a helpful hand kansas state university s rural grocery initiative has been working with rural grocery store owners for about 12 years the organization not only works with groups in kansas but offers similar programs in other states including the center for rural affairs in nebraska and new venture advisors in illinois rgi housed within kansas state s center for engagement and community development provides resources to help sustain and enhance independently owned rural grocery stores according to its website many times communities and perry s no exception face a challenge where a grocery store is no longer going to be operating in their community and they reach out to rgi for technical assistance said isabelle busenitz a program and project manager for the center what that means is we try to listen to the issues that are facing that community and provide them linkages to resources they might use to address some of those questions or concerns about where they are going to go and the challenges they are facing the issues perry has faced aren t unique to the town but are being seen across kansas and nationwide those issues include an owner succession plan competing with discount retailers dealing with high costs of energy meeting buying requirements and dealing with community support rgi also sees a lot of different ideas being tried across kansas to sustain a grocery store one of the reasons that our office thinks rural grocery stores are so important to work with is they offer benefits to their community said rial carver a program and project manager for the center for engagement the three main benefits that we talk about are that the grocery store can provide economic benefits it can be an economic driver for that community in the form of jobs and in the form of local taxes so sales tax dollars property tax dollars are all one contribution that a local business is providing to their community carver said grocery stores also offer their customers a gathering place it can be a hub for the community and some stores have used this opportunity in different ways carver said for example the perry store at one time had a library within the store which is a unique way to provide not just groceries but also a community service the last key factor that rural grocery stores offer to their community is healthy food options they are often the no 1 or the best option for healthy food access carver said so grocery stores tend to have significant sections of fresh produce as well as lean meats and whole grains rgi typically works with communities that have populations of 5 000 or less eighty three percent of the grocery stores in kansas exist in cities with populations of 20 000 or less and then when you look at the populations of 5 000 or less three fourths of all the grocery stores in kansas exist in those populations of 5 000 or less carver said carver said rgi knows about 4 in 10 grocery stores are discount retailers such as dollar general dollar tree and family dollar and they continue to open in rural towns between 2008 and 2018 about 54 rural grocery stores closed carver said about an equal number closed and reopened and i think part of that has to do with what we ve been talking about being able to talk through what were those challenges and what sort of changes could be made to open a new store are some resources that our office has provided busenitz said independent grocery stores typically employ more people compared to discount retailers according to a fact sheet on rgi s website rural grocery stores typically employ 17 people they also on average contribute 644 000 to the local economy networking is one way independent grocery store owners can get advice or talk through similar situations with other owners one way store owners can network is through rgi s annual national rural grocery summit and regional workshops in 2020 the program will host its summit june 8 9 in manhattan and three workshops between february and april throughout the state the coffee shop back at the makeshift coffee shop at shear style salon herschell and company are still avoiding politics but they aren t afraid to enter into the infamous kansas state university versus university of kansas debate the majority of the room seems to be ku fans but dean riedesel raises his hand making it known he is a wildcat the atmosphere is light hearted as the men sip their coffee and talk about a recent mouse race that took place at the local american legion post ralph porter took first in the race and there is some playful banter between him and herschell about the win life without the thriftway and with dollar general clearly has gone on it s all we have higgins said so i definitely want to go there to make sure at least we keep that the coffee club isn t the only way the small town has found to deal with the loss of thriftway this past spring community members took it upon themselves to build two blessing boxes outside perry united methodist church 220 oak st the boxes are filled with nonperishable items for residents to take whenever they need them it s going very very well and people are very appreciative hladky said we often get a note back in the box that says thank you for doing this given all that has transpired the past year ledbetter said community members need to consider where perry is today and where they want it to be if you don t pick a future one will pick you he said which future would you rather have i think that applies here perry is going to end up somewhere 10 years from now we can either try to manage that manipulate that and facilitate that or it will move somewhere on its own
washington the limited trade deal that the trump administration and beijing announced friday means americans will avoid a holiday tax increase on imported toys clothing and smartphones u s farmers can sell more soybeans and pork to china and american companies should face less pressure to hand over trade secrets to beijing but what the administration gained from the so called phase 1 deal that president donald trump celebrated falls well short of the demands the president issued when he launched a trade war against beijing 17 months ago further rounds of negotiations will be required to achieve a more significant agreement advertisement still friday s preliminary agreement managed to at least defuse a conflict that had put investors on edge and slowed economic growth entering an election year in which trump plans to campaign at least in part on america s prosperity under the agreement the trump administration dropped its plan to impose new tariffs on 160 billion of chinese imports beginning sunday a tax that would have likely led to higher prices on many consumer goods the administration also agreed to reduce its existing import taxes on about 112 billion in chinese goods from 15 to 7 5 in return u s trade representative robert lighthizer told reporters china agreed to buy 40 billion a year in u s farm products over two years even though u s agricultural exports to china have never topped 26 billion a year in addition beijing committed to ending a long standing practice of pressuring companies to hand over their technology as a condition of gaining access to the chinese market lighthizer said china also agreed to lift certain barriers to its market for such products as beef poultry seafood pet food and animal feed in all the u s expects a 200 billion boost in exports over two years as a result of the deal we expect the trade deficit to go down for sure lighthizer said adding that the agreement will likely be signed the first week in january and take effect 30 days later everything is written he said everything is completely finished advertisement yet the administration released no detailed paperwork on the agreement and it said the text was still being translated between chinese and english in the past the two sides had appeared to be close to firm agreements only to see negotiations fall apart at the same time the phase 1 agreement leaves some major issues unresolved notably complaints that beijing unfairly subsidizes its own companies to give them a competitive edge in world markets many trade analysts said the agreement amounted to a mixed bag this deal should go a long way in reversing the downward spiral in bilateral trade relations and increasing certainty for u s businesses said wendy cutler a former u s trade negotiator who is now vice president at the asia society policy institute but she cautioned it s unclear on how far the phase 1 agreement goes in addressing the key structural issues that brought the u s to the negotiating table 17 months ago other analysts were harsher with only limited concessions china has been able to preserve its mercantilist economic system and continue its discriminatory industrial policies at the expense of china s trading partners and the global economy said scott kennedy a china specialist at the center for strategic and international studies trump could reverse course and renew tariffs but beijing has bought itself a likely respite from the daily uncertainty for at least a few months and perhaps for the remainder of trump s current term trump had first announced a phase 1 deal back on oct 11 but negotiations continued for two more months the president who announced the latest agreement via twitter said that work on a follow up phase 2 agreement would begin immediately his announcement came minutes after the house judiciary committee approved impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress leading the white house to argue that the president never stops working and continues to make successful deals that benefit this country in beijing officials said at a briefing that if the trump administration reduces its tariffs china will lower its trade penalties on american goods and also scrap plans for new tariffs sunday the world s two biggest economies are battling over the industries of the future and the way china does business an unorthodox mix of capitalism and state control the administration accuses china of cheating in its drive to develop such advanced technologies as driver less cars and artificial intelligence the administration alleges and independent analysts generally agree that china steals technology forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets unfairly subsidizes its own firms and throws up bureaucratic hurdles for foreign rivals beijing rejects the accusations and contends that washington is simply trying to suppress a rising competitor in international trade since july 2018 the trump administration has imposed a series of trade sanctions on china sometimes changing or delaying planned tariff rates friday s announcement means the u s will still continue to impose 25 import taxes on 250 billion in chinese goods and will halve the tariffs on a separate 112 billion to 7 5 it will drop plans to target an additional 160 billion that step would have extended the tariffs to just about everything china sells the united states and would have hit consumer items such as toys and smartphones that have so far largely been spared beijing has retaliated by taxing 120 billion in u s exports including soybeans and other farm products that are vital to many of trump s supporters in rural america rob atkinson president of the information technology and innovation foundation said the agreement represents progress but said the united states must still comprehensively address china s rampant innovation mercantilist practices mary lovely a trade economist at the peterson institute for international economics said it s unlikely that friday s deal delivers enough benefits for the u s to outweigh the costs of the trade fight so far u s farmers lost billions of dollars in income companies paid billions in tariffs and in many cases shifted their supply chains and consumers saw some prices increase many of us are highly skeptical that the agreement will be enough to outweigh these other costs lovely said the u s didn t move the needle very much still the agreement should help smooth some of the uncertainty surrounding global trade lovely said we have a cease fire we have some roll back that is very significant she said we were kind of on a brink here and we saw the negotiators pull us back lighthizer said the phase 1 agreement addressed one of the key u s concerns ensuring that a deal can be enforced the trump administration and other critics say china has a long history of violating its promises friday s deal establishes a dispute resolution process if a complaint isn t resolved the aggrieved party can impose sanctions including tariffs a skeptic would say we ll see lighthizer said and that s probably a wise position to take but our expectation is that they ll keep their obligations and in any event they re enforceable repeated rounds of negotiations had failed to achieve a substantive deal the prolonged uncertainty over trump s trade policies curtailed u s business investment and likely held back economic growth many corporations have slowed or suspended investment plans until they know when how or even whether the trade standoff will end a far reaching agreement on china s technology policies will likely prove difficult it would require beijing to scale back its drive to become a global powerhouse in industrial high technology something it sees as a path to prosperity and international influence this deal would amount to a modest de escalation of trade hostilities but hardly resolves the fundamental trade and economic tensions that are dampening business sentiment and investment in both countries said eswar prasad an economist at cornell university and former head of the international monetary fund s china division efforts to acquire foreign technology are a theme that runs through chinese law and government security researchers have asserted that beijing operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen foreign technology into commercial products your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter

the market euphoria which lifted the pound and shares in the ftse 100 and uk focused ftse 250 is fully justified britain still faces the challenge of navigating brexit and a slowing global economy but the long shadow of labour taking over the means of production for great swathes of the economy has been lifted the socialist agenda has been banished for at least five years and possibly ten given the size of boris johnson s majority recovery of sterling will produce mixed results but most of them positive irrespective of brexit shareholders should benefit from political stability says alex brummer the muted reaction of the ftse 100 companies reflects the fact that so many of these firms earn profits overseas firms as diverse as diageo glaxosmithkline and rolls royce have benefited from a weak pound when dollar earnings are translated back into sterling the next layer of companies which includes housebuilders and challenger banks such as virgin money saw the greatest uplift investors in the ftse 250 have been on strike and underlying values ignored irrespective of brexit shareholders should benefit from political stability underpinning values will be sterling s recovery the bank of england has been playing out two scenarios the first is that of a cliff edge brexit which would send the pound tumbling that would rule out an interest rate cut but could almost certainly mean raising rates to militate against capital flight with inflation benign a stronger pound helps with that there may even be scope for a rate cut should the economy suffer in the backwash from what could be a long economic war between the us and china there will be new leadership at the bank on january 31 but one would not expect basic analysis to change with inflation benign a stronger pound helps with that there may even be scope for a rate cut should the economy suffer says alex brummer the old lady is of the view that in the period since the financial crisis monetary policy has been front back and centre now is the moment for fiscal policy to take up the slack chancellor sajid javid has baked a 4 1 per cent rise in department spending in the cake with his one year spending review but he also left himself headroom for further stimulus by easing the fiscal rules allowing borrowing to rise to 3 per cent of output from the present 2 per cent there is also space to lift capital spending with the prime minister citing infrastructure technology and broadband among the priorities all of this should support stuttering growth while the precise shape of britain s trading relationship with our eu neighbours is decided britain s greatest competitive advantage is in services but most trade agreements find it difficult to capture services so as long as the uk can more or less align its financial regulation with the eu the outlook will not be as bleak as some big american investment houses claim wind ups as the authorised corporate director link is in charge of the clean up at neil woodford s flagship equity income fund it is proposing to begin the wind up of the fund next month with the first payout to savers on january 20 doubtless ratepayers to kent county council will be glad to get back some of the 263million locked up since june as an investor in the fund i have to question what link is up to would not a better approach have been to allow new managers blackrock and pjt partners to have kept the fund running allowing investors who wanted to bolt to withdraw cash on a phased basis as liquidity improves experience suggests that if given time the value of investments in troubled financial groups is restored creditors of lehman brothers received 100 cents on the dollar when complex derivative products were unwound people holding equitable life policies have seen a restoration of value that was totally unexpected and depositors in the corrupt bank of credit commerce international saw most of their cash back the election result shows how swiftly share values can change and who is to say that some of woodford s unlisted holdings won t come good link s handling of this whole sordid affair has been faulty barnett formula jolly good that woodford acolyte mark barnett of invesco is offering investors sage post election investment guidance it might have carried more weight had he not been dismissed this week by edinburgh investment trust for sub octane performance but everyone s entitled to a comeback

washington president donald trump said friday that the u s has canceled plans to impose new tariffs on 160 billion worth of chinese imports sunday as part of a modest interim agreement that de escalates a 17 month trade war between the world s two biggest economies washington president donald trump said friday that the u s has canceled plans to impose new tariffs on 160 billion worth of chinese imports sunday as part of a modest interim agreement that de escalates a 17 month trade war between the world s two biggest economies the united states is also reducing existing import taxes on about 112 billion in chinese goods from 15 to 7 5 in return trump said on twitter the chinese have agreed to massive purchases of american farm and manufactured products as part of a so called phase 1 deal the office of trump s trade representative said china had consented to structural reforms that would improve intellectual property protection and curb the practice of forcing foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of admission to the chinese market but it offered no details and business groups said more needed to be done to combat beijing s aggressive trade practices this deal should go a long way in reversing the downward spiral in bilateral trade relations and increasing certainty for u s businesses said wendy cutler a former u s trade negotiator who is now vice president at the asia society policy institute but she said it s unclear on how far the phase 1 agreement goes in addressing the key structural issues that brought the u s to the negotiating table 17 months ago trump s announcement came minutes after the house judiciary committee approved impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress leading the white house to argue that the president never stops working and continues to make successful deals that benefit this country chinese officials said at a briefing in beijing friday that if washington reduces the tariffs china will lower its trade penalties on american goods and also scrap plans for new tariffs sunday trump told reporters at the white house that chinese farm purchases would hit 50 billion china s deputy finance minister liao min said china is ready to work with the u s side to do more to promote growth in trade but would not confirm the 50 billion figure u s farm exports to china have never topped 26 billion a year the deal announced friday leaves unresolved some of the thorniest issues but trump said work on a follow up would begin immediately rather than waiting until after the 2020 election this is an amazing deal for all thank you friday s announcement was a long time coming trump first announced a phase 1 deal on oct 11 but negotiations on a final version continued for two months financial markets rallied in asia on hopes for reduced trade tension but stocks were down modestly in early trading on wall street the administration accuses china of cheating in its drive to develop advanced technologies as driverless cars and artificial intelligence the administration alleges and independent analysts generally agree that china steals technology forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets unfairly subsidizes its own firms and throws up bureaucratic hurdles for foreign rivals beijing rejects the accusations and contends that washington is simply trying to suppress a rising competitor in international trade since july 2018 the trump administration has imposed a bewildering series of trade sanctions on china sometimes changing or delaying planned tariff rates friday s announcement means that the u s will continue to levy 25 import taxes on 250 billion in chinese goods and will halve the tariffs on another 112 billion to 7 5 it will drop plans to target an additional 160 billion that step would have extended the tariffs to just about everything china sells the united states and would have hit consumer items such as toys and smartphones that have so far largely been spared beijing has retaliated by taxing 120 billion in u s exports including soybeans and other farm products that are vital to many of trump s supporters in rural america rob atkinson president of the information technology and innovation foundation said the agreement represents progress but said the united states must still comprehensively address china s rampant innovation mercantilist practices mary lovely a trade economist at the peterson institute for international economics said it is unlikely that friday s deal delivers enough benefits for the u s to outweigh the costs of the trade fight so far u s farmers lost billions of dollars in income companies paid billions in tariffs and in many cases shifted their supply chains and consumers saw some prices increase many of us are highly skeptical that the agreement will be enough to outweigh these other costs lovely said the u s didn t move the needle very much still the agreement should help smooth some of the uncertainty surrounding global trade lovely said we have a cease fire we have some roll back that is very significant she said we were kind of on a brink here and we saw the negotiators pull us back repeated rounds of negotiations had failed to achieve a substantive deal the prolonged uncertainty over trump s trade policies has curtailed u s business investment and likely held back economic growth many corporations have slowed or suspended investment plans until they know when how or even whether the trade standoff will end a far reaching agreement on china s technology policies will likely prove difficult it would require beijing to scale back its drive to become a global powerhouse in industrial high technology something it sees as a path to prosperity and international influence this deal would amount to a modest de escalation of trade hostilities but hardly resolves the fundamental trade and economic tensions that are dampening business sentiment and investment in both countries said eswar prasad an economist at cornell university and former head of the international monetary fund s china division it is a promising sign that the two sides are talking and making progress on resolving their differences but the elements left for phase 2 of the trade talks are far thornier efforts to acquire foreign technology are a theme that runs through chinese law and government security researchers have asserted that beijing operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen foreign technology into commercial products the trump administration has been seeking a way to enforce any significant trade agreement with china reflecting its contention that beijing has violated past promises one way to do is to retain some tariffs as leverage mcdonald reported from bejing associated press writers christopher rugaber kevin freking and darlene superville in washington contributed to this report
