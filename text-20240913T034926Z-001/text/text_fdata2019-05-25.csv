photo bigstock china and its neighbours have much to gain from making the bri into a more inclusive enterprise as we moved into the 21st century a new more sustainable set of opportunities for the third world to construct a more just and balanced global economic order has presented itself the onward thrust of globalization has led to transformative changes in global comparative advantage in a wide range of goods and services countries of the third world particularly from asia have established their global competitiveness to a level where china has emerged as the world s largest economy in ppp terms with india in third place between 1990 and 2017 asia s share of global gdp increased from 23 9 to 35 8 while china s share of gdp grew from 1 6 to 15 2 in the area of global trade asia s share increased from 22 7 in 1990 to 37 6 in 2017 china s share of global trade in this same period increased from 1 6 to 11 5 as a consequence of asia s enhanced competitiveness 61 of global foreign exchange reserves are now located in asian countries including central west south and east asia with china accounting for 27 of total global reserves a further manifestation of the shift of global investment capacity is to be found in the sovereign wealth funds swf where 75 of global holdings originate in asia with china accounting for 21 of global swf capital asia s capital surpluses are now underwriting the balance of payments and budget deficits of the western capitalist countries where 56 of us treasury bills are held by asian countries with china accounting for 19 of these holdings these trends in global capital accumulation are not likely to change significantly in the years to come since they originate in the competitive strength of the asian economies and not in the price variabilities of global commodity markets the arguments now propagated by some of the wealthiest countries that this relocation of competitive strength and capital accumulation to asia owes to malpractices in the global trading system appears to be a self serving argument which fails to address the root cause of decline in the competitiveness of the west the enhancement of both economic competitiveness and capital surpluses in the hands of some third world countries particularly in asia provides a historic opportunity to use these strengths to promote south south cooperation as a route to construct a new more just international economic order for the 21st century central to any initiative to restructure the global economic order is the relocation of capital surpluses from the advanced capitalist countries of the west into asia with china as the principal source of global capital this relocation of global surpluses from the west to asia has also created conditions for challenging the monopoly of global capital flows and their management by western and international finance institutions such as the imf world bank and adb this monopoly over capital underwrote the economic power of the west and empowered its institutions to write the rules for governing the global economy so as to perpetuate their hegemony over the global economic order this relocation of global financial power into asian hands now drawing upon the services of some of the world s largest banks and swf to manage their funds has created opportunities to re write the rules for building a more just economic order china s vast foreign exchange reserves of 3 2 trillion and capital accumulated in its various sovereign wealth funds amounting to 1 7 trillion is specially provisioned to play a vanguard role in building a more balanced order bri as an instrument of cooperation the refusal of the us and europe to relinquish their dominance over the management of the global financial institutions has encouraged some countries of the south to draw upon the relocated capital surpluses accumulated by the more advanced emerging economies the brics bank set up by brazil russia india china and south africa was the first of these initiatives but its capital base and scope remains modest china moved further in designing an asia centric bank the asia infrastructure investment bank aiib in partnership with some other countries with a strong enough capital base to challenge the monopoly of the world bank and adb over development financing the aiib served as an important demonstration of china s intention of using its capital surpluses to extend its economic reach across the global south and even into the developed world of europe the aiib s multilateral design and narrower focus on the infrastructure needs of the developing world did not fully capture china s more ambitious vision to construct a new international order china therefore decided to autonomously move further through the belt and road initiative bri program by drawing upon its enormous financing capacity chinese commercial banks such as the bank of china and the citic had already engaged themselves in funding large investment projects across the world in 2014 for example exim bank of china disbursed 80bn in project financing more than the total disbursement of the seven largest development finance institutions china has now set up a more dedicated bri funding facility the silk road fund over the last two decades china had steadily built up strong commercial ties across the world its growing economic competitiveness had ensured that by 2015 it was the largest trading partner of the us a number of eu countries as well as many economies in asia latin america and ssa the bri must therefore be viewed as a continuum of china s expanded global economic reach and resource base china s financial capacity to underwrite the bri program is backed by the availability of sizeable surplus capacity in its capital goods engineering and construction industries its mega construction companies have emerged as world leaders in the construction sector these available assets invest china with the development capability to operationalize its bri program this opportunity to recycle its financial investments in large infrastructure projects located in beneficiary countries back into the chinese economy will significantly reduce the opportunity cost to china for implementing the bri china s global expansion has stimulated growth across the asian region as a result today asia is the fasted growing region in the global system over the next 25 years it will account for over 50 of global growth investment in this region and indeed in other fast growing economies of the third world would both provide for higher returns on capital and also be safer sources of investment the global financial crisis of 2007 which has persisted over the last decade due to severe deficiencies in the direction and management of the financial institutions and system of a number of western countries indicates that the traditional overlords of the global financial system are no longer its most reliable custodians furthermore some of the most advanced economies have shown that incoming investments in their markets can be exposed to a variety of restraints on political grounds and also to the political hazard of being frozen or confiscated as part of wider strategic agendas since capital surpluses of other asian and some other third world countries are also sizeable there is scope for tapping into a much larger pool of investible resources to underwrite a large number of bri projects not just in asia but across the world in sub saharan africa latin america and even europe china s bri program can play a catalytic role in drawing in countries with investible surpluses from asia and the brics to participate in the development of the countries of the south as it stands today a partial relocation of global surpluses away from western capital markets to underwrite the large infrastructures deficit which hold back development in many developing countries can play a major role in accelerating both global growth and reducing poverty in the less developed countries the improved economic linkages created by these investments will further stimulate south south cooperation both as a result of better connectivity as also through the enhanced transfer of skills and technology associated with major investment projects ensuring economic sustainability of bri programs china remains the driving force behind asia s dynamic gdp and export growth as also the primary source of accumulation of capital surpluses it can therefore not only sustain its commitment to the brics bank and aiib but can also underwrite major commitments to the bri this is an awesome responsibility for one country china will therefore need to reflect on how it handles its global mandate it will particularly need to exercise caution in relation to the terms on which it transfers its capital and skills under all circumstances china will need to avoid the prospect of bri beneficiaries falling into debt and dependency traps once associated with the transfer of capital from the west debt liabilities of third world countries accumulated to the western colonial powers precipitated the era of colonization and later the construction of a global economic order based on domination of the north and dependency of the south which came to be known as neo colonialism today some of the former colonial powers are proclaiming that china s aggressive lending practices are contributing a form of debt trap diplomacy in my view much of these criticisms are overstated china has little to gain from driving weaker partners into debt thereby reducing their capacity to trade china has indeed helped out many of its borrowers around the world through debt relief extended to more than 80 projects around the world between 2000 and 2017 but the risks of overindebtedness remain inherent in the circumstances of some of the weaker economies which have been prone to overdependence on external loans well before the bri entered the global discourse debt relief is at best a temporary solution the substantive goal is to restore viability to loss making investment projects this has been tried by china in addressing the problems of some of the more talked about bri debtors such as pakistan and sri lanka both countries had been accumulating international debts not just from china but multilateral institutions as well as from the global capital market a recent article in the economist april 27 reports that pakistan s current levels of indebtedness amounted to about 80 of its gdp but china s share so far contributes about an eighth of the debt with further bri loans being disbursed china s share of debt may rise to a quarter of pakistan s total debt sri lanka s debt dependence on china according to a recent article by two of its leading economists dushni weerakoon and sisira jayasuriya amounted to 10 of its external debt much of this debt was accumulated independently of its bri debts through borrowing on hard terms in these countries two much talked about projects associated with the bri program are the gwadar port on the arabian sea built by the chinese at a cost of 8bn to connect pakistan with the silk road and hambantota port in southern sri lanka built at a cost of several billion dollars by the chinese both projects initially threatened to become losing concerns due to their inability to enhance capacity utilization and served as liabilities to the respective economies the chinese bailed out both projects by converting a large part of the debt into equity and taking over the management of both ports on a long lease china has now assumed the risk of making both ports economically viable through superior management and bringing in further investments in the port region to increase capacity utilization the leasing out of national ports to foreign companies with strong management capabilities is common practice and has generated large global business for some of the leading port management authorities such as the singapore port authority and dubai port authority a chinese port authority has already taken over the management of greece s main port at piraeus china has recently applied its model of swapping debt for equity in laos where it has invested 6bn under the bri in constructing a railway which connects the landlocked country to china to its north and the sea china offered the loan on generous terms at 2 3 with 35 years maturity with repayment after five years and has assumed 70 of the investment as equity this idea of china of converting debt to equity under the bri is sensible economics and makes it a stakeholder in the project s viability the projection of china as a 21st century imperialist ensnaring poor countries in debt for nefarious strategic purposes is mostly propagated by erstwhile great powers struggling to retain their global hegemony without having to pay the price however china as a newcomer to the big league of global investment finance will need to structure its terms for financing of its bri projects so that recipients can sustain the debt and repay it through enhancement in their production base and its diversification such a task would be made easier if china incorporated its experience in gwadar hambantota and laos as a business model by re structuring its bri projects as partnerships with the host country rather than as exclusive loan financed investments to this end china will need to restructure its own economy to create market space for a widening volume of exports from third world countries which have benefitted from and been linked to china through the bri the possible risks of investing exclusively in capital intensive infrastructure projects through the bri have not escaped the attention of the chinese leadership in his recent inaugural address to the second bri global forum in beijing on may 6 2019 president xi jinping projected the bri as a comprehensive global economic partnership to build a more integrated economic order to promote trade investment and technology transfer bri investment by china which is projected at around a trillion us dollars may provide the physical manifestation of this order but the economic activity generated through the process will have an exponentially larger impact on not just china but its partners in the projects possible areas of research collaboration between think tanks on the bri agenda we must recognise that the bri as it is conceived by president xi jinping in its totality is much more than just a program to use chinese capital to construct infrastructure projects across the world the bri is indeed a global initiative to construct a new international order based on enhancing development and ending poverty across the south within the framework of a more equitable world order the scope of the bri thus extends to agendas for comprehensive deeper economic cooperation across the world the vision of a globally more cooperative order has traditionally been articulated in certain global fora convened by international institutions dreaming dreams about a more just harmonious world no country came forward to either take the lead in building such an order or in mobilizing funding for its realization the bri is unique because it is presented to the world as part of a national and foreign policy commitment by one country china which today presides over the largest most competitive economy in the world furthermore china has demonstrated what has never before been promised before by any collective of countries let alone one country that it is willing to invest part of its enormous wealth towards the realization of its vision this again is not pie in the sky since the trillion or so dollars committed to bri is just a quarter of china s current capital surplus and can be replenished through further earnings through its global competitiveness the bri may not immediately take us towards the promised land of global peace and order but will at least demonstrate that at least one country is willing to move ahead in this direction this initiative may now inspire other countries to join this ambitious enterprise but this is part of the future in the absence of any collective move to construct a new order china will have to work out the specifics of its more comprehensive vision on a bilateral basis such exercises will need to study the scope and willingness of individual countries to engage with china in the project and politically decide how ambitious they will be in participating in such joint ventures some of the think tanks in china which are already engaged in studying the bri and its prospects may find it useful to enter into research collaboration with their counterparts in countries where bri is making or may make significant advances the focus of such collaborative research would be to study the current focus and impact of the bri programs including those funded by the aiib and to examine the economic benefits and financial viability of these projects in the beneficiary country study would also be required as to the terms and condition of the loans appropriate for particular countries to ensure that they do not end up overburdened with debt work on identifying project priorities will remain important however in some cases a chinese think tank and its partner institution in a host country may review the broader agenda of the bri to explore how far it is possible to work out a more comprehensive program for long term cooperation with china such an exercise may also be extended to include countries which may partner with china in regional groupings as for example in the bangladesh china yunnan india and myanmar bcim sub regional group multi national groupings involve more complex political and strategic issues which may also be examined in order to design a comprehensive regional agenda for cooperation which is mutually beneficial to all partners it is particularly important that chinese and indian think tanks come together to assess the concerns of the indian government which have so far kept them out of the bri process so far no plausible explanation has been forthcoming from the indian side for keeping itself outside the bri along with trump s usa and japan both china and india as well as their neighbours have much to gain from making the bri into a more inclusive enterprise with both india and japan as full partners in the bri such a pan asian grouping could once again recreate a bipolar global order which remains essential to the peace and prosperity of the 21st century professor rehman sobhan is chairman centre for policy dialogue dhaka
why debt won t spark inflation modern technology was supposed to make travel less necessary we can meet by phone video and now in virtual reality but we re still traveling more than ever i certainly am the reason is simple technology can t yet replace face to face conversation and especially group conversations it is genetically hardwired in our species we spend more time on the phone and skype than ever but technology also makes information more complex and nuanced conveying it often requires a personal presence so we fly around and talk in person i thought of that last week at the strategic investment conference i ve been writing about japanification of the developed world economy explaining what i mean by that as best i can in these letters but in talking to conference attendees i found that i have not effectively communicated some of the nuances to be clear i don t want japanification nor do i think it will deliver the desired results i believe that in the next recession policymakers will respond with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and instead of producing growth it will depress growth and leave us all in the same morass japan has endured for almost three decades in other words i believe that both government and central banks will try japanification of course under other names but i don t expect it to work in the way they would hope when faced with the imminent possibility of recession depression or even a crash authorities will try to do something but they will have very few choices the default option of ever larger stimulus will kick in so like japan the us will see yet more quantitative easing and extraordinarily low interest rates along with annual federal deficits of 2 trillion and higher alternatives like restructuring the tax code and balancing the budget will be nowhere in sight at best this process will result in an even slower growing economy and avoid total meltdown that s the optimistic view given what i understand today about the political and economic realities as i see them i also believe that it is the most likely scenario the others are much darker however i also believe there is an off ramp that could short circuit the japanification effect leading to something closer to normal more on that below today i want to go deeper into the intellectual and academic rationale behind this outlook dr lacy hunt has long been an enormous influence on my understanding of economics in this letter i ll discuss his latest ideas i should note that any errors are mine and not his fault lacy briefly presented two theorems at the sic after his scholarly lecture that s really what it was i brought up my favorite central banker and former bis chief economist bill white the three of us had possibly the most stimulating discussion of the whole conference at least for me you can and should view it all on our virtual pass but i ll share some highlights below this is important and you need to understand it because it is the exact opposite of what many people think missing inflation let s start with some facts that may be inconvenient for some but are nonetheless facts back in the 1980s and 1990s many of us in the conservative and gold bug movements me included thought excessive government spending and the resulting debt would eventually bring inflation or even hyperinflation we wanted a hawkish federal reserve or better yet a gold standard to prevent it i have many friends close friends who still deeply believe in a gold standard but that s a discussion for another day reality turned out differently federal debt rose steadily inflation didn t here s a chart of the on budget public debt since 1970 using actual dollars instead of the more usual percentage of gdp and with a log scale to eliminate the hockey stick illusion here is the same data in terms of debt to gdp note the brief shining moment when the us was growing faster than the debt rose and actually ran surpluses in the late 1990s these were also times when gdp grew faster than the deficits and debt but the general trend is from the lower left to the upper right there was a significant jump during the great recession you can see the debt growth started to level out in the late 1990s but then took off again yet the only serious inflation in this whole period occurred in the first decade paul volcker stamped it out in the early 1980s i am not saying we had no inflation at all obviously we did and in many parts of the economy significantly more than the official average measures reflect some of it manifested in asset prices stocks real estate instead of consumer goods we like that and typically don t consider it inflation but it is but there was nothing remotely like the kind of major inflation that this level of government debt should theoretically have caused based on what we understood in the 1970s and 1980s remember ross perot and his charts it hasn t happened one argument is that technology reduced production costs enough to offset the higher debt burden that s probably part of it but i think a minor part the real answer is twofold first is the way high government debt interacts with interest rates over long periods and with a time lag but almost inexorably second but no less understood is the demand for certain currencies even as government debt and obligations rise a little reminder interest rates and inflation are really two sides of the same coin interest is the cost of money liquidity that cost is heavily influenced by the risk of money being devalued i e inflation expectations if lenders expect higher inflation then they expect to be repaid in cheaper dollars and thus demand more of them via higher interest rates so inflation drives rates higher while lack of inflation keeps them low as we ve seen since 2008 this brings us to lacy hunt s sic session in which he presented two important theorems they are related but i will discuss them separately i ll start by just quoting lacy then explain what i believe he means federal debt accelerations ultimately lead to lower not higher interest rates debt funded traditional fiscal stimulus is extremely fleeting when debt levels are already inordinately high thus additional and large deficits provide only transitory gains in economic activity which are quickly followed by weaker business conditions with slower economic growth and inflation long term rates inevitably fall that first sentence should come with a little boom cannon icon it will shock many people who think rising federal debt raises interest rates through a crowding out effect that means the government because it is the most creditworthy borrower sucks up capital and leaves less available to private borrowers who must then pay more for it via higher interest rates or a weakened currency that is the case for most countries in the world yet clearly it has not been the case for some countries in recent decades specifically larger developed economies that s not to say it never will be but actual experience supports lacy s point and not just in the us here are four charts he showed at sic in the us japan the eurozone and the uk sovereign rates fell as government debt rose that is not how keynesian or most other macroeconomic theories say debt funded fiscal stimulus should work additional cash flowing through the economy is supposed to have a multiplier effect spurring growth and eventually raising inflation and interest rates this has not happened the reason it hasn t happened is that we have crossed a kind of debt rubicon in recent history past performance really is not an indicator of future results today in much of the developed world the existing debt load is so heavy that additional dollars have a smaller effect the new debt s negative effects outweigh any benefit the higher taxes that politicians often think will reduce the deficit serve mainly to depress business activity we see the result in slower economic growth plus lower interest rates and inflation note we are talking here about fiscal policy i e government spending on jobs programs infrastructure etc when financed by issuing new debt central banks aren t directly involved until they start financing the government debt via qe or some version of mmt which lacy and the rest of the speakers at the sic will hasten to point out are not equivalent velocity falling lacy s second theorem supports the first monetary decelerations eventually lead to lower not higher interest rates as originally theorized by economist milton friedman as debt productivity falls the velocity of money declines making monetary policy increasingly asymmetric one sided and ineffectual as a policy instrument irving fisher s equation of exchange m2 v gdp says gdp is equal to the money supply times its turnover or velocity the federal reserve heavily influences the former but not the latter that it turns out is a serious problem the fed s phillips curve fixation gives it the illusion that every macroeconomic problem is a nail and monetary policy is the ideal tool hammer to fix it of course that s not true looser financial conditions don t help when the economy has no productive uses for the new liquidity with most industries already having ample capacity the money had nowhere to go but back into the banks hence velocity fell 33 in the two decades that ended in 2018 now if velocity is falling then any kind of fed stimulus faces a tough headwind it can inject liquidity but can t make people spend it nor can it force banks to lend and in a fractional reserve system money creation doesn t go far unless the banks cooperate later in the conference bill white observed that this is why monetary policy is increasingly ineffective the banks respond to each crisis the same way and every time they find that it takes more aggressive action to produce the same effect obviously that can t go on forever bill called it a fundamental intemporal inconsistency the result is that public and private debt keeps rising but also becomes less productive lacy showed how in a world of falling monetary velocity the amount of gdp growth produced by each additional dollar of debt fell 24 in the last 20 years that s why we have so much more debt now and yet slower growth this also explains why this year s first quarter notwithstanding growth has been so sluggish since 2014 that was when money supply peaked so for five years now we ve had both a shrinking money supply and slowing velocity that s not a recipe for inflation and the more recent jump in federal deficit spending is making matters worse not better in our q a lacy and bill discussed how linear economic models are just not working and nonlinear analysis is so critical a lot of practical people are turned off by this thinking it shouldn t be so complex but these same people would never tell a physicist to avoid nonlinear concepts the economy is complex and getting more so as the world adds new seemingly critical variables i should also note that lacy only had 30 minutes for his presentation and had to make a complex argument in an abbreviated time there are scores more corollary points we could explore the complex debt and currency dance astute readers will quickly point out that rising debt in places like venezuela has brought extraordinary inflation and currency devaluation historically that s what rapidly rising government debt does i simply point you to rogoff and reinhart s this time is different where they examine every debt and currency crisis for the last few centuries the circumstances may have been different but the result was the same yet today things do indeed seem different japan the us the uk and other countries seem able to expand their government debts beyond historically acceptable levels and get away with it interest rates have stayed low often getting lower and going negative while currency valuations have remained relatively stable the operative word here is relatively what is different is the international demand for currencies and debt denominated in those currencies a globalized economy yielded a surplus of savings that seeks a home in what is perceived as safe assets nobody thinks venezuela is safe that is why in a global crisis money flies to the us and other reserve currencies these safe haven currencies have the exorbitant privilege of running large fiscal deficits thought experiment if italy were to remove itself from the euro and reissue the lira does anybody really think that italy would keep today s low rates ditto for greece and other countries left on their own these currencies would devalue relative to stronger ones like germany and their interest rates would rise this is not necessarily a bad thing the safety valves of currency devaluation and bond market vigilantes saved italy numerous times before it joined the euro what most people don t realize is that italy grew faster than germany in real terms for the 20 30 years prior to joining the euro despite its inflation and devaluations how long can this go on the japanese experience suggests much longer than we would think forever no there is a point where the zeitgeist the perceived global narrative about a country and currency changes and currencies and interest rates become unhinged it can happen seemingly overnight again how long can this go on we simply don t want to know the answer to that question we will only know after the fact and it will be a horrible painful fact to experience better to find a viable exit ramp too high and getting wider i ll wrap up with a direct quote from lacy hunt which you will probably want to read several times his academic prose takes a little time to sink in but when it does you should be concerned if not terrified the parallels to the past are remarkable but there appears to be one fatal similarity the fed appears to have a high sensitivity to coincident or contemporaneous indicators of economic activity however the economic variables i e money and interest rates over which they have influence are slow moving and have enormous lags in the most recent episode in the last half of 2018 the federal reserve raised rates two times by a total of 50 basis points in reaction to the strong mid year gdp numbers these actions were done despite the fact that the results of their previous rate hikes and monetary deceleration were beginning to show their impact of actually slowing economic growth the m2 money growth rate was half of what it was two years earlier signs of diminished liquidity were appearing and there had been a multi quarter deterioration in the interest rate sensitive sectors of autos housing and capital spending presently the treasury market by establishing its rate inversion is suggesting that the fed s present interest rate policy is nearly 50 basis points too high and getting wider by the day a quick reversal could reverse the slide in economic growth but the lags are long it appears that history is being repeated too tight for too long slower growth lower rates the fed waited too long to raise rates and then overshot the mark when it finally got around to it i was calling for rate hikes in 2012 and 2013 the fed could have hiked 50 to 75 basis points per year normalizing interest rates and letting the economy adjust slowly rather than all at once late in the cycle having realized it fomc members then paused but too late and possibly for the wrong reasons now they re trapped lacy thinks an immediate 50 bp cut might help but he s not optimistic they will do it or that it will work if they do if that s right then we are in for slower growth and probably recession sooner rather than later in a debt laden highly leveraged economy it probably won t be a mild one either i mentioned earlier that i believe there is an off ramp exit for the us economy in the coming weeks i m going to respond to ray dalio s recent two part letter and then his third longer piece seemingly endorsing modern monetary theory mmt it will probably be a multipart series and will allow all of us to have a much larger thought experiment a potentially educational experience than we have been having in the spirit of dalio s own radical transparency philosophy maybe it is time to start thinking the unthinkable before we move on at least in this letter from the strategic investment conference let me gently suggest that you take advantage of our virtual pass you can see most of the 33 speakers on video listen to them on audio and read the transcripts of the sessions i m getting many responses raving about the conference from people who weren t even there they watched on the virtual pass which is the next best thing and maybe think about joining us next year at the phoenician in scottsdale arizona on may 11 14 as my friend kent k wrote one of the best things about attending sic is not only the information learned from these rock star speakers you get to actually have a drink with them and sometimes dinner and pick their brain from a financial context it would be like seeing the rolling stones or paul mccartney perform and then having a casual conversation with them afterwards i have never attended any other conference that provides this kind of experience they shall not grow old on the five hour flight from dallas to puerto rico this past weekend i decided to watch a movie scrolling through the seemingly endless choices i came across the documentary by peter jackson of lord of the rings fame called they shall not grow old jackson and his team went through world war i film archives to assemble an extraordinarily moving view of the reality total brutality and utter inhumanity of war the entire documentary consists of actual film from the era starting out black and white and eventually becoming colorized it is a well done homage to these soldiers bravery and patriotism over 10 million died during that single war and the civilian death toll was almost as large in the us it is memorial day weekend where we annually pay tribute to those who lost their lives to keep countries free and democratic spending less than two hours watching they shall not grow old would be a good way to honor their sacrifice it is a window into times and events simply not imaginable to most of us and while you re watching remember that european bond markets were very calm almost up to the last moment no one really thought war was coming but then the unthinkable happened it s time to hit the send button and to those of you who served your country wherever and whenever it was thank you i wish you a truly great week your reflecting on the unthinkable analyst
cnn as president donald trump lands in japan saturday amid a worsening trade war with china he could well be thinking back to a previous economic spat between washington and an asian economic powerhouse in the 1980s japan was the big bad its economy was booming the second largest in the world and many in the united states feared they were about to be overtaken articles were published warning of the japanning of america or an economic pearl harbor as japanese businesses bought us companies and landmarks lawmakers and commentators warned of a growing trade deficit between the two countries and complained of japanese firms stealing us intellectual property and taking advantage of unfair trade deals in an interview with the morton downey jr show in 1989 trump himself complained that japan had systematically sucked the blood out of america sucked the blood out it s a huge problem and it s a problem that s going to get worse trump said of the us japan trade balance and they re laughing at us by then however change was already happening and far from overtaking the united states japan was about to fall far behind trade war after president ronald reagan took office in 1981 the united states started pressuring japan to open its market up to american companies and reduce the trade imbalance between the countries while japan agreed to measures including a limit on the number of cars it exported to the united states panic over japanese trade power grew and lawmakers on both sides demanded action in approving a bill calling for tough trade reprisals against japan robert packwood then republican head of the senate s finance committee promised to give tokyo an eye for an eye that is all they understand during a 1985 finance committee hearing democratic sen max baucus said that reagan predicted a future in which commerce will be king the eagle will soar and america will be the mightiest trading nation on earth well commerce may be king and eagles may be soaring but they re not american eagles america s trade performance has never been worse that year five countries the united states west germany france the united kingdom and japan signed the plaza accord devaluing the us dollar against the japanese yen and the german deutsche mark this was a boon for the united states leading to an increase in exports and a lowering of its trade deficit with many western european countries yet the plaza accord wasn t the end of us action against japan in 1987 washington imposed 100 tariffs on 300 million worth of japanese imports effectively blocking them from the american market things quickly turned sour for tokyo as the yen increased in value japanese products became more and more expensive and countries turned away from the one time export powerhouse efforts by the country s central bank to keep the yen s value low sparked a stock price bubble the collapse of which helped push the country into recession and a lost decade japan s export and gdp growth essentially halted in the first half of 1986 economists joshua felman and daniel leigh wrote in a report for the international monetary fund they concluded that while the plaza accord did not cause japan s economic downturn by itself it did trigger a series of events compounded by poor decisions in tokyo which led to the collapse competing lessons some of trump s first forays into politics involved railing against japan during the 1980s and early 1990s during that time he started calling for the use of tariffs as a trade weapon while he has not referenced the historical us japan relationship during the recent china conflict washington s success against tokyo could influence his thinking on how to handle beijing one of his key advisers on trade robert lighthizer also took part in japan negotiations in the 1980s in 2011 as trump flirted with a presidential run lighthizer praised his skepticism toward pure free trade dogma the icon of modern conservatism ronald reagan imposed quotas on imported steel protected harley davidson from japanese competition restrained imports of semiconductors and automobiles and took myriad similar steps to keep american industry strong he wrote yet while lighthizer and trump may take positive lessons from the 1980s trade war beijing is also paying attention and china s leaders have no intention of copying japan s mistakes in an editorial last year china s xinhua state news agency warned that japan was seriously hurt by its improper response to the plaza accord and us trade pressure it blamed the us for scapegoating japan for problems in the domestic economy adding a strong protectionist sentiment was the direct driving force behind the plaza accord this has been a common theme in state media coverage of the trade war that the us is seeking to blame beijing for matters outside its control repeating history of course 2019 is not 1985 and china is not japan beijing is far stronger both economically and politically than

1 like although i respect and love the usa i can only see this trade war acts as bullying imagine they accused the japanese of the same information stealing and spying because they saw the prowess of the japanese in the 1980 s they slammed japan with sanction and tariff and successfully halted it s economic development all because of the fear of losing the top spot in the world instead of them to find other productive means to tackle asian tigers they normally resort to bullying all because weak western nations are all too ready to obey them anytime anyday hiding beneath the facade of economic friendship and treaties like the article said the chinese is very different from the japanese and will be ready to fight for their economic relevance i thought developmental strides should be applaudes not bullied and the usa should review some of the actions it takes even if there is no one bold enough to stand up to them even if they succeed in crippling the chinese economy another asian tiger will also rise and i will see how long the us will keep using this stunt 2 likes 1 share usa must know that the chinese cannot be bullied the chinese are way too advanced to make the mistakes

vermont s 2019 legislative session has sort of come to a close we look back on what ultimately happened to a number of bills that generated conversation over these past months as well as ones you may not have heard as much about note a few of these bills are still awaiting gov phil scott s signature we ve noted instances where it is unclear how the governor will proceed and we will update those sections once we have a final answer at the start of the session we laid out six issues to watch during the 2019 legislative session we did keep a close eye on those particular ones these past few months so click on a topic just above or scroll on down to see how those six issues shook out we also tracked a bunch of other bills too click here to jump down to our even more list 1 paid family and medical leave the push to create a statewide paid family and medical leave program was one of house democrats biggest priorities in 2019 in april they passed legislation that would have given parents 12 weeks of paid leave to take care of a newborn or eight weeks of paid time off to deal with a personal medical crisis or to tend to an ailing family member in order to raise the nearly 80 million annually it would cost to fund the program the legislation would have imposed a 0 55 payroll tax on virtually every worker in vermont many senators balked at the price tag and winnowed the proposal significantly the senate s version would have pared down the program s benefits mainly by eliminating any paid leave for the purposes of dealing with a personal injury or illness but that plan was also cheaper requiring only a 0 2 payroll tax late session negotiations yielded a number of proposed compromises house and senate leaders however were unable to reach a deal and while senate lawmakers passed a paid leave bill in the waning minutes of the 2019 legislative session house speaker mitzi johnson says her chamber won t move on the proposal until 2020 republican gov phil scott had

transfer tax to help vermont come up with the approximately 25 million a year the state will need to meet its clean water obligations lawmakers however initially said the governor s plan would

that money i e existing state revenues to fund clean water efforts lawmakers say they ve achieved their goal of establishing a long term dedicated revenue source for water quality notwithstanding their decision to use existing revenues to fund the program that s because new language in the tax bill redirects 6 of the rooms and meals tax about 12 million annually to a clean water fund that provision will leave a hole in the state s general fund budget every year fiscal analysts say the increased revenues that fueled this year s budget surplus will likely reappear in future years and supply the funds needed to fill that hole but that projection they say comes with a caveat fiscal pressures next year and beyond according to the analysts may require alternate uses of revenues that would otherwise be used to backfill the hole left by the reallocation of the rooms and meals tax and they also say an economic downturn could create new and unexpected budget pressures in the future 4

suspected that a driver was operating their vehicle in an impaired manner the debate over driver impairment grew more complicated when the committee took testimony that the saliva test would reveal the presence of marijuana in an individual s system but not specific impairment levels questions were also raised if law enforcement officials would need a warrant before administering a saliva test

every year the vast majority of ghana s natural wealth is stolen the country is among the largest exporters of gold in the world yet according to a study by the bank of ghana less than 1 7 percent of global returns from its gold make their way back to the ghanaian government this means that the remaining 98 3 percent is managed by outside entities mainly multinational corporations who keep the lion s share of the profits in other words of the us 5 2 billion of gold produced from 1990 to 2002 the government received only us 87 3 million in corporate income taxes and royalty payments the dominant discourse propagated by institutions like the international monetary fund imf that control the levers of global finance blames the bad governance of local officials for the consequences of this plunder citing corruption scandals as the main reason for a lack of resources however the discourse around bad governance the idea that corrupt local officials are to blame for endemic poverty low health indicators education and other measures of national well being focuses on what happens with the 1 7 percent of the returns that ghana receives sarah bracking points out that the company would argue that the market value of output is not synonymous with their surplus or profits as working capital wages depreciation of machines and so forth must be paid from this however the figures do act as a good illustration of the low returns to the sovereign owners of sub soil resources as a proportion of their final market value which in africa can be estimated as typically in the region of between three and five percent but which in this case is lower about 1 7 per cent holding officials accountable for their use of public funds should be a given but what about the remaining 98 3 percent of the returns generated by ghana s gold exports individuals are blamed fingers angrily pointed at corrupt governments while the nations they govern are robbed blind by transnational corporations it is these corporations working with institutions like the imf and the world bank that define the terms of this conversation these international lenders bury borrowing countries with steep interest rates and terms that grant lending institutions the power to determine and approve national policies national leaders of countries that fall into the debt trap are forced to forfeit the right to create their own policies for access to loans these leaders are then blamed for the consequences of policies and terms crafted by lending institutions a key form of neocolonialism they are also blamed for the vestiges of hundreds of years of colonialism that came before in some cases it is true that national leaders are involved in corruption scandals in others corruption scandals are fabricated relying on a deeply embedded narrative and lack of faith in national leadership in the global south despite a lack of evidence seen recently in brazil with the imprisonment of leading presidential candidate lula da silva even in cases where the corruption of local governments does exist the amount of money pilfered pales in comparison to the wealth extracted by transnational corporations in other words robber barons are blaming petty thieves for the consequences of their large scale robbery schemes according to the united nations conference on trade and development unctad multinational corporations offshore tax hubs result in an estimated us 100 billion in annual tax revenue losses for developing countries vijay prashad of tricontinental institute for social research calls this phenomenon tax strikes or the idea that those who hold capital who are the masters of property have been essentially on strike against regimes of taxation they use their vast wealth to either hide their money or change tax laws to offer them increasing protections rather than using this money for the social good to invest in public services infrastructure health or education they use it to increase their own wealth often by inflat the stock market and various asset bubbles comparatively during a 2013 keynote address world bank president jim yong kim cited that corruption in the form of bribery and theft by government officials costs developing countries between us 20 billion and us 40 billion each year in other words by a rough calculation the amount that corrupt government officials cost developing countries is anywhere from 40 to 80 percent less than half of the amount that these nations lose in offshore tax havens the real power then remains in the hands of multinational corporations which not only make off with vast sums of wealth belonging to the darker nations but also continue to exercise control over nations in the global south where they use access to finance as a lever to impose policies that benefit themselves at the expense of the people who live there when local leaders are deemed too much of a threat to multinational corporations interests they are quickly deposed through coups as we saw in haiti 2004 and honduras 2009 or destabilization campaigns as we see in venezuela today kwame nkrumah a leader in ghana s independence struggle and the country s first president referred to this process as neocolonialism the essence of neo colonialism is that the state which is subject to it is in theory independent and has all the outward trappings of international sovereignty in reality its economic system and thus its political policy is directed from outside nkrumah wrote in his book neo colonialism the last stage of imperialism through organizations like the imf and world bank former colonialists would strive for the general objective to achieve colonialism in fact while preaching independence fifty four years after nkrumah wrote neo colonialism the last stage of imperialism 1965 and 62 years after ghana s independence from great britain 1957 nkrumah s assessment remains as clear and relevant as ever the preferred words of imperialism have shifted but the underlying structure remains the same a system where an illusion of freedom obscures the power relations and where monopoly capital in the form of transnational corporations and lending institutions exercises control over the country s economic and political reality the narrative of today s neocolonialists blames bad governance as the obstacle to a better future in which ghanaians benefit from their vast mineral wealth as gyekye tanoh of the third world network africa points out in his recent interview with tricontinental institute for social research according to this trope the corruption of local governments is to blame however this narrative leaves out of the picture the pillage of natural resources and exploitation of labor by colonizers great britain in the case of ghana not only were the systems to process crude forms of minerals such as oil and gold not developed by colonizers but the country s reliance on foreign capital to buy and process these resources has kept the country in a position similar to its colonial status pre 1957 as nkrumah predicted where transnational corporations rather than the state of great britain keep the vast majority of revenues produced from ghanaian gold and other resources tanoh explains he entire system that was set in place since the 1980s to force countries to rely upon raw material exports and to become dependent on foreign buyers is what leaves countries like ghana with such a minuscule amount of the wealth taken from ghana s land good governance is not going to solve this unless good governance refers as well to the deep structural dynamics pointing a proverbial finger at those responsible for the distribution of 1 7 percent of wealth generated and framing them as the main culprits of corruption poverty and underdevelopment is not just reckless and irresponsible it is part of a systemic narrative that deflects attention away from the real thieves the multinational corporations that preside over the 98 3 percent of the remaining wealth it is intellectually dishonest to ignore the broader historical context that is responsible for the low returns of ghanaian gold to ghanaian citizens true bad governance is the appropriation of 98 3 percent of wealth produced by ghanaian resources that lines the coffers of transnational corporations instead of being returned to benefit the ghanaian people of the ten top multinational firms that operate on the african continent only one vale of brazil is located in the global south of the remaining nine three are united states corporations three are canadian two are australian and one is british all are private transnational corporations in other words the gold that is extracted from ghanaian soil like the natural wealth extracted from across the african continent and global south is immediately handed over to multinational corporations almost entirely based in and controlled by the global north or at best by the national elite to be processed refined and distributed death rape and preventable illnesses that plague those who work in or live near the mines are rampant in the area where these companies operate as illustrated by tricontinental institute for social research s latest briefing though ghana won its independence in 1957 the vestiges of colonialism and underdevelopment did not magically leave with it under colonialist rule resources were extracted from former colonies like ghana to sustain the wealth of their colonizers wealthproduced from gold further enhanced by enslaved or bondedlabor quickly left the country promoting development in england while leaving ghana void of the infrastructure to develop or refine its own resources and leaving its people without access to basic services to accept the narrative on bad governance is to forfeit what fidel castro called the battle of ideas it is to let the powerful transnational corporations and the web of institutions that protects their interests from the imf to corporatized non profits and mainstream media define the terms of the conversation on development sovereignty and the lives of the people who inhabit the resource rich land it is to forfeit the control of ghanaian resources to transnational corporations the very thieves of the majority of the country s wealth under the false pretext that they are incapable of managing it themselves to quote gyekye the language of good governance implies that it is only the aberrant behaviours of the public officials that should be seen as corruption yet of course the lack of resources available to accountable public institutions makes it impossible to create or sustain meaningful domestic anti corruption mechanisms it is intellectually dishonest to blame local leaders as the main culprits for bad governance conveniently leaving multinational corporations out of the picture it is the vestiges of colonialism and its continued neocolonialist forms that deprive the ghanaian people of the right to process develop and manage their natural wealth and to be the drivers of their own policies in other words their right to national sovereignty it is transnational corporations the stand ins of yesterday s british empire often aided by an enthusiastic national bourgeoisie that have robbed the ghanaian people of sovereignty over their resources their wealth and their future

the way the trump administration is now openly deliberating whether to impose additional tariffs on a further 325 billion of chinese goods exported to the united states national security concerns are also being increasingly invoked not only is huawei the chinese telecommunications group already largely shut out of selling its products in the u s domestic market but trump is also now taking steps to ban the sale of u s made components to huawei as well what was once a mere trade skirmish therefore appears to be metastasizing into cold war 2 0 this creates a conundrum for the trump administration beijing is increasingly viewed by many countries as an economic rival or a security threat to be contained rather than a collaborative trade partner to be accommodated but the president s america first trade policy is undermining broader multilateral efforts to contain china because trump s incessant focus on reducing his country s bilateral trade deficit with beijing means diverting chinese purchases away from other trade counterparties that means for example china buying more u s cars made on american soil than say german ones more u s soybeans than brazilian or more u s semiconductors than japanese or south korean ones all designed to help reduce the bilateral deficit this sort of a trade deal however is clearly not in the interests of the eu brazil japan or southeast asia and is making them averse to collaborating with the united states with regard to any chinese security concerns they might share which they do especially when one considers that the basis for the west s successful containment strategy against the former soviet union was that it was both collaborative and multilateral in scope semiconductors are a perfect case in point to highlight the new contradiction if trump bans the export of u s made semis to huawei he has now offered a temporary 90 day waiver then the latter will naturally gravitate toward buying them from other countries in fact the sino u s trade dispute is just one of many growing points of friction between the u s and its traditional allies many are increasingly ignoring trump and competing for chinese markets or investment as the italians have recently done in response to beijing s belt and road initiative the sino u s dispute throws up other challenges for the administration tariffs are certainly effective as an attention getting mechanism but if the goal is ultimately to encourage more jobs at home they will be ineffective if unaccompanied by a national industrial policy that focuses on american re industrialization in order to create skilled high paying private sector jobs capable of profitably supporting workers with solid middle class incomes a corollary is that a national development policy must be geared toward jobs that reflect the needs of the 21st century economy rather than nostalgically working to sustain industries that may be headed toward obsolescence like steel or even fossil fuels many share the president s belief that a harder line on chinese trade is necessary this reflects a growing loss of faith even among those formerly well disposed to beijing that the country s market reforms will inevitably lead to multi party liberal democracy along with mounting skepticism that free trade and commercial co dependence can displace military rivalry a similar historic miscalculation was made before world war i but support for the president s current stance particularly from democrats is conditionally tied to the embrace of a more activist form of state industrial policy to ensure that american workers derive maximum benefit from the reverse engineering of existing chimerica supply chains and that argues professor michael lind means adequate and permanent production on u s soil not just innovation in america and production elsewhere this means some combination of managed trade along with national industrial policy managed trade which prioritizes concrete purchases of u s goods as opposed to increased market access or structural changes to china s economy is not really new ronald reagan pursued a similar policy against japan during the 1980s nor is the idea of a national economic development strategy particularly contrary to american historical traditions since the days of alexander hamilton industrialization and the concomitant role of the state have long been viewed as the joint basis of modern military power and prosperity by both major parties whether the president was a republican like lincoln or eisenhower or a democrat such as fdr or jfk it is only with the rise of multinational industry in the past few decades where the notion has taken hold that the state should limit its role in economic development borders have come second to measures of growth and corporate profitability when there has been greater growth potential with policies that go across borders the policies generally got the green light even at a cost of eroding america s homegrown manufacturing base as industry became even more profitable when it went offshore the focus for staying on top of the world s economic food chain shifted principally in the fields of advanced research in the fields of computing biology and of course military and space but americans themselves often did not experience the benefits of these shifts as more and more industry moved offshore international monetary fund imf and world bank loans ensured that the developing world would increasingly depend on western agriculture to feed itself western engineering expertise to supply energy infrastructure and western finance centers to manage and leverage their economies the muscle memory of state involvement in industry at this point is a matter of bailouts and buyouts what remains of the old state level involvement in national economic affairs has evolved into a washington consensus that engages in a more limited government role modest incentives and subsidies to avoid sudden and sharp economic convulsions a 25 year decline in manufacturing rather than all at once until the latest disruption on trade wall street and the markets had come to believe trump would get a trade deal with china that promised increased access to beijing s domestic market e g the credit card companies and the u s rating agencies but not much in the way of a changed status quo one of the reasons why the president may have pulled back from this kind of an agreement is that expanding u s corporate access to china s domestic markets actually deepens chimerica integration rather than disrupting it and bringing much industry back to the united states american blue collar workers a growing trump constituency will neither benefit from a status quo plus arrangement nor is that kind of a deal consistent with the growing belief among trump s advisers that beijing constitutes a growing national security threat which leads to one of the new dimensions of this trade war it is occurring against a backdrop in which long standing contradictions with regard to trade and national security concerns have finally collided these tensions are not new as michael lind has observed under presidents of both parties the pentagon drew up war plans against china while the commerce department blessed the offshoring by u s based multinationals of much of america s industrial base to chinese soil this combination of containment and engagement inspired a name that itself was a contradiction congagement trump is attempting to unravel congagement via the embrace of a more nationalistic industrial policy that means returning to the time tested and successful hamiltonian industrial strategy of using whatever means are necessary tariffs subsidies procurement tax breaks even overseas development loans to countries that purchase u s manufactured exports to ensure that strategic industries necessary to u s military power are introduced to america or remain here as lind writes so with regard to china this means exporting u s goods made on american soil it therefore disrupts existing supply chains it s not free trade by any stretch but the virtue of numerical targets is that they are actually easier to monitor and enforce than vague promises to respect intellectual property or eliminate state subsidies under a managed trade framework if china does not meet its quota of american goods then trump could slap on new tariffs for america s trade nationalists this sort of a deal also has the happy byproduct of undermining the multilateral trade framework established by the world trade organization because enforcement mechanisms are left in the hands of the two parties to the agreement with regard to national security considerations it means preserving domestic manufacturing capacity in dual use industries important in both defense and civilian commerce but in resolving one contraction trump might well be introducing a new one while managed trade might well dislocate many existing chimerica supply chains such disruption would likely come at the economic expense of america s traditional allies in europe japan taiwan and korea if beijing were to accept specified quotas it means some other country loses out not only will this likely prove unacceptable to china s non u s trade partners but it will also further exacerbate widening divisions between the united states and its traditional allies making coherent economic diplomacy against beijing less likely especially against a backdrop of rising national populist movements that have rendered problematic any idea of a united european response in a protracted rivalry with china and if it comes against a backdrop of china viewed as a national security threat beijing itself has even less incentive to accept such a deal even if it means risking some short term economic damage there are also economic pitfalls for the united states in embracing such a narrowly nationalistic approach high tech knowledge industries e g biotech health care ai robotics etc are crucial for future growth prospects at the same time growing concerns about climate change risk consigning one of america s major comparative advantages namely its dominance in the fossil fuel industries to obsolescence as the rest of the world works to decarbonize their economies the issue here is that only a few countries matter in these industries as opposed to say resource based exporters if the global economy continues to evolve into a series of regional balkanized competing military economic blocs in a post unipolar world it behooves the united states to be part of the biggest most advanced of those geo economic blocs that becomes harder to do if the eu japan korea etc increasingly view america as an unreliable partner pursuing a narrowly nationalistic policies that damage their own economic interests or the united states pursues more preemptive wars of choice without any degree of international support e g iran all of which stands in marked contrast to the post wwii period where the united states consciously made trade offs that often worked against narrowly nationalistic considerations but which sustained a coalition that ultimately won the cold war for example it largely tolerated asia s mercantilist trade practices in order to secure the region s cooperation as part of a u s dominated security umbrella even though the resultant asian export onslaught proved damaging to a number of american manufacturing interests trump has evinced little awareness of or inclination to pursue these trade offs in fact america first almost makes it impossible to consider them

today conventional discourse leads us to believe that the great depression was created by a failure of laissez faire economics by a failure of the free market and an unregulated economy this is the narrative that has been constructed and is now perpetuated in all classes of political science and history taught to students the great depression many intellectuals and economists have furthered this narrative by asserting that the gold standard was the real cause of the market failure thus government intervention was consequently legitimate to rescue the economy this is a myth that must be debunked before it polarizes forthcoming generations as dr murray rothbard who was a strong proponent of laissez faire economics once famously said of the great depression what was the trouble economic theory demonstrates that only governmental inflation can generate a boom and bust cycle and that the depression will be prolonged and aggravated by inflationist and other interventionary measures in contrast to the myth of laissez faire we have shown in this book how government intervention generated the unsound boom of the 1920s and how hoover s new departure aggravated the great depression by massive measures of interference the guilt for the great depression must at long last be lifted from the shoulders of the free market economy and placed where it properly belongs at the doors of politicians bureaucrats and the mass of enlightened economists and in any other depression past or future the story will be the same the gold standard the gold standard did not generate the crash of the stock market of 1929 but the federal reserve did by definition the gold standard is a monetary system in which the value of money is determined by a physical commodity mainly gold because gold has been the most precious and trusted metal to convey trades in 1861 treasury secretary salmon chase signed the us paper certificate which enabled individuals to exchange paper money for a set amount of gold in 1900 the gold standard act was enacted to make gold the legal tender that would determine the value of the dollar so the value of gold was set at 20 67 an ounce therefore one dollar was equal to one twentieth of an ounce of gold the pure and classical gold standard was effective from 1870 to 1914 individuals used gold as commodity money because it guaranteed that the government would redeem any amount of paper money for its value in gold furthermore the gold standard was mainly trusted as backed commodity money because it kept inflation relatively low and sustainable in 1913 the federal reserve was created by congress to be used as a lender of last resort due to bank panics it established that the federal reserve s main objective was to maintain the value of gold during the period of bank panics the leaders of the federal reserve committed an irreparable mistake that unfortunately led to the great depression in 1914 the united states was engaged in world war i and could not subsidize its military expenditures by solely relying on the gold standard president woodrow wilson took the united states economy off the gold standard and used the federal reserve to print more money so the united states government could supply its military arsenal during the war the early 1920s saw the rise of the federal reserve as the central authority as it became the regulator of the value of gold during the pre world war ii era though they thought they were doing the right thing the leaders of the federal reserve committed an irreparable mistake that unfortunately led to the great depression they imposed a policy that allowed the federal reserve to control the loans and credits it would offer to commercial banks this is how the real bills doctrine was implemented according to a study conducted by professor richard h timberlake who has extensively researched the real bills doctrine and monetary policy the theory of the real bills doctrine states that the unrestricted issuing of money in exchange for real bills will not cause excessive inflation from undue increases in the money supply and that doing so will not cause bank failure from illiquidity the real bills doctrine so the federal reserve supplied an excess of money to commercial banks during times of economic expansion according to another study conducted by professor lawrence h white and published by the cato institute the real bills doctrine wrongly takes the nominal quantity demanded of a particular type of credit as a reliable guide to the nominal quantity of money the public wants to hold moreover professor white argues that the real bills doctrine incorrectly made the redeemability of bank liabilities an unimportant aspect in the process that determined the quantity of money in effectuating the real bills doctrine during the 1920s leaders of the federal reserve did not include an alternative response to counter bank panics during times of economic recession the accumulation of the excess of money supplied to commercial banks by the federal reserve generated a substantial deflation prices of goods and services significantly shrank below zero percent of the inflation rate and this deflation subsequently created the crash of the stock market in 1929 don t blame the gold standard when franklin delano roosevelt became president one of his major acts as the most powerful man in america was to increase the value of gold by enacting the gold reserve act the value of gold increased from 20 67 an ounce to 35 an ounce enacted in 1934 the gold reserve act asserted that gold could no longer be privately owned the law required that gold certificates held by the federal reserve through private ownership be surrendered and vested in the department of the treasury the federal government did not need to take full control of the money supply to restore the economy only licensed jewelers were allowed to have gold for sales purposes the gold reserve act was the primary policy that in fact took the united states off the gold standard before it was utterly dissolved by president nixon in 1971 the gold reserve act entrenched the nationalization of money and epitomized a clear unjustified encroachment of the central government on the economy the federal government did not need to take full control of the money supply to restore the economy the federal reserve could have changed its monetary policy while leaving commercial banks with the power to freely establish their own exchange rates without government interference based on this history it is clear that the gold standard did not create the great depression but the federal reserve did
argentina is famous for its delicious steaks full bodied malbecs scintillating footballers and seemingly untamable inflation this last factor has led to stubbornly high poverty in a country blessed with bountiful natural wealth from the vast and fertile pampas to the largest shale gas deposit in the world defining and measuring poverty is always fraught with danger and controversy and is especially true in a country that has a history of cooking the books when it comes to official statistics however the universidad católica argentina uca s social debt observatory offers a more reliable independent and comprehensive data set than most urban poverty its latest figures suggest that urban poverty increased in 2018 to 31 3 percent or 12 7 million argentines the highest figure uca has ever reported since it started collecting data in 2010 according to the report 30 percent of urban households are marginalized in terms of labor rights and 28 percent have no link to the welfare system as it exists in argentina in greater buenos aires where the majority of argentines live the poverty rate reaches an eye watering 41 1 percent with an extra 750 000 individuals falling into poverty in 2018 alone uca uses a multi dimensional system of indicators to measure urban poverty that in essence measures those urban argentines who don t have access to an adequate supply of food health housing education employment and social security systems according to this measure of poverty argentina has seen an increase from 29 9 percent in 2010 when the series began to the 31 3 percent reported for 2018 macri s economic policies due to complex legacies of colonization and the subsequent nature of state building in latin america in the 19th century argentina has always experienced high levels of both poverty and inequality however when the current president mauricio macri took office in december 2015 poverty stood at 27 percent which suggests a significant increase since he was elected marci has implemented a curious mix of continuity and change in policy grounded in elements of business as usual with key anti poverty policies and shock therapy in macro economic policies for example the key universal child benefit asignación universal por hijo or auh a targeted program for children of the previous regime under cristina fernandez de kirchner was maintained by the more neoliberal macri with social expenditure in general frozen in current terms this suggests that increases in poverty under his watch have come from areas other than cutting back on welfare which is the normal culprit of these kinds of increases under right wing regimes inflation and imf loan instead we must look to the areas of policy that have seen radical change under macri rationalization of argentina s exchange rate combined with fiscal consolidation through the removal of key subsidies in energy and transport has led to rampant inflation with prices 50 percent higher in february 2018 than they were a year earlier this is despite a fast shrinking economy gdp contracted by more than 6 percent year on year in the final quarter of 2018 the economic situation got so bad by mid 2018 that macri and argentina went to the imf for a us 57 billion stand by agreement with an accelerated timetable of disbursements this was particularly poignant for a country that paid all its outstanding imf debt early under a previous regime in 2005 effectively expelling the imf after it had received widespread criticism from within the country for precipitating a financial collapse in december 2001 the return of the imf to argentina has not been a popular move among argentines argentina s uncertain future these changing macro economic indicators led to significant increases in income poverty which has been responsible for the increases witnessed in the uca s poverty data set this income poverty has crystallized due to lower wages as they have not kept up with inflation loss of employment as a number of key employment policies have been either scaled back or canceled and greater job insecurity as a result of the above inflationary and economic stagnation context in other words the general retreat of the state under the macri administration has left behind significant segments of society that have not benefited from the limited policies of monetary assistance who instead require effective economic social and human development policies anathema to the political economy of neoliberalism and macri the future is far from certain with a presidential election this year even macri himself says he will win by 52 48 a wafer thin margin senior members of his administration suggest argentina will return to growth in the first half of 2019 and current macro economic policies suggest inflation should start to come down as well however in the continuing absence of significant human development policies whether normal argentines will feel the benefit of this remains as unclear as macri s re election prospects disclaimer the views and opinions expressed here are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial position of the globe

washington dc not content with its trade war against china us president donald trump s administration has also opened bilateral trade negotiations with japan yet whatever trump hopes to achieve with japan it will be far less than what he threw away when he abandoned the trans pacific partnership tpp in early 2017 during the 2016 us presidential campaign trump promised americans that he would negotiate so many great deals on their behalf that they would get tired of winning now that he has imposed heavy costs on us farmers consumers and the overall economy through tariffs on chinese imports americans are probably growing quite tired indeed trump s withdrawal from the tpp is the canonical example of his trade policy recklessness signed in 2016 by the united states and 11 other pacific rim countries the treaty would have governed around 40 per cent of all trade covered by world trade organisation rules it was a twenty first century agreement that included not just tariff reductions but also provisions to liberalise retail communications entertainment and financial services it would have strengthened labour and environmental standards established a new dispute resolution mechanism and created a framework for managing e commerce cyber security intellectual property rights data mobility and more when the us withdrew from the tpp many assumed the agreement was dead but the remaining signatories led by japanese prime minister shinzo abe quickly agreed on a replacement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp which retains around 200 of the tpp s 220 odd provisions the 20 that were left out were those for which the us pushed and can be reinstated should the country wish to join the pact at a later date now that the cptpp has entered into force australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam enjoy preferential access to each other s markets as tariffs are phased out us suppliers in those markets are finding themselves at a growing disadvantage while the japanese tariff on american beef imports has remained at 38 5 per cent the levy on beef from fellow cptpp countries has fallen to 27 5 per cent and eventually will reach just 9 per cent as a result american beef and wheat entering japan or any other cptpp country now face a higher tariff than beef and wheat from australia canada or new zealand still abe has worked hard to maintain good relations with the us taking much political heat at home for it japan was one of the few us trading partners not to retaliate when the trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and while affirming japan s preference for regional and multilateral arrangements abe has nonetheless agreed to bilateral bargaining with the us with a japanese parliamentary election coming this summer bilateral talks are not likely to go anywhere until later in the year when they do happen japan will benefit from having already entered into a free trade agreement fta with the european union as of this past february more than 90 per cent soon to be 97 per cent of eu exports to japan are duty free and after

china on friday accused u s officials of lying to the public about their trade war as rising tensions between the world s two largest economies kept financial markets in a state of unease talks to end the trade dispute collapsed earlier this month with the two sides in a stalemate over u s demands that china change its policies to address a number of key u s grievances including theft of intellectual property and subsidies for state enterprises washington has slapped higher tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods prompting beijing to retaliate and effectively banned u s firms from doing business with huawei technologies co the world s largest telecom network gear maker
washington dc not content with its trade war against china us president donald trump s administration has also opened bilateral trade negotiations with japan yet whatever trump hopes to achieve with japan it will be far less than what he threw away when he abandoned the trans pacific partnership tpp in early 2017 during the 2016 us presidential campaign trump promised americans that he would negotiate so many great deals on their behalf that they would get tired of winning now that he has imposed heavy costs on us farmers consumers and the overall economy through tariffs on chinese imports americans are probably growing quite tired indeed trump s withdrawal from the tpp is the canonical example of his trade policy recklessness signed in 2016 by the united states and 11 other pacific rim countries the treaty would have governed around 40 per cent of all trade covered by world trade organisation rules it was a twenty first century agreement that included not just tariff reductions but also provisions to liberalise retail communications entertainment and financial services it would have strengthened labour and environmental standards established a new dispute resolution mechanism and created a framework for managing e commerce cyber security intellectual property rights data mobility and more when the us withdrew from the tpp many assumed the agreement was dead but the remaining signatories led by japanese prime minister shinzo abe quickly agreed on a replacement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp which retains around 200 of the tpp s 220 odd provisions the 20 that were left out were those for which the us pushed and can be reinstated should the country wish to join the pact at a later date now that the cptpp has entered into force australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam enjoy preferential access to each other s markets as tariffs are phased out us suppliers in those markets are finding themselves at a growing disadvantage while the japanese tariff on american beef imports has remained at 38 5 per cent the levy on beef from fellow cptpp countries has fallen to 27 5 per cent and eventually will reach just 9 per cent as a result american beef and wheat entering japan or any other cptpp country now face a higher tariff than beef and wheat from australia canada or new zealand still abe has worked hard to maintain good relations with the us taking much political heat at home for it japan was one of the few us trading partners not to retaliate when the trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and while affirming japan s preference for regional and multilateral arrangements abe has nonetheless agreed to bilateral bargaining with the us with a japanese parliamentary election coming this summer bilateral talks are not likely to go anywhere until later in the year when they do happen japan will benefit from having already entered into a free trade agreement fta with the european union as of this past february more than 90 per cent soon to be 97 per cent of eu exports to japan are duty free and after a brief phase out period the same will apply to 85 per cent of agri food products while wine from the us faces a 15 per cent tariff wine from the eu as well as from cptpp countries such as chile now

home world business markets show they re finally waking up to global wall of worry photographer chris ratcliffe bloomberg may 25th 2019 13 06 pm 1005 views world business to the big time buysiders those investors more likely to check their portfolio by the season than the session it was just another week the s p 500 still shows a big green number for 2019 after all ditto the quants with their multiyear horizons and programmed strategies and hedge funds whose nerves have been on show for a while now but for a host of investors traders and analysts this was the week markets finally woke up to a world of hurt president donald trump lit the touchpaper days before signing an order effectively curbing huawei technologies co s access to the american market the reaction was slow burn but by monday u s stocks were extending declines as major chipmakers prepared to cease business with the chinese giant tuesday s respite thanks to a partial walk back of the ban was brief by wednesday more companies were in trump s sights and more losses ensued thursday was a sea of red as the asian nation hardened its own rhetoric friday s bounce wasn t enough to prevent a fifth straight weekly drop for the dow jones industrial average the longest slump since 2011 the move against huawei a metaphorical hand grenade in the heart of global tech has forced market participants to ditch the rose tinted glasses now that they have not only does the prospect of a prolonged trade war confront them but a heap of other stuff too simmering tensions in the middle east a looming change in the u k government impeachment clamor in washington some familiar flash points in emerging markets that s an awful lot of risk at a time when many assets still look relatively expensive the market needed an excuse to correct and the trade war headlines were the trigger but the underlying weakness is much more complex than that said alberto tocchio the chief of heron asset management a switzerland based family office with 2 5 billion swiss francs 2 5 billion under management a continuous deterioration of the macro environment high valuations and political geopolitical uncertainty are also importantly weighing on markets viewed from afar the u s stock picture doesn t look bad the s p 500 is about 4 from a record peak still up 13 in 2019 and price swings as measured by the cboe volatility index are higher than a month ago but still at about the one year average but look closer and the flaws and imperfections become clearer and the biggest blemish is arguably the tech sector the philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index dropped 6 this week on track for the worst month since the financial crisis the nasdaq 100 index is off almost 7 from its all time peak at the start of the month a gauge of the fangs facebook inc amazon com inc netflix inc and alphabet inc has fallen faster still that s all vital because the phenomenal performance of tech shares has underpinned the decade long bull market from trough to peak the nasdaq 100 gained about twice as much as the s p 500 tech communications and consumer discretionary look to me to be the three areas to avoid now said david holohan head of equity strategy at mediolanum asset management in dublin the outlook has certainly deteriorated because of supply chain worries particularly on the semiconductor side and they re only going to get worse nor is the pain limited to american shares the three biggest stocks on the msci emerging markets index tencent holdings ltd alibaba group holding ltd and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co are having a miserable month the developing world is another of those ugly marks in global markets just now alongside a crisis of confidence for foreign investors in turkey rhetoric between the u s and iran has been ratcheting up money has been fleeing the most actively traded emerging market etf the doubts about tech have fed into a broader pessimism on wall street short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on the largest s p 500 etf jumped as high as 7 this week according to data from ihs markit ltd that s the highest level since 2015 part of the trigger back then was the prospect of interest rates rising for the first time in almost a decade the federal reserve played its part in the market wake up call this week with minutes from the latest meeting showing policy

information net operating income a non gaap financial measure is defined as total revenues less rental expenses which excludes depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses acquisition related expenses asset management fees and interest expense net the company believes that net operating income serves as a useful supplement to net income because it allows investors and management to measure unlevered property level operating results and to compare operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of financial performance and accordingly the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results net operating income should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and data included on the company s quarterly report on form 10 q filed with the sec on may 15 2019 the following are reconciliations of net income attributable to common

company generates almost all of the net operating income from property operations in order to evaluate the overall portfolio management analyzes the net operating income of same store properties the company defines same store properties as operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar periods being compared and excludes properties under development by evaluating the property net operating income of the same store properties management is able to monitor the operations of the company s existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of the current portfolio and determine the effects of new acquisitions on net income the following table presents same store and non same store components of net operating income for the

445 1 net operating income 37 339 33 004 one of the company s objectives is to provide cash distributions to its stockholders from cash generated by the company s operations the purchase of real estate assets and real estate related investments and the corresponding expenses associated with that process is a key operational feature of the company s business plan in order to generate cash from operations due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit an industry trade group has promulgated a measure known as ffo which the company believes is an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a reit the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not equivalent to the company s net income as determined under gaap the company defines ffo consistent with nareit s definition as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write downs plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis the company along with others in the real estate industry consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance because it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and asset impairment write downs which the company believes provides a more complete understanding of its performance to investors and to its management and when compared year over year reflects the impact on the company s operations from trends in occupancy publicly registered non listed reits such as the company typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operations while other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years the company believes that publicly registered non listed reits like the company are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases the company will use cash flows from operations and debt financings to acquire real estate assets and real estate related investments and the company s board of directors will determine to pursue a liquidity event when it believes that the then current market conditions are favorable however the company s board of directors does not anticipate evaluating a liquidity event i e listing of its shares of common stock on a national securities exchange a sale the sale of all or substantially all of its assets or another similar transaction until five to seven years after the termination of the primary offering of the company s initial public offering which is generally comparable to other publicly registered non listed reits thus the company does not intend to continuously purchase real estate assets and intends to have a limited life due to these factors and other unique features of publicly registered non listed reits the institute for portfolio alternatives or the ipa has standardized a measure known as modified funds from operations or mffo which the company believes to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered non listed reit mffo is a metric used by management to evaluate sustainable performance and dividend policy mffo is not equivalent to the company s net income as determined under gaap the company defines mffo a non gaap measure consistent with the ipa s definition in its practice guideline ffo further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of gaap net income acquisition fees and expenses amounts related to straight line rental income and amortization of above and below intangible lease assets and liabilities accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments mark to market adjustments included in net income nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from or deconsolidation to equity accounting adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations where such adjustments have been included in the derivation of gaap net income and after adjustments for a consolidated and unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures with such adjustments calculated to reflect mffo on the same basis the company s mffo

this is an excerpt from regional security in the middle east sectors variables and issues get your free copy here science and technology enhance the capabilities of states and societies to obtain and transform resources necessary for their development and advancement on the other hand lack of scientific knowledge and access to technology not only affects a country s level of development but also jeopardises its national security in an anarchic international system security interdependence implies that the security of a state is closely tied to the security of the other states and especially its neighbours since national securities are interdependent the security or insecurity of a state may have a considerable impact not only on the security of its immediate neighbours but also on the security of the whole region in which it is geographically embedded regional security technology as a factor affecting national security is closely related to population growth the greater the population growth and the greater the pace of the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood its activities and interests beyond its borders will expand the greater the demographic growth and the less rapid the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood it will face significant socio economic problems and instability choucri 2002 98 in other words unevenness in the interactive growth and development within and across the societies contributes to unevenness in the size development and capabilities of such societies to differential capabilities among them and to competitions conflicts and violence choucri 1984 as an engine of growth the potential of technology is still largely untapped in the middle east where states not only lack adequate skilled labour and capital but also use these factors less efficiently therefore the purpose of this chapter is to investigate the impact of science and technology on national and regional security in the middle east in doing so the chapter is divided into six sections the first section discusses the relationship between technology and development while the second section explores the relevance of science and technology to security drawing on a historical analysis the third section examines the reasons science and technology have not so far played an effective role in the development of middle eastern states and societies the next section identifies and discusses the instruments and patterns of technological development in the contemporary middle east the last section of the paper offers a sectoral analysis of the relationship between science and technology on the one hand and security national and regional in the middle east on the other the technology development relationship the commonly held view is that technology and development are strongly linked with development driven by technology and technology serving as a key indicator of national development in reality however technological change is often highly problematic with respect to its socio economic and environmental implications as it may exacerbate inequality uneven development ecological degradation and or social exclusion murphy 2017 1 a critical understanding of the drivers dynamics implications and geographically uneven distributions of technology and technological change is thus an important component of development studies and practice murphy 2017 1 generally speaking technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life society and the environment drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts engineering sciences and applied sciences in this sense technology is embedded deeply in social cultural economic and political systems due to its spatial diffusion technology has uneven geographies of use significance and impact murphy 2017 1 with respect to development technology is seen as an essential driver and determinant of socioeconomic cultural environmental and political change economically technology can increase national productivity through improvements to the efficiency of production and logistics while encouraging and enhancing innovation and knowledge creation alternatively technology can exacerbate socioeconomic differences and create uneven development within and between countries and regions culturally technology has a profound effect on the norms and identities that help to constitute particular social groups environmentally technology can contribute in significant ways to greener and more sustainable societies or exacerbate ecological degradation through intensified or expanded impacts locally and globally politically technology can have democratising effects e g the facebook revolutions in the middle east or it can facilitate enhanced forms of repression or surveillance by state authorities hanska 2016 32 science and technology are key drivers of development this is because technological and scientific revolutions and innovations underpin economic advances and contribute to improvements in health systems education and infrastructure thus developments in science and technology have profound effects on economic and social development apart from constituting a salient political issue access to and application of technology are critical to a country s development by the same token access to high quality education especially higher education is essential for the creation of scientific knowledge science and technology are the differentiating factors among countries separating those that are able to tackle poverty effectively by growing and developing their economies and those that are not the level of countries economic development depends to a large extent on their ability to grasp and apply insights from science and technology and use them creatively to promote technological advances developing countries need to invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers as well as to ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society moreover adopting appropriate technologies leads directly to higher productivity which is the key to growth creativity and technological innovation emerge naturally in societies that have large stocks and flows of knowledge in sharp contrast in societies with limited stocks of knowledge creative people feel constrained and migrate to other countries thereby causing brain drain to their own countries and societies such societies are prone to remain in poverty and dependency hence in the presence of many social economic and defence needs and demands access to quality education as well as the adoption and application of appropriate technologies do not only constitute a policy question but also a question of policy priorities moreover both of these questions are tied to a country s political development science technology and security it has been suggested stivachtis 2011 397 422 that development and security are interrelated indeed the end of the cold war allowed the identification of development with human security undp 1993 2 for instance the declaration on the right to development 1986 2 asserts that all human beings have a human right to development and that development has been consequently subdivided into several sectors such as political development economic development and socio cultural development in addition development and the environment are inextricably linked undp 1994 24 40 moreover it has been shown stivachtis 2011 414 that there is a close relationship between development sectors and security sectors in the sense that the absence or presence of development in a particular sector impacts security and vice versa for example political development is related to political security while economic development is related to economic security as a result lack of political development has the potential of enhancing political insecurity yet as in the case of security problems in one development sector may affect other development sectors and as an extension the corresponding security sectors for instance political underdevelopment may affect economic development and therefore a state s economic security this means that security and development can to a great extent be operationalised in the same way mittleman 1988 22 yet it has been argued stivachtis 2011 415 that national security becomes inextricably connected to national development this means that neither development can be achieved without security nor security without development one of the most important questions in the field of security and development studies is whether a particular security or development sector is so significant that policy priority should be given to it the expectation is that if problems threats in this sector are addressed this would have positive effects on the other sectors addressing this question political scientists stress the political prerequisites for economic development political order and stability implying the presence and function of viable institutions and enforceable rules almond and coleman 1960 almond and powell 1966 for example whether political instability in a country may result from the inability of the national government to promote economic development and create sustainable and effective welfare mechanisms or from its inability to manage social and political change in a period of rapid economic growth political development appears to be fundamental as far as the last point is concerned the record contradicts the conventional wisdom that the way to avoid political instability is to stimulate economic development and industrialisation olsen 1963 empirical research shows that whatever the long term benefits of modernisation its short term impact tends to be more instability and sometimes violence skocpol 1994 feierabend et al 1966 thus discussion about development has emphasised political development meaning the need to establish institutions capable of managing socio political tensions and preventing their escalation into violence that may threaten the security of the state and its citizens however since developing states have widely divergent social economic and political attributes this diversity implies the absence of a unique policy formula that could apply without distinction to any developing state development enhances state power and capabilities and enhances national security on the other hand security provides the fertile ground for development while any threats to security ultimately affect development underdevelopment on the other hand increases the vulnerability of the state thereby enhancing its insecurity science and technology are key drivers of development and therefore central not only to a country s socio economic development but also its national security science technology and development in the middle east a historical account over the centuries scientific and technological advances have repeatedly enabled foreign powers to interfere with the functioning of middle eastern economies as well as to undermine the security of the less advanced countries of the region this section will discuss some of the main technology related events that led to this situation which continues today following the rise of islam in the seventh century science and technology flourished in the islamic world to a far greater extent than in the west muslim rulers promoted the translation of greek philosophy and science and then encouraged further scientific exploration in numerous fields including mathematics astronomy medicine pharmacology optics chemistry and physics much of the knowledge developed by the muslims and transmitted to the europeans enabled europe to emerge from the dark ages into the renaissance saliba 2011 until the sixteenth century the arab world was connected by a unique system of trade and transport that unified its large population scattered over vast areas of land and sea the system sustained the economy of each arab state underpinned trade with europe and fed into the various international trading systems bahlan 1999 261 in fact the arabs had developed an effective transnational trading system which reached its peak in the eighth to sixteenth centuries and which was based on local technological inputs such as skilled merchants and caravan managers navigators with extensive geographic knowledge efficiently operated ports and trading emporia scientifically bred camels and seaworthy dhows bahlan 1999 262 trust and mutual dependence among closely knit social groups prevailed the socioeconomic support of the transport and trading system enhanced regional harmony and the stability of local communities the mechanics of the arab trading system were so flexible that traders could move their business readily from place to place in response to changes in supply and demand or in order to avoid ruthless rulers or areas of conflict bahlan 1999 263 since trade brought prosperity and employment local governments sought to attract traders and provide security and support facilities to ease the process of trade and the life of the traveller the arab transport system was responsible for the large scale circulation of people and information this included the diffusion of agricultural products inventions and all types of knowledge thus the trade and transport system had a powerful economic social and cultural impact it also integrated the economies of arab countries with each other and with those of asia the mediterranean and africa according to antoine zahlan 1999 there are three main reasons middle eastern countries lag behind in terms of technology and scientific knowledge their loss of trade and transportation systems the effects of the industrial revolution on arab economies and the political and economic effects of the colonisation and neo colonisation processes the collapse of the arab trade and transport systems the collapse of the arab trade and transportation systems was induced by portuguese technological advances in ship design navigation and naval warfare guilmartin 1974 the strategic breakthrough was the invention of transoceanic ships these ships could carry a large number of guns and could navigate the high seas the arabs failed to acquire or develop the necessary technological capabilities to match portuguese naval vessels the small but powerful portuguese fleet interfered violently with trade between the arab world asia and africa guilmartin 1974 the portuguese used their superior naval force to harass and interfere with shipping attack coastal towns loot ships and pillage coastal towns ottoman technical assistance to the cities of the arabian peninsula ultimately saved the people of the arab coastal towns from outright massacre by the portuguese for the next three centuries the forces of the ottoman empire protected the region from european devastation however the ottomans themselves were unable to cope with european technological challenges and their empire eventually collapsed portugal s naval technology diffused to the european atlantic states by the early seventeenth century the british the dutch and the french had displaced the portuguese from the indian ocean between 1620 and 1670 these three countries introduced a new innovation the east india company which controlled fleets marketing systems finances storage space and armies platt 1977 while arab trade depended on the efforts of a very large number of traders operating in a small scale and each working on their own the east india company was centrally managed possessing the financial resources necessary to exercise monopolistic behaviour and thus control markets consequently the east india company quickly managed to eliminate arab long distance trade platt 1977 by the eighteenth century trade routes throughout the middle east were being reoriented toward coastal towns and european trade and transport whereas the arab international trading system had been heavily land based and internal the new system was heavily dependent on european shipping and trade bahlan 1996 264 this loss was soon followed by the progressive displacement of internal land based long distance travel services by european shipping no serious arab competition arose to challenge the rapid development of european mediterranean shipping firms headrick 1981 when in 1832 the french occupied algeria and later tunisia and morocco they sought to close all trans saharan routes which were being used by resistance movements and by clandestine trade bahlan 1999 265 thus by the early twentieth century the complex and rich system of internal trans saharan transport had been dismantled two further technological developments accelerated the dismantling of regional and local trade and transport systems the construction and operation of railway systems by foreign firms and the construction of the suez canal headrick 1981 by the latter part of the nineteenth century the national systems of trade and transport had disintegrated to the level where they were replaced by totally imported systems with very little local participation zahlan and zahlan 1978 the displacement of camel based transport technology with railway and steamship technologies without the transfer of mechanical and new naval technologies meant that the arabs lost the employment generated by operating their system of transport headrick 1981 even today arab countries remain unable to acquire the employment derived from operating and maintaining their extensive transport systems the strength of the arab and muslim worlds was based on a common market and not on political unity although many arab countries were in conflict this did not eliminate trade and cultural exchanges between them but as the arabs were unable to acquire adopt or develop alternative technologies to contain technological challenges which eventually led to the collapse of the transnational arab trading system the forces that bound the arab communities to each other were loosened and the cohesiveness of the arab world began to weaken industrial revolution the second phase of technology dismantling was induced by the industrial revolution which undermined the traditional textile industries that were firmly based in arab countries steam power machine production chemical sciences and technology electrification petroleum production and refining communication technologies radio electric power and engineering and countless advances in medical science construction technologies city planning and management systems all had dramatic consequences for the arab world every technological advance in europe contributed to the continuing decline of inter arab cohesiveness zahlan and zahaln 1997 the acquisition of western military technologies beginning with the ottomans and muhammad ali led to the progressive divorce of military institutions from their local environment and to their progressive integration into the military industrial intelligence complexes of western powers new technology was imported in a dependent mode and packaged with its consultants contractors operators and financiers and without any effort being made to develop new technologies at home zahlan and zahlan 1991 the cost of this dependency was enormous as were the resulting economic and political consequences of the egyptian and ottoman debts the occupation of egypt in 1882 and the collapse of the economy of the ottoman empire colonisation and independence the third phase of technology dismantling began with the direct occupation of arab countries when practically every single important decision was made by the emissaries of the colonial powers colonialism affected all aspects of life in the middle east the net result was the further divorce of the elites the culture and the economy of the region from technical matters zahlan 1999 267 the fourth phase was induced by political independence when independence was achieved the rulers and elites of the new states had little knowledge of contemporary developments in science and technology which had become so central to the industrialised world in the late twentieth century not only did all equipment industrial supplies and maintenance services have to be imported but also arab countries depended completely on foreign consulting and contracting services helie 1973 the new leaders sought to develop their countries through the rapid expansion of educational systems and investment in new industries cultural distortions and alienation were intensified by the accelerated programs adopted at this time beblawi and luciani 1987 because they wished to accelerate the process of development the new national elites unknowingly adopted methods that ultimately led to even greater technological dependence as a result foreign consulting firms conceived and designed enormous projects foreign accounting and law firms monitored them and an army of foreign contractors and foreign labour implemented them zahlan and zahlan 1978 although major things were built such as power and desalination plants hospitals irrigation schemes enormous dams transport systems and airports locals contributed little to the process beblawi and luciani 1987 however those who mediated these contracts earned enormous commissions and well placed people accumulated personal fortunes in the billions of dollars zahlan and zahlan 1984 meanwhile the gap between the arab world and industrial countries has continued to grow and arab economies still suffer from chronic stagnation and low productivity components and instruments of technology systems the major instruments of national technological development are university education systems research and development r d national consulting and contracting firms relevant economic and financial institutions to support technological development and science policy zahlan 1996 269 there has been a significant and dramatic expansion of the proportion of people in the middle east who have completed four or more years of higher education the number of universities has also increased including a significant number of foreign universities kjerfve 2014 yet the quality of higher education in the middle east is among the lowest in the world only two or three arab universities are in the list of the top 500 universities in the world and none is in the top 200 employers in the region complain that university graduates lack the skills needed to work in the global marketplace many are not well trained in science mathematics engineering and other technical subjects where the jobs are furthermore these graduates lack the soft skills including creativity and teamwork partly because their training has emphasised memorisation and rote learning devarajan 2016 much of the emphasis of arab foreign education has been in science and engineering qasem 1998 doctoral level knowledge producing education however is still highly underdeveloped in the region and therefore specialisation is pursued abroad dini et al 2015 arab universities have been the leading centres for both basic and applied research in science and technology the number of professors in arab universities has increased with the majority of them associated with science and technology zahlan 2012 the number of research and development centres also increased with half of them engaging in research in agriculture nutrition water and irrigation marine sciences and the biological science the rest focus on oil and petrochemicals ecology basic sciences and computer science lightfoot 2018 research activity in arab countries is thus highly focused on applied subjects with a priority in medicine and agriculture despite the valiant efforts of a number of scientists basic research is on such a small scale that it is virtually non existent zahlan 2012 r d organisations play a major role in successful planning design and operation of economic installations however because the consulting and contracting services utilised in establishing industrial plants are generally imported on a turnkey basis the demand for local r d services is still limited sehnaoui 2017 technological dependence severely constrains the development of the requisite r d capabilities to support and service the various economic sectors zahlan 2014 arab science and technology related human resources are more than adequate and could in principle constitute an integrative social factor but in the absence of rational and appropriate science policies and adequate financial resources the potential of this human resource is dissipated zahlan 2012 the reason for such a low figure is the lack of resources and the absence of demand for services by nationals both the public and private sectors depend nearly exclusively on foreign firms for technical services zahlan 2014 arab countries are near the top of the developing world level of activity but far below the levels of industrial countries thus although the output may be comparable the application of scientific findings is more constrained than in other large developing countries where there are no political or economic barriers to the circulation of ideas and expertise segal 2018 the arab world provides a large market for technology products and services this can be seen from the large number of identical contracts for the same technology that are awarded repeatedly over short periods of time in a number of technological fields such a market provides excellent opportunities for technology transfer because technology is best acquired as part of the repeated undertaking of similar projects zahlan 2012 the absence of adequate financial and insurance services to support national consulting and contracting firms combined with the absence of adequate technology policies are the main reasons for the slow pace at which technology trickles into the region zahlan 1984 contracts with foreign consulting and contracting firms are in agricultural development construction transport systems industry educational technologies aviation communication and so on emery et al 1986 zahlan and zahlan 1991 since the national markets for sophisticated technological services of each arab state are small any serious effort to transfer technology has to involve substantial arab economic cooperation there has been no significant effort to date to implement inter arab cooperation in technology moreover the subject of technology transfer to the arab world has become synonymous with trade emery et al 1986 ilgen and pempel 1987 in this type of analysis arabs are not seen as participant in a process of technological development the main focus of this approach is on the suppliers of technology rather than the consumers in addition emphasis is often placed on the competition among the various industrial powers for the lucrative arab markets the behaviour of the arab trading parties tends to be of minor interest this is mainly due to the fact that much of the planning and decision making is done by foreign institutions the leading arab development institutions as well as the arab governments utilise foreign consulting firms almost exclusively zahlan 2014 in the presence of foreign skills and know how the construction of petrochemical plants refineries and water desalination plants is well within the capabilities of arab organisations arab firms lack neither the technical expertise nor the natural financial or human resources to undertake such projects what is missing is a variety of other inputs such as financial legal and technical support services that arab governments do not make available to their national organisations finally the weakness of arab science and technology systems in conjunction with the absence of effective science policies in the arab world have made the economic integration of technological activity very difficult zahlan and zahlan 1980 the inability to formulate and adopt sensible technology policies has contributed to the continuing disintegration of arab society and culture beblawi and luciani 1987 27 unemployment alienation marginalisation and the intensification of civil unrest and violence are all direct or indirect indicators of the absence of an integrated science policy and of the impact of that absence on the economic life of the arab world bizri 2017 science technology and security sectors in the military sector the referent object of security is mainly the state military action usually threatens the state s physical base territory and population and institutions buzan 1991 116 117 the relevance of science and technology to military security is highlighted by the need of states to produce weapons systems necessary for national defence it is not by accident that due to current conflicts in the region the major focus of many middle eastern states is access to military related technologies states that have the necessary technology to produce their own weapons systems find themselves in a better position than those that have to import weapons this is not only for economic reasons i e impact on trade balance but also because they can be less politically dependent on weapon supply countries when it comes to achieving military self reliance in the middle east technology transfer and the expansion of local production for international export are common objectives of regional countries singer 2009 indeed in their contacts with the major western producers of military equipment some middle eastern states have made it clear that if western providers of military equipment want to work with local arab companies they will have to transfer their technical knowledge to the ones that are part of a rising indigenous defence sector mouchantaf 2018 however some analysts are sceptical of this attitude because regional states lack the capability to absorb military technology not only due to the shortage of nationals in the defence industry but also because of the limited access to science engineering and mathematics graduates mouchantaf 2018 in the political sector the referent object of security can be the government or the citizens threats may arise as a result of peoples dissatisfaction with governmental policies or from the attempts of governments to exercise tight control over their citizens in their effort to maintain power surveillance and other control related technologies in the hands of governments such as control over the mass media and press show the relevance of technology to political security on the other hand the recent arab uprisings demonstrated that communication technologies such as the internet facebook and cell phones can be effectively used to organise and coordinate popular resistance to the government berman 2017 specifically although text messaging was used extensively in the arab spring it had a limited effect and did not lead to direct political change brown 2012 as a tool it helped individuals to communicate and coordinate but this impact was indirect satellite tv also had more subtle and varying effects what made the big difference was the use of cell phones which provided a ubiquitous image and video capture device ellis 2011 anyone possessing a cell phone could document and transmit footage instantly without camera phones the only actors capable of documenting the 2011 uprisings would have been professional journalists whose coverage is usually lacking in dynamic situations such as the arab spring cell phone technology also helped to include citizens who were watching events unfold as they were seeing video and images captured by regular citizens this mobilised individuals who felt like they too could take part in the protests and have a political voice social media and the internet also had a significant impact on the outcome of the arab uprisings as they offered the protestors a space to express and develop political viewpoints unhindered by regimes this is because social networking sites like facebook have structural features that promote participation and mobilisation hanska 2016 29 30 on the other hand the arab spring demonstrated that it is quite dangerous to be friends with regime critics on facebook for example the syrian electronic army sea was established to wage online war against assad opponents as a result sea has attacked domestic sites as well as international targets such as the associated press twitter account ellis 2011 technology however has a long history of being used in revolutionary movements in the middle east for example during the iranian revolution ayatollah khomeini produced and distributed tapes of sermons denouncing the shah helping to grow dissent in the country parallels can also be drawn with the cedar revolution of 2005 in lebanon where protests occurred after the lebanese prime minister was killed citizens demanded an investigation and the withdrawal of syrian troops from the country ellis 2011 a final aspect of the impact of the internet on the middle east conflicts involves the utilisation of social media for jihadist recruitment the phenomenon is particularly relevant in cases of so called self radicalisation where individuals succumb to the lure of extremist propaganda produced in middle east sites pulled into isis circles some cyber recruits carry out violent acts as lone wolves while others travel to the middle east in order to fight for the caliphate in the societal sector the referent object of security is collective identities such as religious or national identities buzan 1991 122 123 as in the political sector surveillance and other control related technologies can serve as instruments of power in the hands of governments that aim at controlling particular religious and ethnic groups this is the reason societal threats can be difficult to disentangle from political ones on the other hand targeted social groups may use communication technologies to raise support for their cause or invite external involvement for protection purposes in the economic sector national security issues can emerge involving linkages between economic capability on the one hand and military capability power and socio political stability on the other buzan 1991 126 due to its connection to economic development science and technology become central to economic considerations chambers 2015 ahmed 2018 moreover a state s military capability rests at least partly on the possession of an industrial base capable of supporting the armed forces the absence or the economic decline of basic industries can therefore raise questions about the ability of the state to support independent military production buzan and sen 1990 for example the desire of several middle eastern states to maintain or acquire production capability in key militarily related industries has inserted a national security requirement into the management of the national economy on the other hand the pursuit of military research and development has prevented some middle eastern states from investing in their civil economy yet when technology cannot support economic development economic threats may also enhance domestic instability the link between economic and political stability generates a set of questions about development which can easily be seen as national security issues for example some middle eastern states that are not efficient producers find themselves locked into a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment from which there is no obvious escape hence the governments of those states find themselves having to choose between investing in new technologies and knowledge creation at the expense of lowering the already very low living standards information and communication technologies ict constitute one of the fastest growing sectors in the middle east nevertheless most of the countries in the middle east have shown no signs of impending information revolutions irs the proliferation and ever more sophisticated employment of icts are critically dependent upon economic factors as well as the nature of the government and its role in ict development except for israel and turkey every other country in the region is deficient in necessary economic factors or government participation burkhart 2003 thus it has been argued that despite having high mobile penetration rates the middle east lags behind other areas in terms of technological advancement and regional states need to improve technology education and the regulatory framework saadi 2017 moreover governments need to address information related security vulnerabilities that threaten the operation of both the private and public sectors and impact national economies in the environmental sector science and technology become extremely relevant due to the need to have an efficient use of natural resources and to protect the environment the overall aridity of the middle east has motivated some of the richer countries to search for technological solutions to their water requirements through sustained investment in research they have become experts in water desalination water recycling and solar energy the region s oil poor countries however cannot afford such advanced technologies and remain dependent on more traditional water resources yet the need to secure access to water has led to the utilisation of construction related technology to create water dams unfortunately while these dams regulate the water flow to cropland generate vital electricity and supply potable water they also introduce environmental problems that have cast a shadow on their overall success since the region s major rivers no longer flood to produce natural fertilisers farmers downstream are forced to use massive amounts of artificial fertilisers which in turn pollute the regional rivers conclusion the technological dependence of arab countries has enhanced their vulnerability to outside interference and reduced their internal national integration national integration depends on economic exchanges within society dependent technology policies reduce such exchanges instead economic exchanges take place with foreign countries without involving the national population the counterpart of weak internal cohesiveness is a high degree of dependence on imports in general the extent of arab dependence on imports for all necessities of life is striking on the positive side middle eastern countries possess enormous human strategic and natural resources which if efficiently managed and put to effective use could induce a rapid economic change but those resources cannot be put to socioeconomic use because of the underdeveloped state of their national and regional institutions in other words socioeconomic development is difficult to achieve in the absence of an adequate level of political development this situation is a direct consequence of the strength and stability of the prevailing rentier political economy beblawi and luciani 1987 therefore middle east governments need to strengthen their political legal and institutional systems adopt a performance oriented political economy and introduce an appropriate science and technology policy today arab countries face three major challenges population pressures global increase of oil and gas sources and declining arab labour productivity mounting population pressures will decrease the resources available for undertaking economic reforms by the year 2050 an expected increase of some 400 million inhabitants will bring the total population to some 700 million half of these will be below the age of 18 this young population could be an important force for positive and creative change if provided with proper education and training the absence of appropriate technology policies however could transform this abundant and youthful population into a disruptive and destabilising force to this one may add the fact that the expanding number of gas and oil sources worldwide have combined to reduce arab income and increase the cost of imports in addition increasing labour productivity in the newly industrialising countries is reducing the attractiveness of arab countries for foreign direct investment most of the subcontracting to the arab states now is for low value added and low technology activities in other words internal and external factors are not favourable to promoting technological development in the middle east however it is imperative the future of any country is contingent on its capacity to produce the goods and services in demand the major tool in achieving this goal is science and technology the middle east has remained outside this competition because arab states have not sought to acquire the requisite political economy however people in the region retain the capacity to alter their future thus a positive response to global technological challenges would require the adoption of a successful program of technology transfer in order to narrow or close the technology gap technology transfer takes place over a substantial period of time and is a cumulative and systemic process transfer however involves changes in a country s political culture the legal system the economy social organisation and management to promote technological advances middle eastern governments should invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers and should ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society yet particular attention should be given to improving the investment climate which is crucial as are the right incentive structures to guide the allocation of resources and to encourage research and development successful countries have grown their ability to innovate by investing public funding to help finance research and development in critical areas the benefits to flow from technological revolution in an increasingly connected and knowledge intensive world will be seized by those countries that are sensitive and responsive to the rapidly changing environment and nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities those who succeed will make substantial advances in reducing poverty and inequality those who do not will face enormous internal insecurity and will transform themselves into a threat

this is an excerpt from regional security in the middle east sectors variables and issues get your free copy here science and technology enhance the capabilities of states and societies to obtain and transform resources necessary for their development and advancement on the other hand lack of scientific knowledge and access to technology not only affects a country s level of development but also jeopardises its national security in an anarchic international system security interdependence implies that the security of a state is closely tied to the security of the other states and especially its neighbours since national securities are interdependent the security or insecurity of a state may have a considerable impact not only on the security of its immediate neighbours but also on the security of the whole region in which it is geographically embedded regional security technology as a factor affecting national security is closely related to population growth the greater the population growth and the greater the pace of the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood its activities and interests beyond its borders will expand the greater the demographic growth and the less rapid the technological development of a country the greater the likelihood it will face significant socio economic problems and instability choucri 2002 98 in other words unevenness in the interactive growth and development within and across the societies contributes to unevenness in the size development and capabilities of such societies to differential capabilities among them and to competitions conflicts and violence choucri 1984 as an engine of growth the potential of technology is still largely untapped in the middle east where states not only lack adequate skilled labour and capital but also use these factors less efficiently therefore the purpose of this chapter is to investigate the impact of science and technology on national and regional security in the middle east in doing so the chapter is divided into six sections the first section discusses the relationship between technology and development while the second section explores the relevance of science and technology to security drawing on a historical analysis the third section examines the reasons science and technology have not so far played an effective role in the development of middle eastern states and societies the next section identifies and discusses the instruments and patterns of technological development in the contemporary middle east the last section of the paper offers a sectoral analysis of the relationship between science and technology on the one hand and security national and regional in the middle east on the other the technology development relationship the commonly held view is that technology and development are strongly linked with development driven by technology and technology serving as a key indicator of national development in reality however technological change is often highly problematic with respect to its socio economic and environmental implications as it may exacerbate inequality uneven development ecological degradation and or social exclusion murphy 2017 1 a critical understanding of the drivers dynamics implications and geographically uneven distributions of technology and technological change is thus an important component of development studies and practice murphy 2017 1 generally speaking technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life society and the environment drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts engineering sciences and applied sciences in this sense technology is embedded deeply in social cultural economic and political systems due to its spatial diffusion technology has uneven geographies of use significance and impact murphy 2017 1 with respect to development technology is seen as an essential driver and determinant of socioeconomic cultural environmental and political change economically technology can increase national productivity through improvements to the efficiency of production and logistics while encouraging and enhancing innovation and knowledge creation alternatively technology can exacerbate socioeconomic differences and create uneven development within and between countries and regions culturally technology has a profound effect on the norms and identities that help to constitute particular social groups environmentally technology can contribute in significant ways to greener and more sustainable societies or exacerbate ecological degradation through intensified or expanded impacts locally and globally politically technology can have democratising effects e g the facebook revolutions in the middle east or it can facilitate enhanced forms of repression or surveillance by state authorities hanska 2016 32 science and technology are key drivers of development this is because technological and scientific revolutions and innovations underpin economic advances and contribute to improvements in health systems education and infrastructure thus developments in science and technology have profound effects on economic and social development apart from constituting a salient political issue access to and application of technology are critical to a country s development by the same token access to high quality education especially higher education is essential for the creation of scientific knowledge science and technology are the differentiating factors among countries separating those that are able to tackle poverty effectively by growing and developing their economies and those that are not the level of countries economic development depends to a large extent on their ability to grasp and apply insights from science and technology and use them creatively to promote technological advances developing countries need to invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers as well as to ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society moreover adopting appropriate technologies leads directly to higher productivity which is the key to growth creativity and technological innovation emerge naturally in societies that have large stocks and flows of knowledge in sharp contrast in societies with limited stocks of knowledge creative people feel constrained and migrate to other countries thereby causing brain drain to their own countries and societies such societies are prone to remain in poverty and dependency hence in the presence of many social economic and defence needs and demands access to quality education as well as the adoption and application of appropriate technologies do not only constitute a policy question but also a question of policy priorities moreover both of these questions are tied to a country s political development science technology and security it has been suggested stivachtis 2011 397 422 that development and security are interrelated indeed the end of the cold war allowed the identification of development with human security undp 1993 2 for instance the declaration on the right to development 1986 2 asserts that all human beings have a human right to development and that development has been consequently subdivided into several sectors such as political development economic development and socio cultural development in addition development and the environment are inextricably linked undp 1994 24 40 moreover it has been shown stivachtis 2011 414 that there is a close relationship between development sectors and security sectors in the sense that the absence or presence of development in a particular sector impacts security and vice versa for example political development is related to political security while economic development is related to economic security as a result lack of political development has the potential of enhancing political insecurity yet as in the case of security problems in one development sector may affect other development sectors and as an extension the corresponding security sectors for instance political underdevelopment may affect economic development and therefore a state s economic security this means that security and development can to a great extent be operationalised in the same way mittleman 1988 22 yet it has been argued stivachtis 2011 415 that national security becomes inextricably connected to national development this means that neither development can be achieved without security nor security without development one of the most important questions in the field of security and development studies is whether a particular security or development sector is so significant that policy priority should be given to it the expectation is that if problems threats in this sector are addressed this would have positive effects on the other sectors addressing this question political scientists stress the political prerequisites for economic development political order and stability implying the presence and function of viable institutions and enforceable rules almond and coleman 1960 almond and powell 1966 for example whether political instability in a country may result from the inability of the national government to promote economic development and create sustainable and effective welfare mechanisms or from its inability to manage social and political change in a period of rapid economic growth political development appears to be fundamental as far as the last point is concerned the record contradicts the conventional wisdom that the way to avoid political instability is to stimulate economic development and industrialisation olsen 1963 empirical research shows that whatever the long term benefits of modernisation its short term impact tends to be more instability and sometimes violence skocpol 1994 feierabend et al 1966 thus discussion about development has emphasised political development meaning the need to establish institutions capable of managing socio political tensions and preventing their escalation into violence that may threaten the security of the state and its citizens however since developing states have widely divergent social economic and political attributes this diversity implies the absence of a unique policy formula that could apply without distinction to any developing state development enhances state power and capabilities and enhances national security on the other hand security provides the fertile ground for development while any threats to security ultimately affect development underdevelopment on the other hand increases the vulnerability of the state thereby enhancing its insecurity science and technology are key drivers of development and therefore central not only to a country s socio economic development but also its national security science technology and development in the middle east a historical account over the centuries scientific and technological advances have repeatedly enabled foreign powers to interfere with the functioning of middle eastern economies as well as to undermine the security of the less advanced countries of the region this section will discuss some of the main technology related events that led to this situation which continues today following the rise of islam in the seventh century science and technology flourished in the islamic world to a far greater extent than in the west muslim rulers promoted the translation of greek philosophy and science and then encouraged further scientific exploration in numerous fields including mathematics astronomy medicine pharmacology optics chemistry and physics much of the knowledge developed by the muslims and transmitted to the europeans enabled europe to emerge from the dark ages into the renaissance saliba 2011 until the sixteenth century the arab world was connected by a unique system of trade and transport that unified its large population scattered over vast areas of land and sea the system sustained the economy of each arab state underpinned trade with europe and fed into the various international trading systems bahlan 1999 261 in fact the arabs had developed an effective transnational trading system which reached its peak in the eighth to sixteenth centuries and which was based on local technological inputs such as skilled merchants and caravan managers navigators with extensive geographic knowledge efficiently operated ports and trading emporia scientifically bred camels and seaworthy dhows bahlan 1999 262 trust and mutual dependence among closely knit social groups prevailed the socioeconomic support of the transport and trading system enhanced regional harmony and the stability of local communities the mechanics of the arab trading system were so flexible that traders could move their business readily from place to place in response to changes in supply and demand or in order to avoid ruthless rulers or areas of conflict bahlan 1999 263 since trade brought prosperity and employment local governments sought to attract traders and provide security and support facilities to ease the process of trade and the life of the traveller the arab transport system was responsible for the large scale circulation of people and information this included the diffusion of agricultural products inventions and all types of knowledge thus the trade and transport system had a powerful economic social and cultural impact it also integrated the economies of arab countries with each other and with those of asia the mediterranean and africa according to antoine zahlan 1999 there are three main reasons middle eastern countries lag behind in terms of technology and scientific knowledge their loss of trade and transportation systems the effects of the industrial revolution on arab economies and the political and economic effects of the colonisation and neo colonisation processes the collapse of the arab trade and transport systems the collapse of the arab trade and transportation systems was induced by portuguese technological advances in ship design navigation and naval warfare guilmartin 1974 the strategic breakthrough was the invention of transoceanic ships these ships could carry a large number of guns and could navigate the high seas the arabs failed to acquire or develop the necessary technological capabilities to match portuguese naval vessels the small but powerful portuguese fleet interfered violently with trade between the arab world asia and africa guilmartin 1974 the portuguese used their superior naval force to harass and interfere with shipping attack coastal towns loot ships and pillage coastal towns ottoman technical assistance to the cities of the arabian peninsula ultimately saved the people of the arab coastal towns from outright massacre by the portuguese for the next three centuries the forces of the ottoman empire protected the region from european devastation however the ottomans themselves were unable to cope with european technological challenges and their empire eventually collapsed portugal s naval technology diffused to the european atlantic states by the early seventeenth century the british the dutch and the french had displaced the portuguese from the indian ocean between 1620 and 1670 these three countries introduced a new innovation the east india company which controlled fleets marketing systems finances storage space and armies platt 1977 while arab trade depended on the efforts of a very large number of traders operating in a small scale and each working on their own the east india company was centrally managed possessing the financial resources necessary to exercise monopolistic behaviour and thus control markets consequently the east india company quickly managed to eliminate arab long distance trade platt 1977 by the eighteenth century trade routes throughout the middle east were being reoriented toward coastal towns and european trade and transport whereas the arab international trading system had been heavily land based and internal the new system was heavily dependent on european shipping and trade bahlan 1996 264 this loss was soon followed by the progressive displacement of internal land based long distance travel services by european shipping no serious arab competition arose to challenge the rapid development of european mediterranean shipping firms headrick 1981 when in 1832 the french occupied algeria and later tunisia and morocco they sought to close all trans saharan routes which were being used by resistance movements and by clandestine trade bahlan 1999 265 thus by the early twentieth century the complex and rich system of internal trans saharan transport had been dismantled two further technological developments accelerated the dismantling of regional and local trade and transport systems the construction and operation of railway systems by foreign firms and the construction of the suez canal headrick 1981 by the latter part of the nineteenth century the national systems of trade and transport had disintegrated to the level where they were replaced by totally imported systems with very little local participation zahlan and zahlan 1978 the displacement of camel based transport technology with railway and steamship technologies without the transfer of mechanical and new naval technologies meant that the arabs lost the employment generated by operating their system of transport headrick 1981 even today arab countries remain unable to acquire the employment derived from operating and maintaining their extensive transport systems the strength of the arab and muslim worlds was based on a common market and not on political unity although many arab countries were in conflict this did not eliminate trade and cultural exchanges between them but as the arabs were unable to acquire adopt or develop alternative technologies to contain technological challenges which eventually led to the collapse of the transnational arab trading system the forces that bound the arab communities to each other were loosened and the cohesiveness of the arab world began to weaken industrial revolution the second phase of technology dismantling was induced by the industrial revolution which undermined the traditional textile industries that were firmly based in arab countries steam power machine production chemical sciences and technology electrification petroleum production and refining communication technologies radio electric power and engineering and countless advances in medical science construction technologies city planning and management systems all had dramatic consequences for the arab world every technological advance in europe contributed to the continuing decline of inter arab cohesiveness zahlan and zahaln 1997 the acquisition of western military technologies beginning with the ottomans and muhammad ali led to the progressive divorce of military institutions from their local environment and to their progressive integration into the military industrial intelligence complexes of western powers new technology was imported in a dependent mode and packaged with its consultants contractors operators and financiers and without any effort being made to develop new technologies at home zahlan and zahlan 1991 the cost of this dependency was enormous as were the resulting economic and political consequences of the egyptian and ottoman debts the occupation of egypt in 1882 and the collapse of the economy of the ottoman empire colonisation and independence the third phase of technology dismantling began with the direct occupation of arab countries when practically every single important decision was made by the emissaries of the colonial powers colonialism affected all aspects of life in the middle east the net result was the further divorce of the elites the culture and the economy of the region from technical matters zahlan 1999 267 the fourth phase was induced by political independence when independence was achieved the rulers and elites of the new states had little knowledge of contemporary developments in science and technology which had become so central to the industrialised world in the late twentieth century not only did all equipment industrial supplies and maintenance services have to be imported but also arab countries depended completely on foreign consulting and contracting services helie 1973 the new leaders sought to develop their countries through the rapid expansion of educational systems and investment in new industries cultural distortions and alienation were intensified by the accelerated programs adopted at this time beblawi and luciani 1987 because they wished to accelerate the process of development the new national elites unknowingly adopted methods that ultimately led to even greater technological dependence as a result foreign consulting firms conceived and designed enormous projects foreign accounting and law firms monitored them and an army of foreign contractors and foreign labour implemented them zahlan and zahlan 1978 although major things were built such as power and desalination plants hospitals irrigation schemes enormous dams transport systems and airports locals contributed little to the process beblawi and luciani 1987 however those who mediated these contracts earned enormous commissions and well placed people accumulated personal fortunes in the billions of dollars zahlan and zahlan 1984 meanwhile the gap between the arab world and industrial countries has continued to grow and arab economies still suffer from chronic stagnation and low productivity components and instruments of technology systems the major instruments of national technological development are university education systems research and development r d national consulting and contracting firms relevant economic and financial institutions to support technological development and science policy zahlan 1996 269 there has been a significant and dramatic expansion of the proportion of people in the middle east who have completed four or more years of higher education the number of universities has also increased including a significant number of foreign universities kjerfve 2014 yet the quality of higher education in the middle east is among the lowest in the world only two or three arab universities are in the list of the top 500 universities in the world and none is in the top 200 employers in the region complain that university graduates lack the skills needed to work in the global marketplace many are not well trained in science mathematics engineering and other technical subjects where the jobs are furthermore these graduates lack the soft skills including creativity and teamwork partly because their training has emphasised memorisation and rote learning devarajan 2016 much of the emphasis of arab foreign education has been in science and engineering qasem 1998 doctoral level knowledge producing education however is still highly underdeveloped in the region and therefore specialisation is pursued abroad dini et al 2015 arab universities have been the leading centres for both basic and applied research in science and technology the number of professors in arab universities has increased with the majority of them associated with science and technology zahlan 2012 the number of research and development centres also increased with half of them engaging in research in agriculture nutrition water and irrigation marine sciences and the biological science the rest focus on oil and petrochemicals ecology basic sciences and computer science lightfoot 2018 research activity in arab countries is thus highly focused on applied subjects with a priority in medicine and agriculture despite the valiant efforts of a number of scientists basic research is on such a small scale that it is virtually non existent zahlan 2012 r d organisations play a major role in successful planning design and operation of economic installations however because the consulting and contracting services utilised in establishing industrial plants are generally imported on a turnkey basis the demand for local r d services is still limited sehnaoui 2017 technological dependence severely constrains the development of the requisite r d capabilities to support and service the various economic sectors zahlan 2014 arab science and technology related human resources are more than adequate and could in principle constitute an integrative social factor but in the absence of rational and appropriate science policies and adequate financial resources the potential of this human resource is dissipated zahlan 2012 the reason for such a low figure is the lack of resources and the absence of demand for services by nationals both the public and private sectors depend nearly exclusively on foreign firms for technical services zahlan 2014 arab countries are near the top of the developing world level of activity but far below the levels of industrial countries thus although the output may be comparable the application of scientific findings is more constrained than in other large developing countries where there are no political or economic barriers to the circulation of ideas and expertise segal 2018 the arab world provides a large market for technology products and services this can be seen from the large number of identical contracts for the same technology that are awarded repeatedly over short periods of time in a number of technological fields such a market provides excellent opportunities for technology transfer because technology is best acquired as part of the repeated undertaking of similar projects zahlan 2012 the absence of adequate financial and insurance services to support national consulting and contracting firms combined with the absence of adequate technology policies are the main reasons for the slow pace at which technology trickles into the region zahlan 1984 contracts with foreign consulting and contracting firms are in agricultural development construction transport systems industry educational technologies aviation communication and so on emery et al 1986 zahlan and zahlan 1991 since the national markets for sophisticated technological services of each arab state are small any serious effort to transfer technology has to involve substantial arab economic cooperation there has been no significant effort to date to implement inter arab cooperation in technology moreover the subject of technology transfer to the arab world has become synonymous with trade emery et al 1986 ilgen and pempel 1987 in this type of analysis arabs are not seen as participant in a process of technological development the main focus of this approach is on the suppliers of technology rather than the consumers in addition emphasis is often placed on the competition among the various industrial powers for the lucrative arab markets the behaviour of the arab trading parties tends to be of minor interest this is mainly due to the fact that much of the planning and decision making is done by foreign institutions the leading arab development institutions as well as the arab governments utilise foreign consulting firms almost exclusively zahlan 2014 in the presence of foreign skills and know how the construction of petrochemical plants refineries and water desalination plants is well within the capabilities of arab organisations arab firms lack neither the technical expertise nor the natural financial or human resources to undertake such projects what is missing is a variety of other inputs such as financial legal and technical support services that arab governments do not make available to their national organisations finally the weakness of arab science and technology systems in conjunction with the absence of effective science policies in the arab world have made the economic integration of technological activity very difficult zahlan and zahlan 1980 the inability to formulate and adopt sensible technology policies has contributed to the continuing disintegration of arab society and culture beblawi and luciani 1987 27 unemployment alienation marginalisation and the intensification of civil unrest and violence are all direct or indirect indicators of the absence of an integrated science policy and of the impact of that absence on the economic life of the arab world bizri 2017 science technology and security sectors in the military sector the referent object of security is mainly the state military action usually threatens the state s physical base territory and population and institutions buzan 1991 116 117 the relevance of science and technology to military security is highlighted by the need of states to produce weapons systems necessary for national defence it is not by accident that due to current conflicts in the region the major focus of many middle eastern states is access to military related technologies states that have the necessary technology to produce their own weapons systems find themselves in a better position than those that have to import weapons this is not only for economic reasons i e impact on trade balance but also because they can be less politically dependent on weapon supply countries when it comes to achieving military self reliance in the middle east technology transfer and the expansion of local production for international export are common objectives of regional countries singer 2009 indeed in their contacts with the major western producers of military equipment some middle eastern states have made it clear that if western providers of military equipment want to work with local arab companies they will have to transfer their technical knowledge to the ones that are part of a rising indigenous defence sector mouchantaf 2018 however some analysts are sceptical of this attitude because regional states lack the capability to absorb military technology not only due to the shortage of nationals in the defence industry but also because of the limited access to science engineering and mathematics graduates mouchantaf 2018 in the political sector the referent object of security can be the government or the citizens threats may arise as a result of peoples dissatisfaction with governmental policies or from the attempts of governments to exercise tight control over their citizens in their effort to maintain power surveillance and other control related technologies in the hands of governments such as control over the mass media and press show the relevance of technology to political security on the other hand the recent arab uprisings demonstrated that communication technologies such as the internet facebook and cell phones can be effectively used to organise and coordinate popular resistance to the government berman 2017 specifically although text messaging was used extensively in the arab spring it had a limited effect and did not lead to direct political change brown 2012 as a tool it helped individuals to communicate and coordinate but this impact was indirect satellite tv also had more subtle and varying effects what made the big difference was the use of cell phones which provided a ubiquitous image and video capture device ellis 2011 anyone possessing a cell phone could document and transmit footage instantly without camera phones the only actors capable of documenting the 2011 uprisings would have been professional journalists whose coverage is usually lacking in dynamic situations such as the arab spring cell phone technology also helped to include citizens who were watching events unfold as they were seeing video and images captured by regular citizens this mobilised individuals who felt like they too could take part in the protests and have a political voice social media and the internet also had a significant impact on the outcome of the arab uprisings as they offered the protestors a space to express and develop political viewpoints unhindered by regimes this is because social networking sites like facebook have structural features that promote participation and mobilisation hanska 2016 29 30 on the other hand the arab spring demonstrated that it is quite dangerous to be friends with regime critics on facebook for example the syrian electronic army sea was established to wage online war against assad opponents as a result sea has attacked domestic sites as well as international targets such as the associated press twitter account ellis 2011 technology however has a long history of being used in revolutionary movements in the middle east for example during the iranian revolution ayatollah khomeini produced and distributed tapes of sermons denouncing the shah helping to grow dissent in the country parallels can also be drawn with the cedar revolution of 2005 in lebanon where protests occurred after the lebanese prime minister was killed citizens demanded an investigation and the withdrawal of syrian troops from the country ellis 2011 a final aspect of the impact of the internet on the middle east conflicts involves the utilisation of social media for jihadist recruitment the phenomenon is particularly relevant in cases of so called self radicalisation where individuals succumb to the lure of extremist propaganda produced in middle east sites pulled into isis circles some cyber recruits carry out violent acts as lone wolves while others travel to the middle east in order to fight for the caliphate in the societal sector the referent object of security is collective identities such as religious or national identities buzan 1991 122 123 as in the political sector surveillance and other control related technologies can serve as instruments of power in the hands of governments that aim at controlling particular religious and ethnic groups this is the reason societal threats can be difficult to disentangle from political ones on the other hand targeted social groups may use communication technologies to raise support for their cause or invite external involvement for protection purposes in the economic sector national security issues can emerge involving linkages between economic capability on the one hand and military capability power and socio political stability on the other buzan 1991 126 due to its connection to economic development science and technology become central to economic considerations chambers 2015 ahmed 2018 moreover a state s military capability rests at least partly on the possession of an industrial base capable of supporting the armed forces the absence or the economic decline of basic industries can therefore raise questions about the ability of the state to support independent military production buzan and sen 1990 for example the desire of several middle eastern states to maintain or acquire production capability in key militarily related industries has inserted a national security requirement into the management of the national economy on the other hand the pursuit of military research and development has prevented some middle eastern states from investing in their civil economy yet when technology cannot support economic development economic threats may also enhance domestic instability the link between economic and political stability generates a set of questions about development which can easily be seen as national security issues for example some middle eastern states that are not efficient producers find themselves locked into a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment from which there is no obvious escape hence the governments of those states find themselves having to choose between investing in new technologies and knowledge creation at the expense of lowering the already very low living standards information and communication technologies ict constitute one of the fastest growing sectors in the middle east nevertheless most of the countries in the middle east have shown no signs of impending information revolutions irs the proliferation and ever more sophisticated employment of icts are critically dependent upon economic factors as well as the nature of the government and its role in ict development except for israel and turkey every other country in the region is deficient in necessary economic factors or government participation burkhart 2003 thus it has been argued that despite having high mobile penetration rates the middle east lags behind other areas in terms of technological advancement and regional states need to improve technology education and the regulatory framework saadi 2017 moreover governments need to address information related security vulnerabilities that threaten the operation of both the private and public sectors and impact national economies in the environmental sector science and technology become extremely relevant due to the need to have an efficient use of natural resources and to protect the environment the overall aridity of the middle east has motivated some of the richer countries to search for technological solutions to their water requirements through sustained investment in research they have become experts in water desalination water recycling and solar energy the region s oil poor countries however cannot afford such advanced technologies and remain dependent on more traditional water resources yet the need to secure access to water has led to the utilisation of construction related technology to create water dams unfortunately while these dams regulate the water flow to cropland generate vital electricity and supply potable water they also introduce environmental problems that have cast a shadow on their overall success since the region s major rivers no longer flood to produce natural fertilisers farmers downstream are forced to use massive amounts of artificial fertilisers which in turn pollute the regional rivers conclusion the technological dependence of arab countries has enhanced their vulnerability to outside interference and reduced their internal national integration national integration depends on economic exchanges within society dependent technology policies reduce such exchanges instead economic exchanges take place with foreign countries without involving the national population the counterpart of weak internal cohesiveness is a high degree of dependence on imports in general the extent of arab dependence on imports for all necessities of life is striking on the positive side middle eastern countries possess enormous human strategic and natural resources which if efficiently managed and put to effective use could induce a rapid economic change but those resources cannot be put to socioeconomic use because of the underdeveloped state of their national and regional institutions in other words socioeconomic development is difficult to achieve in the absence of an adequate level of political development this situation is a direct consequence of the strength and stability of the prevailing rentier political economy beblawi and luciani 1987 therefore middle east governments need to strengthen their political legal and institutional systems adopt a performance oriented political economy and introduce an appropriate science and technology policy today arab countries face three major challenges population pressures global increase of oil and gas sources and declining arab labour productivity mounting population pressures will decrease the resources available for undertaking economic reforms by the year 2050 an expected increase of some 400 million inhabitants will bring the total population to some 700 million half of these will be below the age of 18 this young population could be an important force for positive and creative change if provided with proper education and training the absence of appropriate technology policies however could transform this abundant and youthful population into a disruptive and destabilising force to this one may add the fact that the expanding number of gas and oil sources worldwide have combined to reduce arab income and increase the cost of imports in addition increasing labour productivity in the newly industrialising countries is reducing the attractiveness of arab countries for foreign direct investment most of the subcontracting to the arab states now is for low value added and low technology activities in other words internal and external factors are not favourable to promoting technological development in the middle east however it is imperative the future of any country is contingent on its capacity to produce the goods and services in demand the major tool in achieving this goal is science and technology the middle east has remained outside this competition because arab states have not sought to acquire the requisite political economy however people in the region retain the capacity to alter their future thus a positive response to global technological challenges would require the adoption of a successful program of technology transfer in order to narrow or close the technology gap technology transfer takes place over a substantial period of time and is a cumulative and systemic process transfer however involves changes in a country s political culture the legal system the economy social organisation and management to promote technological advances middle eastern governments should invest in quality education for youth continuous skills training for workers and managers and should ensure that knowledge is shared as widely as possible across society yet particular attention should be given to improving the investment climate which is crucial as are the right incentive structures to guide the allocation of resources and to encourage research and development successful countries have grown their ability to innovate by investing public funding to help finance research and development in critical areas the benefits to flow from technological revolution in an increasingly connected and knowledge intensive world will be seized by those countries that are sensitive and responsive to the rapidly changing environment and nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities those who succeed will make substantial advances in reducing poverty and inequality those who do not will face enormous internal insecurity and will transform themselves into a threat

start to think twice before joining the campaign british columbia once promised a carbon tax dividend on its carbon tax but now keeps all the money in canada gasoline consumption has grown steadily over the past 40 years despite bouts of severe price increases that were equivalent to carbon taxes of up to 500 a tonne of all the myths surrounding a carbon tax the greatest is the foundational claim that an increase in the price of fossil fuels will lead to major reductions in carbon emissions thereby saving the world from the perils of climate change yale university s william nordhaus a 2018 nobel prize winner argues in the climate casino that a sharp price rise is needed to choke off growing carbon emissions gasoline price history in north america suggests the choke off theory is at least debatable and more likely unsupportable in the united states the price of gasoline soared more than 60 per cent to us 3 a gallon during the 1970s and went through another price burst to almost 4 a gallon in the early part of the 21st century increases of that magnitude up to 2 a gallon are equivalent to imposing a carbon tax of 160 a tonne but u s consumption of gasoline declined only

taxes don t produce dramatic cuts in demand is well known study after study has concluded that gasoline is dominated by what economists call price inelasticity people do not change their behaviour in the face of rising prices when the product is essential to their economic success there are some recent counter studies but it is clear that the market price theory is still highly theoretical numerous factors other than price are the real drivers of fossil fuel demand including economic recessions demographics driver behaviour vehicle fuel efficiencies better roads changing lifestyles living standards and technological change why do most economists tend to play down or even ignore price inelasticity nobel winner nordhaus argues for a global carbon tax but does not mention elasticity or inelasticity once in the 300 page text of the climate casino advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content price can have an impact but nothing on the scale suggested by carbon tax theorists who cite british columbia as a demonstration case of the effectiveness of carbon taxes again the evidence is murky at best even murkier today as the price of gasoline in vancouver hovers around 1 70 a litre up from 1 in 2015 that s equivalent to adding a 320 carbon tax gasoline consumption in b c has been declining but the 30 carbon tax impact equal to 8 9 cents at the pump today is at best a marginal factor compared with the pile of other taxes and costs built into the price of gasoline see graph another folly for canada to impose a carbon tax independently is a form of economic suicide if other trading partners in north america europe asia south america do not adopt similar carbon taxation the canadian economy will become increasingly uncompetitive so far no other country is joining the national carbon tax crusade australia just said no to one elsewhere carbon tax schemes are either weak or marginal even nordhaus the leading guru of carbon taxation was categorical that a carbon price will succeed only if most major countries sign an international carbon tax treaty under such a treaty member nations would impose tariffs on the goods of non members and use various enforcement mechanisms to promote compliance advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not

steel shoes cellphones fruits vegetables clothing petroleum products imported from non carbon tax countries an alternative trade proposal is to find a way to exempt certain canadian industries from the carbon tax so they would remain internationally competitive even nordhaus the leading guru of carbon taxation was categorical that a carbon price will succeed only if most major countries sign an international carbon tax treaty which leads us to another delusion a carbon tax is said to be a beautiful free market substitute for costly and inefficient regulation some economists used to say that carbon taxes were preferable because they left no room for planners on the contrary carbon control and pricing have become a bureaucratic paradise for central planners and economic control freaks in canada governments still plan to regulate coal out of existence electric vehicle mandates and quotas will be issued fuel consumption standards will be imposed on non electric vehicles carbon sequestration will be required for major industries alternative energy forms must be subsidized industrial emission standards will be regulated into existence by state planners although scores of exemptions will be needed advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content but there s another good reason to abandon carbon taxes which is that the whole market mechanism theory does not hold up carbon taxation in practice requires massive government intervention nationally and globally state planners must calculate and predict future climate scenarios under different carbon conditions then determine the acceptable volume of carbon emissions to be produced by industry and by product each country must be assigned national targets with that mostly speculative knowledge in hand planners must then determine which price of carbon will be effective in reducing emissions using models that pile more speculation on speculation what s the right price 50 a tonne 100 250 nobody has a clue because there is no way to calculate the effective price a standard central planning problem anybody who doubts the coming planning risk should read the report of the high level commission on carbon prices a seminal world bank paper that portrays a world tied up for the rest of the century in a bureaucratic carbon price nightmare the uncertainties around the carbon price trajectories that are consistent with a 2oc target imply that policies will have to involve experimentation be closely monitored over time and revised when they seem to fail that is do not reduce emissions enough or impose unacceptable costs e g threaten food security carbon tax schemes are not market based they are tax and control regimes unprecedented exercises in central planning that canada does not need and should not adopt until the rest of the world is on side carbon tax policy also rests on the dubious assumption that fossil fuels can be priced and regulated out of existence to make way for alternatives an

it s that same song and dance once again why have things gotten so bad that we need an imf bailout and who is to blame for it contradictory statements feeble excuses and a lot of finger pointing are rife the current government is blaming previous governments for squandering the country s wealth and the previous government blaming the current government for incompetence reminding them of the larger than life promises they made to the people there is enough blame to go around however ironically enough maybe for once neither side is entirely responsible for this crisis i don t want to absolve our leadership but there is more to it than what meets the eye let me focus on two things first the aspect of the current crisis that is global in nature and as such mostly out of control of the control of our government and secondly and more importantly what are some of the things that the government can do to stop the bleeding and move the country in the right direction pakistan once again finds itself in the middle of a global power struggle i frankly don t envy the officials attempting the very delicate and tricky balancing act to appease competing global powers there is a seismic shift in the global power structure that has been triggered by american president donald j trump his trade war with china has threatened to put the already slowing chinese economy in a tailspin it has put many of the ambitious infrastructure projects especially around the belt and roadway initiative on the back burner infrastructure spending on these projects has slowed down significantly over the past year due to various reasons including a shift in focus of the chinese government on the domestic economy to cushion the blows from the trade war this doesn t bode well for pakistan as a major recipient of these investments united states has seized this opportunity to achieve two primary objectives of the trump administration a negotiated withdrawal of u s forces from afghanistan and curtailing iran s influence in the region it will squeeze pakistan both politically and economically to cooperate in isolating iran and bringing the taliban to the negotiation table last but not the least the jingoism coming from india and re election of modi government doesn t bode well for pakistan and investor confidence things are grim on the international stage all of which have eroded investor confidence which may as well be a goodbye for fdi in the near future i am sure at this point most readers are thinking tell me something i don t know sherlock i know things are bad the question is how do we to fix it the answers to this question are not that easy however there are specific quick steps the government can take to put the country on the right footing pakistan is a country of 200 million with a gdp of 300 billion it is resource rich and has a large young population all the drivers needed to turn the economy around without a lot of fdi first create certainty by providing business owners with a clear path forward pass legislation that removes any uncertainty related to changes in laws regulation and the threat of dragging them in front of courts for past and current malpractices as it refers to minor offenses please give them a breather i e don t raze shops of small vendors or flip carts of street food vendors for not being officially licensed provide clarity on the devaluation of the currency that is sustainable and then hold on to it if the exchange rate needs to be pkr 200 per dollar then provide a specific timeline for the devaluation and stick to it it is not helpful for any business person to wake up every morning wondering how much the exchange rate will fluctuate that day and how the government will give many contradictory statements around exchange rates moreover please for the sake of sanity can we get all government officials to be on the same page and provide consistent responses provide talking points to all officials making public statements so that at least there is coherence in the messaging if you can t get your people to listen and believe your message then you will have a hard time making the population listen to it streamline and in many cases outrightly eliminate many of the regulations that are slowing business activity unless it is causing a mortal danger for the citizens freeze the regulation requirements make it easy for people to get appropriate permits and register a new business the goal should be to allow a person to be able to register and start a business in a matter of days from his her computer anyone who has dealt with bureaucracy in pakistan knows how difficult it is to do business for those who haven t according to the world bank pakistan ranks 136 out of 190 in terms of ease of doing business ironically pakistan is one of the lowest ranked countries when it comes to ease of paying taxes create incentives to businesses for hiring people especially small businesses but giving them tax breaks or easing for them permit and licensing processes i e opening bank accounts obtaining permits doing business in residential areas getting power connections etc this would have the added benefit of bringing these businesses and their employee payroll into the official economy provide civil servants written legal assurances maybe through act of parliament that the steps taken to streamline businesses and eliminate delays will be supported by the government and no punitive actions will be taken against them for circumventing un necessary red tape significantly increase the import duties on luxury and non essential items why we are importing 1billion of cell phones is unfathomable drastically increase import duties on cars this is where the public holds as much responsibility for this situation as the politicians pakistan needs to provide protection and incentives to domestic businesses from foreign competition and may i say whims of the people who have developed a peculiar taste for imported items while expanding the tax base is necessary and the amnesty schemes introduced are a good first step to move in the right direction there needs to be a two pronged approach to solve this problem first instead of creating uncertainty for small businesses when it comes to bringing them in the tax net take a slower approach the unofficial economy is the golden goose that keeps the economy going please don t kill it in haste to increase tax revenues as quickly as possible digitize the economy by creating incentives to move transactions from cash to electronic so that more of the unofficial economy is formalized this would allow the government to bring in more of the informal economy into tax net over the long run while at the same time removing inefficiencies from day to day business transactions leverage the infrastructure that has been built over the past decade to create opportunities for businesses for example create special economic zones on the cpec routes especially close to population centres and provide incentives to people to build storage staging facilities for imports and exports providing incentives to buy heavy transport vehicles to move goods and provide tax incentives to manufacturing companies who would be interested in manufacturing products on the route to easily access the ports chinese firms engaged in exports would be an ideal target for these incentives as it would allow them to circumvent the u s china trade war increase spending on port expansions and streamline port operations so that we can cut the time to get produce on ships for export spoilage due to delays is one of the big reason grains and produce from pakistan doesn t make it to the international markets this is by no means an exhaustive list of steps the government can take to get things on the right footing but a few quick and easy fixes for a long term solution as the first step pakistan needs to get some serious people to sit down and reassess the current mdtf and build a new five year plan similar to the ones that have been created since 1955 maybe some of the retired bureaucrats that have built some of the more effective plans in the past should be brought out of retirement along with experts today to create a plan that addresses long term challenges and lays down an achievable strategy for growth identify specific sectors and focus energies to develop those sectors industries rather than taking a shotgun approach and achieving nothing due to lack of focus and funds not every country needs to be the back office of global businesses like india focus on businesses that have traditionally provided growth such as textile and agriculture that while low value added to provide consistent growth and cash flow and then focus on a handful of leading edge sectors such as arts and entertainment robotics medicine genetics and defense production just pick a few and concentrate energies across the value chain for five years to put these sectors on a strong footing this would differentiate us from the pack and ensure that we are on the leading edge on some of the emerging sectors rather than behind the curve on everything importance of investment in education and healthcare can t be overstated one of the primary reasons for our problems is that none of our leaders have ever taken education seriously education doesn t win elections as it takes decades to educate people a new road can be built in months and will win the politician the next election which is why they focus on building roads if people voted for those who built schools and got higher pay for teachers maybe more politicians would focus on education this is especially relevant when it comes to higher education focus on quality and depth of research and higher education the number one complaint i have heard from foreign businesses trying to set up research or back office in pakistan is the abundance of candidates with university degrees yet a complete lack of basic underlying concepts and principals in their respective fields it seems too many students are good at passing exams but not understanding or applying the material increase the focus on specializations that are cutting edge such as genetics a i materials sciences etc rather than generating waves and waves mbas i assure you as an mba myself the world does not need a lot of mbas the challenges are many and the path forward is not without peril however i am hopeful for the future all we need to do is to stop searching for a silver bullet and instead pull ourselves up from the bootstraps
it s all to do with oil mate maori lament the legacy of british colonial tyranny their focus has been theft of land rather than being defeated by the musket australia s indigenous lament of british colonialism is not confined to loss of land but horrendous genocide fast forward from 19th century to 20th century and america emerged as the next ozymandias and the inevitable date with destiny demise but how can this colossus collapse succinctly shit happens if you ll excuse reversion to the vernacular for a moment as the trend in the above link foretells the 21st century looms as day of reckoning tdb recommends newzengine com it s all to do with oil mate religion is definitely the major cause of war over the centuries and today remains a massive contributor to murder in the name of righteousness but oil has taken stage as king of kings oil is to today s religion the petro dollar was negotiated by henry kissinger with the saudis shortly after nixon took the us off the gold standard the agreement stipulated that all saudi oil would be sold in us dollars commonly called petro dollar this creates a demand for us currency and hence keeps its value elevated as a result as the price of oil increases so does the demand for the us dollar the saudis in turn invested their petro dollars in us treasury notes in other words they purchased us debt this increased the money supply in the us and helped finance the consumption society that developed in the us and the demand for more imported goods especially from china in recent years collateral damage emerges in the form of us corporations using cheap labour in china which leads to rising unemployment in the us and a trade deficit us v china which precipitates the current war america can t win i e tariff war most international borrowing takes place in us dollars in third world countries whose currencies are inevitably weak their economies are very susceptible to any rise in the us dollar as their borrowing costs interest on loans increases with any increase in the us dollar the us dollar is also the world s reserve currency in which most trade between nations is settled this too creates the demand for the dollar and here we get to the nub of why so many wars where america is involved the value of the dollar is backed up by the us military might who have a history of challenging any nation that dares to challenge their reserve currency status oil trade underpins the above one can appreciate therefore that the us is keen to retain their current status as the world s reserve currency and go after anyone who challenges their position like gaddafi in libya and iran with the bric nations organising against the reserve status of the us dollar if they succeed in replacing it as the sole reserve currency the value of the us dollar will decline as there will be less demand this will import inflation into the us as the cost of goods to feed their consumption will increase in us dollar terms the problem that arises with the bric countries is that they include both china and russia who individually and indisputably together have the military might to challenge the us if they try to enforce the dollar s status as percy shelley once penned of ozymandias my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair nothing beside remains round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away

their behaviour in the face of rising prices when the product is essential to their economic success article content be it resolved that a carbon tax is the policy canada needs to fight climate change terence corcoran and andrew coyne go head to head on whether a carbon tax is the proper tool to fight climate change according to the oracles of carbon economics a carbon tax must be applauded because it is a market based tax that acts just like a market price which under the infallible economic laws of supply and demand will automatically produce reductions in carbon dioxide emissions more efficiently than regulations and other big government measures advertisement 2 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below this content is reserved for

bigger carbon tax imagine if a 20 carbon tax produces a refund of 307 then a 200 carbon tax will mean an annual tax refund of more than 3 000 this is known as the carbon tax and dividend plan

grown steadily over the past 40 years despite bouts of severe price increases that were equivalent to carbon taxes of up to 500 a tonne of all the myths surrounding a carbon tax the greatest is the foundational claim that an increase in the price of fossil fuels will lead to major reductions in carbon emissions thereby saving the world from the perils of climate change yale university s william nordhaus a 2018 nobel prize winner argues in the climate casino that a sharp price rise is needed to choke off growing carbon emissions gasoline price history in north america suggests the choke off theory is at least debatable and more likely unsupportable in the united states the price of gasoline soared more than 60 per cent to us 3 a gallon during the 1970s and went through another price burst to almost 4 a gallon in the early part of the 21st century increases of that magnitude up to 2 a gallon are equivalent to imposing a carbon tax of 160 a tonne but u s consumption of gasoline

inelasticity people do not change their behaviour in the face of rising prices when the product is essential to their economic success there are some recent counter studies but it is clear that the market price theory is still highly theoretical numerous factors other than price are the real drivers of fossil fuel demand including economic recessions demographics driver behaviour vehicle fuel

carbon taxes again the evidence is murky at best even murkier today as the price of gasoline in vancouver hovers around 1 70 a litre up from 1 in 2015 that s equivalent to adding a 320 carbon tax gasoline consumption in b c has been declining but the 30 carbon tax impact equal to 8 9 cents at the pump today is at best a marginal factor compared with the pile of other taxes and costs built into the price of gasoline see graph another folly for canada to impose a carbon tax independently is a form of economic suicide if other trading partners in north america europe asia south america do not adopt similar carbon taxation the canadian economy will become increasingly uncompetitive so far no other country is joining the national carbon tax crusade australia just said no to one elsewhere carbon tax schemes are either weak or marginal even nordhaus the leading guru of carbon taxation was categorical that a carbon price will succeed only if most major countries sign an international

with less than two months till the expiration of the contract for more than 20 000 teachers and paraprofessionals the chicago teachers union ctu is conspiring with the city s democratic party administration to impose a new round of austerity and attacks on public education the ctu has grown widely discredited among teachers having collaborated with former mayor rahm emanuel in the closures of dozens of schools laying off of thousands of teachers and support staff and expanding school privatization and charter school schemes the ctu has also colluded with the democrats in attacking teacher pay pensions and health care benefits since december the union has also shut down and betrayed a series of strikes by highly exploited charter school teachers on a national scale the ctu s parent union the american federation of teachers aft and the national education association nea have sabotaged one struggle after another in west virginia oklahoma arizona california washington and elsewhere the unions have made every effort to channel teachers anger and opposition behind support for the democratic party which under the obama administration spearheaded the attacks on education and continues to do so in several states and large urban school districts like los angeles new york city and chicago the ctu has been led over the last decade by the caucus of rank and file educators core former union president karen lewis and current union president jesse sharkey a leader of the now defunct international socialist organization in chicago and around the country core and its affiliates have institutionalized the use of hollow rhetoric about social justice and fighting for the schools our children deserve to cover up the unions role as the chief prop of the democratic party and enforcer of its austerity program aware and fearful of the rising tide teacher militancy and strike actions in the us and globally the ctu and the aft are now working out plans in secret with the newly inaugurated democratic mayor lori lightfoot to block the aspirations of teachers and prevent a revolt in the us s third largest city on wednesday the ctu held a demonstration in downtown chicago under the slogan of standing strong for the schools chicago students deserve billed as a rally for a fair contract the event was in reality a ctu welcoming party for lightfoot as aft president randi weingarten boasted from the stage in a significant indication of the depth of the erosion of support among teachers for the ctu only a few hundred attended a tiny fraction of the ctu s roughly 25 000 members and far below the thousands who demonstrated repeatedly during the 2015 16 contract struggles many of those present were union officials or members of pseudo left organizations such as the democratic socialists of america and socialist alternative those few teachers who did attend described increasingly abysmal schools and workdays contradicting the claims of the rally speakers that the ctu has fought for and won improved conditions see chicago teachers speak on inequality attacks on public education at downtown rally along with weingarten jesse jackson the longtime democratic party stooge was the most shameless promoter of the new mayor exclaiming we have a new day in chicago a new mayor give it up for lori lightfoot current ctu president jesse sharkey who has played a central role in each of the union s sellouts gave credence to lightfoot s claims to be seeking a fairer and more just city not just for downtown but on the south and west sides too and the working class neighborhoods at the same time he unconvincingly attempted to present himself and the union as skeptics and even potential opponents of lightfoot signaling the ctu s intention to do everything possible to block a strike sharkey has called for a federal mediator to be brought in to oversee the talks saying at the rally when we come back to school in the fall we ll have an offer for our members to read as the rally took place former ctu president karen lewis and the union s political legislative director stacy davis gates were holding closed door discussions with lightfoot as our beloved karen is having a sit down with lori lightfoot the first african american female mayor of the city of chicago the rally mc noted no matter how we might feel we can be sure that we made history veteran chicago teachers will likely feel nothing but dread that lewis was sitting down for a tête à tête with lightfoot to discuss the future of public education in the city the same beloved karen is in fact notorious for leading the sellout of the 2012 chicago teachers strike bluntly admitting that the resulting agreement was an austerity contract in the year following the strike she openly supported the closing of schools stating we understand the whole movement of closing schools and doing it aggressively we either do this together in some reasonable way or we will always be fighting while the ctu backed lightfoot s opponent cook county board president toni preckwinkle in the mayoral runoff election earlier this year the union has since been at pains to demonstrate its goodwill towards the victor relying on identity politics the ctu has made much of the fact that lightfoot is the first female gay african american mayor thus seeking to burnish her image as a progressive and obscure her role as a representative of big business and the ruling class in doing so the union has quickly dropped its previous demagogic criticisms of lightfoot s pro business anti worker agenda in a march press release promoting preckwinkle the ctu noted lightfoot s ties to veteran corporate education reform operatives her support for the transformation of shuttered schools into police training academies lightfoot previously served as head of emanuel s sham police oversight board and her statement in january that for the 2019 chicago teachers contract we can t negotiate and give away dollars we don t have all this has been swept under the rug an election ad produced by the ctu who is the real lori lightfoot has since been removed from the union s youtube channel in a press release lauding lightfoot on monday the ctu stated the chicago teachers union congratulates lori lightfoot on her inauguration as mayor of our great city she stands on the shoulders of former ctu presidents karen lewis and jackie vaughn as well as ida b wells willie barrow and countless other black women who fought tirelessly for equity and against the vestiges of institutional racism chicago citizens demanded a new direction for their collective future and elected mayor lightfoot out of a desire for bold and progressive ideas and a commitment to building a more fair just and equitable city lightfoot s inaugural address rife with banalities and vague promises for greater equity at the same time contained the requisite code phrases intended to reassure the city s financial elite of her intentions to relentlessly defend their interests we must start with getting our fiscal house in order over many many years chicago dug itself into a giant financial hole we have an outsized structural deficit a persistent and growing pension debt and other costs that that threatens our financial stability we must tackle this problem head on no doubt some hard choices will have to be made like their counterparts across the world public school and charter teachers in chicago and their students confront increasingly impossible conditions in the midst of claims of a supposedly historic economic boom and the obscene concentration of colossal fortunes teachers are being told once again that there is not enough money for public education and decent working conditions if teachers are being told they and their students must make further sacrifices in the current situation how much more will be demanded when the inevitable next recession hits without an expropriation of the wealth of the big banks and global corporations and without an end to war and spending on police and military buildup worldwide the attacks on education and the growth of social inequality will continue teachers need new organizations of struggle to carry their fight forward in opposition to both parties of big business rank and file teachers must break from the ctu and the trade unions and organize independent rank and file committees to fight to defend teachers and public education as a whole it is necessary for teachers to link up with the broadest layers of the working class autoworkers public transportation workers uber and lyft drivers amazon and ups workers and others to plan and carry out a general strike to fight for the social rights of the working class the win these rights including the right to high quality public education the working class will have to take political power into its own hands and carry out a radical redistribution of wealth as part of the socialist transformation of society the socialist equality party will do everything it can to provide political assistance and leadership for these struggles we urge all teachers who want to learn more to contact us today

the united states us has added india to its watch list of countries with potentially questionable foreign exchange policies including undervaluation of currencies the monitoring list already comprises china japan korea germany and switzerland referring to high foreign exchange reserves the us said india which has a 23 billion trade surplus with the us increased its purchases of foreign exchange over the first three quarters of 2017 although the rupee still rose in value the us treasury in its semiannual report has said that the monitoring list includes those major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices it said that net purchases of foreign exchange over 2017 as a whole totalled 56 billion 2 2 of gdp including activity in the forward market the intervention has been increased citing strong capital inflows with foreign direct investment fdi of 34 billion and foreign portfolio flows of 26 billion over the first three quarters of the year according to a report by the economic times the semiannual report on us trade partners macroeconomic and forex policies monitors any unfair current practices an indian official aware of the development said we do not manipulate our currency this mirrored the pattern of the last few years in which intervention has typically tracked fdi and institutional portfolio flows direct intervention has supported a steady increase in foreign exchange reserve levels the us said countries remain on the list for two report cycles to help ensure that any improvement in performance versus the criteria is durable and is not due to temporary factors while no major trading partner was found to be manipulating its currency five of those on the list meet two of the three criteria while china is included because it constitutes a disproportionate share of the overall us trade deficit the us has a deficit of 337 billion with china out of a total global trade deficit of 566 billion according to government data the us treasury report is required by congress to identify countries that are trying to artificially manage the value of their currency to gain a trade advantage for example by keeping the exchange rate low to promote cheaper exports and while china which is at the centre of a brewing trade dispute with washington remained on the watch list the us treasury said the chinese currency generally moved against the dollar in a direction that should help reduce china s trade surplus with the united states germany also remained on the watch list even though it is a part of the european currency union which means it cannot independently control the exchange rate for the euro even so the report notes that germany has the world s largest current account surplus and has made little to no progress in reducing this massive surplus the past three years the us treasury called for all the countries on the list to implement economic reforms to address their surpluses edited by aseem thapliyal

abc news abc news washington amid roiling trade tensions the crowded 2020 democratic candidate field now finds itself divided on a path forward on the tricky terrain of american trade a path made all

the united states us has added india to its watch list of countries with potentially questionable foreign exchange policies including undervaluation of currencies the monitoring list already comprises china japan korea germany and switzerland referring to high foreign exchange reserves the us said india which has a 23 billion trade surplus with the us increased its purchases of foreign exchange over the first three quarters of 2017 although the rupee still rose in value the us treasury in its semiannual report has said that the monitoring list includes those major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices it said that net purchases of foreign exchange over 2017 as a whole totalled 56 billion 2 2 of gdp including activity in the forward market the intervention has been increased citing strong capital inflows with foreign direct investment fdi of 34 billion and foreign portfolio flows of 26 billion over the first three quarters of the year according to a report by the economic times the semiannual report on us trade partners macroeconomic and forex policies monitors any unfair current practices an indian official aware of the development said we do not manipulate our currency this mirrored the pattern of the last few years in which intervention has typically tracked fdi and institutional portfolio flows direct intervention has supported a steady increase in foreign exchange reserve levels the us said countries remain on the list for two report cycles to help ensure that any improvement in performance versus the criteria is durable and is not due to temporary factors while no major trading partner was found to be manipulating its currency five of those on the list meet two of the three criteria while china is included because it constitutes a disproportionate share of the overall us trade deficit the us has a deficit of 337 billion with china out of a total global trade deficit of 566 billion according to government data the us treasury report is required by congress to identify countries that are trying to artificially manage the value of their currency to gain a trade advantage for example by keeping the exchange rate low to promote cheaper exports and while china which is at the centre of a brewing trade dispute with washington remained on the watch list the us treasury said the chinese currency generally moved against the dollar in a direction that should help reduce china s trade surplus with the united states germany also remained on the watch list even though it is a part of the european currency union which means it cannot independently control the exchange rate for the euro even so the report notes that germany has the world s largest current account surplus and has made little to no progress in reducing this massive surplus the past three years the us treasury called for all the countries on the list to implement economic reforms to address their surpluses edited by aseem thapliyal

us president donald trump and china s president xi jinping meet business leaders at the great hall of the people in beijing it was a stark warning about the risks ahead for the global economy even by the forthright standards of the boss of the organisation for economic co operation and development the world economy is in a dangerous place angel gurria said as the oecd announced its latest lower forecasts for growth on may 21 the source of his worry the mounting trade tensions between the united states and china which could hit the rest of the world much harder than they have to date let s avoid complacency at all costs gurria said clearly the biggest threat is through the escalation of trade restriction measures and this is happening as we speak this clear and present danger could easily have knock on effects with much of the world economy still recovering from the after effects of the global financial crisis a decade ago us president donald trump caused alarm when he raised tariffs on sh20 3 trillion usd200 billion worth of goods from china on may 10 prompting beijing to say it would hit back with its own higher duties trade tensions are the main reason that growth in the global economy will weaken to 3 2 percent this year the slowest pace in three years and down from rates of about 5 per cent before the financial crisis a decade ago the oecd said more tariffs the world economy is expected to pick up slowly next year but only if washington and china drop their latest tariff moves the impact could be a lot more severe if trump follows through on his latest threat to hit a further sh30 4 trillion usd300 billion of chinese imports with tariffs and china retaliates again that kind of tariff escalation plus the associated rise in uncertainty about a broadening of the trade war could lop about 0 7 percent off the world economy by 2021 2022 the oecd said that would be equivalent to about sh60 7 trillion usd600 billion or the loss of the economy of argentina but the knock on effects might not stop there a full blown trade war combined with an ensuing debt crisis in china and a shift away from exports to drive its economy could cause a 2 percent hit to china s economy in turn knocking global growth further the oecd said to be sure that kind of worst case scenario may well be averted given the stakes for the united states and china trump and chinese president xi jinping are due to meet at a group of 20 leaders summit in japan on june 28 29 other g20 nations will be urging them to step back from the fight chief among them germany and japan two export power houses which have much to lose from a long trade war for now the effect of the trade tensions is being felt mostly among manufacturers by contrast consumers buoyed by low unemployment and weak inflation in many of the world s rich economies have shown little sign of alarm at the row between washington and beijing but over the longer term a protracted trade war is likely to drag down the consumer economy too global trade should normally grow at double the pace of the world economy but is expected to lag it in 2019 boding ill for investment by companies the oecd said that investment would normally drive productivity growth which is key for long term prosperity and is urgently needed living standards for many workers in rich countries remain lower than before the financial crisis of 2008 09 the frustration with lower living standards is widely seen as one of the main factors behind the rise of populist politics including trump s presidential election victory in 2016 to put it bluntly this cannot be the new normal said laurence boone the oecd s chief economist we cannot accept an economy that doesn t raise people s living standards

moscow konstantin vyatkin has never acknowledged the soviet collapse for the past 28 years i ve tried to live in this country called russia he says but in my heart i still live there in the soviet union the words may sound banal in a country where two thirds of the population professes nostalgia for the former empire motivated by economic concerns and the absence of a welfare state but vyatkin does not simply miss the soviet union he actively denies its breakup and claims to obey only its laws and now a vibrant cottage industry is helping legitimize his discontent sitting behind the steering wheel of his mercedes in central moscow on a recent afternoon he produces a brand new soviet passport date of issue march 9 2019 it looks identical to the real thing with a stamp bearing the soviet emblem a black and white photograph and hammers and sickles on each two page spread it came he says with a red and white sticker now stuck to his windshield i am a citizen of the u s s r it reads vyatkin is among a loose but growing network of russians prone to conspiratorial thinking and ready to use quasi legal arguments in an effort to evade laws and taxes they believe their government was usurped by venal outside forces and disavow the system of numbers and documents that identify them as citizens at banks police stations and inside courtrooms across the country people calling themselves citizens of the u s s r demand their right to impunity before the legal system of the russian federation a state they neither recognize nor apparently fear the internet which only reached the masses after the soviet collapse is now helping spread their basic conspiracy theory that a document dissolving the soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr a constituent republic of the soviet union and signed on december 25 1991 by its then president boris yeltsin is illegal the organs of soviet power are being recreated vyatkin has long felt like a stranger in his own country but around six months ago his disillusionment reached a head and he began scouring the web for validation i was looking for information and like minded people he says i knew i couldn t continue living in a country like this on a website that claims to represent mvd sssr the soviet interior ministry he filled out an online form and paid 3 800 rubles 58 to receive his soviet passport the organization which uses the soviet su domain but lists no address or other identifying details other than moscow rsfsr told rfe rl in an e mail that it has issued more than 10 000 such passports since early 2018 on youtube vyatkin found hundreds of channels peddling conspiracy theories that russia s an offshore company registered in delaware that president vladimir putin was killed in 2012 and replaced by a body double that the soviet union and its ministries are being resurrected some gave him convincing explanations of the inequality he was witnessing in russia but beyond feeding widespread soviet nostalgia and disillusionment the channels also promote ways newly minted soviet citizens can skirt russian laws open bank accounts and evade taxes bloggers harass parliamentary deputies on camera prank call government ministries set up bank accounts using soviet passports and ridicule traffic cops who stop them for displaying illicit soviet registration plates some of these channels have hundreds of thousands of followers the most popular video on the youtube channel pravoved tv jurist tv which claims to offer practical tips and advice for citizens of the u s s r is titled how to legally avoid paying off debt it has 2 8 million views as legal authorities it cites wikipedia and russian online dictionaries the movement s unofficial manifesto quoted by mvd sssr and other sites flogging counterfeit documents as well as the numerous videos online includes a demand that all soviet citizens working for the occupational structures be amnestied and freed from prosecution once the u s s r is revived anyone born in the erstwhile soviet union is considered to still be a soviet citizen today under the 1978 soviet law on citizenship and so are their children that includes people living in all of the 15 former soviet republics also making the rounds is a guide to interacting with russian officials in contact with a representative of the occupational structure a citizen of the u s s r must behave correctly and politely and not provoke any unlawful actions explains a document published by mvd sssr aleksandr ulyanov a 53 year old blogger in yaroslavl who curiously shares lenin s surname puts this into practice for his youtube blog in one video he drives around town with soviet number plates and a dashboard camera and when he s pulled over he claims the officer has no authority over a citizen of the u s s r since the russian police represent a state that should not legally exist here we go again i ve heard this all before the officer says in the video what year were you born ulyanov asks 1985 what was the country the u s s r did someone deprive you of u s s r citizenship what are you trying to tell me that you re not a russian citizen but a citizen of the u s s r ulyanov responds from a legal standpoint you have no right to address me ulyanov then presents his passport driver s license and insurance papers all issued by ministries claiming to represent the u s s r you understand what s happening all the organs of soviet power are being re created the baffled officer apparently lets him continue on his way who pays the bills bloggers like ulyanov may be lone crusaders using youtube to educate viewers in the art of legal sabotage but soviet nostalgia has long been a business opportunity and some are seizing on the new legalistic argument to elicit money from the most gullible in january 2018 sergei demkin a former oil trader in st petersburg published a document online that claimed members of a new trade union he was launching were entitled to free household utilities the organization union ssr now has its own office in central st petersburg from which it advocates rejection of russian laws and claims to empower its members with a legal basis to refuse paying taxes and utility bills demkin says that since the government has never refuted his claims they are legally sound but the privilege does not come free demkin s clients mostly retired people in a country where the average monthly pension is 213 pay a 1 000 ruble 15 registration fee and monthly payments of 200 rubles 3 in a telephone interview with rfe rl demkin said union ssr has 170 regional chapters but he declined to quantify his membership i don t want the russian secret services to know how many we are he said they fear any form of association but fontanka an independent news outlet in st petersburg estimated in february that union ssr has 10 000 members in that city alone and demkin s clients are apparently taking his message to heart across russia thousands have been refusing to pay their bills and some have sent letters to energy companies citing the january 2018 document demkin released many have had their electricity switched off as a result in december major energy providers in several russian regions including amur and kamchatka told the ria novosti news agency that members of union ssr had begun sending letters to the companies stating their refusal to pay bills one provider published a statement clarifying that trade union members were not exempt from utility payments it singled out union ssr for spreading dangerous rumors in april state tv profiled a union ssr member in the city of nizhny tagil who had refused to pay bills for the past three years according to her homeowner s association she owed more than 100 000 rubles 1 500 and her electricity had been shut off 13 times each time she managed to reactivate it herself on her door hung a sign reading this apartment belongs to the jurisdiction of the u s s r the laws of the russian federation have no legal force here ilya bakhmutsky a moscow based lawyer for the association of guaranteed suppliers and energy service companies who has looked into the activity of groups like union ssr described their claims as totally unsubstantiated and simply a call to break the law according to bakhmutsky unregistered groups like union ssr can fly under the authorities radar because they exist in a legal vacuum and are not governed by laws that regulate commercial enterprises a separate court ruling would be needed to shut union ssr down we have many similar groups in russia and i think the authorities just don t get around to them he said grigory yudin a sociologist at moscow s higher school of economics said that a noticeable shift has taken place in russia recently from nostalgia driven by the imperialist past toward a nostalgia driven by a demand for social justice and for equality bakhmutsky agreed in the u s s r there was no such concept as private property and most soviet citizens paid minimal taxes and utility bills many today want a return to that blueprint he said the number of people living below the poverty line is growing naturally they begin to seek a moral justification for not paying for the services they use he said and some try to capitalize on that misconstrued sense of social justice in january state gas giant gazprom revealed that customers across russia owe the company and its subsidiaries over 30 1 billion rubles 466 million in arrears in chechnya the problem grew so acute that a court instructed gazprom in january to write off 135 million in debt owed by customers in the region after prosecutors warned of social unrest four other regions soon followed chechnya s lead by seeking their own debt amnesties we just help people at a time of rising living costs and anger over inequality groups like union ssr are operating on fertile ground however there are signs that law enforcement is beginning to catch up in early 2018 the sverdlovsk regional branch of russia s federal security service fsb launched a criminal investigation on charges of promoting extremism against andrei zlokazov a man who styles himself as head of the sverdlovsk region of the rsfsr court documents describe zlokazov as a member of the union of slavic forces of rus an unregistered group whose membership the fsb estimates at 150 000 members according to sova an ngo that monitors extremism in russia the union s materials contain very specific often unclear and often anti semitic rhetoric according to the indictment zlokazov joined the organization in 2014 and was quickly appointed to a number of high ranking posts in the imagined soviet government local fsb investigator nikita karpov told the daily kommersant last march that the security services were forced to act after they were alerted to a series of orders that zlokazov sent out through the russian mail to the leaderships of army bases across the region in february 2016 in which he threatened to liquidate them if they did not reorganize themselves into self defense units engaged in the campaign to revive the soviet union the fsb alleges zlokazov was out to foment revolution in russia but he does not appear to have been driven purely by ideology from his apartment in yekaterinburg prosecutors say he ran a business selling soviet passports driver s licenses and other documents of the kind vyatkin and others use to insist on impunity before russian law perhaps spooked by the arrest of taraskin in july 2018 demkin devotes a sizable portion of the front page of union ssr s website to an explanation of why the group is not extremist he s twice been summoned to the local police station he told rfe rl each time arguing his way out he insisted he makes no money from his organization but rather uses his own money part of a 50 000 ruble 775 monthly income from real estate investments to prop it up we just help people he said free from taxation in early march vyatkin stumbled upon valentina reunova an unlikely youtube star the bespectacled muscovite in her early 60s calls herself chairwoman of the soviet supreme council and keeps thousands of viewers across russia hanging on her every word vyatkin contacted her to ask what he can do to help revive the u s s r in late march he traveled to a small rental apartment in a moscow suburb to attend a gathering that included reunova and other like minded people of the kind he d been searching for like other such clubs across the country they claim to have inherited the soviet union and meet regularly to discuss state policies before cell phone cameras that live stream the speeches online they also hold ceremonies in which members receive their new soviet passports that afternoon vyatkin addressed thousands of viewers tuning in from across the former soviet union and explained why he was joining the movement to rebuild the u s s r i hope all viewers in our u s s r hear me he said we must resurrect the organs of soviet power vyatkin who runs a small business that renovates hydraulic tail lifts on dump trucks has long felt angry about taxes and the lack of welfare in russia in may he plans to visit his local police station and demand they delete his records i ll insist on my rights as a soviet citizen he says after that tax statements will no longer arrive

tip top was sold to froneri this month photo file comment for some time now central bankers have been opining that our new zealand dollar has been unjustifiably and unsustainably elevated in price relative to our major trading partners the constant rhetoric is that our currency needs to be lower and this will be of a large benefit to exporters and therefore our underlying economy post the decision of the reserve bank to lower interest rates this month we have now seen the nzd fall back to a level of 0 6535 cents versus the usd remembering we were as high as 0 8810 cents back in late 2014 whilst we are an export led country and this is undoubtedly a tailwind for the sector it does not come without other consequences notably the relative cheapness of many of our prime assets for offshore investors just last month goodman property trust sold their interests in the vxv office portfolio a cluster of seven office parks in auckland to blackstone group a us based global investment firm vodafone nz has been sold to a consortium subject to commerce commission and overseas investment office approval including brookfield asset management another global alternative asset manager who is co listed on the new york toronto and euronext stock exchanges this is just the tip of the iceberg locally investors have been lamenting the move lower in interest rates and how it was making investors re think how they were deploying their investments despite this backdrop yields of 4 00 6 00 per cent in a global context still remain attractive relative to investors in europe as an example when you consider they are able to fund at interest rate levels closer to 0 00 per cent adding to this we have a currency that has been in freefall further sweetening the deal this is not limited to the private market since december 2017 our nzx50 equity market has returned circa 20 per cent with a lot of this outperformance coming in the form of foreign capital and a low interest rate environment low interest rates are not unique to nz but this obsession with a lower currency to engineer imported inflation and boost exporters is proving highly attractive for foreign capital add in the political stability and relative ease of doing business in this country then it is no wonder we are seeing many of our iconic companies being snapped up the counter argument will be that we have an overseas investment office oio to protect our national interests around key strategic assets however with a number of private property deals and the recent sales of trade me restaurant brands tip top and vodafone nz are anything to go by nz is for sale and to the highest bidder mark fowler is head of investments at hobson wealth partners
democratic candidates split on the best path forward for us trade policy amid roiling trade tensions the crowded 2020 democratic candidate field now finds itself divided on a path forward on the tricky terrain of american trade a path made all the more difficult by president donald trump s protectionist stance and hardline tone on getting fair deals for the u s complicating matters are the threat of tariffs on some chinese imports late wednesday trump announced on twitter that he s agreed to delay an increased tariff from oct 1 to oct 15 as a gesture of good will he said the delay came at the request of the vice premier of china and was because of the country s celebration of its 70th anniversary trump has imposed or announced penalties on about 550 billion in chinese products the tariffs of 25 which were imposed on 250 billion worth of chinese goods were due to increase to 30 on oct 1 president donald trump speaks during an event with american farmers and ranchers in the roosevelt room of the white house in washington may 23 2019 bloomberg via getty images in august the u s also announced a delay with a 10 tariff that was set to be slapped on 300 billion of chinese imports in september the cell phones laptop computers video game consoles certain toys computer monitors and certain items of footwear and clothing and other products subject to the delay would still be subject to the tariffs starting dec 15 according to the office of the u s trade representative the move would likely come as a relief during the holiday shopping season as economists say the cost of the u s tariffs are passed on to american businesses and consumers democrats staking out more trade friendly views contrast themselves with the trump administration s hard line some have assumed the attack stance that isolationist trade policies hurt farmers rather than achieve fairer deals it s a tricky tap dance for democrats seeking to contrast themselves with trump yet not alienate key rust belt or progressive grassroots voting blocs president donald trump poses for photographs with rep mike conaway of texas and farmers and ranchers from across the country in the oval office at the white house may 23 2019 chip somodevilla getty images former rep beto o rourke like a number of 2020 candidates has focused on rural crop communities on his several trips to early voting states such as iowa they ve positioned themselves as fighting for farmers where trump s tariffs have hurt the agricultural community in an op ed on cnn timed with his town hall o rourke said trump s tariffs lead america s trading partners to turn elsewhere leaving farmers holding the bag people are hurting with this biblical strength flooding geoff burgan o rourke s iowa communications director told abc news farmers out here have regularly told we want trade not aid and the future of rural america is something you can t get away from o rourke s climate proposal a sweeping 5 trillion plan specifically folds in initiatives focused on midwestern agricultural communities agenda items like expanding federal crop insurance and investing in flood infrastructure others such as former vice president joe biden find themselves in a complicated position on trade biden voted for the north american free trade agreement nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china he and o rourke also supported former president barack obama s trans pacific partnership tpp a sweeping multinational trade proposal that included pacific rim nations which a number of unions opposed out of concerns about labor protections and that it would cost the u s jobs some rival 2020 campaigns have hammered biden on this perceived vulnerability sen bernie sanders i vt who opposed nafta and the trans pacific partnership attacked biden s voting record on trade attempting to draw a sharp contrast between himself and his front running presidential opponent joe voted for nafta and permanent trade relations trade agreements with china i led the effort against that joe voted for the deregulation of wall street i voted against that sanders told abc news white house chief correspondent jonathan karl during an interview on this week in des moines iowa it s not the first time sanders has spoken out strongly on trade he has vigorously opposed policies like nafta from its inception calling out his 2016 primary opponent hillary clinton for her support of the trans pacific partnership agriculture secretary sonny perdue walks past the west wing on the north lawn of the white house in washington may 23 2019 andrew harnik ap i was on the picket line in opposition to nafta sanders said during the new hampshire primary debate during the last election we heard people tell us how many jobs would be created i didn t believe that for a second for the wide swath of democrats running in 2020 a catch 22 now emerges the powerful pull to align with obama in symbolic legacy and the simultaneous need for would be progressives to distance themselves from the obama administration s less popular trade agenda biden has defended his vote on nafta telling the associated press that he supported not free trade but fair trade i think that back in the time during the clinton administration it made sense at the moment the former vice president said sen elizabeth warren d mass joins sanders in being long time skeptics of free trade she vehemently opposed the trans pacific partnership calling it a rigged process producing a rigged outcome for 40 of the u s economy urging congress in 2015 to reject the trade plan that would tilt the playing field even more in favor of big multinational corporations and against working families warren also opposed the united states mexico canada trade agreement usmca trump s renegotiated trade deal with mexico and canada calling it nafta 2 0 and voting against the plan in 2018 stumping in iowa her speech has fiercely denounced big agro calling for the breakup of industry mergers charging consolidation is choking family farms for those on the front lines weathering the storm of trade wars and climate change alike farmers at the center of the conflict will scrutinize candidates positions and past voting records closely for who will prioritize their interests as things stand farmers who spoke with abc news expressed frustration when we take china off the table for a demand for our products we suddenly have a huge amount of supply and the price collapses matt russell a fifth generation farmer in iowa who owns a 110 acre farm of produce heirloom tomatoes and grass fed beef told abc news senior washington reporter devin dwyer the biggest thing is the loss of trade that s the big story
source post gazette com overview federated investors fii is one of the largest investment managers in the u s with 459 9 billion in managed assets at the end of 2018 the company develops high quality investment products in a variety of disciplines and distributes them through an extensive network of financial intermediaries in multiple channels markets and countries the majority of federated s revenue is derived from advising the federated funds and separate accounts in both domestic and international markets unlike many other asset managers federated specializes more in the money market area with over usd 300 billion aum in this category or 65 of the total aum source analyst update q1 2019 however the revenue to aum ratio is typically not that sexy for money market products and therefore almost 50 of the gross revenue see below is currently coming from the equity fund business source analyst update q1 2019 federated investors has its global footprint but concentrates heavily on the north america market see below over 90ï¼ of the total aum source analyst update q1 2019 quality score vs valuation federated investors earns a decent urbem quality score a purely algorithm driven model which takes all the quantitative aspects into account as well as finds itself a high position on the list by my factor based quality ranking model which considers both qualitative and quantitative factors in the meantime the valuation of the share looks so favorable especially in light of today s overheated market a 14 3x p e compared to its historical average of 16 5x a 2 5x p s compared to 3x historically a 3 4x p b compared to 4 7x and a current dividend yield of 3 6 to 3 4 historically source morningstar data as of 5 24 2019 wall street predicts a high single digit annual growth in eps see below bringing the peg ratio to 1 5x not too bad for an asset manager focused on low risk money market source simplywallst data as of 5 24 2019 source morningstar data as of 5 24 2019 comparing fii s price multiples to the averages of industry sector we would see that the stock is relatively cheap source reuters data as of 5 24 2019 although i am not a fan of dcf the absolute valuation also tells us that the share is around 25 under its fair value see the assumptions of the dcf model below according to simplywallst source simplywallst data as of 5 24 2019 source simplywallst data as of 5 24 2019 so is federated investors a truly wonderful business that you can buy at the current attractive price or is the stock a quality trap we need to dig deeper below financial performance the management at federated has been delivering superior returns on capital consistently over the past decade including the period of the great recession annual return on invested capital never dropped below 15 return on equity never below 20 return on assets never below 10 see below indicating capital efficiencies protected by some economic moat source morningstar data as of 5 23 2019 the current capital efficiencies are close to the low end of the past 10 year range even though benefiting from the reduced tax rate the company retained around 50 of its annual net profit so it would be interesting to see how effectively the management reinvested the retained earnings according to the definition here the business earned only a 3 6ï¼ return on capitals retained for the past 10 years and a 21 7 return over the past 5 years the inconsistency indicates the possible difficulties of finding opportunities to reinvest at attractive rates of return in the long term the top line growth for the past decade appeared to be struggling only 4 out of 10 years have seen positive growths the business clearly needs a consistent growth engine source morningstar data as of 5 24 2019 despite the growth issue federated investors does generate abundant cash flow for shareholders i e fcf margin above 10 while requiring little capex i e less than 3 of annual sales to sustain its operations thanks to the asset light business model source morningstar data as of 5 24 2019 the company also has a healthy balance sheet with an over 2x current ratio and a low debt level compared to its cash and equity levels see below source morningstar data as of 5 24 2019 growth prospect despite the high margins superior returns on capital strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet federated investors does lack a long term prospect in my opinion this is mainly due to the lack of reinvestment opportunity as mentioned above or secular growth in the traditional active investment management space coupled with a near term industry headwind resulting from the race to zero the management mainly relies on external opportunities e g m a to drive growths last year for a total price of gbp 260 million the company acquired 60 of london based hermes a leading provider of responsible investing across public and private real estate infrastructure private equity and private debt markets hermes possesses a differentiated proposition through its esg integrated investment process considering environmental social and governance factors the firm generated a strong track record of aum growth for the past few years see below source analyst update q1 2019 earlier this month federated investors and the pnc financial services group pnc announced that they had reached a definitive agreement for federated to acquire certain components of pnc capital advisors llc s investment management business for usd 52 million the deal would result in the addition of approximately 9 billion in liquidity assets 4 2 billion in equity assets and 700 million in fixed income assets to federated s aum as you can see below federated investors has been a frequent consolidator in the asset management space over the past couple of years source analyst update q1 2019 while i find and appreciate the management s prudence in terms of m a i do prefer to see that major growth drivers come from internal reinvestment opportunities the high single digit growth estimate by wall street mostly focuses on the near term boost from m a activities which may not be sustainable over the longer haul certainly i would not blame the management for the low returns on reinvesting retained earnings since the asset management industry has been generated more secular headwinds than tailwinds for federated as described below many investors have become more cost conscious when it comes to the fees for investment products demonstrated by the race to zero in the industry the ongoing shift from active to passive products is expected to continue as more investors seek out low cost options to active investment funds like federated s and based on the thesis that most active fund managers cannot add value by outperforming in the long run as more and more baby boomers in the us begin reaching the retirement age withdrawals follow putting pressure on money flows meanwhile more equity assets would convert into low risk assets such as money market funds benefiting federated risk the risk profile of federated s business looks neutral on the one hand the money market business does provide downside protection for federated investors and reduces its bear market risk the heavy emphasis on money market assets lends to a stable aum revenue stream regardless of market volatility actually the money market portion of the business is a hedge on stock market volatility as any sell off in the stock market may contribute to money market investments as a safe haven nonetheless the company seems to be on its path to try to diversify away from its core competence in the money market adding more exposure to the high risk equity business on the other hand the money market fund business does have its special characteristic in terms of the interest rate risk the long term low interest rate environment resulted in the gross yield earned by certain money market funds not being sufficient to cover all of the fund s operating expenses as a result beginning in 2008 federated implemented voluntary waivers in order for certain money market funds to maintain positive or zero net yields the impact of the voluntary yield related fee waivers for recent years are displayed below source 2018 annual report there was no cost from the fee waiver program in 2018 as the fed funds rate was high enough finally increases in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on federated s revenue from the money market and other low risk products in a rising short term interest rate environment risk seeking investors may shift money to investments strategies in comparable instruments for higher yields than those available in the money market holding lower yielding instruments summary warren buffett once laid out his 4 criteria of stock selection a durable competitive advantage to protect the economic castle an able management team with shareholder interest in mind the opportunity to reinvest at high rates of return a sensible price tag i believe that the equity investment in federated investors appears to satisfy 1 2 and 4 but definitely not 3 here therefore the stock cannot be regarded as a quality buy at the moment there might be some opportunities with regards to the multiple expansion but as a long term quality focus investor i would forgo those ones
illinois house committee passes progressive income tax rates without public notice in a party line vote that even fellow lawmakers were unaware of illinois house democrats passed out of committee a progressive income tax rate structure that would take effect should gov j b pritzker succeed in scrapping illinois constitutional flat income tax protection illinois house democrats skirted basic transparency measures in moving one of the most important taxpayer bills of the year on may 24 the illinois house revenue finance committee voted 9 6 along party lines to approve senate bill 687 which contains progressive income tax rates that would raise an estimated 3 3 billion from taxpayers those rates would go into effect if the general assembly passes and illinois voters approve an amendment to scrap the state s constitutional flat tax protection and allow for a progressive income tax but the committee abused procedural rules meant to ensure deliberation and public notice which lead to the bill s passage in near secrecy while some members of the media and advocacy groups were in attendance at the committee hearing members of the general public had no opportunity to voice their opinion on the measure in the days leading up to its passage the bill was never posted publicly for the may 24 hearing committee member state rep margo mcdermed r frankfort called out this maneuver after she was asked to limit her questions to experts testifying before the committee she noted that citizens were denied the ability to post witness slips supporting or opposing the rates bill prior to the hearing the constitutional amendment required for these rates to take effect senate joint constitutional amendment 1 has drawn nearly 10 000 opposing witness slips revenue finance committee chairman mike zalewski d riverside explained he was not in violation of the rules because the bill was posted for the may 20 committee hearing though it wasn t heard or voted upon and he never technically adjourned that meeting meaning they remained in a days long recess this allowed the committee to call a surprise vote on the rates bill we have not adjourned this committee zalewski told mcdermed if you want to go back and listen to the tapes and if any moment i ve said adjourn then we have a different story as a result illinoisans had no avenue to voice official opposition or support throughout the week we as a caucus were not told our staff was not told that this was going to be heard this morning mcdermed said on the house floor what does this say about your confidence in this policy in this measure when the only way that you can get it through to the floor of this house is by engaging in legislative tricks and shout down people on the other side beyond mcdermed and other republicans many democrats in the house were also unaware the rates had been called to a vote much less passed to the house floor in addition to the surprise calling of the bill three democratic members of the committee who have either voiced opposition or withheld vocal support for the progressive income tax state reps sam yingling d round lake beach jonathan carroll d northbrook and stephanie kifowit d aurora were substituted out of committee and replaced with yes votes illinoisans concerned that the progressive income tax would serve as a trojan horse to middle class tax hikes of up to 3 500 may have more cause for worry after comments from freshman state rep yehiel kalish d chicago in the committee hearing he thought the proposed income tax rates were too low i want to be on record saying that i don t think we go high enough he said the progressive income tax constitutional amendment allowing for these new rates sjrca 1 has already passed the senate and on may 20 passed the house committee on revenue finance it now awaits a floor vote in the house if the amendment gets 71 yes votes it will be on the ballot for illinois voters to consider in the 2020 election should voters approve the amendment at the ballot box new progressive income tax rates would be allowed to go into effect the amendment would eliminate the state s flat income tax protection empower lawmakers to pass additional income taxes on the same dollar earned and allow for the nation s highest tax on business income though the rates plan approved by the house differs in some ways from pritzker s original proposal the overall effect would be the same a tax hike that would hurt small businesses drag down economic growth fail to close the budget deficit or pensions and serve as a bridge to higher taxes for the middle class what s in this progressive income tax proposal while gov j b pritzker has been campaigning for months on his own proposal the rates and brackets passed out of the senate and the house committee on revenue finance are different from the governor s pritzker s proposal levied a 7 95 flat rate on the highest income bracket while the plan currently moving in the general assembly features a 7 99 flat rate on the highest income bracket that top bracket also now kicks in at a lower level for single filers 750 000 instead of 1 million the state s corporate income tax rate would also be bumped up to 7 99 from 7 pritzker s plan hiked the corporate income tax to 7 95 this does not include the personal property replacement tax of 1 5 on s corporations and 2 5 on c corporations senate democrats who originally filed and passed the rates bill explained the changes as an attempt to rid pritzker s proposal of the widely criticized marriage penalty which would subject joint filers to higher income tax rates than they would face if they were single filers but the senate plan also fails to eliminate the marriage penalty because there were no changes to tax brackets below 250 000 the penalty still exists for those who would see a tax cut provided the plan doesn t change again married couples would receive less of a tax break than they otherwise would if they were single for those who would face a tax increase the marriage penalty still hasn t been fully eliminated while the single filer brackets have been altered slightly married filers would still face the possibility of higher taxes under this proposal than they would if they were single one of the most frequently stated reasons for enacting a progressive income tax is the need to close the anticipated budget shortfall currently pegged at 3 2 billion due to further increases in discretionary spending but the plan currently moving through the general assembly would fall 175 million short of this goal according to the senate democrats own numbers furthermore even if the state dedicates all of the new revenue from this plan to illinois unfunded pension liability the progressive income tax rates passed by the senate and the house committee on revenue finance will fail to pay off the state s pension debt ever although this plan is being sold as a way to shore up state finances pay down debt and increase services it will fail to do any of that without addressing the structural spending problems that have led to the highest overall tax burden in the nation a progressive income tax system would only be a bridge to higher income taxes and judging by how quickly pritzker s fair tax promises have receded it has become clear to taxpayers the ease with which income tax rates could rise under the governor s plan instead pritzker and the general assembly should follow a responsible roadmap to tax relief and restored fiscal health through pension reform and spending restraint

escalating disputes between china and the united states could significantly weaken sentiment in business and financial markets disrupt global supply chains and create an economic drag this year the international monetary fund warned on friday the imf research citing official data found that the revenue collected by the u s government through hefty tariffs on chinese imports has been paid almost entirely by u s importers some of these tariffs have been passed on to u s consumers such as those on washing machines while others have been absorbed by importing firms through lower profit margins the research said any further increase in tariffs will likely be passed through to consumers it said china and the u s the world s two largest economies have been embroiled in a tit for tat trade confrontation over the past few months washington threatened to further escalate a tariff war and increased tensions by tightening restrictions on chinese companies earlier this month the u s raised tariffs on 200 billion of chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent and china took countermeasures then the u s administration listed about 300 billion more of chinese goods for possible tariff hikes the imf report warned that the additional impact of the recent and future tariffs will cut about 0 3 percent of global gdp in the short term with half stemming from negative effects on business and market confidence failure to resolve the trade differences and further escalation in other areas such as the auto industry which would cover several countries could further dent business and financial market sentiment negatively impact emerging market bond spreads and currencies and slow investment and trade the research said experts urged the u s government to stop its protectionism and proposed options for a resolution between the two countries chen wenling chief economist of the china center for international economic exchanges said the u s needs to correct moves that have already added pressure to global economic prospects otherwise it will pay the price for its protectionist behavior she said chen said the u s is disrupting the world order weakening the global economy and destroying the trade rules stephen roach a faculty member at yale university and former chairman of morgan stanley asia said the u s government blamed others for economic problems that are very much of its own making there are plenty of realistic options for resolution between the two countries roach said in a recent article contributed to beijing based think tank china watch for instance he suggested the u s and china should take the lead in forging a global cyber accord while additional tariffs from both u s and china will weigh on china s growth outlook we expect policy measures to offset some of the negative impacts said tommy wu a senior economist at oxford economics a british think tank the spike in trade tensions has already rattled financial markets the yuan has weakened by 2 percent to its lowest level since january we expect stock markets and the yuan to remain under pressure in the near term though they could be supported by an expected stabilization in the domestic economy later this year wu said sheng songcheng the former director of the survey and statistics department in the people s bank of china said the truth is that imposing more tariffs on chinese goods has not yet reduced u s trade deficits the long lasting u s trade deficits in goods was formed from the u s dollar s international status its domestic low deposit rate and the u s position in the global value chain and those factors cannot be changed by protectionist measures sheng said

barquisimeto venezuela andreína cordero started the year skipping meals so her three kids could eat her husband a construction worker was out of a job and the family s savings had been devastated by the nation s hyperinflation limiting cordero s children to a diet of rice beans pasta and fried corn patties but the family got a break from their daily struggle to feed themselves this spring when a social worker enrolled them in a program run by a silicon valley startup that is donating cryptocurrency to hundreds of venezuelan families every week from february to april cordero received a deposit of eos tokens through a cellphone app she then traded the digital money for local currency through online transfers and used the funds to shop in market stalls we finally got to eat chicken cordero said and there were also vegetables for the kids the three month trial in crypto transfers is now over and the family is back to skipping meals and eating mostly beans and rice but cordero is thankful for the time that digital currency saved her kids from malnutrition i m very grateful for what they did for us cordero said it would be a blessing if something like that were set up again over the past decade cryptocurrencies like eos and bitcoin have become popular among investors looking to make large profits from a new and anonymous form of storing wealth but a handful of charities are also now using digital currencies to send relief directly to those in need circumventing banks and companies that handle remittances they ve found the ideal testing ground in venezuela where the annual inflation rate by some estimates has soared to a staggering 67 000 forcing millions to scavenge daily to feed themselves leticia luque calculates the exchange rate of cryptocurrency in barquisimeto venezuela on april 11 2019 luque an informal merchant said that she began to accept crypto payments two months ago at the request of a social worker manuel rueda ap file crypto has the highest likelihood of being helpful to people in places where money is broken said joe waltman executive director of givecrypto the charity that provided direct transfers to cordero and more than 100 venezuelan families in barquisimeto and there s probably no better example of broken money right now than venezuela givecrypto s program provided temporary help to vulnerable families by providing them with a weekly deposit worth around 7 or about the same as venezuela s monthly minimum wage the organization is also aiming to make people familiar with crypto apps so they can transfer their own earnings into digital currency and use it to buy goods long after they have stopped receiving free deposits we want to show that people who are not techies or investors can also benefit from this technology said efrain pineda the project s manager anyone can use crypto to protect themselves from inflation and make their daily life easier while many middle class venezuelans already try to protect their savings from hyperinflation by purchasing u s dollars and even gold nuggets saving in crypto offers a solution to store wealth that may be physically safer than holding on to cash or precious metals in a crime infested country online platforms that allow venezuelans to buy and hold u s dollars provide a similar service storing cryptocurrency presents greater financial risks than holding u s dollars though due to the wild swings in the value of some crypto assets including bitcoin but in venezuela where the local bolivar currency has lost two thirds of its value this year some merchants are willing to give this technology a shot in barquisimeto leticia luque an informal merchant said she began to accept crypto payments two months ago at the request of a social worker collaborating with givecrypto s direct transfer scheme she said the technology has helped her gain time to barter for better prices with suppliers and plan what she will buy next we used to be in a rush to purchase goods before our bolivars lost their value said luque whose husband travels every week to colombia to stock up on packaged foods and basic goods that the couple re sells out of their home now we can take our time and we know that our earnings are in a safe place waltman said the barquisimeto experiment was the first stage of a larger effort to promote the use of cryptocurrency in venezuela using stable currencies whose values have less fluctuation than bitcoin a similar initiative known as an airdrop is being developed by airtm a currency exchange platform based in mexico city that plans to donate small amounts of cryptocurrency to 100 000 people in venezuela this summer so far it has raised 300 000 from donations toward its 1 million goal the one time payment of no more than 10 a person will provide only momentary relief but the goal is also to encourage venezuelans to engage with the airtm platform we want to show venezuelans how to hold money outside their local currency said joshua kliot the organization s co founder the biggest impact this could have is to crypto ize the country and it s not just in venezuela where nonprofits are attempting to help vulnerable people by introducing them to digital currency platforms in europe bitnation a humanitarian agency has enabled hundreds of refugees without bank accounts to receive direct donations through bitcoin accounts in jordan the world food program delivers aid to 100 000 syrian refugees by creating digital currency accounts for each recipient using blockchain technology but official currencies to pay for goods refugees only need to have their iris scanned in participating stores paul lamb a nonprofit management consultant based in california says the idea of distributing funding directly to people in need is becoming increasingly popular among humanitarian groups because in some contexts it is cheaper than organizing the logistics required to physically hand out food or medicine usually these money transfers are made through debit cards in the local currency but humanitarian groups are also starting to look at cryptocurrency it s harder for someone to steal cryptocurrency said hugh aprile the colombia country director for mercy corps a nonprofit that has handed out debit cards to 7 000 venezuelan refugees and in situations where you have high inflation it can ensure the stability of the funds being transferred but aid programs that distribute cryptocurrency also face several challenges in venezuela power cuts like the one that recently left much of the country in the dark for days knock out the internet connection needed to use cryptocurrency and connections for many are iffy even when there is power a tightly controlled currency system that punishes financial crimes with jail time has also discouraged some merchants from accepting cryptocurrency merchants who accept crypto and are public about it risk being inspected by the government said randy brito the founder of bitcoin venezuela a cryptocurrency education group poverty is another barrier ariany jaimes a social worker who recruited participants for givecrypto s project in barquisimeto said she had to keep some of the neediest people out of the program because they didn t own smartphones with modern operating systems we realize that this technology is not going to become widespread overnight jaimes said but i do hope that these programs continue because they make our life a little easier follow nbc latino on facebook twitter and instagram
critics often claim that china is using its massive belt and road initiative as a form of coercive debt trap diplomacy to exert control over the countries that join its transnational infrastructure investment scheme this risk as deborah brautigam of john hopkins university recently noted is often exaggerated by the media in fact the bri may hold a different kind of risk for china itself at the recent bri summit in beijing chinese president xi jinping seemed to acknowledge the debt trap criticism in his address xi said that building high quality sustainable risk resistant reasonably priced and inclusive infrastructure will help countries to utilize fully their resource endowments this is an encouraging signal as it shows that china has become more aware of the debt implications of bri a study by the center for global development concluded that eight of the 63 countries participating in the bri are at risk of debt distress but as john maynard keynes memorably put it if you owe your bank a hundred pounds you have a problem but if you owe your bank a million pounds it has in the context of the bri china may turn out to be the banker who is owed a million pounds in particular china may fall victim to the obsolescing bargain model which states that a foreign investor loses bargaining power as it invests more in a host country infrastructure projects like those under the bri are a classic example because they are bulky bolted to the ground and have zero economic value if left incomplete unsurprisingly some bri partner countries are now demanding to renegotiate terms and typically after the projects have started china may be forced to offer ever more favorable concessions in order to keep the projects on track in mid april for example malaysia announced that a major bri rail project put on hold by the government after last year s election would now go ahead after renegotiation according to media reports the costs of construction were reduced by as much as one third other bri countries will probably also ask for debt forgiveness and write offs the costs of which will ultimately be borne by chinese savers the bri may well have additional hidden costs for china down the road for starters it is extraordinarily difficult to make money on infrastructure projects there is a widespread belief that infrastructure investment powers economic growth but the evidence for this is weak in fact china itself built much of its current infrastructure after its growth had taken off in the 1980s and 1990s for example china grew much faster than india despite having a shorter railway network according to the world bank in 1996 china had 56 678 kilometers 35 218 miles of rail lines and india had 62 915 kilometers chinese growth was not jump started by infrastructure but by reforms and human capital investments if growth fails to materialize in bri countries chinese companies may end up bearing the costs furthermore many of china s bri partner countries are risky including pakistan a major recipient of investments under the scheme in addition to its high political economic and default risks the country also scores poorly on education indicators according to one report pakistan ranked 180th among 221 countries in literacy this is a potential red flag for chinese investments in pakistan because research suggests that investments in physical infrastructure promote growth only in countries with high levels of human capital china itself benefited from its infrastructural investments because it had also invested heavily in education nor should the bri be compared to the marshall plan the us aid program to help rebuild western europe after world war ii as an example of how large scale investment projects can boost growth the marshall plan was so successful and at a fraction of the bri s cost because it helped generally well governed countries that had been temporarily disrupted by war aid acted as a stimulus that triggered growth several of the bri countries by contrast are plagued by economic and governance problems and lack basic requirements for growth simply building up their infrastructure will not be enough finally the bri will probably further strengthen china s state sector thereby increasing one of the long term threats to its economy according to a study by the american enterprise institute private firms accounted for only 28 of bri investments in the first half of 2018 the latest data available down by 12 percentage points from the same period of 2017 the bri s massive scale coupled with the lack of profitability of china s state sector means that projects under the scheme may need substantial support from chinese banks bri investments would then inevitably compete for funds and increasingly precious foreign exchange resources with china s domestic private sector which is already facing a high tax burden and the strains of the trade war with the us moreover western firms an important component of china s private sector are retreating from the country several us companies including amazon oracle seagate and uber as well as south korea s samsung and sk hynix and toshiba mitsubishi and sony from japan have either scaled down their china operations or decided to leave altogether partly as a result us foreign direct investment in china in 2017 was 2 6 billion compared to 5 4 billion in 2002 this is a worrisome development through the bri china is building ties to some of the world s most authoritarian financially opaque and economically backward countries at the same time a trade war an ever stronger state sector and protectionism are distancing china from the west china has grown and developed the capacity to undertake bri projects precisely because it opened its economy to globalization and to western technology and knowhow compared to its engagements with the west the bri may entail risks and uncertainties that could become problematic for the chinese economy as the chinese economy slows down and its export prospects are increasingly clouded by geopolitical factors it is worth rethinking the pace scope and scale of the bri yasheng huang is

the english educated la di da journalist s views on developing societies such as india are unimportant at best they are meant to denigrate us as they only service masters who perpetuate oligarchic geopolitical supremacy thankfully the average indian voter is numb to aware of and now contemptuous of such machinations in the light of the various doom and gloom articles about the indian elections in the economist time and the new york times released over the second half of the polling period i recently had the pleasure of appearing on the carvaka podcast to discuss the perceptions of indian politics in the international media and the ill fitting use of left right labels in indian politics in it among other points i argue that the average indian voter is a lot smarter than media elites credit them for and that they understand how to vote in their self interest better than any editor of an english language newspaper or magazine also the articles in such publications are aimed for domestic consumption among their core readership in the us and uk or to validate the feelings of wealthy urban indians who see themselves as future us or uk citizens with little to no impact on actual voting patterns in india the results that have come out this week only prove to validate this theory although it is not a particularly complex concept as those indians willing to pay for a subscription to the economist and those indians willing to line up to vote on a 40 degree day form a venn diagram with very little overlap in the first place and then this week we saw a fascinating set of articles come out within hours of each other in the new york times one which alleged that narendra modi s track record on issues is akin to bernie sanders left wing policy platform and the other which compared him to right wing demagogues such as donald trump viktor orban and recep tayyip erdoğan now most voters know that the truth is a lot more nuanced than that but why do we not see a reflection of this nuance in international coverage of indian politics and elections the reality behind international media coverage at the moment the current understanding of indian politics globally is incredibly superficial in fact the current understanding of politics outside of the us and uk among the english language media suffers from this problem whenever there is reporting on any country outside of the anglosphere journalists and editors working in the western media are generally not paid to make nuanced documentaries on other countries or be balanced in their reportage about countries which their audiences barely ever think about when a newspaper television channel or radio station in the us or uk chooses to pay attention to elections or politics in the rest of the world and this could be in wealthy developed countries in their backyards like france germany or sweden or emerging markets like russia or serbia or postcolonial countries like india or indonesia it is not to give their readership a political education into the history of each candidate or political movement in these countries it is to apply the us uk paradigm of left centre right onto these countries so that their audience knows who the good guys are who the bad guys are and who our guys are so that they superficially know if they should feel good or bad when the results come out even if they never intend to visit the country in question so we see a common trend of using outdated ill fitting paradigms to explain the politics of countries like india which have a very different socio economic and political context to that of the us or uk they treat a country like india as a blank canvas on which they can project a lot of the problems in their own society which they are either unwilling or unable to address back home this is not to say that we do not have problems of our own and that these publications are 100 per cent wrong 100 per cent of the time as a postcolonial developing country in the global south we do face massive challenges our country s politics society and economy are by no means perfect we do indeed have political parties which are based on regional parochial caste or linguistic identities we do have a law and order problem and a violence against women problem we are trapped in a infinite growth model that pits economic growth against ecological sustainability we are economically still a very unequal society and these are themes that many indian voters not only admit themselves but actively vote to address it is not inaccurate to say that these problems exist be it by the indian electorate or by foreign observers what is important to note however is that when the economist for example endorses one candidate over another saying rahul gandhi is the better of the two choices it does not mean that they have exemplary insight or expertise into what is good for ordinary indians or not it means they think this candidate is better for their readers their values and interests especially since the vast majority of indian voters can t even afford a subscription to the economist to read such an article in the first place heads i win tails you lose over the past five weeks of elections we have seen reports on indian politics which portray modi as an illiberal equivalent of trump netanyahu or orban or portray rahul gandhi as some sort of progressive indian justin trudeau they call the bjp a right wing hindu nationalist party to associate it with right wing republicans or white nationalists while calling the congress a centre left liberal party associating it with neoliberal centrist democrats there was even an article this week in the nation which called yogendra yadav who is not even standing for elections this year india s most prominent democratic socialist as the leader of the left wing swaraj india party which does not even have any seats in parliament and compared him to bernie sanders the simplistic analogies of this kind descended into a farce that very same day when the new york times featured an article by ruchir sharma not me the one from morgan stanley saying that he had hoped modi would be an economic conservative like ronald reagan but was disappointed to have seen that he had turned out to have more in common policy wise with the left wing agenda of bernie sanders possibly the us politician that the nyt editorial board loathes the most after trump and then within a few hours the same newspaper ran an article by jeffrey gettleman portraying modi as an amalgamation of every right wing demagogue from donald trump to viktor orban to recep tayyip erdoğan to even scott morrison the kind of leaders their readership abhors for those craving positive coverage of india in the international press let this be a wake up call it does not matter if india s prime minister is left wing or right wing liberal or conservative patriarchal or feminist whenever he or she acts in the nation s self interest instead of the economic or geopolitical interests of the other countries they will attract criticism from the international media no matter what they do this was true of nehru for supporting the non aligned movement it was true of indira gandhi for supporting bangladeshi independence it was true of morarji desai believing in swadeshi and gandhian socialism it was true of atal behari vajpayee for conducting nuclear tests at pokhran and it was true of manmohan singh for india s negotiating stance on climate change editors and journalists in the international media don t write articles to make indians feel good or india look good they write what sells well among their audiences and reflects the views of their editorial board and financiers from the perspective of hegemonic imperial states such as the us and uk media coverage of any rising power challenging their geopolitical monopoly will always negative be it japan during the 1980s germany in the 1990s russia in the 2000s or china in the 2010s this is proven by this week s new york times double whammy a classic case of heads i win tails you lose as the western media uses one hand to criticise modi for being too left wing and pro poor and wish he were more like the conservative icon reagan slashing taxes and regulation for big companies while the other hand criticises him for being too right wing and illiberal and wants to teach him tolerance after all the western chattering classes claim to be experts at tolerance towards vulnerable groups even if they only gave themselves that certificate to feel better about their track record of being either unwilling or unable to stop a ban on muslims entering their country or prevent 15 000 migrant children from being separated from their families and detained or their police and justice system brutalising people of colour or their politicians and policymakers saying that rescuing asylum seekers drowning in the mediterranean only encourages more immigration and then not only choosing to turn a blind eye to the drowning of 18 400 vulnerable men women and children of colour escaping conflict and persecution over the past five years but even criminalising priests professors firefighters and local politicians who try to help them if even 1 per cent of this was done under the leader of an african asian or latin american country we would hear editorials on a weekly basis about how the secular fabric of the country was being destroyed minorities living in fear of the state or the state destroying dissenting voices and institutions such as universities churches and civil society and there would either be articles about the coming of age of some obscure opposition politician whose party has 8 per cent of seats in their legislature or support for regime change or a coup d etat perhaps it would look something like this yet these doyens of tolerance feel that diverse pluralistic and multilingual societies in the global south need to learn tolerance and multiculturalism from their countries who are tearing their societies apart as they find themselves unable to process that the concept of equal rights also can cover those who do not look like or pray like them all their lip service to liberal values and human rights does not disguise the fact that these countries as many of their own more perceptive citizens have put it went from barbarism to decadence without civilisation in between the idea of india the cult of macaulay s children sometimes the editors of international publications show some degree of self awareness and know that they can t get away with writing lazy xenophobic orientalist stereotypes about savage indians needing western values to civilise them and that s when they weaponise their token writers of colour who are often wealthy london new york or washington denizens of indian origin working for an investment bank that begged for bailouts in 2008 a middle rung university looking for fee paying indian students or a think tank funded by the oil gas and tobacco industries or who are the most westernised and by extension trustworthy indians in the leafy streets of central delhi leaving the ring road means entering a world a bit too hot and dusty for the newspaper s india correspondent s comfort after all the hardship allowance only goes so far this is made easy by the fact that many postcolonial countries have an elite today which has adopted the language culture and mannerisms of their former colonial masters and when western journalists academics or companies come to india they work together with these people who they see as more western than indian and thus more credible reliable and easy to work with these elites are often educated through western paradigms and often share and validate the same opinions on india that a western observer would have as prime minister morarji desai said in an interview on thames television in 1977 i should know having narrowly escaped such a fate myself being an anglophone urban indian who went to private schools where french or german were taught rather than sanskrit or marathi or gujarati and a university in delhi famous for studying history and politics through a marxist lens which meant i was constantly surrounded by this social group throughout my education and social life i could even have turned out to be like one of them were it not for a healthy anticolonial scepticism if not contempt of american and british bourgeois values developed through an appreciation for non western perspectives from the second and third world nevertheless my peer group as did i would religiously read the hindu every morning and frontline every month watch debates on ndtv every evening and occasionally get invited to the studio talk about the subtle differences between obscure parties in west bengal such as the all india forward bloc and the revolutionary socialist party and supported the student wing of the cpi m the students federation of india in university elections even while the left front descended from being the supposedly moral and incorruptible permanent opposition to supporting a venal upa coalition at the centre having being an insider within such an academic and social environment i would even go as far as to say that even today in 2019 the top rungs of our society and education system actively incentivise people to act precisely the way lord macaulay envisaged in his famous minute on indian education back in 1835 to put it simply when our top schools and universities churn out pankaj mishras and arundhati roys this is not a bug in the system but the key feature creating such specimens is the entire point of the educational system we inherited from the british raj and those who come out with some form of critical reasoning or self awareness or cultural roots intact are the unintended bugs and defective products to be stamped out and ostracised from the establishment so just like those indians employed as clerical staff and commercial middlemen during british colonial times a tiny substratum at the socio economic summit of indian society is nowadays cultivated and encouraged to write about india the way their editorial masters in the west used to back during their colonial mission civilisatrice but cannot get away with anymore they portray aspirational middle class and working class indians with their traditional indigenous value systems and beliefs as illiterate bigoted superstitious savage natives who don t know what is good for the country and need a neo feudal mai baap state to keep their base passions in check and protect the idea of india by hoarding all social capital at the top while throwing the poor just enough crumbs to keep them alive in a phenomenon that cambridge scholar ayşe zarakol has termed auto orientalism or self orientalism the educated classes within postcolonial or post conflict countries are shamed through stigmatisation for their history or cultural traditions and then internalise validate and amplify this shame among their own country and to the establishment abroad as she observed in after defeat how the east learned to live with the west aatish taseer the author of the recent divider in chief profile on modi in time is funnily enough the lutyens insider who put it best when discussing one of the leading indian activist authors from among this comprador bourgeoisie arundhati roy back in 2011 when she used to criticise the congress government so when western editors journalists or academics want to portray india a certain way be it out of misplaced good intentions outright malice or simply laziness they in turn get validation from our westernised elite who are willing to write what makes the western establishment happy acting as their interlocutors to a set of indigenous cultures and languages both sets of self serving elites perceive as inferior the best example of this was the recent hasan minhaj episode on indian elections which regurgitated 5 years worth of lazy misguided or malicious anglophone media tropes into a convenient little video package and put the cherry on the cake by having an american of indian origin present it with the authority and immunity from criticism that comes from his indian ancestry a neat little microcosm of the media landscape that we live in now being a video it is best analysed in video form itself and since the sham sharma show and carvaka podcast on youtube have already dissected that episode quite well i need not go into it but to put it simply we live in an era of private for profit media and this is the narrative that editors feel is the one that is most profitable to them it makes either their audiences happy or their financers we live in a capitalist era and society for better or worse so there s very little point in outraging at unfair treatment by these media outlets if they want to go with this narrative by all means they should do what they want it s a business decision on their part they aren t writing for indian middle class voters they are writing for the audiences that buy their subscriptions what it does mean though is that we as consumers of this media and these narratives need to understand something important that if the economist or time or the new york times endorses rahul gandhi over narendra modi or even vice versa for the 2019 election it is not necessarily a reflection of this magazine really thinking that rahul or modi would be better for the vast majority of indians but rather a reflection of who is better for the interests of the publication s owners and target demographics who can afford a subscription just because it s published in london or new york does not mean it is more credible or reliable or neutral than any politically affiliated indian publication out of new delhi chennai or kolkata so read the news with your eyes open and consume it with a pinch of salt one does not see hand wringing from chinese or russian audiences saying that they feel ashamed to be from their country just because the economist or nyt wrote an unflattering portrait of their leader nor does one see japanese audiences saying they can t sleep at night because some asian american stand up comedian joked about shinzo abe so as to pivot his career from making tired jokes about his immigrant parents to making political analysis for those blessed with the attention span of a toddler they understand that this is simply people working in the media abroad doing their jobs and propagating the narratives their employers and target audiences incentivise them to craft and if the public in non western countries do not agree with these narratives rather than outraging about them many countries choose a more effective approach setting their own narratives that matches their experiences and perspectives and letting it compete in what classical liberals call the marketplace of ideas qatar s al jazeera is a leading exponent of this approach as are to a lesser extent russia s rt and sputnik turkey s trt china s cctv and japan s nhk rather than getting worked up every time you see the international media s slanted coverage push for rajya sabha tv wion or your favourite indian media outlet to think big and go toe to toe with them there is no good or bad in the media and geopolitics only self interest so when a media outlet or think tank or university in the west sends foreign experts or hires local compradors to guide people in postcolonial or post conflict countries a certain way it is imperative that the public take their advice with a pinch of salt to put it simply western governments are not your friend the western media is not your friend western companies are not your friend there are no friends in geopolitics there is no good no evil no left wing no right wing there is only self interest none of these entities have anything to gain from the advancement or upliftment or self interest of the average indian voter at best they can represent the interests of one or two substrata of indian society and at worst they represent purely the interests of their paymasters so when these western economists journalists and academics say to indians if only you acted more like us one day you too could be rich like us or you should be more socially liberal like hillary clinton or you should be more economically conservative like ronald reagan or you should build a social democratic welfare state or capitalism with a human face just like we did in the 60s it is not because aping the west will magically solve all of our problems and lift us into the club of rich developed nations they are not waiting at the finish line to give us a big hug a gold medal and a seat at the un security council or the oecd by giving their input on our society economy or politics they are acting in their own self interest because the current systems at the international level be they economic or geopolitical are designed to keep certain countries poor weak and unstable so that the wealth power and stability of certain other countries are maintained in this light the negative portrayal of indian leaders is not a phenomenon which has magically appeared over the past five years with the arrival of the divisive modi the new york times the economist and time have written about every indian prime minister with hostility often reserving their most vitriol for nehru and indira gandhi back in the 1960s and 1970s for not bowing down to the geopolitical interests of the us and uk leave aside india these publications do not have a kind word for any postcolonial or independent minded country which challenges the washington consensus on neoliberal economics or the blairite clintonite third way of social liberalism combined with economic conservatism if you have the time or inclination have a wade through the archives of these publications over the past 70 years the anglophone media has never praised a foreign country or leader until and unless they totally capitulated to western interests and started putting the economic or geopolitical interests of the us or uk ahead of their own citizens welfare so who do we see them praising rebel groups whom their governments finance like the moderate rebels who have destroyed syria or the anti soviet warrior who put his army on the road to peace osama bin laden or puppet dictators like suharto in indonesia augusto pinochet in chile or yahya khan and zia ul haq in pakistan who turned their countries into american client states and killed anyone who opposed such a move with sadistic glee and who do they have a history of vilifying independent minded leaders of independent minded countries who questioned and challenged the geopolitical defaults of their time olof palme of sweden for using the country s diplomatic neutrality to criticise the vietnam war urho kekkonen of finland for refusing to join nato because the neighbouring ussr was its largest trading partner the mild mannered salvador allende of chile for nationalising his country s copper industry indira gandhi for standing up against genocide in east pakistan and supporting the mukti bahini for bangladeshi independence kenneth kaunda the gandhian of zambia who stood up to white supremacist states like rhodesia and apartheid south africa kwame nkrumah the african nationalist leader of ghana who sent troops to support decolonisation in the congo and supported black activism against the white minority ruled smith regime in rhodesia there was not a kind word among the western establishment for these leaders until their funerals foreign media an integral part of their countries geopolitical establishment the establishment is not necessarily made up of the individual politicians who are in charge for 4 or 5 years at a time the establishment comprises individuals and institutions in the worlds of academia business policy and the media who use their social capital to get what they want in the long term regardless of which individual politicians are in power the economist or nyt or washington post may superficially oppose trump as a candidate or politician but when his administration flexes its muscles to threaten a regime change in venezuela or war with iran they quickly fall into line without question because that is what they have been conditioned to do to them american exceptionalism and imperialism is always good and worth supporting regardless if it s with a liberal humanitarian democratic face or a neo conservative realist republican face the reason these major publications are considered part of the establishment in the west is that they unquestioningly toe the line of their state s geopolitical interests there are many famous examples of this even beyond india for one after the 1996 presidential elections in russia where gennady zyuganov of the reformed communist party of the russian federation was the clear favourite bill clinton deployed the us government to support massive electoral fraud in favour of the drunken and incompetent boris yeltsin ignoring the mass sentiments among the russian populace and administration that this election was rigged the american media approvingly echoed clinton when he called the election of yeltsin a victory for democracy it became such a common fact that the 1996 election was fraudulent that even president dimitry medvedev could say so out at a meeting with opposition leaders in 2012 to their agreement and then after enough time has passed for the damage to russia s economy society and geopolitical power to be complete the establishment media then reports with surprise at the revelations that the electoral victory of the candidate they were cheerleading was a sham with headlines like rewriting russian history did boris yeltsin steal the 1996 presidential election the establishment media also wholeheartedly approved the shock therapy neo liberal reforms that western experts imposed on russia under yeltsin which led to a collapse in society during the wild 90s as the reins of the economy were handed over to a criminal class of elite oligarchs through botched and fraudulent privatisations while healthcare and welfare standards fell so dramatically that the country s death rate skyrocketed and still has not normalised 25 years later when a senior executive at morgan stanley or fellow at an american think tank says that they dream of a ronald reagan for india to create big bang reforms and a free market economy this is what such a dream looks like in reality an anarchic handover of the economy to a criminal elite hand in glove with foreign interests like the manmohan singh era in india but worse this lost decade was an unmitigated demographic and socio economic disaster for the vast majority of russian people but according to the economist it was probably worth it because liberal western economic values and reforms had prevailed and for the us policy and business establishment it was worth it because not only did the only other superpower since the second world war implode american companies got to profit from dirt cheap privatisations and opening another market for mcdonald s and coca cola but then surprise surprise 20 years after all that uncritical cheerleading jeffrey sachs the then harvard economics professor who was portrayed in the west as the charming boyish face of russia s economic reforms came out to say these are also the publications who unquestioningly consumed and regurgitated the lies and fabricated intelligence that led to the iraq war manufacturing consent among their readership to use the term popularised by noam chomsky to approve a war against a secular country that had nothing to do with radical islamism behind the 11 september attacks a war that destabilised the entire middle east and led to the resurgence of al qaeda in iraq and syria and the creation of isis whose atrocities have now spanned paris to colombo and again about 15 years later once the damage is done and short term us foreign policy goals completed the editors and journalists involved suddenly find their consciences pretend to introspect and promise to do better by speaking truth to power before wholeheartedly and blindly supporting us intervention in libya syria and venezuela all over again our constitution was written to end foreign and elitist rule not ossify it for any country not in the club of wealthy powerful nations and their client states it is absurd to crave or even expect the approval of the anglosphere and their media like the apocryphal story of the chataka or pied cuckoo which only drinks falling rainwater and would rather die of thirst than drink from the ground we can look up to the west for as long as we like waiting for approval to trickle down but it won t come contrary to the myths about the chataka only drinking rainwater they quite happily drink water from lakes and ponds so rather than waiting for our would be neo colonial masters to trickle down some elite approval our way our ruling classes have a huge lake to drink from the approval of 1 3 billion indians which is more important than that of a few dozen editors and journalists in london new york and lodhi road all they need to do to access this lake of mass approval is bend down from their mighty pedestals that is after all why in 1950 india chose to become a democracy so that our legislators and ministers would reflect the values aspirations and democratic will of our population rather than disenfranchised masses being ruled directly by a bureaucracy of civil servants hand picked by the elite through an exam and interview like in colonial india or confucian china ambedkar and the constituent assembly designed a constitution that would allow a sovereign india to act in accordance with the interests of its people be they rich or poor educated or illiterate traditional or westernised it was not written for the benefit of other countries or merely as a tool to allow an indigenous english educated elite to take over from british administrators roles in the indian civil service it was a radical revolutionary document to empower citizens not a reactionary elitist manifesto to protect abstract values from the base passions of the masses it was a repudiation of the inscription which still exists above the main entrance to sir edwin lutyens and herbert baker s central secretariat on raisina hill which exemplified british colonialism the results of the election have come out this week and with them those among the chattering classes and twitterati who will now shame indian voters for having voted the wrong way and will now wring their hands about how they are ashamed to be indian and how their dreams of becoming us and uk citizens are dashed because over there they will now be painted with the same brush as these hoi polloi because the voters have delivered a result that displeases the western masters so they smear poor voters who cannot fight back in tv studios or opinion columns as illiterate parochial bigots for having voted based on their own experiences aspirations and interests rather than voting the way the media and establishment tried to shame and force them into just so you know there s nothing wrong with acting in your own self interest we live in a capitalist democracy in a realist pragmatist geopolitical world where if you don t act in your own self interest you get walked over and squashed by those who do the system expects and incentivises individuals companies and countries to do so and punishes those who do not we do not need to put western coverage of india onto a pedestal nor the opinions of their experts be they westerners or indians they aren t sending correspondents or academics to india or even hiring indian staff as some sort of big altruistic favour to us out of their generosity to share the secrets of their successful society they are sending and hiring these people to achieve their own goals and it is imperative that one recognises that indian voters do not need western lenses to tell us how to understand our society around us we have our own eyes we have our own experiences and most people back themselves to trust these experiences and vote for whoever makes sense in this light not because this newspaper or that magazine or some celebrity tells us to some urban bourgeois indians have voted for the congress some for the bjp some even for the cpi m or mns some rural subaltern indians have voted for the bsp jd u sp rjd and some for the bjp or congress some of these votes translated into seats some did not nevertheless each of these voices is equal and legitimate and in a country with equal voting rights for all one vote for each citizen shaming an overwhelmingly poor electorate for expressing their democratic aspirations by having voted for the wrong candidate is denying the subaltern their voice whether it was when they elected the bsp s mayawati as chief minister of uttar pradesh in the 2000s or whether it is the nda winning close to 350 seats in the lok sabha in 2019 criticise the policies parties and candidates if you must but criticising the voters is punching below the belt it is not a victory of democracy only when your favourite candidate wins every free fair and peaceful election where everyone s vote is treated equally is a victory for democracy regardless of the result our eminent intellectuals and media personalities famously ask can the subaltern speak but when they do speak through the ballot and say the wrong things or make the wrong choices in the eyes of those who think they know best these same champions of the poor either ignore or discredit their voices as those of illiterate bigots who do not value democracy be it pankaj mishra s hand wringing about the dangers of whatsapp being in the hands of the poor or the congress spokesperson who went on television to say that their party did not do well in north india because voters there are uneducated and quite frankly the voters respond by returning the favour ignoring and embarrassing the establishment media every time they speak although this is not a new phenomenon it is as old as our democracy in 1977 in response to a question from a foreign journalist about the challenge of democracy in a country plagued by an urban rural divide illiteracy and the lack of a highly informed public or the need to impose certain values upon them from the top down the epitome of moderation in political and personal life morarji desai had this to say with an eloquence and accent that would confound those who think speaking english is a monopoly of congress leaders like nehru and tharoor the election results have only served to reinforce that the average indian voter does not care about what happens in this anglophone bubble since they consume news and opinions in indian languages not english and to these voters even when they do hear that their country or prime minister made the news abroad it does not matter to them whether the portrayal was positive or negative the man or woman on the street often much to the chagrin of the ndtv senior reporter holding the microphone says it makes them proud to see that the world is finally paying attention to india modi ne desh ka naam roshan kiya was heard from ordinary voters across cities and villages around the country over the elections maybe the old adage is true that there s no such thing as bad publicity perhaps their lack of exposure to macaulayan education has kept their immunity to auto orientalism intact or it may just be that it is these voters in villages and smaller towns outside the gated communities of our metros who understand the age old advice attributed by some to mahatma gandhi and some to trade unionist nicholas klein on this matter better than anyone else vox populi vox dei the voice of the people is the voice of god
says it has helped price stability real output growth obinna chima the central bank of nigeria cbn governor mr godwin emefiele has again justified the unconventional monetary policy approach the bank had adopted particularly in forex market and development financing saying it has helped to optimally balance the delicate objectives of price stability and real output growth emefiele spoke yesterday at the distinguished leadership programme lecture series titled up against the tide nigeria s heterodox monetary policy and the bretton woods consensus which he delivered at the university of ibadan oyo state the cbn governor explained that just like fiscal policy monetary policy could at a time when development challenges abound complement the efforts of fiscal policy in employment generation wealth creation and attainment of other growth objectives the cbn governor told his audience that much of the successes the apex bank achieved in the past few years were partly due to the adoption of heterodox macroeconomic policies he highlighted countries such as the united states of america brazil among others that had to rely on unconventional monetary in times of economic difficulties to resuscitate growth within the cbn our unconventional methods especially in the management of the forex market and our development financing supported by the orthodox approaches in the form of our timely adjustments of monetary policy rate have been able to optimally balance the delicate objectives of price stability and real output growth we will continue to develop policy instruments and device ways of ensuring that an optimal mix of heterodox policies is continually deployed to engender the overall wellbeing and prosperity of the nigerian economy our overall aim remains the concurrent attainment of price stability real growth full employment and poverty reduction he added emefiele who recalled the challenges that confronted the nigerian economy in 2016 when it slipped into recession as well as various initiatives and policies that were introduced to revive the economy noted that in april 2017 the investors and exporters i e window which allowed investors and exporters to purchase and sell foreign exchange at the prevailing market rate played a vital role in this regard he further added in addition exchange rate management was further liberalised following the operationalisation of the revised guidelines for the operation of the nigerian inter bank foreign exchange market in june 2016 the commencement of this policy guideline introduced the naira settled foreign exchange futures market relative to our peers the favourable outcomes and strengthening outlook of the nigerian economy is traceable to the timeous adoption on non traditional policy methods the cbn has been able to reduce inflation build our forex reserves maintained forex market stability and foster real growth nonetheless challenges still remain the pace of population growth at about 2 6 per cent still outstrips real growth rate while inflation is outside our tolerance band unemployment rate and incidence of poverty remain at unacceptable levels as many of us already know balancing the objectives of price stability with output stabilisation especially in the face of external headwinds remains a challenge to monetary policy and central banks particularly in emerging and developing economies since the global financial crisis many central banks have begun to promote structural transformation and economic growth beyond the singular mandate of price stability consequently policy toolkits now contain instruments that are aimed at developing the financial sector engendering wider financial inclusion and aligning financial policies with sustainable development and growth emefiele stressed that the development finance initiatives of the central bank was aimed at growth driving and employment generating sectors which he said had equally not gone down well with the proponents of conventional monetary policy tools he however noted that critics of unconventional monetary policy had acknowledged that measures adopted by the cbn have had a positive impact on output and employment they assert that these tools constitute quasi fiscal activities furthermore he said in the view of some critics for instance our forex policies constitute exchange restrictions rationing of forex discretionary allocation based on priority categories and a multiple currency practice many are also unaccepting of our 41 items restriction and its recent increase to 43 items regardless of its apparent successes while there is sufficient evidence of significant reductions in our annual import bill increased non oil output and exports and a robust balance of payment position these critics assert that we are restricting trade and creating unfair competition to our critics who are against the imposition of the forex restrictions conventional monetary policy requires that to encourage domestic production we should impose higher tariffs and levies however our experience in nigeria has shown that this practice has never worked due to certain inefficiencies in attaining these objectives our targeted focus on the agricultural and industrial sectors were driven by the vast opportunities for growth in these sectors given our high population it was also instrumental in taking nigeria out of the recession in 2017 over 50 per cent of the contributions to gdp growth came from the agriculture and industrial sectors these sectors have the ability to absorb the growing labor pool of eligible workers in our effort to meet the household consumption needs of the nigerian populace if efforts were made to improve productivity gains in these sectors it will reduce our dependence on imported items that could be produced in nigeria furthermore improved productivity in the agriculture and manufacturing could also help in reducing our dependence on proceeds from crude oil in 2017 nigeria s total revenue from exports of crude oil was us 23 billion relative to indonesia which earned close to us 22 billion from the export of palm oil in 2017 nigeria has vast amounts of arable land that can be put to good use in the cultivation of not only palm oil but also cotton cocoa tomatoes and rice to mention a few supporting growth in the agriculture and industrial sectors is critical in our efforts to create a diversified wealth base for the country emefiele explained

a dirt field overgrown with weeds is the incongruous entrance to one of america s wealthiest towns a short walk to a rodeo drive like stretch replete with upscale stores such as tiffany co but this sad patch of land is also the physical manifestation of a broader turf war over what type of housing and ultimately what type of people to allow within westport s borders first of two parts it started when a developer known for building large luxury homes envisioned something different back in 2014 for the 2 2 acre property a mix of single and multifamily housing that would accommodate up to 12 families a higher density project is more cost efficient he said and would allow him to sell the units for less than the typical westport home but the site was zoned to hold no more than four single family houses so he needed approval from a reluctant westport planning and zoning commission which denied his plan residents erupted in fury each time he made a scaled back proposal and it took the developer four years after purchasing the property to win approval to build two duplexes and five single family homes you are selling out westport one resident yelled out as the final plan came up for a commission vote last spring other residents picketed commission meetings with signs reading zoning is a promise the commission s discussion was couched in what some would regard as code words and never directly addressed race or income chip stephens a republican planning and zoning commissioner voted against the plan declaring to me it s too much density it s putting too much in a little area to me this is ghettoizing westport now under construction these two bedroom duplexes and single family homes have a price tag of 1 2 million the going rate for a home in this swanky village just outside bridgeport and norwalk we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to get this through would i do this all over again no probably not said the developer johnny schwartz of able construction welcome to connecticut a state with more separate and unequal housing than nearly everywhere else in the country separation by design westport is only one example of a wealthy connecticut suburb that has surrounded itself with invisible walls to block affordable housing and by extension the people who need it in a liberal state that has provided billions in taxpayer money to create more affordable housing decisions at local zoning boards the capitol and state agencies have thwarted court rulings and laws intended to remedy housing segregation as far back as data has been kept connecticut s low income housing has been concentrated in poor cities and towns an imbalance that has not budged over the last three decades many zoning boards rely on their finely tuned regulations to keep housing segregation firmly in place they point to frail public infrastructure clogged streets a lack of sidewalks and concerns of overcrowding that would damage what s often referred to as neighborhood character an investigation by the connecticut mirror and propublica has found that more than three dozen connecticut towns have blocked construction of any privately developed duplexes and apartments within their borders for the last two decades often through exclusionary zoning requirements in 18 of those towns it s been at least 28 years in westport where gated residences overlook long island sound and voters solidly backed democrats in the most recent state and presidential elections private developers have been allowed to open just 65 affordable housing units over the last three decades public housing rentals operated by the local housing authority have also grown at a snail s pace with 71 new units opening in this charming small town of 10 400 homes the impact of this logjam on families is that the share of housing specifically dedicated for low income residents has actually decreased by small percentages in one quarter of connecticut s municipalities since 1990 i think the vestiges of our racial past are far from over said former democratic gov dannel p malloy who left office in early 2019 after eight years and regularly butted heads with general assembly members who wanted local officials to have even more authority over housing decisions for minority residents striving for safe and affordable housing the state has denied the opportunity that we allowed white middle class aspirants to access malloy said meanwhile state lawmakers and bureaucrats watch from the sidelines reluctant to intervene this doesn t appear likely to change any time soon gov ned lamont a democrat from greenwich who took office this year declined to be interviewed for this story but he has said his statewide goal is to work collaboratively with the locals in terms of what they want and what they are not willing to take at the end of the day that community will probably take the lead on making that choice lisa tepper bates lamont s senior coordinator for housing and transit oriented development said in an interview that the administration hopes to bring change by adopting a different philosophy which is to go to the communities and try and have this discussion and try and see how far we can get restrictive zoning ashana cunningham a 33 year old mother of three lives 9 miles from westport s posh downtown each workday she takes a bus from a homeless shelter in bridgeport where she lives with her family among a landscape of abandoned factories run down houses and trash lined streets to her job in a suburban cornucopia a few miles away she tends to children from privileged families at a pricey day care in fairfield two days a week she works a second job at family dollar this is not the life cunningham imagined she earned an associate degree to become a medical assistant but has never made more than 14 an hour she and her wife struggled to pay 1 200 a month rent for a small bridgeport apartment and then her wife became disabled and could not work a car crash further complicated their lives cunningham was injured and left without transportation and ultimately out of a job by the time she found the day care job which pays 12 50 an hour the family was living in the shelter where the smell of bleach lingers and bachata music from a neighbor s apartment pulses through the walls her second job as a cashier pays 11 dollars an hour she knows that she is trapped that moving to a town like westport trumbull or fairfield is impossible there s no other place for us to go fairfield or trumbull forget about it cunningham said you can t afford to pay your rent if you are only making 707 every two weeks build where you can racial and economic segregation is not unique to connecticut but it is extreme and runs counter to the state s liberal image democrats have controlled the state legislature for 22 years and the governor s mansion for eight in southwest connecticut the gap between rich and poor is wider than anywhere else in the country black and hispanic residents statewide live in some of the nation s most segregated neighborhoods census data shows the repercussions of living in segregated neighborhoods often last a lifetime neighborhoods matter researchers at brown harvard and the u s census bureau concluded the opportunity atlas they created makes clear just how much it matters by showing the stark differences in where the 20 5 million children they tracked ended up for example children who grew up in cunningham s bridgeport neighborhood were five times more likely to be imprisoned on april 1 2010 than those who grew up 2 miles down the road over the fairfield line the bridgeport natives also made half the income of their fairfield peers but the families of low income children have few housing options in connecticut s higher opportunity neighborhoods 63 of the state s 169 municipalities have no housing authorities to facilitate the creation of public housing and manage it in southwest connecticut where cunningham lives with her family it costs 3 5 times more to live near high scoring elementary schools than the struggling schools her children attend the brookings institution reported would be movers would have to spend about 25 000 more per year on housing to make that jump brookings found malloy now a visiting professor at boston college explained in an interview why such a large share of affordable housing that opened during his tenure was in the poorest neighborhoods you build where you can where a community is inviting he said i do believe that there is not an openness and willingness to have the people who work in town live in town maybe that s because some towns want everyone to be the same i don t know why a town wouldn t want a fireman or a policeman or a day care worker who works in their community to be able to live in that community during malloy s years in office his administration directed 2 1 billion in public funding to renovate run down public housing or build new housing so more low income residents have an affordable place to live the new housing was disproportionately built in the state s poorest communities however three quarters of the new units constructed since 2011 were in the state s 10 poorest municipalities although only 20 of connecticut s housing stock is located in these communities just over 5 opened in the 10 wealthiest towns government subsidies aside another way to bring down housing costs is to build duplexes or apartments on a lot but that s not being allowed in many communities despite state law requiring local zoning commissions to encourage such development in order to promote housing choice and economic diversity in housing while dozens of towns have not permitted any duplexes and apartments to be built in two decades the multi unit construction in another three dozen towns just replaced similar units that had been demolished this new construction data only includes privately owned residential developments and not public housing dorms or hotels little multi unit housing local zoning rules are often to blame for the lack of more affordable development you can t even build a duplex zoning just kills it said sean ghio policy director at the partnership for strong communities an advocacy group that lobbies for more affordable housing people often fear the unknown and as a result try to keep the unknown out of their lives by maintaining the status quo the status quo in connecticut is living in segregated communities local officials however say there are often legitimate reasons to deny multi unit housing because local infrastructure is not in place or there are environmental concerns unfortunately we are limited in what we can provide said joyce stille who since 1995 has been the administrative officer of bolton a small town in central connecticut that has limited sewer access and where just one duplex has received a permit in 30 years because of our proximity to vernon and manchester we don t really need any they have such a wide range of options people don t come to bolton because bolton has a higher cost of living only 19 cities or towns allow housing with three or more units to be built without requiring special permits according to a 2013 review by trinity college s cities suburbs and schools project and the connecticut fair housing center twenty five municipalities explicitly prohibit such housing and 123 require a special town permit in some towns that do allow it other zoning requirements make it exceedingly difficult for projects to come to fruition since they need more land to build anything besides a single family home for example monroe a high income town in southwest connecticut requires at least 70 acres for multifamily housing construction and each unit may have no more than two bedrooms a single family home requires 1 acre in its specially zoned housing opportunity district 20 acres of land are required to build multifamily housing but because of density restrictions only 13 apartments or townhomes may be built avon requires 15 acres for a two unit home compared with 1 3 acre for a single family residence a large lot requirement makes it financially infeasible for such housing to be built that s just logic said fionnuala darby hudgens who did the analysis that connecticut s department of housing used in its mandatory report to the federal government on exclusionary zoning a watered down law all of this comes 30 years after the connecticut supreme court ruled for the first time that exclusionary zoning practices that quash moderate priced housing are illegal that groundbreaking case involved a truck driver attempting to build an affordable single family home in middle class east hampton that was smaller than the minimum square feet the town required the justices ruled against the town saying its requirements are a form of economic discrimination in the following months state lawmakers passed a law that set the stage for the courts to review local zoning decisions in towns with few affordable homes most notably the law commonly referred to by its statutory reference as 8 30g outlined the process for developers to bypass local zoning decisions by going through the courts if they set aside 30 of a project s units for poor people but the law had limited impact just 2 of all the housing developed in connecticut since then is dedicated to low income families since the law passed the share of housing for low income residents has actually decreased in 47 of the state s 169 municipalities according to state department of housing data any developer who s going to use has to be ready for the potential of a long expensive slog first through the zoning commission and then through the court system said timothy hollister the land use attorney who won the east hampton case he has been trying since 2005 to win approval for a client to open affordable units in westport each year legislators file a slew of bills to weaken the law state rep brenda kupchick a republican from fairfield who served as the ranking member of the legislature s housing committee from 2013 to 2018 said her top committee priority is to scale back the law predatory developers are taking advantage of communities and we aren t getting much affordable units out of it she said in 30 years the needle hasn t moved it s not working let s brainstorm and come up with some ideas that may actually work former senate minority leader john mckinney a republican from fairfield said amending the law was a big issue for his caucus during his 16 years in the state senate look i get the argument that you need it you can t let the westports and the greenwiches off you have to have something i just think there is a better way said mckinney who left office in 2014 to run for governor a bid he ultimately lost he and kupchick say the state should provide financial incentives for towns that allow more affordable housing to be built within their borders after years of failed attempts lawmakers in 2017 finally weakened 8 30g by making it easier for towns to get exemptions from the law s requirements malloy vetoed the measure because he said it would perpetuate the harmful effects of bad economic policy and institutional segregation but the general assembly overrode the veto little poverty or affordable housing this march the department of housing granted westport where 3 4 of the housing is considered affordable a four year exemption which prevents a judge from overriding its zoning decisions the exemption protects the town from legal challenges but it came after the zoning commission had already approved 44 new low income units mostly studios or one bedroom units with monthly rents starting at 1 400 a commissioner made it clear during project hearings that only the threat of a lawsuit under 8 30g persuaded him to approve the plans and now that threat is gone westport currently has 265 units for low income individuals that were constructed with public or private funding though one third of those units replaced existing affordable housing for example the town purchased westport s only trailer park and replaced its 60 mobile homes with 93 affordable apartments run by the local housing authority what this means is that approximately 1 out of every 30 housing units in westport is dedicated to low or moderate income residents compared with 1 in 8 next door in norwalk or 1 in 5 in bridgeport 9 miles away in early may the commissioners signaled they were prepared to reject a new batch of affordable units they say they are doing a great job developing affordable housing they are unnecessary danielle dobin a democratic commissioner said during the panel s discussion of the proposed units this commission and the commission before us have been very successful in creating so much more affordable housing in westport just over 4 of westport residents are considered to be living in poverty two and a half times less than the state s poverty rate just under 1 of those who live in this town are black and 5 are hispanic a long way off from the state s makeup the lamont administration expressed satisfaction with the current law as it stands 8 30g is the law in connecticut and can be one of many important tools we have to ensure that the housing our residents need is available to them bates the senior coordinator for housing and transit oriented development said the administration is seeking no changes at this time asked what happens if minds can t be changed bates declined to talk about next steps i constitutionally don t believe that in general people s minds can t be changed i think it s a question of whether there is an effective way to engage them in discussion and conversation i think sometimes you can go a lot further that way bates said you know this is a new administration so it is hard to come into it and say you are ready to beat somebody with a hammer when you haven t had that conversation with them this article was produced through a partnership between propublica and the connecticut mirror which is a member of the

by chenayi mutambasere so recently we have had another keep calm message and moment from our local oxford university professor mthuli ncube he has or is going to draw down usd 500million to address the economic crisis he said recently over the past weekend the pertinent question on everyone s mind is what difference if any will this draw down make to the lives of ordinary zimbabweans to attempt to answer this question let us consider the socio economic history and current state in zimbabwe the cycle of economic crisis in zimbabwe is currently is on the main attributed to 2016 when the then finance minister patrick chinamasa recklessly withdrew funds from the reserve bank to pay off a huge part of zimbabwe s international debt the minister hedged on the fact that if the debts were paid this would stimulate the extension of credit lines from the imf et al but with zanu pf proudly holding on to their corruption and human rights violation titles this was not to be the case of course it never will be as long as it is zanu pf many of us in the diaspora watched a desperate chinamasa with his begging bowl on sky news many a time asking for money while praising mugabe s regime oxymoron anyone what the minister should have known is that a country being in debt is not necessarily a bad thing for as long as it is sticking to the payment conditions and it is minimising on its own risk look at the biggest economy in the world america the country has been thriving on debt for decades owing trillions including to china its direct and immediate competitor but to this day it thrives this own goal by chinamasa cost the country something to the tune of 1 8 billion almost the exact amount owed to the world bank by zimbabwe put simply if you and your household want to pay off a huge debt you first put a plan in place before further bankrupting your family you would either reduce spending or increase income but goz continued to spend on their frills amidst a struggling agricultural economy infact chinamasa literally went to the bank and demanded the money that was available from the banking corporation s over night deposits withdrew it all and off he went with it to pay off the debt the government continued to spend recklessly without any care including allowing the then president robert mugabe s numerous hospital trips abroad amidst a wailing agriculture sector mugabe still makes these trips to this very day spending unbudgeted funds running into millions what ensued from this point was the biting liquidity crisis that became so bad that zimbabweans queued for days to access a measly usd 50 for this bad move alone we would be right to think that chinamasa deserves to be given the doomsday legendary title but zanu pf being who they are there is one born every minute such that there would be a long queue to choose from with the case in point we can assume at least two others would be vying for that title as the crisis worsened zanu pf did what they are famous for in spite of the fact that at this point the economy was a usd economy trusting citizens would bank in usd and rightly expect to withdraw in usd a quite simple and logical expectation zanu pf proceeds to con the citizenry by simply swapping the usd for funny money coined bond notes it will work they said the incumbent reserve bank of zimbabwe governor john mangudya guaranteed it would work claiming he would resign if it didn t maybe had he done so it would have been the only good thing to come out of this economic debauchery the governor proposed that he would print usd 200 million worth of this funny money which would in turn be backed by the afrexim bank which afrexim neither confirmed or denied now keeping in mind that the money which chinamasa grabbed from the coffers was ud 1 8bn how then was 200million worth of funny money going to solve this issue added to that the idea of government bonds bond notes is a form of i owe you it is government saying that i can t give you your usd 100 that you deposited therefore i will instead give you this note that says i have your money you can use this note to purchase and eventually i will pay back in hard cash whomever has this usd not only did this fail dismally but to print 200 million to cover a 1 8billion hole was always going to be a tall order the idea of pegging the bond note to the usd as 1 1 became yet another way that the government syphoned more money from its citizens in no time had it been launched money changers were already flooding the border posts similar to their gono boys predecessors the money changers had competitive black market rates in order to get hold of the hard currency it was a matter of days if not hours that the 1 1 rate had fallen to the wayside the rate has gone up to as high as 1 7 bond notes to usd a far cry to mangudya s promise to pay of 1 1 invariably what this created were purchasing power disparities in the market of course someone who was willing to pay in usd got it cheaper than someone with bond notes prices became inflated so that the bond note price would make it viable for the seller to part with their item in the hope that they could then buy back usd to replenish their stocks the inflated bond prices increased the demand of bond notes from the banks by its customers keeping in mind that supposedly only 200million was printed the liquidity crisis soon returned this time impacting both usd and the funny money bond notes at this time an emergence of telephone money and other plastic money services offered a somewhat temporary lifeline so instead of keeping money in the bank or trying to find bond notes you transferred money to your phone and transacted on your phone great idea but liquidity crisis still made it difficult for banks to act with in the international banking clearing system in turn this would mean that neither the plastic money nor the phone money could be used abroad what happens with clearing when you the customer present your card in a shop at that moment a call is made by visa to your bank to check if you the customer has that money the bank send back a yes and money is transferred from the customer s bank s visa account to the vendor bank s visa account your bank takes the money physically from your account and holds it in its current account to then replace the money it has paid to the vendor s account what then started to happen with plastic money in zimbabwe during international transactions was that while the bank would take money from the customer s account they could not honour the transaction to the vendor s bank because of accumulating debt on the banks visa account international clearing demands hard currency not funny money this accumulated huge debts for the zimbabwean banking system in an attempt to solve this issue we welcomed another baby the nostro accounts these meant that customers could bank real money i mean hard currency no i mean usd making it easier for banks to discern payments the nostro s could also be used abroad what the citizens didn t realise at this point was that in agreeing to a nostro account it was rip to any usd balances previously held in your other accounts at this point we became an economy with 4 methods of exchange we can t fully qualify all of them as currencies because you keep walking in one direction perhaps south of plumtree and yeah toilet paper may be worth more there so 4 methods of exchange telephone money bond notes usd and nostro all with different value dependent on how quickly the recipient wants to exchange them with the most internationally liquid being the more expensive ones so while we are all wheeler dealing with money prices in the most commonly available paper denomination that is bond notes continued to increase here i am saying the increase in price is a direct reflection of the devaluation of the bond notes and the next one in line after them i e ecocash the increase in price means increase amounts demanded from the banks at any given time increase in money demand from the bank means increased illiquidity by the bank and there we were starting back at one no bond notes in the bank limited bank balance transfers etc at this point due to the political crisis which manifested in the way of political violence citizens being killed maimed falsely arrested and a captured judiciary in this i mean the judiciary is capable of deciding in favour of a party due to that party s political affiliation all of this coupled with the banking crisis continues to impact the economy in many adverse ways of which the top 3 are 1 no new foreign investment an investor wants to know that their money is safeguarded if they are violated in any way they can go to the court and be protected by justice 2 zimbabwe rating was in crisis it became more than blacklisted international rating agencies delisted it so investors have no information on how worthwhile it is to invest in zimbabwe 3 reduced fiscal foreign aid so while zimbabwe still receives foreign aid to specific non governmental projects the government does not receive direct aid neither can it apply for any in its current form so what about the new kid on the block prof ncube showing well and truly the ability to adapt and manage the zim way decided to earn his stripes by delivery his own zanuconomic policies 1 have a baby of his own in his last financial statement the rtgs was birthed in words by the prof a new not new currency this enigma turned out to be the currency name for a bank to bank transfer by the customer so you don t have cash you want to move money around then use rtgs bizarre right it is also pegged in value against the usd and the rest of the babes on the shelf ecocash bond notes yep this baby still around usd and nostro recent reports are that some nostro are also now rtgs too the rtgs was released under the guise of aiding those undertaking huge business transactions so that the rtgs is pegged at the market rate against the usd and as long as you have enough in your account you should be able to request the usd equivalent or at least undertake an international transfer but if you remember that we started this problem with a shortage of usd 1 8billion and so far nothing to increase cash in the economy has been done no matter what you call it there is no money in the economy that meets the demand for usd given the amount of foreign transactions the nation requires to undertake on realising the rtgs won t work our prof newbie has now said he has been given a loan not sure whom by to the tune of usd 500million so that businesses can access the money they need will this work well to answer that question rewind to november 2016 when a us 200million was used to back the issuance of bond notes at the time the deficit was estimated to be usd 5billlion so you answer that question look how far not we have come since

barquisimeto venezuela ap andreina cordero started the year skipping meals so her three kids could eat her husband a construction worker was out of a job and the family s savings had been devastated by the nation s hyperinflation limiting cordero s children to a diet of rice beans pasta and fried corn patties but the family got a break from their daily struggle to feed themselves this spring when a social worker enrolled them in a program run by a silicon valley startup that is donating cryptocurrency to hundreds of venezuelan families every week from february to april cordero received a deposit of eos tokens through a cellphone app she then traded the digital money for local currency through online transfers and used the funds to shop in market stalls we finally got to eat chicken cordero said and there were also vegetables for the kids the three month trial in crypto transfers is now over and the family is back to skipping meals and eating mostly beans and rice but cordero is thankful for the time that digital currency saved her kids from malnutrition i m very grateful for what they did for us cordero said it would be a blessing if something like that were set up again over the past decade cryptocurrencies like eos and bitcoin have become popular among investors looking to make large profits from a new and anonymous form of storing wealth but a handful of charities are also now using digital currencies to send relief directly to those in need circumventing banks and companies that handle remittances they ve found the ideal testing ground in venezuela where the annual inflation rate by some estimates has soared to a staggering 67 000 forcing millions to scavenge daily to feed themselves crypto has the highest likelihood of being helpful to people in places where money is broken said joe waltman executive director of givecrypto the charity that provided direct transfers to cordero and more than 100 venezuelan families in barquisimeto with the aid of eos venezuela a local blockchain developer and there s probably no better example of broken money right now than venezuela givecrypto s program provided temporary help to vulnerable families by providing them with a weekly deposit worth around 7 or about the same as venezuela s monthly minimum wage the organization is also aiming to make people familiar with crypto apps so they can transfer their own earnings into digital currency and use it to buy goods long after they have stopped receiving free deposits we want to show that people who are not techies or investors can also benefit from this technology said efrain pineda the project s manager and head of operations at eos venezuela anyone can use crypto to protect themselves from inflation and make their daily life easier while many middle class venezuelans already try to protect their savings from hyperinflation by purchasing u s dollars and even gold nuggets saving in crypto offers a solution to store wealth that may be physically safer than holding on to cash or precious metals in a crime infested country online platforms that allow venezuelans to buy and hold u s dollars provide a similar service storing cryptocurrency presents greater financial risks than holding u s dollars though due to the wild swings in the value of some crypto assets including bitcoin but in venezuela where the local bolivar currency has lost two thirds of its value this year some merchants are willing to give this technology a shot in barquisimeto leticia luque an informal merchant said she began to accept crypto payments two months ago at the request of a social worker collaborating with givecrypto s direct transfer scheme she said the technology has helped her gain time to barter for better prices with suppliers and plan what she will buy next we used to be in a rush to purchase goods before our bolivars lost their value said luque whose husband travels every week to colombia to stock up on packaged foods and basic goods that the couple re sells out of their home now we can take our time and we know that our earnings are in a safe place waltman said the barquisimeto experiment was the first stage of a larger effort to promote the use of cryptocurrency in venezuela using stable currencies whose values have less fluctuation than bitcoin a similar initiative known as an airdrop is being developed by airtm a currency exchange platform based in mexico city that plans to donate small amounts of cryptocurrency to 100 000 people in venezuela this summer so far it has raised 300 000 from donations toward its 1 million goal the one time payment of no more than 10 a person will provide only momentary relief but the goal is also to encourage venezuelans to engage with the airtm platform we want to show venezuelans how to hold money outside their local currency said joshua kliot the organization s co founder the biggest impact this could have is to crypto ize the country and it s not just in venezuela where nonprofits are attempting to help vulnerable people by introducing them to digital currency platforms in europe bitnation a humanitarian agency has enabled hundreds of refugees without bank accounts to receive direct donations through bitcoin accounts in jordan the world food program delivers aid to 100 000 syrian refugees by creating digital currency accounts for each recipient using blockchain technology but official currencies to pay for goods refugees only need to have their iris scanned in participating stores paul lamb a nonprofit management consultant based in california says the idea of distributing funding directly to people in need is becoming increasingly popular among humanitarian groups because in some contexts it is cheaper than organizing the logistics required to physically hand out food or medicine usually these money transfers are made through debit cards in the local currency but humanitarian groups are also starting to look at cryptocurrency it s harder for someone to steal cryptocurrency said hugh aprile the colombia country director for mercy corps a nonprofit that has handed out debit cards to 7 000 venezuelan refugees and in situations where you have high inflation it can ensure the stability of the funds being transferred but aid programs that distribute cryptocurrency also face several challenges in venezuela power cuts like the one that recently left much of the country in the dark for days knock out the internet connection needed to use cryptocurrency and connections for many are iffy even when there is power a tightly controlled currency system that punishes financial crimes with jail time has also discouraged some merchants from accepting cryptocurrency merchants who accept crypto and are public about it risk being inspected by the government said randy brito the founder of bitcoin venezuela a cryptocurrency education group poverty is another barrier ariany jaimes a social worker who recruited participants for givecrypto s project in barquisimeto said she had to keep some of the neediest people out of the program because they didn t own smartphones with modern operating systems we realize that this technology is not going to become widespread overnight jaimes said but i do hope that these programs continue because they make our life a little easier ___ manuel rueda on twitter

the best europe in history is facing some of its greatest challenges ever they will test the sustainability effectiveness and relevance of the european union and its related institutions that helped end centuries of conflict despite all the focus on this week s european parliamentary elections the most closely watched and most widely reported in their four decade run this vote shouldn t distract anyone from the more existential questions facing europe the dangers are deep and fall under three broad categories consistently slow economic growth declining global relevance and unimaginative political leadership the good news is that european leaders and citizens can address all three and european parliamentary elections might even help more than they hurt by creating a more democratically dynamic and truly european body that is closer to its constituents back to that below the bad news is that most european leaders and citizens continue to live in denial insufficiently aware of the fragility of their historic accomplishments and inadequately motivated to make the decisions that could build on the past 74 years of european peace and progress even worse few in the trump administration least of all the president himself are willing to say loudly and publicly that today s europe is one of the greatest foreign policy accomplishments in american history achieved at a considerable cost of blood and treasure through two world wars and a cold war that followed it follows that as we enter a new period of major power competition pitting democracies and open societies against autocratic rivals the stakes are growing that the united states has in european success and vibrant transatlantic relations we confront a historic inflection point as significant as 1919 1945 and 1989 and just as then europe is at the center of a global contest and the united states remains a crucial actor in how that unfolds whatever challenges the west faces in the 21st century ideological economic technological and geopolitical all are playing out again in full force on the european continent as the financier george soros has argued europe is sleepwalking into oblivion and the people of europe need to wake up before it is too late if they don t the european union will go the way of the soviet union in 1991 neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand we are experiencing a revolutionary moment that the range of possibilities is very broad and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain share that warning with most eurocrats in brussels or officials in european capitals and they ll roll their eyes they ll remind you that critics and particularly americans have been underestimating the european union since its beginning and should drop outdated apocalyptic thinking about their future i share the view that this european project at age 74 is more robust and resilient than doomsayers recognize indeed even as many worry that eurosceptic and nationalist parties will surge in this weekend s elections far right populist parties except in the uk have shifted away from seeking a way out of the european union to wanting to change it from within this vote is perhaps the most truly european in the european union s history with ideological battle lines being drawn across national borders the result is likely to be a more factionalized european parliament with more pronounced disputes however it at the same time will be a more democratically dynamic political and pan european parliament one that more closely reflects the preferences of national electorates and thus might increase confidence in the eu that however will only happen if they and national political leaders address the three broad issues listed above slow economic growth it s no wonder that populists are gaining ground against established parties that haven t delivered results if the eurozone s gdp over the past decade were a stock you wouldn t want to own it eurozone economic output in 2017 was lower than it was in 2009 according to world bank figures and looking at the considerable political risks ahead the atlantic council s ben haddad judges that stock as high risk low return by comparison chinese gdp over that same period grew by 139 india s gdp by 96 and the united states by 34 the european commission has cut the 2019 eurozone growth forecast to 1 2 from an already unimpressive 1 9 with concerns over germany s economic strength abound and there are strong signals that worse is to come says ana palacio former spanish foreign minister and an atlantic council board member debt levels are rising fast and the european central bank has re launched stimulus measures to stave off recession unlike the financial crisis of a decade ago where the pain was concentrated in southern europe this one will hit the eurozone generally and most dangerously germany the european union barely survived the first crisis says palacio a recession that hits the eu core would amount to a serious even existential threat declining global relevance the eu has failed to adjust to the new world of major power competition and it thus is at risk of being a less relevant global actor an object of international relations rather than a subject the eu finds itself in a world dominated by great power rivalries chinese assertiveness and revisionist russian belligerence says former swedish prime minister carl bildt a member of the atlantic council s international advisory board worse in confronting these threats it can no longer count on the united states as an unconditional friend or ally says bildt one of europe s leading strategic thinkers the eu now must choose between securing its own place on the global stage and becoming a playground for other powers this is a strategic decision of the first order all other policy choices will follow from it unimaginative leadership with germany chancellor angela merkel fading from the field with french president emmanuel macron s european visions swamped in a sea of yellow vests and given the current candidates for top european jobs it s hard to know where the leaders will emerge who will reform revive and reorient europe for the challenges ahead the continent that gave the world the thirty years war a dozen years of napoleonic wars and then two world wars doesn t look poised to self destruct again on that scale yet the heady hopes of the last seven decades are also fading europe with critical us help secured peace between france and germany and advanced its institutions and agenda holding strong against the soviet union through the cold war after the soviet union collapsed it brought in 11 formerly communist countries as new democracies the post cold war years were ones of self confidence that had many believing says bildt that the eu model would lead to more stable governance for the entire world for now however the emphasis must be on saving the best europe history has known after all history has also taught us how costly it is to remake europe once it is torn asunder this article originally appeared on cnbc com frederick kempe is president and chief executive

menafn gulf times critics often claim that china is using its massive belt and road initiative as a form of coercive debt trap diplomacy to exert control over the countries that join its transnational infrastructure investment scheme this risk as deborah brautigam of john hopkins university recently noted is often exaggerated by the media in fact the bri may hold a different kind of risk for china itself at the recent bri summit in beijing chinese president xi jinping seemed to acknowledge the debt trap criticism in his address xi said that building high quality sustainable risk resistant reasonably priced and inclusive infrastructure will help countries to utilise fully their resource endowments this is an encouraging signal as it shows that china has become more aware of the debt implications of bri a study by the center for global development concluded that eight of the 63 countries participating in the bri are at risk of debt distress but as john maynard keynes memorably put it if you owe your bank a hundred pounds you have a problem but if you owe your bank a million pounds it has in the context of the bri china may turn out to be the banker who is owed a million pounds in particular china may fall victim to the obsolescing bargain model which states that a foreign investor loses bargaining power as it invests more in a host country infrastructure projects like those under the bri are a classic example because they are bulky bolted to the ground and have zero economic value if left incomplete unsurprisingly some bri partner countries are now demanding to renegotiate terms and typically after the projects have started china may be forced to offer ever more favourable concessions in order to keep the projects on track in mid april for example malaysia announced that a major bri rail project put on hold by the government after last year s election would now go ahead after renegotiation according to media reports the costs of construction were reduced by as much as one third other bri countries will probably also ask for debt forgiveness and write offs the costs of which will ultimately be borne by chinese savers the bri may well have additional hidden costs for china down the road for starters it is extraordinarily difficult to make money on infrastructure projects there is a widespread belief that infrastructure investment powers economic growth but the evidence for this is weak in fact china itself built much of its current infrastructure after its growth had taken off in the 1980s and 1990s for example china grew much faster than india despite having a shorter railway network according to the world bank in 1996 china had 56 678km 35 218 miles of rail lines and india had 62 915km chinese growth was not jump started by infrastructure but by reforms and human capital investments if growth fails to materialise in bri countries chinese companies may end up bearing the costs furthermore many of china s bri partner countries are risky including pakistan a major recipient of investments under the scheme in addition to its high political economic and default risks the country also scores poorly on education indicators according to one report pakistan ranked 180th among 221 countries in literacy this is a potential red flag for chinese investments in pakistan because research suggests that investments in physical infrastructure promote growth only in countries with high levels of human capital china itself benefited from its infrastructural investments because it had also invested heavily in education nor should the bri be compared to the marshall plan the us aid programme to help rebuild western europe after world war ii as an example of how large scale investment projects can boost growth the marshall plan was so successful and at a fraction of the bri s cost because it helped generally well governed countries that had been temporarily disrupted by war aid acted as a stimulus that triggered growth several of the bri countries by contrast are plagued by economic and governance problems and lack basic requirements for growth simply building up their infrastructure will not be enough finally the bri will probably further strengthen china s state sector thereby increasing one of the long term threats to its economy according to a study by the american enterprise institute private firms accounted for only 28 of bri investments in the first half of 2018 the latest data available down by 12 percentage points from the same period of 2017 the bri s massive scale coupled with the lack of profitability of china s state sector means that projects under the scheme may need substantial support from chinese banks bri investments would then inevitably compete for funds and increasingly precious foreign exchange resources with china s domestic private sector which is already facing a high tax burden and the strains of the trade war with the us moreover western firms an important component of china s private sector are retreating from the country several us companies including amazon oracle seagate and uber as well as south korea s samsung and sk hynix and toshiba mitsubishi and sony from japan have either scaled down their china operations or decided to leave altogether partly as a result us foreign direct investment in china in 2017 was 2 6bn compared to 5 4bn in 2002 this is a worrisome development through the bri china is building ties to some of the world s most authoritarian financially opaque and economically backward countries at the same time a trade war an ever stronger state sector and protectionism are distancing china from the west china has grown and developed the capacity to undertake bri projects precisely because it opened its economy to globalisation and to western technology and knowhow compared to its engagements with the west the bri may entail risks and uncertainties that could become problematic for the chinese economy as the chinese economy slows down and its export prospects are increasingly clouded by geopolitical factors it is worth rethinking the pace scope and scale of the bri project syndicate yasheng huang is international program professor in chinese economy and business and professor of global economics and management at the mit sloan school of management menafn2505201900670000id1098569127
an energy infrastructure giant an engineered paper leader and a tech behemoth are intriguing options for yield seeking investors dividend paying stocks provide investors with several benefits not only can they provide spendable income but those payments often account for a significant portion of a stock s total returns over the long run that s why dividend paying stocks have historically outperformed their stingier peers furthermore they tend to do so with less volatility the best performing dividend stocks tend to be those that have above average yields with most companies in the s p 500 yielding around 2 those paying over 4 certainly fit the bill three top options with dividends above that level are tc energy trp 1 37 westrock wrk 0 12 and ibm ibm 0 64 different name same great dividend matt dilallo tc energy canadian pipeline giant transcanada recently changed its name to tc energy which better reflects its diversification across the entire north american continent however while the name might be different the energy infrastructure company s dividend remains as attractive as ever the payout which currently yields 4 6 is on track to continue expanding at a healthy rate over the next few years tc energy has worked hard to ensure that it can sustain that high yielding payout one way it has done that it by selling assets with more volatile cash flow and replacing them with those that generate stable earnings as a result more than 95 of tc energy s cash flow now comes from predictable sources like long term contracts the company further supports its dividend with a conservative payout ratio of less than 65 of its cash flow and a strong investment grade balance sheet tc energy uses its retained cash and balance sheet strength to invest in high return expansion projects the company currently has 30 billion canadian dollars 23 3 billion of growth projects underway that should support 8 to 10 dividend growth through at least 2021 meanwhile tc has another ca 20 billion 14 9 billion of projects in development which could enable it to continue growing the payout at a healthy pace well into the next decade tc energy s well supported fast growing high yield dividend makes it a top option for income seeking investors to buy for the long term an industry leader priced well below book value maxx chatsko westrock this company continues to deliver and wall street continues to ignore the progress engineered paper leader westrock leaned on its recently acquired kapstone assets to post 16 year over year revenue growth in its fiscal second quarter of 2019 the period ending march 30 that was driven by a strong performance in the corrugated packaging segment which achieved year over year revenue and operating income growth of 27 and 18 respectively a confluence of factors headlined by the rise of e commerce a growing global middle class and a desire among customers to ditch plastic packaging have created historic market conditions for cardboard that s why after decades of decline the american pulp and paper industry is pouring capital into corrugated products and the facilities that manufacture them providing what could amount to a long term advantage in the international market thanks to new and rebuilt infrastructure westrock isn t letting the opportunity go to waste the company expects investments in operating efficiency this year and next to deliver an additional 80 million in annual ebitda upgrades completed in 2021 will bump up that annualized total to 150 million equivalent to nearly 5 of total ebitda from fiscal 2018 the bounty from those strategic investments is largely in addition to management s plan to realize 200 million in run rate synergies from the recent kapstone acquisition by the end of fiscal 2021 the two combined amount to a significant windfall for a company that isn t exactly hurting for profits westrock expects full year fiscal 2019 adjusted ebitda of about 3 35 billion up from 2 89 billion in fiscal 2018 that solid financial foundation allows the 10 billion business to pay an annualized dividend yield of 4 7 it also results in the company being significantly undervalued shares trade at 0 86 times book value they d have to rise 14 to be fairly valued a peg ratio of 0 63 and just 9 3 times future earnings investors with a long term mindset might not hesitate to add shares to their portfolio a high yield tech giant tim green international business machines shares of ibm have jumped nearly 20 this year but the stock remains beaten down relative to its multiyear highs a rising

expects to produce adjusted earnings per share of at least 13 90 this year but just 47 of that total will go toward dividends and once the company s acquisition of red hat closes both per share earnings and free cash flow are expected to benefit within a couple years ibm s dividend growth will likely be slow for a while as the company focuses on reducing its debt following the red hat deal but there s no reason to believe the company s 24 year streak of dividend hikes will end anytime soon ibm is still struggling to consistently grow revenue as the performance of legacy businesses offsets growth in areas like cloud computing but the company s bet on hybrid multicloud computing which will be boosted by the red hat acquisition looks like the right strategy for dividend investors ibm is a high yield stock worth buying
