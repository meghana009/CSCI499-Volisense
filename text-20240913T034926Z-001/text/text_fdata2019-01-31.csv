impact of slower cyclical demand from our capital equipment customers which had an adverse impact on ats segment margin for the quarter although we remain positive about our positioning and the long term growth prospects of the capital equipment business we will focus our efficiency initiatives during the first quarter of 2019 on improving margins and better aligning this business to the current revenue environment we made good progress in 2018 on our long term revenue diversification and strategic priorities including delivering sequential margin expansion in every quarter since q1 and growing our strong leadership positions within the aerospace and defense and capital equipment markets as we enter 2019 we will continue to focus on driving better inventory performance as the

which were largely offset by an aggregate 0 38 per share tax benefit arising from the recognition of deferred tax assets as a result of our acquisitions of impakt and atrenne integrated solutions inc atrenne and a 0 04 per share tax benefit arising from the reversal of previously accrued mexican taxes mexican tax reversal see notes 5 13 and 14 to our q4 2018 interim financial statements for

solar assets solar benefit see notes 13 and 14 to our q4 2018 interim financial statements for further detail see schedule 1 for the exclusions used to determine non ifrs adjusted eps for q4 2017 and fy 2017 non ifrs operating margin for q4 2018 of 3 5 reflects improved performance from our ccs segment offset in part by weaker than expected demand in our capital equipment business resulting in lower utilization during the quarter as compared to fy 2017 non ifrs operating margin for fy 2018 was negatively impacted by such lower utilization changes in overall mix and pricing pressures most significantly in our ccs segment as well as 13 5 million in increased inventory provisions non ifrs measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies that use ifrs or other generally accepted accounting principles gaap see non ifrs supplementary information below for information on our rationale for the use of non ifrs measures and schedule 1 for among other items non ifrs measures included in this press release as well as their definitions uses and a reconciliation of non ifrs measures to the most directly comparable ifrs measures ccs portfolio review as part of our strategy to continue to diversify our business and improve shareholder returns we commenced a comprehensive review of our ccs revenue portfolio ccs review in the second half of 2018 with the intention of addressing under performing programs and disengaging from customer programs that do not meet our strategic objectives the review of our ccs business which generated 4 4 billion of revenue in 2018 is currently expected to result in a decline in our ccs segment revenue of approximately 500 million over the next 12 to 18 months subject to change based on the growth or contraction of ccs programs not subject to the review the review is substantially complete and the customer programs that comprise the approximate 500 million in revenue have been identified we expect to complete the majority of these actions in 2019 including the intended restructuring actions which have been built into our current cost efficiency initiative and changes to our manufacturing network although we expect reduced revenue in our ccs business as a result of our ccs review we intend to maintain a significant majority of our ccs business and continue to invest in areas we believe are key to the long term success of our ccs segment including our jdm offering to help drive improved ccs financial performance in future periods capital equipment business update within our capital equipment business revenue from our semiconductor capital equipment customers has been adversely impacted by cyclical decreases in demand primarily in the second half of 2018 which resulted in losses in this business in the mid single digit million dollar range in the fourth quarter of 2018 in response to this demand softness which we expect to continue throughout 2019 we are undertaking actions to align this business to the current demand environment and to improve profitability restructuring update we have recorded 43 million in restructuring charges from the commencement of our cost efficiency initiative through the end of q4 2018 including the 6 4 million of restructuring charges recorded in q4 2018 our restructuring actions under this initiative include among others actions identified as part of our ccs review noted above as well as actions in our capital equipment business noted above we continue to estimate total restructuring charges for our efficiency initiative to be within the previously disclosed range of between 50 million and 75 million however we are extending the program by six months and expect the remainder of the charges to be recorded by the end of 2019 toronto real property and related transactions update the agreement governing the sale of our toronto real property was assigned to a new purchaser in september 2018 and in connection therewith was amended to provide for the remaining proceeds of 122 million canadian dollars approximately 89 million at year end exchange rates to be paid in one lump sum cash payment upon closing of the transaction on january 21 2019 the required municipal zoning approval was obtained as a result the closing of the transaction is scheduled to occur on march 7 2019 and we have every reason to believe that this transaction will be completed on or about such time if the transaction is consummated we will receive total proceeds of approximately u s 110 million including a high density bonus and an early vacancy incentive related to the temporary relocation of our corporate headquarters see note 13 b to our q4 2018 interim financial statements for further details completion of impakt acquisition in november 2018 we completed the acquisition of u s based impakt a highly specialized vertically integrated company providing manufacturing solutions for leading oems in the display including lcd and organic light emitting diode oled and semiconductor industries as well as other markets requiring complex fabrication services with operations in california and south korea the purchase price for impakt was 325 4 million net of cash acquired the purchase price is subject to a net working capital adjustment which has not yet been finalized the purchase was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 245 0 million of which were repaid with proceeds of a new incremental term loan under our credit facility see

market and demand softness from our capital equipment business were partially offset by stronger than expected demand in our enterprise end market non ifrs operating margin for q4 2018 met our guidance non ifrs adjusted sg a for q4 2018 was higher than our guidance range primarily due to higher than expected variable expenses and sg a costs related to impakt our non ifrs adjusted eps results for q4 2018 were within our guidance range 2 for the first quarter of 2019 we expect a negative 0 18 to 0 24 per share pre tax aggregate impact on net earnings on an ifrs basis for employee stock based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets excluding computer software toronto transition costs described on schedule 1 hereto and restructuring charges we anticipate our annual non ifrs adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 to be in the range of 19 to 21 excluding any impacts from taxable foreign exchange we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of such changes on our operating results or the degree to which we will be able to manage such impacts see non ifrs supplementary information below for information on our rationale for the use of non

comparable ifrs measures we do not provide reconciliations for forward looking non ifrs financial measures as we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling

base and develop new capabilities the availability of cash resources for repurchases of outstanding subordinate voting shares that we achieve the expected benefits from our acquisitions of atrenne and impakt and that the sale of our toronto real property will be consummated when anticipated although management believes these assumptions to be reasonable under the current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those that would have been achieved had such assumptions been accurate forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law all forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements supplementary non irs measures schedule 1 our non ifrs measures herein include adjusted gross profit adjusted gross margin adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue adjusted selling general and administrative expenses sg a adjusted sg a as a percentage of revenue operating earnings adjusted ebiat operating margin adjusted ebiat or operating earnings as a percentage of revenue adjusted net earnings adjusted earnings per share adjusted return on invested capital adjusted roic free cash flow adjusted tax expense and adjusted effective tax rate adjusted ebiat adjusted roic free cash flow adjusted tax expense and adjusted effective tax rate are further described in the tables below in calculating these non ifrs financial measures management excludes the following items where applicable employee stock based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets excluding computer software restructuring and other charges net of recoveries as defined below impairment charges other solar charges as defined below and acquisition inventory fair value adjustments all net of the associated tax adjustments which are set forth in the table below and non core tax impacts tax adjustments related to acquisitions and certain other tax costs or recoveries related to restructuring actions or restructured sites we believe the non ifrs measures we present herein are useful as they enable investors to evaluate and compare our results from operations in a more consistent manner by excluding specific items that we do not consider to be reflective of our ongoing operating results to evaluate cash resources that we generate each period and to provide an analysis of operating results using the same measures our chief operating decision makers use to measure performance in addition management believes that the use of a non ifrs adjusted tax expense and a non ifrs adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations and is useful to management and investors for historical comparisons and forecasting these non ifrs financial measures result largely from management s determination that the facts and circumstances surrounding the excluded charges or recoveries are not indicative of the ordinary course of the ongoing operation of our business non ifrs measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies that use ifrs or who report under u s gaap and use non u s gaap measures to describe similar operating metrics non ifrs measures are not measures of performance under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under ifrs the most significant limitation to management s use of non ifrs financial measures is that the charges or credits excluded from the non ifrs measures are nonetheless charges or credits that are recognized under ifrs and that have an economic impact on the company management compensates for these limitations primarily by issuing ifrs results to show a complete picture of the company s performance and reconciling non ifrs financial measures back to the most directly comparable ifrs financial measures the economic substance of the exclusions described above and management s rationale for excluding them from non ifrs financial measures is provided below employee stock based compensation expense which represents the estimated fair value of stock options restricted share units and performance share units granted to employees is excluded because grant activities vary significantly from quarter to quarter in both quantity and fair value in addition excluding this expense allows us to better compare core operating results with those of our competitors who also generally exclude employee stock based compensation expense in assessing operating performance who may have different granting patterns and types of equity awards and who may use different valuation assumptions than we do including those competitors who report under u s gaap and use non u s gaap measures to present similar metrics amortization charges excluding computer software consist of non cash charges against intangible assets that are impacted by the timing and magnitude of acquired businesses amortization of intangible assets varies among our competitors and we believe that excluding these charges permits a better comparison of core operating results with those of our competitors who also generally exclude amortization charges in assessing operating performance restructuring and other charges net of recoveries consist of costs relating to employee severance lease terminations site closings and consolidations write downs of owned property and equipment which are no longer used and are available for sale reductions in infrastructure toronto transition costs recoveries defined below acquisition related consulting transaction and integration costs acquisition costs legal settlements recoveries and the accelerated amortization of 1 2 million in unamortized deferred financing costs recorded on the extinguishment of our prior facility during the second quarter of 2018 we exclude these restructuring and other charges net of recoveries because we believe that they are not directly related to ongoing operating results and do not reflect expected future operating expenses after completion of these activities we believe these exclusions permit a better comparison of our core operating results with those of our competitors who also generally exclude these charges net of recoveries in assessing operating performance toronto transition costs recoveries are costs recoveries recorded in connection with the sale of our toronto real property the relocation of our toronto manufacturing operations the move of our corporate headquarters to a temporary location while space in a new office building for such headquarters at our current location is under construction as well as the move to such new office space upon its completion toronto transition costs consist of direct relocation costs duplicate costs such as rent expense utility costs depreciation charges and personnel costs incurred during the transition period as well as cease use costs incurred in connection with idle or vacated portions of the relevant premises that we would not have incurred but for these relocations toronto transition recoveries will consist of amounts received from the purchaser of the toronto real property or gains we record in connection with its sale if consummated we believe that excluding these costs and recoveries permits a better comparison of our core operating results from period to period as these costs will not reflect our ongoing operations once these relocations are complete impairment charges which consist of non cash charges against goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment result primarily when the carrying value of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount our competitors may record impairment charges at different times and we believe that excluding these charges permits a better comparison of our core operating results with those of our competitors who also generally exclude these charges in assessing operating performance other solar charges consisting of non cash charges to further write down the carrying value of our then remaining solar panel inventory and the write down of solar accounts receivable a r primarily as a result of a solar customer s bankruptcy to estimated recoverable amounts were recorded in the second quarter of 2017 through cost of sales and sg a expenses respectively these impairment charges which were identified during the wind down of our solar operations were excluded as they pertained to a business we had exited and therefore were no longer directly related to our ongoing core operating results although we recorded significant impairment charges to write down our solar panel inventory in the third quarter of 2016 those charges were not excluded in the determination of our non ifrs financial measures for such period as we were then still engaged in the solar panel manufacturing business in connection with this wind down we also recorded net non cash impairment charges to write down the carrying value of our solar panel manufacturing equipment held for sale to its estimated sales value less costs of disposal which we recorded through other charges during 2017 acquisition inventory fair value adjustments relate to the write up of the inventory acquired in connection with our acquisitions representing the difference between the cost and fair value of such inventory acquired assets and liabilities are recorded on our balance sheet at their fair values as of the date of acquisition fair value adjustments are recognized through cost of sales in the period during which the acquired inventory is sold we recognized the full 1 6 million adjustment related to inventory acquired from atrenne during the second quarter of 2018 as all of the inventory was sold during that quarter which negatively impacted our gross profit and net earnings for such period no such adjustment was recorded with respect to inventory acquired from impakt we exclude the impact of the recognition of these adjustments as applicable because we believe such exclusion permits a better comparison of our core operating results from period to period as their impact is not indicative of our ongoing operating performance non core tax impacts are excluded as we believe that these costs or recoveries do not reflect core operating performance and vary significantly among those of our competitors who also generally exclude these costs or recoveries in assessing operating performance the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the various non ifrs measures discussed above and a reconciliation of non ifrs measures to the most directly comparable

in our business our non ifrs adjusted roic measure reflects non ifrs operating earnings working capital management and asset utilization non ifrs adjusted roic is calculated by dividing non ifrs adjusted ebiat by average net invested capital net invested capital calculated in the table below consists of the following ifrs measures total assets less cash accounts payable accrued and other current liabilities and provisions and income taxes payable we use a two point average to calculate average net invested capital for the quarter and a five point average to calculate average net invested capital for the year a comparable measure under ifrs would be determined by dividing ifrs earnings before income taxes by net invested capital which we have set forth in the charts above and below however this measure which we have called ifrs roic is not a measure defined under ifrs the following table sets forth for the periods indicated our calculation of ifrs roic and non ifrs

interim financial reporting as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb and the accounting policies we have adopted in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs the q4 2018 interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our 2017 annual audited consolidated financial statements 2017 afs and reflect all adjustments that are in the opinion of management necessary to present fairly our financial position as at december 31 2018 and our financial performance comprehensive income and cash flows for the three months ended december 31 2018 q4

information is presented in millions of u s dollars except percentages and per share amounts the q4 2018 interim financial statements were authorized for issuance by our board of directors on january 31 2019 use of estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our judgments estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the economic environment could also impact certain estimates necessary to prepare our consolidated financial statements including estimates related to the recoverable amounts used in our impairment testing of our non financial assets and the discount rates applied to our net pension and non pension post employment benefit assets or liabilities our assessment of these factors forms the basis for our judgments on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of our costs and expenses actual results could differ materially from our estimates and assumptions we review our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis and make revisions as determined necessary by management revisions are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and may impact future periods as well there have been no material changes to our assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of our estimates and assumptions during q4 2018 or fy 2018 from those described in the notes to our 2017 afs however see accounting policies below for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting policies the q4 2018 interim financial statements are based upon accounting policies consistent with those used and described in note 2 of our 2017 afs except for the recently adopted accounting standards discussed below recently adopted accounting standards ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers effective january 1 2018 we adopted ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers issued by the iasb this standard provides a comprehensive five step revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and prescribes when and how much revenue should be recognized this standard replaced ias 18 revenues ias 11 construction contracts and related interpretations in accordance with the transitional provisions of the rule we elected to apply ifrs 15 using the retrospective method and have restated the comparative reporting periods presented herein and recognized the transitional adjustments through equity at the start of the first comparative reporting period presented herein the new standard changed the timing of our revenue recognition for a significant portion of our business resulting in the recognition of revenue for certain customer contracts earlier than under the previous recognition rules which was generally upon delivery the new standard had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements primarily in relation to inventory and accounts receivable balances ifrs 9 financial instruments effective january 1 2018 we adopted ifrs 9 financial instruments issued by the iasb this standard introduced a new model for the classification and measurement of financial assets a single expected credit loss ecl model for the measurement of the impairment of financial assets and a new model for hedge accounting that is aligned with a company s risk management activities in connection with the adoption of this standard we also complied with the transitional rules of ias 1 presentation of financial statements and ifrs 7 financial instruments disclosures in accordance with the transitional provisions of the rule we have applied the changes of ifrs 9 retrospectively with the exception of the hedge accounting policies which we have applied prospectively as required the adoption of this standard did not result in any adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and did not have a material impact on our accounting policies under ifrs 9 financial assets are classified as either measured at amortized cost fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci or fair value through profit or loss fvtpl this classification is generally based on the business model in which the financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics ifrs 9 eliminated the held to maturity loans and receivables and available for sale categories previously allowed under ias 39 trade and non customer receivables that were previously classified as loans and receivables under ias 39 are measured at amortized cost under ifrs 9 although the classification of such assets changed measurement of these assets continues to be at amortized cost and no changes to their carrying amounts were required upon adopting ifrs 9 for financial liabilities ifrs 9 largely retains the existing ias 39 classifications with the exception of those designated at fvtpl we do not currently hold any liabilities designated as fvtpl we do not currently hold any financial assets or liabilities under fvoci see changes in accounting policies below for a description of accounting policy changes in connection with our adoption of ifrs 9 and ifrs 15 and note 3 for the transitional impacts of adopting ifrs 15 recently issued accounting pronouncements ifrs 16 leases in january 2016 the iasb issued this standard which brings most leases on balance sheet for lessees under a single model eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases ifrs 16 supersedes ias 17 leases and related interpretations and is effective for periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 with earlier adoption permitted we adopted this standard effective january 1 2019 applying the modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of adopting ifrs 16 will be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained deficit balance as of january 1 2019 without restatement of prior period comparative information we have implemented changes to our business processes systems and controls to enable the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with ifrs 16 the new standard is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in the period of initial application the quantification of which we expect to estimate in our audited consolidated annual financial statements for fy 2018 we will recognize new right of use assets and lease liabilities related to the majority of our operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2019 upon initial application of ifrs 16 the amortization of these assets will be recognized as a depreciation charge and the interest expense on the lease liabilities will be recognized as finance costs in our consolidated statement of operations previously we recognized operating lease expenses on a straight line basis over the lease term generally in cost of sales or sg a in our consolidated statement of operations no significant changes are expected for our existing finance leases nor for any leases in which we are a lessor changes in accounting policies the following section should be read as a modification to the significant accounting policies in notes 2 q r s and t of our 2017 afs and reflects accounting policy changes in connection with our adoption of ifrs 9 and ifrs 15 a financial assets and financial liabilities we recognize financial assets and financial liabilities initially at fair value and subsequently measure these at either fair value or amortized cost based on their classification as described below fair value through profit or loss fvtpl financial assets and any financial liabilities that we purchase or incur respectively with the intention of generating earnings in the near term and derivatives other than cash flow hedges are classified as fvtpl this category includes short term investments in money market funds if applicable that we group with cash equivalents and derivative assets and derivative liabilities that do not qualify for hedge accounting see derivatives and hedge accounting in paragraph c below for derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting for investments that we classify as fvtpl we initially recognize such financial assets on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value and recognize subsequent changes in our consolidated statement of operations we expense transaction costs as incurred in our consolidated statement of operations we do not currently hold any liabilities designated as fvtpl amortized cost financial assets that we hold with the intention of collecting the contractual cash flows in the form of payment of principal and related interest at amortized cost and includes our trade receivables term deposits and non customer receivables we initially recognize the carrying amount of such assets on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measure these at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment losses other financial liabilities this category is for our financial liabilities that are not classified as fvtpl and includes our accounts payable the majority of our accrued liabilities and certain other provisions as well as borrowings under our credit facility including our term loans we record these financial liabilities at amortized cost on our consolidated balance sheet b impairment of financial assets we used a forward looking ecl model in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts as it relates to trade receivables contract assets under ifrs 15 and other financial assets our allowance is based on historical experience and includes consideration of the aging of the balances the customer s creditworthiness current economic conditions expectation of bankruptcies and political and economic volatility in the markets or location of our customers among other factors a financial asset is written off or written down to its net realizable value as soon as it is known to be impaired we will adjust previous write downs to reflect changes in estimates or actual experience c derivatives and hedge accounting we measure foreign exchange forward and interest swap contracts that we designate as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet we defer changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative to the extent effective in other comprehensive income oci until we recognize the asset liability or forecasted transaction being hedged in our consolidated statement of operations any cash flow hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in operations immediately for hedges that we discontinue before the end of the original hedge term we amortize the unrealized hedge gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations over the remaining term of the hedge if the hedged item ceases to exist before the end of the original hedge term we recognize the unrealized hedge gain or loss immediately in our consolidated statement of operations d revenue we derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of electronic products and services that we manufacture and provide to customer specifications we recognize revenue from the sale of products and services rendered when our performance obligation has been satisfied or when the associated control over the products has passed to the customer and no material uncertainties remain as to the collection of our receivables under ifrs 15 which we adopted january 1 2018 where products are custom made to meet a customers specific requirements and such customers are obligated to compensate us for the work performed to date we recognize revenue over time as production progresses to completion or as services are rendered we generally estimate revenue for our work in progress based on costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin for eligible products for which we do not have alternative uses for contracts that do not qualify for revenue recognition over time under ifrs 15 we recognize revenue at the point in time where control is passed to the customer which is generally upon shipment and no further performance obligation remains except for our standard manufacturing or service warranties we apply significant estimates judgment and assumptions in determining the timing of revenue recognition measuring work in progress and estimating the amounts and timing of expected returns revenues and related costs as our invoices are typically issued at the time of the delivery of final products to the customers the earlier recognition of revenue on certain custom made products has significantly increased the amount of unbilled contract assets included in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet see recently adopted accounting standards above and note 3 a below for the impact of adopting ifrs 15 3 transition to ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers we adopted ifrs 15 as of january 1 2018 by applying the retrospective method and have restated the comparative reporting periods presented herein in computing the transitional adjustments we applied the practical expedients in accordance with ifrs 15 to exclude certain contracts that we started and completed in the same annual reporting period or were completed prior to january 1 2016 the beginning of the earliest period to be presented in our 2018 annual audited consolidated financial statements we recognized the transitional adjustments through equity as of january 1 2017 for our q4 2018 interim financial statements a transitional impacts for a significant portion of our business the timing of our revenue recognition has changed under the new standard from a point in time to over time resulting in earlier recognition of revenue than under the previous recognition rules which was generally upon delivery of final products to our end customer the most significant financial impacts of adopting ifrs 15 on the comparative periods in our q4 2018 interim financial statements are summarized as follows three months ended year ended december 31 2016 december 31 2017 december 31 2017

current assets on our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently amortized over the projected period of expected future benefits or as recoveries are realized from the new contracts we monitor our contract assets for potential impairment on a regular basis no significant impairment losses were recorded on our contract assets during q4 2018 the fourth quarter of 2017 q4 2017 fy 2018 or the

earn revenue and incur expenses for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and to assess performance no operating segments have been aggregated to determine our reportable segments during the first quarter of 2018 we completed a reorganization of our reporting structure including our sales operations and management systems into two operating and reportable segments ats and ccs prior to this reorganization we operated in one reportable segment electronic manufacturing services which was comprised of multiple end markets ats communications and enterprise during 2017 the change in operating and reportable segments was a result of modifications to our organizational and internal management structure which were initiated in 2017 to streamline business operations and improve profitability and competitiveness and were completed in early 2018 as a result of these modifications and commencing in the first quarter of 2018 our chief executive officer ceo who is our chief operating decision maker reviews segment revenue segment income and segment margin described below to assess performance and make decisions about resource allocation our prior period financial information has been reclassified to reflect the reorganized segment structure and to conform to the current presentation the foregoing changes had no impact on our historical consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as previously reported factors considered in determining the two reportable segments included the nature of applicable business activities management structure market strategy and margin profiles our ats segment consists of our ats end market and is comprised of our aerospace and defense industrial smart energy healthtech and capital equipment including semiconductor display and power equipment businesses products and services in this segment are extensive and are often more regulated than in our ccs segment and can include the following government certified and highly specialized manufacturing electronic and enclosure related services for aerospace and defense related customers high precision equipment and integrated subsystems used in the manufacture of semiconductors and displays a wide range of industrial automation controls test and measurement devices advanced solutions for surgical instruments diagnostic imaging and patient monitoring and efficiency products to help manage and monitor the energy and power industries our ats segment businesses typically have a higher margin profile and longer product life cycles than the businesses in our ccs segment our ccs segment consists of our communications and enterprise end markets and is comprised of our enterprise communications telecommunications servers and storage businesses products and services in this segment consist predominantly of enterprise level data communications and information processing infrastructure products and can include routers switches servers and storage related products used by a wide range of businesses and cloud based service providers to manage digital connectivity commerce and social media applications our ccs segment businesses typically have a lower margin profile and higher volumes than the businesses in our ats segment and have been impacted in recent periods and continue to be impacted by aggressive pricing rapid shifts in technology model obsolescence and the commoditization of certain products segment performance is evaluated based on segment revenue segment income and segment margin segment income as a percentage of segment revenue revenue is attributed to the segment in which the product is manufactured or the service is performed segment income is defined as a segment s net revenue less its cost of sales and its allocable portion of selling general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses collectively segment costs identifiable segment costs are allocated directly to the applicable segment while other segment costs including indirect costs and certain corporate charges are allocated to our segments based on an analysis of the relative usage or benefit derived by each segment from such costs segment income excludes finance

our ccs segment that represented more than 10 of total revenue q4 2017 and fy 2017 three and two customers respectively seasonality from time to time we experience some level of seasonality in our quarterly revenue patterns across some of our businesses however numerous factors affecting our period to period results make it difficult to isolate the impact of seasonality and other external factors on our business in the past revenue from the storage component of our ccs segment has increased in the fourth quarter of the year compared to the third quarter and then decreased in the first quarter of the following year reflecting the increase in customer demand we typically experience in this business in the fourth quarter in addition we typically experience our lowest overall revenue levels during the first quarter of each year there is no assurance that these patterns will continue 5 acquisitions in april 2018 we completed the acquisition of u s based atrenne integrated solutions inc atrenne a designer and manufacturer of ruggedized electromechanical solutions primarily for military and commercial aerospace applications the purchase price for atrenne was 141 7 net of cash acquired including a net working capital adjustment of 3 8 which is subject to finalization the purchase was funded with borrowings under the revolving portion of our then available credit facility we recorded 64 0 of goodwill as part of the acquisition attributable primarily to the specific knowledge and capabilities of the acquired workforce and expected synergies from the combination of our operations details of our preliminary purchase price allocation in the year of acquisition are as follows atrenne current assets net of 1 1 of cash acquired 31 5 property plant and equipment 7 8 customer intangible assets and computer software assets 51 0 goodwill 64 0 current liabilities 8 5 deferred income taxes and other long term liabilities 4 1 141 7 acquired assets and liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair values as of the date of acquisition in connection with our purchase of atrenne we recorded a 1 6 fair value adjustment to write up the value of the acquired inventory as of the acquisition date representing the difference between the inventory s cost and its fair value during the second quarter of 2018 we recognized the full 1 6 fair value adjustment through cost of sales as such acquired inventory was sold during that quarter the purchase price for atrenne includes a customary post closing net working capital adjustment we expect to finalize our purchase price allocation by the end of the first quarter of 2019 once such net working capital adjustment has been finalized annual amortization of intangible assets will increase by approximately 6 as a result of the atrenne acquisition the goodwill arising from this acquisition is attributable to our ats segment and is not tax deductible in november 2018 we completed the acquisition of u s based impakt holdings llc impakt a highly specialized vertically integrated company providing manufacturing solutions for leading oems in the display and semiconductor industries as well as other markets requiring complex fabrication services with operations in california and south korea the purchase price for impakt was 325 4 net of cash acquired the purchase price is subject to a net working capital adjustment which has not yet been finalized the purchase was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 245 0 of which was repaid with proceeds of a new incremental term loan under our credit facility see note 11 we recorded 111 2 of goodwill as part of the acquisition attributable primarily to the specific knowledge and capabilities of the acquired workforce and expected synergies from the combination of our operations details of our preliminary purchase price allocation in the year of acquisition are as follows impakt current assets net of 5 9

we expect to complete the valuation of these assets and to finalize the purchase price allocation for impakt in the first half of 2019 we expect annual amortization of intangible assets to increase by approximately 15 as a result of the impakt acquisition goodwill arising from this acquisition is attributable to our ats segment and is not tax deductible pro forma disclosure consolidated revenue and net earnings for q4 2018 and fy 2018 would not have been materially different had either or both of the atrenne and impakt acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2018 we engaged third party consultants to provide valuations of certain inventory property plant and equipment and intangible assets in connection with our purchases of atrenne and impakt the fair value of the acquired tangible assets was measured based on their value in use by applying the market sales comparison brokers quotes cost or replacement cost or the income discounted cash flow approach as deemed appropriate the valuation of the intangible assets by the third party consultants was primarily based on the income approach using a discounted cash flow model and forecasts based on management s subjective estimates and assumptions various level 2 and 3 data inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy were used in the valuation of the above mentioned assets we incur consulting transaction and integration costs acquisition costs relating to potential and completed acquisitions during q4 2018 and fy 2018 we recorded acquisition costs of 5 6 and 11 0 respectively including for our atrenne and impakt acquisitions q4 2017 and fy 2017 2 7 and 4 5 of acquisition costs respectively in other charges in our consolidated statement of operations 6 solar panel manufacturing business during the fourth quarter of 2016 we made the decision to exit the solar panel manufacturing business and terminated a supply agreement pursuant to which we made specific cash advances to a solar cell supplier solar supplier the remaining 12 5 of such cash advances were repaid in full during the first half of 2017 during the second quarter of 2017 we recorded additional provisions of 0 9 in cost of sales 0 5 in sg a expenses and 5 2 in other charges see note 13 in our consolidated statement of operations to write down the carrying value of our solar panel inventory accounts receivable and solar panel manufacturing equipment respectively and an impairment reversal of 1 4 with respect to such solar equipment in the fourth quarter of 2017 based on executed sales agreements during the second quarter of 2018 we completed the sale of our remaining solar manufacturing equipment we paid 11 3 including fees and accrued interest to terminate and settle our outstanding lease obligations for this equipment in january 2018 see note 11 we also manufactured and sold completed solar panels to the solar supplier as a customer as of december 31 2017 we had 6 7 of outstanding solar accounts receivable all from the solar supplier which were repaid in full during 2018 7 accounts receivable accounts receivable sales and financing programs we have an agreement to sell up to 250 0 increased from 200 0 in november 2018 based on a review of our requirements in accounts receivable on an uncommitted basis subject to pre determined limits by customer to two third party banks at december 31

provisions of 13 5 for fy 2018 q4 2017 and fy 2017 net inventory recoveries of 0 6 and net inventory provisions of 3 3 respectively for q4 2018 our net inventory recoveries of 0 3 were comprised of a 4 6 provision reversal to reflect improved recovery of inventory substantially offset by new provisions of 4 3 for specific aged inventory the increase in our inventory provisions for fy 2018 as compared to the prior year was a result of increases in our overall aged inventory levels more than half of which related to customers in our ats segment our inventory provisions for fy 2017 included provisions of 0 9 that we recorded in the second quarter of 2017 to further write down the carrying amount of our remaining solar panel inventory in our ats segment to recoverable amounts we regularly review our estimates and assumptions used to value our inventory through analysis of historical performance 9 assets classified as held for sale at december 31 2018 we had 27 4 december 31 2017 30 1 of assets classified as held for sale which consisted primarily of land and buildings in europe and north america 10 pension and non pension post employment benefit plans we provide pension and non

benefits on retirement based on their pensionable service either in annuities and or lump sum payments our u k defined benefit pension plans are comprised of a main pension plan and a supplementary pension plan in march 2017 the trustees of our u k main pension plan entered into an agreement with a third party insurance company to purchase an annuity for participants in such plan who have retired the purchase of the annuity resulted in a non cash loss of 17 0 which we recorded in oci and simultaneously re classified to deficit during the first quarter of 2017 in april 2017 the trustees of our u k supplementary pension plan entered into an agreement with a third party insurance company to purchase an annuity for participants of this plan all of whom are retired the purchase of the annuity resulted in a non cash loss of 1 9 which we recorded in the second quarter of 2017 in other charges see note 13 in our consolidated statement of operations as we anticipate winding up this plan the non cash loss was recorded through our consolidated statement of operations in june 2018 the trustees of the u k main pension plan entered into an agreement with a third party insurance company to purchase an annuity for participants in such plan who have not yet retired the purchase of the annuity resulted in a non cash loss of 63 3 for the second quarter of 2018 which we recorded in oci and simultaneously re classified to deficit our pension and post employment defined benefit plan obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations we recognize actuarial gains or losses arising from pension and non pension post employment defined benefit plans in oci and we subsequently reclassify the amounts to deficit during q4 2018 and fy 2018 we recognized 8 4 of net actuarial

the stock market indexes predicted 9 of the last 5 recessions and they have been beauties paul samuelson 1966 1 introduction this article seeks to address some of the recent anxiety over a us economic recession we will look at the economic data and try to parse which data is meaningful and which data is currently pointing to the risk of a 2019 or early 2020 recession we will do this without reference to any complicated statistical models and by only using publicly available data the recent debt and equity market volatility have contributed in no small part to the recessionary concerns we will attempt to place that recent market volatility in a historical context and to shed some light on whether the markets are ahead of the curve on a possible recession it is important to note that any conclusions we reach on a future us recession are not a stock market forecast partly this is because economic growth and stock prices can become decoupled for long stretches of time more importantly the us stock market and particularly the s p 500 index spy reflects global economic developments to the us gdp does not for example almost half of spy company revenues are sourced from overseas it has been estimated that 40 to 60 of annual s p 500 earnings growth is derived from overseas sources of revenue our focus in this article is a us recession not a global recession we do not want to cloud the waters by engaging in a debate on spy price targets with that disclaimer out of the way here is our roadmap for analyzing the question is the us likely to enter an economic recession in 2019 or early 2020 1 introduction you are here 2 questions to keep in mind 3 historical financial market volatility 3 1 credit spreads 3 2 debt defaults refinancing obligations 3 3 equity market returns 3 4 market stress volatility indexes 4 macroeconomic sectors 4 1 residential housing 4 2 private sector investing non housing capex 4 3 consumption 4 3 1 are us consumer over extended 4 4 net exports 5 government policy 5 1 monetary policy 5 1 1 the inverted yield curve 5 2 fiscal policy 5 2 1 public debt constraints 5 2 2 the federal shutdown 5 3 deregulation 5 4 policy uncertainty 6 irrelevant metrics 6 1 private sector credit growth 6 2 private payrolls 6 3 stock market margin debt 6 4 vehicle sales 7 what would change our mind 8 recap conclusion 2 questions to keep in mind as you go through these charts there are some questions you may want to keep returning to these questions may also help you the next time some commentator makes a bold prediction based on a single economic or market indicator leading indicator does this indicator generate a recession signal before the recession has actually begun at the other end of the spectrum does the indicator generate a recession signal so many years in advance of a recession that it cannot possibly take account of intervening actions by governments in section 6 below we will discuss some popular economic indicators that actually lag gdp data historically accurate does this indicator generate incorrect recession signals there are dozens upon dozens of intuitive recession indicators that generate too many or too few recession signals signal parameters it is one thing to look at historical recessions and the general trend of a recession indicator but for any indicator to be meaningful in the future we need to more precisely define the parameters of that indicator how far does it need to decline how long does it need to decline does a reversal of the trend nullify the earlier signal etc etc we will discuss this problem in section 5 1 1 below in the context of inverted yield curve recession predictions although it applies to all the indicators in this article it is dã jã vu all over again the markets are currently very concerned about weakness in the housing sector and a repeat of the 2007 2008 financial meltdown it is worth asking whether a given indicator was flashing red before the last recession and how does that stack up to recent readings in the indicator how about some confirmation a recession is incredibly difficult to predict no two are ever alike but there has yet to be a recession which did not generate multiple leading indicator warning signs if your only warning is a single indicator and the slowdown has not spread to several other metrics there is most likely a problem with your mental model in many cases the person asserting a recessionary signal from their preferred economic indicator s will provide you with a convenient historical time series chart where you can test these questions against incidences of prior recessions it is a widely held belief that financial markets are a useful leading indicator of economic growth as a result we will begin by putting the recent debt and equity market volatility into its historical context if you would rather focus on the economic data you can skip ahead to section 4 3 historical financial market volatility by way of preview the late 2018 market sell off was no more remarkable or we would argue concerning than many prior episodes of market volatility most of which did not lead to a recession the cost of financing is still at or near historic lows and given the ongoing but often overlooked upward trend in core inflation and labor cost pressures modestly higher nominal rate increases are not that surprising nor are they a reason to worry about a near term recession figure 1 conveniently summarizes the all in nominal cost of financing for lenders of different credit quality two things hopefully stand out firstly nominal yields are still very low by historical standards and the late 2018 spike in nominal yields was certainly no worse than 2011 2012 or 2015 2016 figure 1 treasury high yield ytw 3 1 credit spreads of course nominal yields are less relevant in an environment of rising core inflation if we look at real inflation adjusted rates on aaa corporate debt they are still hovering around multi decade lows core inflation has been trending upwards since early 2018 and as you might expect nominal aaa yields are also increasing this has kept real yields almost flat this is not entirely due to the fed raising short term interest rates it is also a reflection of the fact that market lenders are demanding higher interest rates to compensate them for higher inflation now and in the future figure 2 aaa aaa all in yield core cpi similarly the real spread on baa corporate bonds i e the lowest investment grade rating before high yield ratings is still near historic lows and is displaying no more volatility than is typically associated with annual spread variations over the business cycle figure 3 baa bbb real all in yield there has unquestionably been a significant fund outflow from high yield debt funds both bonds 3 bn ytd and leveraged loans 4 bn ytd however high yield issuance continues at a robust pace albeit down from the historically elevated levels of recent years in january alone there were 13 high yield issues raising 12 bn of proceeds in leveraged loans ytd there was almost 20 bn in institutional loan launches given that core inflation is hovering above the fed s 2 target it is all the more remarkable that corporate credit spreads are currently as low as they are it is perhaps obvious from the chart of the baa real yields that nominal baa yields are struggling to keep up with core inflation going further down the ratings scale the real spreads on high yield debt are once again near historic lows 250 bps the 2018 volatility is nowhere near as dramatic as the market sell offs in 1998 2001 2003 2007 2011 and 2014 2015 figure 4 real high yield oas spreads 3 2 debt defaults refinancing obligations from a long term historical perspective both the high yield and investment grade debt default rates are incredibly benign with the recent sell off in crude oil prices we may experience another spike in energy related defaults however as figure 5 illustrates this commodity price sensitive does not generally cause a credit contagion to other sectors of the economy figure 5 percent of high yield and investment grade defaults source moody s note ba in legend should read baa if we focus on defaults since 2013 the leveraged loan default rate continues at a trickle interestingly if you looked at the default rate forecasts in mid 2018 most estimates had the rate continuing to slowly grind higher into 2019 compared to the actual modest decline in the default rate over late 2018 figure 6 us leveraged loan default rate globally the message is broadly the same with a more enduring elevated level of energy resources defaults but even if you include energy in the global totals default rates are very benign there is no obvious reason to currently be concerned about us banks and their potential exposure to international borrowers this data is also confirmed by the fdic and sec filings of the 100 largest us banks figure 7 global speculative grade default rates delinquency rates give us an eye into the future of possible debt defaults and on this metric it is all quiet on the western front with the lowest delinquency rates in generations figure 8 commercial bank loans delinquency rates similarly the number of special mentions in the shared national credit program examinations shows a clear downward trend while not always the case the percentage of sm c often begins trending upwards for a couple of years before an economic recession figure 9 overall special mention and classified volume and percentage trends source board of governors of the federal reserve system fdic office of the comptroller of the currency january 2019 note there was a definitional change to credit in fy2018 which may have artificially lowered some of the results for 2018 however the trend in credit quality since 2009 is clear that is all well and good but many people are worried about a lending bubble where borrowers have taken on too much debt with progressively weaker debt covenants there is some merit to those concerns with a clear loosening in covenants especially cov light bonds since 2009 however if the debt bubble does burst it won t be caused by a refinancing crisis in previous cycles refinancing risk has been a legitimate concern particularly on a sector specific basis but as we see in figure 10 the leverage loan maturities are progressively staggered for many years to come this is to say that there is not a wall of debt coming due in 2019 or 2020 for that matter figure 10 us leveraged loan maturity wall 3 3 equity market returns many commentators have viewed this recent market volatility as an important indicator of an impending gdp recession even the latest fomc minutes referred on multiple occasions to the recent market sell off as an important consideration to be weighed against the stronger than expected incoming economic data depending on how you want to define the stock market stock prices in the us have either gone nowhere in the last twelve months wilshire 5000 or are down around 10 spy figure 12 wilshire 5000 total market full cap index yoy change the technical definition of an equity bear market is a 20 decline from recent highs most commonly investors will use the spy or the dow jones industrial average djia for this assessment while we technically meet that criterion at the moment we would argue that historically a 20 decline from peak to trough is not that meaningful apart from the convenience of sharing a commonly accepted definition of a bear market it is often stated that a technical bear market is significant because it portends the end of a bull market and further stock price declines to follow while this is a well defined and easily understood definition its forecasting accuracy isn t as robust as many believe when it comes to forecasting recessions a 20 stock market decline from peak to trough is not particularly illuminating a major market sell off can be a more robust indicator of recessionary pressures more but we are currently a long way from that condition being met figure 13 s p 500 index yoy change 1950 to 2019 either way it is clear that the current stock market volatility is well within the bounds of normal variation and is not that remarkable historically the s p 500 generates average annual returns of around 5 and has annual volatility of 15 which means that on average every 2 years or so the market will be down 10 figure 15 s p 500 index yoy change 2014 to 2019 3 4 financial stress volatility indexes it is also not apparent that there might be financial stresses lurking beneath the surface of recent stock market gyrations the high yield debt markets are still very much open with almost 5 bn in bond primary issuance during the early weeks of 2019 over 13 bn in levered loans i e sub investment grade institutional loans we launched in early january and the vix recently peaked at 35 a level that was exceeded in the non recession years of 1998 2002 2010 2012 and 2016 figure 16 cboe volatility index similarly the st louis fed s financial stress index despite a recent rally is still negative note a reading below zero in figures 17 18 corresponds to less than normal financial stress figure 17 financial stress indices since 2008 recession a longer term perspective is provided in figure 18 negative financial stress index readings are not the norm figure 18 st louis fed financial stress index 1994 to 2019 so if there are no signs of financial strain in the cost of capital nor in the underlying volatility and stress indexes maybe there are signs of a slowdown in the economic data 4 macroeconomic sectors to make it easier to follow the discussion of different sectors it can help to think of the probably familiar macroeconomic equation gdp c i g t x m we will spend some time discussing individual sub sectors within that formula e g residential housing construction gets its own section separate from the discussion of investment spending federal government policy will be discussion in section 5 below as part of our examination of government policy in particular section 5 2 below looks at federal fiscal policy by way of preview the aggregate leading indicator indexes for the us are not only suggesting that there is no looming recession they are on the contrary quite bullish figure 19 oecd leading indicator index for us the residential housing sector has garnered much of the recent media and market attention presumably because it is considered a reliable leading indicator everyone can grasp the concept of housing investment in a way that net exports and other sectors can be more theoretical than practical for many investors it is currently one of the few sectors displaying obvious signs of economic weakness and it was a major catalyst for the 2008 recession which is still fresh in the minds of many investors for all these reasons we begin our examination with residential housing section 4 1 before turning to non housing investment in the following section section 4 2 4 1 residential housing it is true that there has been a material slowdown in this sub sector no question perhaps because of the parallels to 2006 2007 many are worried that this slowdown will cascade through the rest of the economy we currently consider this unlikely for several reasons firstly we need to put residential housing construction into perspective it constitutes about 3 of us gdp it is slightly larger than changes in business inventories rfi is the second line from the bottom of figure 20 below figure 20 gross private domestic investment regardless of its relative contribution to economic growth the current environment for mortgages is relatively benign on a historical comparison basis real mortgage rates are still near historic lows outside of a recession figure 21 real average fixed rate mortgage interest rate nominal mortgage rates are currently lower than the annual nominal increase in average property prices which was one of the contributing factors to there being no property market downturn during the 2002 gdp recession compare this to the mortgage rate property price spread in 1981 1989 and 2007 figure 22 nominal mortgage interest rates relative to nominal change in residential property prices even when you adjust for inflation which is perhaps overly generous to the recession thesis there are not any signs of a housing price collapse a price deceleration perhaps but outside of certain regional markets prices are still increasing in real terms again you can see the clear differences between 2006 2007 and 2018 2019 figure 23 real yoy change in housing prices the mba confirmed the ongoing strength in mortgage lending in early january 2019 with the following update mortgage applications rose to their strongest level in years last week with purchase applications rising to the highest since 2010 and refinance applications up to their highest level since last spring the one area where the mortgage market is not at or near historic lows is the mortgage delinquency rate this metric remains somewhat elevated from prior cycle lows but the downward trend is very clear and there are no obvious signs of a turnaround in the delinquency rate although the latest data in this series is still several months old figure 24 residential mortgage delinquency rate so if mortgage lending is still relatively cheap and plentiful how about the construction and permitting side of the housing market we will take these in turn starting with permits then construction stars followed by home sales and homebuilder confidence within the residential construction sector there are a couple of sector specific leading indicator indexes we will focus on housing unit permit approvals housing starts housing sales both new and used houses and the nahb homebuilder confidence index once again with the exception of the 2000 recession housing permits generally fall off a cliff prior to a gdp recession any decline we see in the permits is temporary and well within the range of average monthly volatility figure 25 private housing unit permits building starts continue to grow the recent declines are well within normal monthly volatility and has shown no meaningful signs of a slowdown especially when compared to early 2006 the homebuilder confidence survey has declined sharply from its historically unsustainable recent readings of 70 but at 54 is still pointing to near term growth in housing construction note the nahb survey is a hybrid of current conditions and expectations for 6 months into the future figure 26 nahb homebuilder confidence index new single family housing starts the difference between starts and sales can be difficult to discern in these historical charts but sales have been declining more rapidly than starts contributing in large part to the media market concerns about a housing bust and economic recession however the decline is not yet comparable to 2006 or 1980 or 1990 with once again 2001 being an exception also the decline in the volatile new houses sales index is not being reflected in the existing home sales index which has increased the last several months of 2018 figure 27 new one family housing sales already we are seeing homebuilders including lennar len announce better than expected demand for housing on the back of interest rate softening this may turn out to be a dead cat bounce but the relative stock price performance of many us homebuilders even after adjusting for interest rates is more akin to the end of a housing recession than the beginning of one figure 28 homebuilder relative stock price performance even if all the prior 6 points are somehow invalidated we still need to see some economic weakness outside of the residential construction sector for there to be a recession there needs to be contagion from residential housing to the broader economy and or other reasons for weakness in the non housing sectors 4 2 private sector investment non housing capex so if we put residential construction expenditures to one side how is the rest of the investment sector performing by any measure non housing capex is booming with a nominal growth rate of almost 5 per year close to a 3 annual real rate figure 28 gross fixed capital formation this perhaps should not come as a surprise given the 2018 tax cuts and jobs act corporate income tax cuts the high percentage of corporate profits relative to gdp and the not insignificant post 2016 federal deregulation see section 5 5 below it has been estimated by several economists that the impact of the corporate tax cuts assuming everything else remains constant will continue contributing to investment growth for the remainder of 2019 and early 2020 similarly while new orders tend to be volatile the moving average has clearly been in an uptrend since early 2016 note given the volatile nature of this data series it is common to use a 4 week moving average we did not do that here because there is no appreciable decline in the smoothed data series figure 29 manufacturers new orders we can put the monthly industrial production data in broadly the same category this data is current until the end of 2018 unlike quarterly gdp data which has a longer time lag there are not many episodes in history where fears of a recession were associated with industrial production growing at more than 4 per annum figure 30 industrial production yoy change the ism purchasing managers index pmi is considered a rapidly adjusting forward looking indicator of economic weakness a reading below 50 is often interpreted as a sign of a pending recession the current reading is 54 1 figure 31 ism pmi source institute for supply management if you apply the long term rates does it need to be negative by say x bps or is any negative number enough to generate a recession signal if you require a meaningful inversion so as to exclude the non recessions that followed brief inversions in 1998 2005 etc then there was no recession signal generated before the 2007 8 financial crisis what happens if the yield curve does a double dip what if the yield curve inverts in the midst of a recession does that mean there is another recession on the horizon or do inversions during recessions not count does our sample include the 1970s and 1980s or is it based on just the recessions since the us has experienced relatively benign inflation the answers to many of these questions permit us to include a number of recessions in our sample but at the same time it would exclude other recession predictions 5 long lags or really short ones what is an acceptable time lag from an inverted yield curve and the start of a recession if we define the recession signal as being generated by a single quarter of inversion and is not negated by a double dip inversion then there is a 2 to 3 year lag from inversion to recession that could be helpful if we didn t face the other methodology problems in question 4 above but when you are looking that far out you really need other data to confirm your theory a lot can happen in 36 months including fiscal stimulus new qe programs etc frankly i m not sure how useful it would be to know today in 2019 that there is a high probability never a certainty of a recession in 2022 if your confirmation signal is when the inversion ends then the lag is at most a few months sometimes the recession has already begun negating much of the practical benefit of this signal under this model specification other economic data would have dramatically increased the odds of a recession long before the inverted yield curve signal was generated 6 recession this year let s pretend for a moment that none of these methodological problems existed and the inverted yield curve recession was 100 accurate based on when the curve is first inverted then that points to the fact that a recession in 2019 or 2020 is unlikely given the lag from signal to recession 7 monetary economics there are a number of technical reasons to believe that the inversion of the yield curve is less relevant today than it was in the past we won t go into the complexity of monetary economics in this article except to mention the potential importance of lower inflation expectations changing bond equity market correlations the impact of central bank bond purchase programs and the dramatic reduction in the term premium of interest rates in summary we do not see the current stance of fed monetary policy as being the catalyst for a recession 5 2 fiscal policy the first thing to note about federal fiscal policy is that while the 2018 tax cuts have received a lot of attention it is also rapidly increasing federal government expenditures that are contributing to the fiscal deficit deterioration while this is an important issue for the future we discuss public debt capacity in section 5 2 1 below there are no immediate plans to reduce the current fiscal stimulus it is not fiscal policy that is going to cause a recession in 2019 figure 47 federal budget nominal outlays receipts with a divided congress it is perhaps even more unlikely that we are going to see a major reduction in federal spending any time before the 2020 elections we should also point out that a recession is unlikely to be associated with total government inaction after a single negative gdp reading and often before even signs of a negative gdp reading it would be quite common to see some form of tax relief government spending stimulus and or interest rate reductions often this stimulus is too little or too late but the point for this section of the article is that fiscal policy will probably not directly contribute to a recession figure 48 government spending as of gdp source bea note edits by lcmi red lines indicate fiscal stimulus either from automatic stabilizers and or new fiscal policy initiatives as we saw in europe around 2012 fiscal stimulus is only effective provided the public sector has the confidence of debt markets with us gross debt to gdp hovering around 100 have we reached the point where stimulative federal fiscal policy is no longer a realistic option 5 2 1 public debt constraints there is a compelling case to be made that the current size of federal government debt 100 of gdp combined with a widening fiscal deficit may make future stimulus spending less of a viable alternative indeed at some point the markets will stop providing cheap funds to a heavily indebted government even if it is the reserve currency and the basis for the risk free interest rate debt markets in particular can be fickle figure 49 federal debt as of gdp there are a few factors which may support future fiscal stimulus for one thing the current debt service ratio is near generational lows moreover if we enter a recession in 2019 or 2020 then that points to lower interest rates this would improve the ability of the federal government to service that sovereign debt there are other issues to consider when examining the willingness of debt markets to service additional federal government debt including but not limited to average term to maturity the proportion of fixed rate debt the ability to raise taxes an area where the federal us government has plenty of capacity especially when compared to other major sovereign borrowers lender diversification the prevalence of index linked bonds central bank holding of domestic public debt short term liquidity the percentage of public debt held by domestic population etc etc we are going to overlook those issues for this article and assume that the debt markets do not capriciously turn on the federal government provided the debt service ratio remains near historic lows figure 50 federal interest payments as of gdp with that in mind the broad takeaway is that federal debt service is not currently a pressing issue and should facilitate fiscal stimulus over the next couple of years also within wide limits sovereign debt sizing is all relative currently the federal government is nowhere near the most indebted sovereign borrower there are far more indebted emerging market governments e g venezuela lebanon sudan barbados singapore etc as well as advanced economy governments e g belgium greece italy japan etc if we were to focus on net public debt instead of gross public debt then eu nations like france and spain would also rank higher than the us federal government combined with the inherent benefits of its reserve currency status there are more obvious targets for disgruntled public sector lenders 5 2 2 the 2018 2019 federal shutdown but what about the federal government shut down i hear you scream well a shutdown may have a negative impact on consumer and or investor psychology but the reduction in spending during a shutdown is a trivial amount of total government expenditures this reflects the fact that most of the federal budget no longer consists of discretionary items the shutdown directly affects approximately 1 10th of 1 of total federal government expenditures i e 0 1 of annual federal government spending some but not all of that reduced spending is clawed back when the federal government re opens e g reimbursing government employees for missed wages which is not to say that a shutdown cannot have a major impact on consumer and or investor sentiment perhaps it is somewhat ironic that the stock market has been in risk on mode since the federal shutdown began with both the wlsh and the spx rallying over 10 so obviously it is not yet decimating investor confidence having said that we acknowledge that there is a credible argument to be made that a financial market investors have very different risk tolerances to business owners investors and b the expectations of slower fed rate hikes and or lower nominal mortgage interest rates could have outweighed the impact of the shutdown on market confidence if forced to pick a side we consider it on balance likely that the market is generally unconcerned about the shutdown although just as with federal debt capacity the markets can turn on a dime when it comes to the perceived effect of a federal shutdown the white house estimates that each week of the federal government shutdown reduces gdp by 13 bps i e 0 13 if the economy is currently growing at circa 3 per annum gdpnow reading was 2 8 for q4 2018 it would take an almost six 6 month shutdown to wipe out the current economic growth you may want to take that figure with a grain of salt as the white house is no doubt trying to apply pressure on the house i e a 5 bn wall appropriation is a lot cheaper than the reduction in gdp caused by the shutdown the relationship is not linear and the data does not include economic adjustments such as the benefit to the economy of lower interest rates and fx rates i e it is not a dynamic scoring other estimates of the initial phase of the shutdown range from 6 bn s p to 11 bn senate democrats in lost economic output some of which will be clawed back by backpay etc to put that figure in context it is at the high end of the range assuming no claw backs of lost economic activity 0 06 i e 6 bps of annual gdp even on a quarterly basis it may detract 0 22 22 bps from q1 2019 growth at the risk of sounding like a broken record it is going to take more than this solitary economic concern to push the us into a recession in the event that the federal shutdown resumes after the 3 week hiatus the federal shutdown should not be the catalyst for an economic recession if it is it won t be caused by a trivial amount of federal spending reductions but by the psychological confidence effects on other sectors of the economy next we turn to an element of federal economic policy that is often overlooked by the markets economic commentators and especially the media 5 3 federal deregulation there is an area of federal government economic policy that does not receive anywhere near the same amount of attention as fiscal monetary policy that is federal regulatory policy since the 2016 elections there has not only been a staggering deceleration in the number of new regulations but also a substantial winding back of earlier federal regulations figure 51 new economically significant federal rules you need to go back to the regan administration for such a low level of regulatory additions and a reduction in the net number of total regulations if you measure total regulations as a of gdp the reduction is even more significant figure 52 total pages in the federal register now there are some problems with the simplistic formula that less pages of regulation equals better regulation and or faster economic growth the number of pages of regulation is not necessarily synonymous with the economic burden of regulations although it is a reasonable proxy some desirable regulations have no obvious short term economic benefit environmental protection being the most commonly cited example the number of pages in the federal register doesn t take account of the numbers of pages in case laws and whether there is relative stability and clear guidance from precedents and there may be a number of economically beneficial regulations that may have also been removed along with the regulations that impose a dead weight loss on the economy with those caveats in mind it has been estimated that the post 2016 federal deregulation initiatives have added around 1 to gdp growth we can debate the merits of each individual deregulation initiative but for present purposes the important takeaway is that deregulation of this scale has a clear economic growth benefits for the economy this stimulatory benefit is rarely incorporated into economists estimates of macroeconomic growth there are a lot of elements involved in federal government economic policy we have argued that most of those policies are currently stimulative but do all the changes result in too much economic uncertainty is future consumption and or investment going to be reduced because of such radical changes 5 4 policy uncertainty we all know that too much uncertainty can have a depressing effect on private sector investment spending while there is no perfect measure of economic policy uncertainty baker has an intuitive measure of policy volatility while that index is slightly elevated we are not entirely sure if it incorporates the impact of presidential tweets it is nowhere near historic highs figure 53 economic policy uncertainty index as a broad generalization you can tell from baker s chart that historically policy uncertainty isn t in and of itself a catalyst for a recession moreover as we discussed in section 4 2 above non housing capex is currently booming and there are several leading indicators that suggest to us that investment strength may continue for some time to the extent that there is any detrimental policy uncertainty it is not yet flowing through to the economy to put the current us economic policy uncertainty into a global context and to see what economic policy uncertainty really looks like you can compare it to the comparable chinese index this comparative chart also indirectly talks to the impact of the current trade negotiations on their respective economies figure 54 economic policy uncertainty indices for us china having walked through different sectors of the macro economy and the implications of current federal government economic policy for the future we want to briefly address a number of popular metrics that are not particularly helpful for the purposes of discussing a future us recession 6 irrelevant or lagging indicators it should be noted that all of the indicators discussion in this section are currently very bullish for gdp growth we only mention them because at some point they may turn bearish and while the media will jump all over them as signs of a possible recession you should be aware that they don t tell us much of anything about the future 6 1 credit growth the lending practices of credit institutions tend to lag the business cycle based on our latest estimates there may be as much as an 18 to 24 month lag between a real gdp growth and b credit growth as a of gdp figure 55 credit growth is a lagged response to business cycle source st louis fed adjustment by lcmi to lag gdp data by 24 months note title says gdp is lagged 2 years but because the chart moved the dates with gdp it technically should say change in pnf credit as a of gdp is lagged 2 years when you hear about the growth in credit as of gdp that tells you more about where the economy was approx 2 years ago similarly with few exceptions the real growth in business lending generates a recession signal often after the recession is well underway and takes several years after the recession to start growing again figure 56 real growth in c i loans the current decelerating in bank lending and deposits we would argue is a reflection of the late 2015 early 2016 economic slowdown and is not a robust barometer of next year s gdp growth figure 57 real growth in commercial bank assets deposits regardless even if these credit metrics were in some way useful measures of future economic growth we would want to see the change in credit reflected in a couple of macroeconomic variables discussed in section 4 above 6 3 stock market margin debt margin debt generates a lot of commentaries because it supposedly highlights when the stock market and or the business cycle is over extended the problem with using margin data for either of those purposes is that there is not a magical level where suddenly margin debt causes a sell off or we would have been in a bear market recession since early 2014 it also suffers from many of the vague parameter problems that we discussed in section 5 1 1 above regarding the inverted yield curve depending on how you want to define a signal margin debt either generates too many false bear market signals e g 1998 2002 3 2012 2015 or generates signals way beyond the point at which it is useful for forecasting figure 58 margin debt stock prices 6 3 private payrolls this metrics has received a fair amount of media attention in recent weeks as evidence that perhaps the us is not going into a recession after all we think that is the wrong way to use the data with very few exceptions a decline in the payroll numbers usually occurs closer to the end of a recession than the beginning as does the unemployment rate and a great many labor market indicators and the recovery in payroll numbers often occurs many months sometimes years after an economic recovery has already begun figure 59 non farm payroll yoy change there are also fairly robust theoretical micro economic reasons why labor market data is more likely to lag the business cycle 6 4 vehicle sales another media darling is vehicle sales despite being an interest rate sensitive sector it is of limited utility as a leading indicator total us vehicle sales are currently in a robust uptrend but that is not particularly relevant for forecasting a recession vehicle sales as a of gdp have been in a prolonged structural downtrend since the 1970s any reduction in nominal vehicle sales just isn t that important to the overall economy figure 60 vehicle sales as of gdp note we used real gdp to determine the relative importance of car sales this is probably overly generous as vehicle sales are a nominal number it is the number of units sold not the total value of car sales if we were to examine nominal vehicle sales as a percent of nominal gdp then the relative importance of vehicle sales is even less moreover in recent recessions vehicle sales have been more of a lagging indicator partly because car durability has improved so much in recent decades the average age of the car on us roads is circa 12 years that is the average which means that many cars are 20 years old us consumers simply don t turn over cars as much as they used to having looked at the macro economic data and discarded some popular metrics along the way we will now go through the painful process of highlighting some of the limitations of our analysis 7 what would change our mind this article has relied in large part on forward looking macroeconomic data as well as current federal government economic policies and their implications for future economic growth there are some limitations to this approach including limits on our knowledge and events that may upend historical economic relationships often referred to as structural breaks here are some of the possible events that are worth keeping an eye on it is far from an exhaustive list trade barriers if the us china trade negotiations fail to generate a positive resolution and or protectionism extends to other regions that would have severe consequences for net exports and or investor psychology political gridlock the federal shutdown may only be the first salvo in an ongoing skirmish when important issues are not addressed the rescinded offer to host the state of the union in the house is not a great omen for the different branches of government working together to solve even non ideological problems stock market collapse 1987 was a case study in how a government and particularly the fed can prevent a market panic from developing into an economic recession or depression however history is not kind to gdp growth and major stock market sell offs outside major stock market sell offs there is some statistical evidence that consumer spending causes changes in stock prices and not vice versa granger causation multivariate var etc however the nightmare scenario is where the government lower rates and or boosts spending or cuts taxes following a stock market drop and yet consumer and or investor confidence continues to plummet sovereign debt crisis we already discussed the risks of an elevated levels of us sovereign debt see section 5 2 1 above but there are far more materials risks in other regions of the world credit contagion can move with frightening speed and have a chilling effect on global capital markets while us treasuries rallied over 30 during the 2008 crisis there is no guarantee this will happen every time oil price shock in the unlikely event that opec cuts production to such an extent that nominal oil prices spike there would be major stagflation implications for the us and the world geopolitical non economic shocks too many to mention but would include items such as a dirty bomb in a major population center iran or north korean deploying a nuclear weapon india pakistan war or china india war or etc a major seismic event in california particularly near silicon valley eu splits apart full scale russian invasion of one of its neighbors presidential impeachment syrian war drags in neighbors or provokes major us russia conflict etc etc any number of these events could adversely affect consumer and or business confidence to such an extent that they could conceivably precipitate a recession they are worth watching in combination with the economic data releases 8 i skipped to the end what are you saying about a us recession in forecasting there are times where the economic projection have a rather wide range of possible outcomes and it is difficult to say with a high degree of confidence that next year s growth rate will be x there are other times when government actions provide you with a high degree of confidence that a recession is about to end or that there is very little likelihood of a recession any time soon we are currently in one of those times when you can say with a high degree of confidence that the us is unlikely to enter a recession in 2019 or even early 2020 there is a lot of uncertainty about the future and something devastating could happen tomorrow but based on the data available to the market today there is no fundamental reason to think that the past and future federal reserve interest rate increases will result in a recession this year it is amazing to think that with real interest rates near zero and unemployment at generational lows market participants are concerned that further interest rate increases could be the catalyst that tips the economy into a recession at some point that will no longer be the case but we are not there yet finally by most measures we are experiencing a unique benign economic environment in the us you need to go back a long time to find a better combination of unemployment and inflation i e the misery index figure 61 the misery index unemployment rate core inflation rate instead of welcoming this period of relative economic prosperity and financial stability far too many commentators are predicting a us recession because a stock prices haven t risen for 12 months or are down 10 yoy b real interest rates are approaching zero c property prices are still adding to household wealth d domestic investment retail sales are growing above trend and e global trade imbalances are quite manageable there is a lot that can wrong from here there will be plenty of time to worry about a recession in the future
a foreign power that controls the caribbean sea could cripple the u s economy the united states is being threatened by hostile nations taking over the caribbean sea major news sources pay little attention to this region but the caribbean is vital to u s security this sea not only connects the east coast with the pacific ocean via the panama canal it guards the mouth of the gulf of mexico half

astonishing truth means that the bible s end time prophecies concerning israel are primarily directed at the united states and britain as well as the jewish state of israel one specific prophecy likens end time israel to a hedged vineyard protected on all sides until god removes the hedge i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down and i will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come up briers and thorns i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel isaiah 5 5 7 this description of a hedged vineyard fits no nation better than it does the united states i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down the u s is protected on the west by the world s largest ocean and the rocky mountains it is protected on the north by the arctic tundra and the friendly nation of canada it is protected on the east by the world s second largest ocean and the appalachian mountains it is protected on the south by the chihuahuan desert lying within these natural fortifications is the mississippi basin the world s largest contiguous expanse of arable land this basin is the key to u s dominance over north america about 57 percent of u s seaborne exports flow out of the mississippi basin to international markets via the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea cuba lies between florida and the yucatan peninsula an enormous gatehouse between the u s heartland and the outside world see map page 18 the threat of a naval blockade against the mississippi basin is why the u s supported cuba s independence from spain and took over the island as a protectorate upon winning the spanish american war in 1898 it is why the soviets tried to use cuba against the u s and why the u s tried to oust the soviet union from cuba in 1962 now the u s is allowing russia and china to forge alliances with cuba nicaragua and venezuela this is setting the stage for a time when an alliance of hostile nations will finally lay siege to america and refuse to let shipments pass the gatehouse in either direction mart of nations some 2 700 years ago god inspired the prophet isaiah to write about a vast trade bloc a mart of nations that would form in the end time isaiah 23 3 verse 1 shows that a lead nation in this trade bloc would be chittim trumpet editor in chief gerald flurry explains in his booklet isaiah s end time vision that chittim or kittim is an ancient name for modern china another leading entity in the trade bloc is tyre mr flurry explains that this represents the commercial center of modern europe a related passage in ezekiel 27 mentions ancient names for modern russia tubal and meshech showing that it too will join this mart with a german led europe the king of the north possessing great maritime power north america will be surrounded on the east by europe and the south by latin america mr flurry writes the bible contains many prophecies of that european power attacking america and many other prophecies of america being besieged isaiah s end time vision he then explains that this dramatic besiegement will be accomplished with the help of the other countries associated with the mart of nations of isaiah 23 and ezekiel 27 including russia and china all of them are going to besiege america britain and the jewish nation he writes he giants of asia will form a brief alliance with the european bloc he writes should europe the resurrected holy roman empire find a way to take advantage even for a moment of key resources and strategic holdings of china russia and japan it would have more than enough power to besiege the anglo saxon nations and enslave them this is why isaiah s prophecy of an end time mart of nations that includes both european and asian powers is so intriguing russia delivers two supersonic bombers to venezuela vadim savitsky tass getty images mr flurry draws particular attention to the latin american region due to its proximity to the united states herbert armstrong long prophesied and we expect the alliance between europe and south america to grow extremely strong he writes europe already wields considerable influence in latin america and once russia and china enter into a brief alliance with europe the influence these powers exert in cuba nicaragua and venezuela will translate into greater foreign control over the region the book of deuteronomy provides more details about the coming besiegement of the united states the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the earth as swift as the eagle flieth a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fenced walls come down wherein thou trustedst throughout all thy land and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land which the lord thy god hath given thee deuteronomy 28 49 52 a gate is a narrow passage of entrance or exit when speaking nationally a sea gate is a narrow choke point like the panama canal the straits of florida the windward passage or the yucatan channel god gave britain and america these strategic gates and many others ensuring that they would become economic and military superpowers but god also warned that if america and britain did not obey him then not only would these sea gates be taken away but they would be used against them this is about to happen these are chilling prophecies pointing to some dark days ahead for america and some of its allies but bible prophecy shows that the mart of nations and the conflict associated with it is actually divine correction that will be immediately followed by the most hope filled epoch in man s history two great trading blocs are positioning themselves to control the world mr flurry writes but that trading partnership won t last long soon they will clash just before jesus christ returns and destroys both of them christ will bring with him a time of peace and stability for the peoples of all nations

cairo 31 january 2019 global and local economic incidents shadowed the egyptian exchange egx during 2018 as it witnessed a downtrend since april after hitting its highest historical level of approximately 18 400 points through the year the benchmark egx30 dropped 13 21 percent or 1 983 37 to end the year at 13 035 77 points compared to 15 019 14 at the end of 2017 the value of trading on the egx30 recorded le 188 billion through 43 billion shares in 2017 the egx30 rose by 21 66 percent or 2 674 25 points reaching 15 019 points the small and mid cap index egx70 slumped during the year by 16 16 percent or 133 8 points reaching 693 83 points compared to 827 66 points by the end of last year and the broader index egx100 also lessened during january to december 2018 period by 12 4 percent or 244 55 points to close at 1 727 21 points down from 1971 76 at the end of the prior year analysts told egypt today that this downtrend came due to several economic decisions and actions which took place in egypt and globally the decline in the value of the local currency the delay of ipos planned for government institutions the trade war between the united states u s and china and the crisis of emerging markets em analyst in institutional equity sales at naeem holding for investment mohamed sameh attributes the downtrend of the egyptian exchange egx in 2018 to several reasons including expectations that the federal reserve will raise the interest rates several times during 2019 and thereby further pressure the highly indebted emerging markets their debt service cost in such economies is expected to rise as advanced economies normalize monetary policy sameh added that this action coincided with the trade war between u s and china which is the biggest in the emerging market clarifying that this war caused a flop in the chinese market and became one of the reasons behind the out flows from all emerging markets escalating trade protectionism heightened geopolitical tensions and the uptick in oil prices at that time built fears concerning achieving the target path for the budget deficit and headline inflation rate which was announced at 13 percent 3 percent he notes shuaa securities egypt attributed the ups and downs of egx in 2018 to three main forces these forces are analysts earnings estimates as measured by forward earnings per share eps for the index components re rating de rating as measured by a higher lower forward price to earnings p e ratio which is also partially affected by earnings estimates and dividend yield dy associate vice president of equity research at beltone financial ali afifi explains that the egx witnessed an overrated hike after the flotation which was followed by an overrated decline witnessed in 2018 afifi added that the increase of interest rates in surrounding countries caused investor outflows from the egyptian market in november 2016 egypt floated its currency losing around 50 percent of its value as part of the economic reform program imposing taxes and cutting energy subsidies these moves aimed to trim the budget deficit after the executive board of the international monetary fund imf approved a 12 billion loan as financial assistance to support the egyptian economic reform program emerging markets were affected by an exit wave of foreign investments in government debt instruments during the second quarter of 2018 as the us dollar rose in value raising fears in comparable emerging markets particularly the more turbulent turkey and argentina in argentina the currency was devalued by 70 percent with 60 percent interest rates turning the country into an attractive investment destination and the turkish lira lost more than 40 percent of its value since the beginning of 2018 foreign investments in egyptian treasury bills t bills recorded le 210 21 billion 11 71 billion at the end of october compared to le 234 52 billion 13 06 billion by the end of september the central bank of egypt cbe revealed that foreign investments in t bills in local currency declined for the seventh month in a row losing around 1 4 billion in october as it reached its lowest levels since june 2017 as a result of the crisis hitting emerging markets the outflows of foreign investments in t bills reached around 9 8 billion during april to october 2018 as the investments hit le 380 3 billion 21 5 billion in march investors seek appropriate return for their risk appetite sameh stated explaining that turmoil surrounding some emerging markets pushed the investor to assign a higher risk premium to emerging markets to compensate growing risk egypt targets average interest rates on the government s debt instrument reaching 14 7 percent in the current budget compared to an expected average of 18 5 percent in fy2017 18 budget during its december meeting the cbe s monetary policy committee kept interest rates on hold for the sixth time in 2018 setting the overnight deposit rate and the overnight lending rate at 16 75 percent and 17 75 percent respectively the egx witnessed four initial offerings during the recently ending year amounting to le 5 2 billion marking an increase of 25 percent compared to 2017 the private offerings of these hit le 4 68 billion compared to le 3 39 billion in previous year moreover public offerings recorded le 0 53 billion in 2018 compared to le 0 57 billion in 2017 meanwhile egypt delayed the listing shares of state owned companies on the egyptian exchange such as the 4 5 percent stake of eastern company slated for october the government attributed the delay to volatility in the global market noting that if the shares were floated it would have failed to be covered at proper valuation analysts agree that this delay contributed to the drop egx witnessed the delay in offering the program s scheduled shares was also reportedly one of the reasons behind the decline of egx associate vice president of equity research at beltone financial afifi says the effect of the ipos delay was not big because share prices had already downed he also stated that the percent age of the free float is not enough sameh argues that the perfect timing for the offering was missed stating that the price of eastern company fell to around le 15 from le 25 while the government plans to offer it at le 21 as a listed company its pricing is easily affected the ipo program is an opportunity for investors waiting for this opportunity analyst institutional equity sales at naeem holding for investment sameh says in 2016 egypt announced the launch of the government s ipo program offering shares over three to five years in several state owned companies in fields such as petroleum services chemicals and real estate as a part of the economic re form program the government targets offering 15 30 percent of stakes in state owned companies on the stock exchange egx to increase funding to egyptian companies maximize the benefit from state assets and attract local and foreign capital flows to egypt market capitalization of the egx lost le 75 2 billion during 2018 recording le 749 7 billion by the end of the year compared to le 824 91 billion in the beginning of 2018 sameh said that increasing market capitalization through ipos will encourage investors to invest in the market and will expand the investor database explaining that market capitalization comprises between 16 percent to 18 percent of the gross domestic product gdp representing one of the lowest rates globally and in emerging markets noting that it should be nearer to 40 percent according to sameh increasing market capitalization will help market liquidity and trading volumes which will encourage them to easily enter market as liquidity and market depth is a critical point for foreigner flows foreign funds would like to use the mini ticket technique to get in and out of the market without any troubles he says the trading volume throughout the year reached 60 8 million shares trading through 6 3 billion transactions with a turnover of le 358 5 billion foreign investors were net buyers during 2018 at le 5 78 billion compared to le 9 55 billion in the prior year according to annual data from the egx meanwhile quarterly data revealed that arab investors have been net sellers at le 838 41 million since the beginning of the year while non arab foreign investors have been net buyers at le 7 218 billion while low oil prices are good for the state budget according to sameh the egx will have an inverse effect as trading of arab investors and organizations are affected by these prices he clarified that declining oil prices would push arabs to sell off in other markets and invest in theirs foreign investors once acquire an annual share amounting 20 35 percent of the total traded value in the egx this lasted from 2007 through to december 11 2018 the decline of this segment has already affected the performance of the egx and inevitably will still have an important impact on the performance of the egx in the upcoming period an article on mubasher trade argues in 2019 sameh expected egx to witness a horizontal trend in contrast with the previous downtrend until the successful offering of the ipos that would increase market capitalization and encourage investors to invest on the egx the expectation that the us will tighten monetary policy this year cast doubt that the cbe can continue easing monetary policy cycle he added mubasher trade also anticipated that tightening monetary policy in the us and the expected tightening of monetary policy in the euro area starting 2019 should have a negative impact on the emerging markets particularly those with high external debt but any severe correction in the equity markets of developed economies may suspend current movements of tightening monetary policy however it is possible for the egyptian equity market to have positive performance in the years ahead strengthened by the forecasted high gdp growth rate and the forecasted lower interest rate despite any crash or correction movements that may hit equity markets in advanced economies within the upcoming period particularly the in us stock market also sometimes any correction movement in advanced economies equity markets may encourage investors to inject their money in emerging countries particularly those with a high gdp growth rate and very cheap equities compared to peers mubasher further notes sameh also feels that oil prices are expected to slump for some time as a result of easing global growth especially in emerging markets amid the surge in the us treasury yield he argues that the market is more aligned with the global trend stating that bearish markets are positively correlated with each other more so than in the bullish market on another note afifi forecasts the egx witnessing an improvement through 2019 as it executes the state ipos program egypt s self sufficiency in natural gas reflects positively on the oil and gas sector afifi notes arguing that these positive results will reach the industrial sector as most factories and plants depend on gas egypt achieved self sufficiency in gas at the end of september 2018 after adding 1 6 million cubic feet to its production from the latest gas discoveries including west delta s taurus and libra fields as well as the atoll and zohr gas fields
published by insurge intelligence a crowdfunded investigative journalism project for people and planet please support us to keep digging where others fear to tread for some the crisis in venezuela is all about the endemic corruption of nicolás maduro continuing the broken legacy of chavez s ideological experiment in socialism under the mounting insidious influence of putin for others it s all about the ongoing counter democratic meddling of the united states which has for years wanted to bring venezuela with its huge oil reserves back into the orbit of american power and is now interfering again to undermine a democratically elected leader in latin america neither side truly understands the real driving force behind the collapse of venezuela we have moved into the twilight of the age of oil so how does a country like venezuela with the largest reserves of crude oil in the world end up incapable of developing them while various elements of socialism corruption and neoliberal capitalism are all implicated in various ways what no one s talking about especially the global oil industry is that over the last decade we ve shifted into a new era the world has moved from largely extracting cheap easy crude to becoming increasingly dependent on unconventional forms of oil and gas that are much more difficult and expensive to produce oil isn t running out in fact it s everywhere we ve more than enough to fry the planet but as the easy cheap stuff has plateaued production costs have soared and as a consequence the most expensive oil to produce has become increasingly unprofitable in a country like venezuela emerging from a history of us interference plagued by internal economic mismanagement combined with external intensifying pressure from us sanctions this decline in profitability became fatal since hugo chavez s election in 1999 the us has continued to explore numerous ways to interfere in and undermine his socialist government this is consistent with the track record of us overt and covert interventionism across latin america which has sought to overthrow democratically elected governments which undermine us interests in the region supported right wing autocratic regimes and funded trained and armed far right death squads complicit in wantonly massacring hundreds of thousands of people for all the triumphant moralising in parts of the western media about the failures of venezuela s socialist experiment there has been little reflection on the role of this horrific counter democratic us foreign policy in paving the way for a populist hunger for nationalist and independent alternatives to us backed cronyism before chavez venezuela used to be a dream us ally model free market economy and a major oil producer with the largest reserves of crude oil in the world the conventional narrative is that its current implosion can only be due to colossal mismanagement of its domestic resources described back in 1990 by the new york times as one of latin america s oldest and most stable democracies the newspaper of record predicted that thanks to the geopolitical volatility of the middle east venezuela is poised to play a newly prominent role in the united states energy scene well into the 1990 s at the time venezuelan oil production was helping to offset the shortage caused by the embargo of oil from iraq and kuwait amidst higher oil prices triggered by the simmering conflict but the nyt had camouflaged a deepening economic crisis as noted by leading expert on latin america javier corrales in revista harvard review of latin america venezuela had never recovered from currency and debt crises it had experienced in the 1980s economic chaos continued well into the 1990s just as the times had celebrated the market economy s friendship with the us explained corrales inflation remained indomitable and among the highest in the region economic growth continued to be volatile and oil dependent growth per capita stagnated unemployment rates surged and public sector deficits endured despite continuous spending cutbacks prior to the ascension of chavez the entrenched party political system so applauded by the us and courted by international institutions like the imf was essentially crumbling according to a recent report by data information resources to the venezuelan american chamber of commerce in the last 25 years the share of household income spent on food has shot up to 72 percent from 28 percent lamented the new york times in 1996 the middle class has shrunk by a third an estimated 53 percent of jobs are now classified as informal in the underground economy as compared with 33 percent in the late 1970 s the nyt piece cynically put all the blame for the deepening crisis on government largesse and interventionism in the economy but even here within the subtext the paper acknowledged a historical backdrop of consistent imf backed austerity measures according to the nyt even the ostensibly anti austerity president rafael caldera who had promised more state financed populism as an antidote to years of imf wrought austerity ended up negotiating for a 3 billion loan from the imf along with a second loan of undisclosed size to ease the social impact of any hardships imposed by an imf agreement so it is convenient that today s loud and self righteous moral denunciations of maduro ignore the instrumental role played by us efforts to impose market fundamentalism in wreaking economic and social havoc across venezuelan society of course outside the fanatical echo chambers of the trump white house and the likes of the new york times the devastating impact of us backed world bank and imf austerity measures is well documented among serious economists in a paper for the london school of economics development economist professor jonathan dijohn of the un research institute for social development found that us backed economic liberalisation not only failed to revive private investment and economic growth but also contributed to a worsening of the factorial distribution of income which contributed to growing polarisation of politics neoliberal reforms further compounded already existing centralised nepotistic political structures vulnerable to corruption far from strengthening the state they led to a collapse in the state s regulative power analysts who hark back to a venezuelan free market golden age ignore the fact that far from reducing corruption financial deregulation large scale privatisations and private monopolies create large rents and thus rent seeking corruption opportunities instead of leading to meaningful economic reforms neoliberalisation stymied genuine reform and entrenched elite power and this is precisely how the west helped create the chavez it loves to hate in the words of corrales in the harvard review economic collapse and party system collapse are intimately related venezuela s repeated failure to reform its economy made existing politicians increasingly unpopular who in turn responded by privileging populist policies over real reforms the result was a vicious cycle of economic and political party decay ultimately paving the way for the rise of chavez dead oil while it is now fashionable to blame the collapse of the venezuelan oil industry solely on chavez s socialism caldera s privatisation of the oil sector was unable to forestall the decline in oil production which peaked in 1997 at around 3 5 million barrels a day by 1999 chavez s first actual year in office production had already dropped dramatically by around 30 percent a deeper look reveals that the causes of venezuela s oil problems are slightly more complicated than the chávez killed it meme since peaking around 1997 venezuelan oil production has declined over the last two decades but in recent years has experienced a precipitous fall there can be little doubt that serious mismanagement in the oil industry has played a role in this decline however there is a fundamental driver other than mismanagement which the press has consistently ignored in reporting on venezuala s current crisis the increasingly fraught economics of oil the vast bulk of venezuela s oil is not conventional crude but unconventional heavy oil a highly viscous liquid that requires unconventional techniques to extract and flow often with heat from steam and or mixing it with lighter forms of crude in the refining process heavy oil thus has a higher cost of extraction than normal crude and a lower market price due to the refining difficulties in theory heavy oil can be produced at below break even prices to a profit but greater investment is still needed to get to that point the higher costs of extraction and refining have played a key role in making venezuela s oil production efforts increasingly unprofitable and unsustainable when oil prices were at their height between 2005 and 2008 venezuela was able to weather the inefficiencies and mismanagement in its oil industry due to much higher profits thanks to prices between 100 and 150 a barrel global oil prices were spiking as global conventional crude oil production began to plateau causing an increasing shift to unconventional sources that global shift did not mean that oil was running out but that we were moving deeper into dependence on more difficult and expensive forms of unconventional oil and gas the shift can be best understood through the concept of energy return on investment eroi pioneered principally by the state university of new york environmental scientist professor charles hall a ratio which measures how much energy is used to extract a particular quantity of energy from any resource hall has shown that as we are consuming ever larger quantities of energy we are using more and more energy to do so leaving less surplus energy at the end to underpin social and economic activity this creates a counter intuitive dynamic even as production soars the quality of the energy we are producing declines its costs are higher industry profits are squeezed and the surplus available to sustain continued economic growth dwindles as the surplus energy available to sustain economic growth is squeezed in real terms the biophysical capacity of the economy to continue buying the very oil being produced reduces economic recession partly induced by the previous era of oil price spikes interacts with the lack of affordability of oil leading the market price to collapse that in turn renders the most expensive unconventional oil and gas projects potentially unprofitable unless they can find ways to cover their losses through external subsidies of some kind such as government grants or extended lines of credit and this is the key difference between venezuela and countries like the us and canada where extremely low eroi levels for production have been sustained largely through massive multi billion dollar loans fuelling an energy boom that is likely to come to a catastrophic end when the debt turkey comes home to roost it s all a bit reminiscent of the dot com bubble of the late 1990s when internet companies were valued on the number of eyeballs they attracted not on the profits they were likely to make wrote bethany mclean recently once again in the new york times a us journalist well known for her work on the enron collapse as long as investors were willing to believe that profits were coming it all worked until it didn t a number of scientists have previously estimated the eroi of heavy oil production to amount to around 9 1 with room for variation up or down depending on how inputs are accounted for and calculated the unfashionable but probably more accurate approach would be downwards closer to 6 1 when both direct and indirect energy costs are considered compare this to the eroi of about 20 1 for conventional crude prior to 2000 which gives an indication of the challenge venezuela faced which unlike the us and canada had emerged into the chavez era from a history of neoliberal devastation and debt expansion that already made further investments or subsidies to venezuela s oil industry a difficult ask venezuela in that sense was ill prepared to adapt to the post 2014 oil price collapse compared to its wealthier western competitors in other forms of unconventional oil and gas to be sure then the collapse of venezuela s oil industry cannot be reduced to geological factors though there can be little doubt that those factors and their economic ramifications tend to be underplayed in conventional explanations above ground factors were clearly a major problem in terms of chronic inadequacy of investment and the resulting degradation of production infrastructure a balanced picture thus has to acknowledge both that venezuela s vast reserves are far more expensive and difficult to bring to market than standard conventional oil and that venezuala s very specific economic circumstances in the wake of decades of failed imf austerity put the country in an extremely weak position to keep its oil show on the road since 2008 oil production has declined by more than 350 000 barrels per day and more than 800 000 per day since its peak level in 1997 this has driven the collapse of net exports by over 1 1 million barrels per day since 1998 meanwhile to sustain refining of heavy oil venezuela has increasingly imported light oil to blend with heavy oil as well as for domestic consumption currently only extra heavy oil production in the orinoco oil belt has been able to increase while conventional oil production continues to rapidly decline despite significant proved conventional reserves these still require more expensive enhanced recovery techniques and infrastructure investments which are unavailable but profit margins from exports of extra heavy crude are much smaller due to the higher costs of blending upgrading and transportation and the heavy discounts in international refining markets in summary oil industry expert professor francisco monaldi at the center for energy and the environment at iesa in venezuela concludes oil production in venezuela is comprised of increasingly heavier oil and thus less profitable pdvsa s operated production is falling more rapidly and the production that generates cash flow is almost half of the total production these trends were problematic enough at peak oil prices but with prices falling they become much more acute the folly of endless growth unfortunately much like his predecessors chavez didn t appreciate the complexities let alone the biophysical economics of the oil industry rather he saw it simplistically through the short term lens of his own ideological socialist experiment from 1998 until his death in 2013 chavez s application of what he called socialism to the oil industry succeeded in reducing poverty from 55 to 34 percent helped 1 5 million adults become literate and delivered healthcare to 70 percent of the population with cuban doctors all this apparent progress was enabled by oil revenues but it was an unsustainable pipe dream instead of investing oil revenues back into production chavez spent them away on his social programmes during the heyday of the oil price spikes with no thought to the industry he was drawing from and in the mistaken belief that prices would stay high by the time prices collapsed due to the global shift to difficult oil described earlier reducing venezuala s state revenues 96 percent of which come from oil chavez had no currency reserves to fall back on chavez had thus dramatically compounded the legacy of problems he had been left with he had mimicked the same mistake made by the west before 2008 pursuing a path of progress based on an unsustainable consumption of resources fuelled by debt and bound to come crashing down so when he ran out of oil money he did what governments effectively did worldwide after the 2008 financial crash through quantitative easing he simply printed money the immediate impact was to drive up inflation he simultaneously fixed the exchange rate to dollars hiked up the minimum wage while forcing prices of staple goods like bread to stay low this of course turned businesses selling such staple goods or involved at every chain in their production into unprofitable enterprises which could no longer afford to pay their own employees due to haemorrhaging income levels meanwhile he slashed subsidies to farmers and other industries while imposing quotas on them to maintain production instead of producing the desired result many businesses ended up selling their goods on the black market in an attempt to make a profit as the economic crisis escalated and as oil production declined chavez pinned his hopes on the potential transformation that could be ushered in by massive state investment in a new type of economy based on nationalised self or cooperatively managed industries those investments too had little results dr asa cusack an expert on venezuela at the london school of economics points out that even though the number of cooperatives exploded in practice they were often as inefficient corrupt nepotistic and exploitative as the private sector that they were supposed to displace meanwhile with its currency reserves depleted the government has had to slash imports by over 65 percent since 2012 while simultaneously reducing social spending to even lower than it was under imf austerity reforms in the 1990s chavistan crisis driven socialism began with unsustainable social spending and has now switched to catastrophic levels of austerity that make neoliberalism look timid in this context the rise of the black market and organised crime exploited by both the government and the opposition became a way of life while the economy food production health care and basic infrastructure collapsed with frightening speed and ferocity climate wild cards amidst this perfect storm the wild card of climate impacts pushed venezuela over the edge accelerating an already dizzying spiral of crises in march 2018 on the back of hyperinflation and recession the government enforced electricity rationing across six western states in one state san cristobal residents reported 14 hour stretches without power after water levels in reservoirs used for hydroelectric plants were reduced due to drought a similar crisis had erupted two years earlier when water levels behind the guri dam which provides well over half the country s electricity hit record lows venezuela generates around 65 percent of its electricity from hydropower with a view to leave as much oil available as possible for export but this has made electricity supplies increasingly vulnerable to droughts induced by climate change impacts it is well known that the el nino southern oscillation the biggest fluctuation in the earth s climate system comprising a cycle of warm and cold sea surface temperatures in the tropical pacific ocean is increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change a new study on the impact of climate change in venezuela finds that between 1950 and 2004 12 out of 15 el nino events coincided with years in which mean annual flow of water in the caroni river basin affecting the guri reservoir and hydroelectric power was smaller than the historical mean from 2013 to 2016 an intensified el nino cycle meant that there was little rain in venezuela culminating in a crippling deficit in 2015 it was the worst drought in almost half a century in the country severely straining the country s aging and poorly managed energy grid resulting in rolling blackouts according to professor juan carlos sanchez a co recipient of the 2007 nobel peace prize for his work with intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc these trends will dramatically deteriorate under a business as usual scenario large areas of venezuelan states which are already water scarce such as falcon sucre lara and zulia including the north of the guajira peninsula will undergo desertification land degradation and decreased rainfall would devastate production of corn black beans and plantains across much of the country sanchez predicts that some regions of the country will receive 25 percent less water than today and that means even less electricity by mid century climate models indicate an overall 18 percent decrease in rainfall in the caroni river basin that leads to the guri dam unfortunately no venezuelan government has ever taken seriously its climate pledges preferring to escalate as much as possible its oil production and even intensifying the co2 intensive practice of gas flaring meanwhile escalating climate change is set to exacerbate venezuela s electricity blackouts infrastructure collapse and agricultural crisis economic war the crisis convergence unfolding in venezuela gives us a window into what can happen when a post oil future is foisted upon you as domestic energy supplies dwindle the state s capacity to function recedes in unprecedented ways opening the way for state failure as the state collapses new smaller centres of power emerge competing for control of diminishing resources in this context reports of food trafficking as a mechanism of economic war are real but they are not exclusive to either political side all sides have become incentivised to horde products and sell them on the black market as a direct result of the collapsing economy retrograde government price controls and wildly speculative prices venezuelan state owned media have pinpointed cases where private companies engaged in hoarding have close ties to the opposition in response the government has appropriated vast assets farmland bakeries other businesses but has failed to lift production on the other hand katiuska rodriguez a journalist investigating shortages at el nacional a pro opposition newspaper said that there is little clear evidence of hoarding being a result of an economic war by capitalist business elites against the government although real she explained hoarding is driven largely by commercial interests in survival and yet there is mounting evidence that the maduro government is complicit in not just hoarding but mass embezzlement of public funds sociologist chris carlson of the city university of new york graduate center points out that a number of former senior chavista government officials have come on record to confirm how powerful elites within the government have exploited the crisis to extract huge profits for themselves a gang was created that was only interested in getting their hands on the oil revenue said hector navarro former chavista minister and socialist party leader similarly chavez s former finance minister jorge giordani estimated that some 300 billion was embezzled in this way and yet the real economic war is not really going on inside venezuela it has been conducted by the us against venezuela through a draconian sanctions regime which has exacerbated the arc of collapse francisco rodriguez chief economist at torino economics in new york points out that a major drop in venezuela s production numbers occurred precisely at the time at which the united states decided to impose financial sanctions on venezuela he argues that advocates of sanctions on venezuela claim that these target the maduro regime but do not affect the venezuelan people if the sanctions regime can be linked to the deterioration of the country s export capacity and to its consequent import and growth collapse then this claim is clearly wrong rodriguez marshals a range of evidence suggesting this might well be the case others with direct expertise have gone further former un special rapporteur to venezuela alfred de zayas who finished his term at the un in march 2018 criticised the us for engaging in economic warfare against venezuela on his fact finding mission to the country in late 2017 he confirmed the role of overdependence on oil poor governance and corruption but blamed the us eu and canadian sanctions for worsening the economic crisis and killing venezuelans us goals are fairly transparent in an interview with fox news that has been completely ignored by the press trump s national security advisor john bolton explained the focus of us attention we re looking at the oil assets that s the single most important income stream to the government of venezuela we re looking at what to do to that he continued we re in conversation with major american companies now i think we re trying to get to the same end result here it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies really invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela the coming oil crisis it is not entirely surprising that bolton is particularly eager at this time to extend us energy companies into venezuela north american exploration and production companies have seen their net debt balloon from 50 billion in 2005 to nearly 200 billion by 2015 industry doesn t make money it s on much shakier financial footing than most people realize said mclean who has just authored the book saudi america the truth about fracking and how it s changing the world indeed there is serious gulf between oil industry claims about opportunities for profit and what is actually happening in those companies when you look at oil companies presentations there s something that doesn t make sense because they show their investors these beautiful investor decks with gorgeous slides indicating that they will produce an 80 or 60 internal rate of return and then you go to the corporate level and you see that the company isn t making money and you wonder what happened between point a and point b in short cheap debt money has permitted the industry to grow but how long that can continue is an open question part of the point in writing my book was just to make people aware that as we trump at american energy independence let s think about some of the foundation of this and how insecure it actually is so that we re also planning for the future in different ways adds mclean indeed us shale oil and gas production is forecast to peak in around a decade or in as little as four years it s not just the us europe as a continent is already well into the post peak phase and russian oil ministry officials privately anticipate an imminent peak within the next few years as china india and other asian powers experience further demand growth everyone will be looking increasingly for a viable energy supply whether from the middle east or latin america but it won t come cheap or easy and it won t be healthy for the planet whatever their ultimate causes the horrifying collapse of venezuela heralds insights into a possible future for today s major oil producers including the united states the us is enjoying a revival in its oil industry but how long it will last and how sustainable it is are awkward questions that few pundits dare to ask except a brave few such as mclean this does not necessarily mean oil production will simply slowly grind to a halt as production limits are reached using current techniques new techniques might be brought into play to try to mine vast reserves of more difficult resources however whatever technological innovations emerge they are unlikely to be able to avert the trajectory of increasing costs of extraction refining and processing before getting fossil fuels to market and this means that the surplus energy available to devote to the delivery of public goods familiar to modern industrial consumerist societies will become smaller and smaller meanwhile the environmental consequences of fossil fuel dependency are making investors re think the financial viability of these industries creating a growing risk that they become stranded assets in this emerging future the trajectory of endless economic growth as we know it cannot continue either way the warnings signs are unmistakeable as we shift into a post carbon era we will have to adapt new economic thinking and restructure our ways of life from the ground up right now the venezuelan people find themselves locked into a vicious cycle of ill conceived human systems collapsing into violent in fighting in the face of the earth system crisis erupting beneath them it is not yet too late for the rest of the world to learn a lesson we can either be dragged into a world after oil kicking and screaming or we can roll up our sleeves and walk there in a manner of our own choosing it really is up to us venezuela should function as a warning sign as to what can happen when we bury our heads in the oil sands this story was 100 reader funded join our supporters

as we ve done on our prior calls we ll be taking questions at the end of craig s comments today before we dive into that i do want to make a couple of quick passing comments the press release for our

reconciliations to any non gaap measures and a webcast of the call will be accessible on our website and available for replay after today s call before we get started i do need to remind you that the comments today do include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward looking statements any results that might differ materially from our forecast that could be due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties and those are described in the earnings release and the presentation and they will be also outlined in our related 10 q filing with that i ll turn it over to craig craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer okay thanks don i ll start on page 3 with highlights of our q4 results and i ll start by saying that i m very pleased naturally with our reports this morning and another very strong quarter performance which really rounded out a solid year overall earnings per share of 1 46 a share up 13 from last year and above the midpoint of our guidance and this was driven by both strong growth in sales as well as higher margins sales were actually 5 5 billion in the quarter an increase of 5 and this includes 7 organic growth and this was above our guidance of 6 for the quarter bookings growth in the quarter was also strong led by double digit growth in both electrical systems and services and in aerospace and so we continue to be pleased with our margin performance as well which increased a 100 basis points to 17 4 we had solid margin performance really across all of the segments and all time record margins in electrical systems and services and in aerospace we also generated very strong operating cash flows of 1 1 billion up 27 and a quarterly record if you exclude the 300 million arbitration payment that we made earlier this year and lastly we reported and repurchased 700 million of shares in the quarter taking advantage of what we saw as a significant pullback in financial markets and if you ll recall we had planned to purchase 200 million to 400 million in the quarter to achieve our target of 800 million to 1 billion for the year i d say for now you can think about this as an acceleration of purchases and that we were planning to make in 2019 however if markets remain weak we ll certainly take advantage of those opportunities as well and buy at higher levels moving to page 4 you will see our financial summary for the quarter you can read these numbers for sure but i ll provide maybe just a bit of context here first our operating segment profits increased 11 and we generated strong incrementals of almost 40 second segment margins of 17 4 were at the high end of our guidance range and 100 basis points above q4 2017 and finally our net income as reported was flat with prior year and prior year included income related to the us tax bill excluding this one time benefit from q3 q4 17 our net income increased 10 on page 5 we ll start our segment overviews with electrical products revenues grew 3 in q4 this includes 5 of organic growth offset by 2 in currency and it was really a strong finish to the year and it was actually our highest organic growth rate for electrical products since q4 of 2014 as we expected growth in our lighting business turned positive and was up mid single digits while orders increased 3 and this was led by solid growth in the americas i d also note here that our backlog increased 15 and while we generally think about this as a book and bill business this increase does suggest that we didn t see any unusual pre buying at the end of the quarter segment margins were 18 2 flat with prior year and this was largely a result of some unfavorable product mix between the business next we can move to page 6 and a summary of our electrical systems and services segment as i noted in my opening commentary this segment posted excellent results for the quarter the business continued to strengthen we posted 10 organic growth in the quarter with strength across all major end markets the 10 growth represented an acceleration of growth which was above our q3 growth rate of 9 and above the q2 growth rate which was up 7 and as you can see we did have some negative impact from foreign exchange and a small divestiture during the course of last year orders were even stronger up 12 on strong growth in all major end markets in the americas and in emea and i d say that this strong growth in q4 was against a very strong comp from last year when orders were up 12 you ll recall from our q3 earnings call that we noted a pause in orders during the month of september we had expected that this was largely project timing and temporary so things really played out as we expected in this segment in addition our backlog continued to increase and was up 13 so overall the segment is performing very consistent with what we would expect from this long cycle business and lastly segment operating profits were up 19 and we generated all time record margins in this segment of 16 6 so a very strong quarter across the board if you turn to page 7 we ll summarize the results of our hydraulics business here we had another strong quarter of revenue growth with sales up 6 8 organic growth offset by 2 negative currency and we continue to see strength really in mobile and with industrial oems in construction and ag markets and in the distribution channel so pretty broad based orders were down 4 and i would say here on tough comps and if you recall q4 2017 our orders were up 25 in the quarter we did however see continued strength in asia with orders up 10 orders in the americas were flat but at very high levels and we continue to see order weakness in emea with orders down some 24 as lead times continue to improve and i d also add here but this was the region where we had our most difficult comp orders in q4 2017 were actually up 38 and so we feel once again pretty good overall about the activity levels in the hydraulics business our backlog does remain strong it increased 6 from last year and turning to operating profits we increased profit by 15 and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 13 so i think the right conclusion here is that we made solid progress in this business which was held back in some prior quarters by some supply chain issues but that progress need to continue and is expected to continue going into 2019 on page 8 we move to aerospace and the business here is clearly firing on all cylinders now begin by noting that growth continued to accelerate in q4 with organic revenue growth up 13 and this is up from 9 growth in q3 and 6 growth in q2 orders also accelerated increasing 17 with strength in commercial transport military fighters and both commercial and military aftermarket and our backlog continue to grow up some 13 in the quarter the business here also demonstrated very strong operating leverage with profits increasing 30 and delivering record operating margins of 22 9 i would add that the favorable mix certainly contributed to these record margins as aftermarket revenues continued to perform well but our team also is doing an outstanding job of executing moving to the vehicle segment on page 9 we re also very pleased with how this segment performed in the quarter our revenues were down 2 with flat organic revenues and 2 negative fx the nafta class 8 truck market remained very strong in the quarter and reached 324 000 units for 2018 and this is up some 27 yes you ll recall here that revenues for our automated truck transmission business are now included in the eaton cummins joint venture and are not consolidated in our financials the jv actually had revenue growth of 45 in the quarter so our business overall is performing extremely well on the other hand our global light vehicle production was down in q4 with north america up modestly offset by slight declines in europe and particular weakness as you ve all heard in china despite flat organic revenues operating profits increased 4 and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 17 9 and finishing up our segment summaries emobility is on page 10 organic revenue growth was 11 offset by 1 negative currency not unexpected operating margins declined to 11 3 as we continue to ramp up our r d spending you ll recall that this new segment was created in q1 of last year at last year at the investors meeting we told you that emobility will become a new 2 billion to 4 billion segment of our company and i m pleased to say that we re on track 2018 was a busy year and a year where we ended ahead of schedule we are in ongoing discussions with a large number of customers on new programs and we remain very optimistic about the long term growth outlook for the business overall we re ahead of schedule on new product developments these new products are allowing us to quote on a broader range of opportunities and quite frankly to move from selling only components to selling systems so we remain very excited about the future of this segment and the work that our team is doing and what this represents as a growth opportunity for eaton as we move forward and before we turn our attention to 2019 i would like to just take a moment to recap some of the key highlights from 2018 now which we see a strong year as a strong year progress first end markets improved allowing us to generate 6 organic revenue growth and this was double the growth rate of 2017 and above our initial estimate for the year which was 4 we continue to make good progress on enhancing our margin performance with a 100 basis point improvement and setting an all time record for the company at 16 8 as a result our net income per share of 5 39 when you exclude the 0 48 impact from the legacy cooper arbitration decision was up 16 over 2017 and our teams very effectively offset both the impact of tariffs and commodity inflation with incremental price we generated 3 billion of operating cash flow and this would exclude to 300 million impact from the arbitration payment this allowed us to return 2 45 billion to shareholders 1 15 billion in dividends and another 1 3 billion of share repurchases and the 1 3 billion represents 4 of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year so overall very proud of the team we exceeded our financial commitment toshareholders we invested in the future of the business and really are building a stronger company now turning to 2019 let me begin by summarizing our growth outlook overall we are expecting 4 to 5 organic growth and this is consistent with the outlook that we provided in q3 2018 during our conference call as we take a look at our individual businesses we expect 4 to 5 organic growth in electrical products with continued strength in industrial and large commercial projects we expect modest growth in lighting and also modest growth in single phase power quality and small commercial projects for electrical systems and services we see 5 to 6 organic growth and here our backlog is very strong we expect continued market strength and power distribution assemblies in the americas and in the data center markets globally we also see modest growth in both the utility and harsh and hazardous markets for hydraulics growth is expected to be 5 to 6 on inaudible levels that are already very strong but we see continued strength in mobile markets in asia and in north america and aerospace markets really are universally strong and we expect to see 8 to 9 growth on strength in oem and aftermarket and really with both military and commercial customers vehicle markets are expected to be flat for both north america heavy duty truck and for global light vehicles but both are running at i d say very high levels and we expect to see strong growth in the brazilian truck market overall our organic revenues are expected to be down 2 to 1 for the year but once again keep in mind that our revenues for automated truck transmissions are expected to grow and are now a part and reported as a part of the eaton cummins joint venture finally we expect emobility to grow 11 to 12 organically consistent with the level of growth that we experienced in 2018 and while we re still a few years away from what we call a major growth inflection point our optimism for this segment continues to grow as we look forward moving on to page 13 we lay out our margin expectations for 2019 for eaton overall we except segment margins to be between 17 and 17 4 at the midpoint this represents a 40 basis point improvement over 2018 and it really places us solidly within the 17 to 18 range that we set as a 2020 goal and i would add one year ahead of schedule and with the exception of emobility we are investing we were investing heavily in product development margins are expected to increase in each of our segments specifically electrical products at 18 6 to 19 2 a 50 basis point improvement and electrical systems and services at 15 2 to 15 8 up 60 basis points hydraulics at 14 to 14 6 up 90 basis points aerospace at a very strong level already but at 21 4 to 22 up 70 basis points and vehicle at 17 4 to 18 up 20 basis points emobility as we noted we re investing heavily in this segment margins will be down to 6 1 to 6 7 from 70 basis point really just as a function of heavy r d investment and on page 14 we pick up the balance of our guidance for 2019 so we expect our full year eps to be 5 70 to 6 a share at the midpoint this represents a 9 increase excluding the impact of the arbitration decision that reduced 2018 earnings by some 0 48 as we discussed organic revenue is expected to be up 4 to 5 but this growth is expected to be partially offset by some 250 million of negative currency translation we expect our corporate costs including pension and interest and other corporate items to be flat with 2018 and our tax rate to be between 14 and 16 this will result in operating cash flows coming in between 3 1 billion and 3 3 billion and we expect capex to be 600 million as i noted we accelerated some 400 million of share repurchases into q4 so the target purchases for 2019 are now at 400 million and for q1 we expect eps to be between 1 18 and 1 28 a 12 increase at the midpoint and for q1 we also expect organic growth to be approximately 4 to have segment margins between 15 5 and 15 9 and a tax rate of between 13 and 14 so overall we expect another strong year and actually don this concludes my opening comments and i ll hand it back to you and you can open the lines for q a don bullock senior vice president of investor relations thanks craig before we before i hand it to the operator to open it up for questions i do want to make a couple of comments first we do acknowledge today is the day that has a enormous number of peers out there on earnings announcement so we are going to hold our call to an hour to do that it s important that you limit your questions to a question and a follow up if you would so we can be sure to cover everyone s questions with that i ll turn it over to the operator to give instructions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our first question today comes from jeff sprague with vertical research jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning very solid craig i was wondering if you could provide a little bit of additional color on how you saw things play out during the quarter obviously the quarter itself was very strong but we did have that peculiar slowdown in september did you see people tapping the brakes in december as the market got wobbly and and what are you seeing here in january craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah jeff i guess you re referencing largely what we talked about on the q3 earnings call in electrical systems and service where we did see this pause during the month of september we had indicated at the time that we thought that was a temporary pause that these projects do at sometimes tend to be lumpy and we thought that would come back in q4 which it certainly did now i d say q4 was really pretty much a consistent quarter we saw high level of economic activity really across the quarter pretty consistent across each of our businesses and as i had noted with no real significant no measurable pre buy at all as evidenced by the growth in our backlog and so i think it was a solid clean quarter across the board and and despite the level of economic uncertainty that s out there activity levels are fairly good and in through the month of january we ve really seen kind of a continuation of that performance certainly in the context of our guidance for q1 which is a little lighter than the growth rate that we saw in q4 we do think there is some economic uncertainty out there which is essentially what we have reflected in our guidance but by and large activity levels across our businesses are still quite positive and quite strong jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst thanks and unrelated just on tax rick i mean your guidance is pretty straight forward but we ve seen a couple of companies getting hit by this irs change and deductibility of interest is that an issue for you or a wildcard or is that fully encapsulated in your guide richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer it s fully baked into our guide one of the reasons that the tax rate jumps from roughly around 13 to 15 in 2019 is because we re reflecting the implications of all these regulations that came out last year some of which i think surprise some companies but we had anticipated that they would come out largely as they did so that s why we re comfortable with this 14 to 16 range for 19 jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst great thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations okay our next question comes from joe ritchie with goldman sachs joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst so craig maybe just on the eps range 0 30 wide versus kind of like typical is closer to 0 20 maybe can you just give us some insight into why you expanded the range and what market conditions have to be in place to drive you to that towards the higher end or the lower end of the range craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would suggest jeo that don t really over read or read much into the fact that the range is a little bit wider i mean i think it s as our eps in absolute dollar terms increases the percentage and the range will naturally widen a little bit but i d say that for us the big variables as we look forward into 2019 that could potentially influence whether you re on the low end or the high end of the range is largely a function of what happens with our end markets right now i said we re feeling fairly good it was a strong fourth quarter coming in stronger than what most had expected ourselves included and so i think it s really a function of how end markets perform going into 2019 and to what extent some of the geopolitical kind of concerns that we re dealing with in various kind of countries around the world get resolved but i wouldn t read anything into the fact that the range has been opened up a little bit you know it s we re feeling very good about kind of the company s performance overall and degrees of freedom that we have around things that we can do in the event of a little bit of economic slowdown so i would not over read that at all joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst okay that s good to hear and i guess my follow on you guys cited power distribution assemblies and data centers as strong growers in 19 i think data centers were up high single digits this is though a little at odds with some of the announcements we ve heard from some of the chipmakers so maybe talk a little bit about like the strength that you re seeing in data centers that makes you feel good about the prospects for 19 craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean the data center market i d say if you look at the long term trend of what we ve been seeing in general as the whole world generates and consumes more and more data i think is pretty compelling for the long term growth prospects we saw strong double digit growth in 2018 as well as a lot of major projects being announced and so as we think about data centers in general while on the hyper scale side of the market it can be somewhat lumpy we do think that what we re looking at in the form of an existing backlog and projects that are in the pipeline that the numbers that we re talking about for 2019 which is kind of mid single digit growth are very much in line with what we have visibility to i think the chip maker piece is perhaps one that s a little bit more nuance in terms of whether or not that s a direct proxy for what we are seeing specifically in the data center markets as a lot of the big data center companies are actually in many cases vertically integrating and doing a lot of this work themselves as opposed to relying upon third parties but now we feel very good about the data center market and about how we re positioned and about the number of projects that have already been announced and so we think it s going to be another strong year joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst great thanks craig don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from the nicole deblase at deutsche bank nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst good morning guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer good morning nicole nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst so i guess maybe starting with the 1q outlook it seems to me like the step down to 4 organic growth could be a little bit of conservatism reading between the lines is what you said in response to jeff s question but i guess maybe thinking about from a segment by segment perspective where is the step down coming from craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i d say that as we take a look at q1 we re certainly seeing a step down in the growth rate i d say principally in electrical systems and services is one of the big drivers in the hydraulics i d say would be another one and then also in aerospace and so those would be the three big ones that i d say there is a relative step down in the growth rate and i think you know largely the way we think about it nicole is the way i answered the question earlier that there is a lot of economic uncertainty out there whether it s brexit or just funding the us government or trade disputes with china and so we think given the level of uncertainty that s still out there in q1 that you could largely see a little bit of a pause in economic activity until some of these major structural issues are resolved and that s kind of what s baked into our forecast could it be conservative it could be but given kind of just a level of economic uncertainty out there we think it s prudent to plan for these issues to at least extend through q1 and be resolved at some point and we think all of that logic is baked into our guidance for the year of growing some 4 to 5 nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst okay understood thanks craig and i guess maybe my second one just around hydraulics so one of your big distributors talked about fluid power demand stepping down a bit in the last two weeks of december curious about that as well as the confidence in the outlook for china mobile to remain strong just because i think cat is looking for more like kind of a flattish equipment environment in china in 2019 craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer china has continued to maybe i ll deal with that one first before i get to the distributor one china has continued to perform extremely well if you take a look at excavator sales in q4 and reloader sales excavator sales are up more than 20 in q4 reloader sales up more than 10 and so the china construction equipment market at least in terms of looking at the public data continues to perform extremely well and our business does as well and so we think as we look into 2019 we do think that growth rates moderate but we still think that we see growth in the china mobile market specifically going into 2019 and that s kind of consistent with what we re hearing from many of our customers and quite frankly eaton in the region we ve done extremely well in terms of new wins and gaining some market share on platforms and that also influences our thinking as well but in terms of the distribution market i can t really speak to one distributor in one part of the region but i would say that our hydraulics business in q4 we had growth of organic growth of 8 and that growth was pretty even throughout the quarter and so we felt very good about the growth rates and we did not see generally speaking or here generally speaking of any slowdown that took place at the end of the year it wouldn t surprise me that if there is a distributor in some place who sold a slowdown some place but more broadly speaking our business continued to perform well nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst understood thanks craig don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from ann duignan with jp morgan ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst yeah hi good morning craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst maybe craig maybe you could dig a little bit deeper into some of your end markets and give us some color in terms of where you re seeing the strength and looking particularly maybe electrical products which specific industrial markets which sub segment of commercial projects and then likewise maybe power distribution just so we get some color as to what s going on out there craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah and i d say that in the beginning with electrical products one of the things we noted ann was that of our lighting business returned to growth it s been a business that obviously we were taking some strategic steps to work through some specific market segment issues and so that business for us returned to growth in q4 and we think the outlook for lighting going into 2019 as that business will continue to grow low to mid single digits we think that the single phase power quality business another business that grew mid single digits in q4 we had order growth that was a little better than that actually in q4 and so that market continues to do well and then largely the power distribution components a lot of what we sell in the components side goes into small and large commercial projects in general and so when you think about some of the growth that we see today in our electrical systems and services businesses mainly the most of the components that support that business come through our electrical products business some of that goes through distribution as aftermarkets as well and so that business continues to do well so so we saw generally speaking pretty decent growth as i mentioned the strongest growth that we ve seen since 2014 in electrical products and the orders are performing solidly and so we think that market continues to have a decent year in 2019 in electrical systems and services i mean it s really as i mentioned almost strength across the board large industrial projects commercial projects those markets continue to perform extremely well and you see many of the same data streams that we see non res construction numbers continue to be up strongly mid to high single digits the dodge non res contracts on were up 23 in dollars in q4 and on a square footage basis up 10 and so we re really seeing strength in most of the non res construction markets and as we talked about in data centers hyperscale and data centers in general had very strong results up strong double digits in 2018 and we think a little bit of moderation in that growth rate as we move into 2019 but still strong growth and so we think in general these businesses continue to perform very well and that no real evidence of any economic slowdown at this point and so we re feeling very good about 2019 and then crouse hinds inaudible oil and gas is another one of those segments that s been a lot of stuff talked about but we had very good growth in q4 in our crouse hinds business up strong single digits high single digits and so that business as well despite a little bit of pullback in oil and gas prices at the end of the year we saw some recovery in december and so we think that market also continues to grow going into 2019 ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst okay that s good color i appreciate that and then just to follow up on the sustainability of aerospace margins i mean we know it s great to have high margins in aerospace but we also know we have to be investing in the future so can you just talk craig maybe about the near term maybe positive mix versus the longer term you need to be on the next platform in order to sustain those high margins craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer absolutely and appreciate the question you know i think there s two things that are really driving the high margins in aerospace i think one it is the fact that after market is continuing to perform extremely well and as you know ann better than most i mean at the end of the day you make most of your money in aerospace and aftermarket and aftermarket is performing extremely well both in commercial and in on the military side the other thing that i d say that we and others are getting a real benefit from right now is really what you alluded to ann is the fact that we are in a bit of a pause period as an industry in terms of new programs we went through a massive refresh over the last 10 years and most of these new programs are actually going into service at this point in time and the next by time you get to the next generation the next refresh you re probably 5 to 10 years out and so i do think that our aerospace margins will continue to be at very high levels for the next number of years and until we get to the point where we have the next round of major investments required for the next generation of commercial and or military aircraft and so we are investing in the future we re doing a lot of investments in offline technology development to be ready for insertion to get to a technology readiness level that says that we are ready to participate on the new platforms but i d say it s really those two things that are really benefiting our business as long as as well as very strong execution by our operational teams ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst right thank you i ll leave it there appreciate it craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations the next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks guys good morning craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi nigel coe wolfe research analyst so what a different three months makes i m just trying to understand the turnaround in ess because it feels like there s probably more economic uncertainty in the us than it was back in september and october so i m wondering what are you hearing from the field your sales engineers customers whatever in terms of what caused the pause and why the release now and maybe just in terms of commenting on pre buy activity this quarter pull ahead of price increase et cetera did you see any of that and could you explain some of these fluster craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i d say nigel i appreciate the question and we spent a fair amount of time talking about it on the q3 earnings call and i think the way we characterized it at the time was we said the business we thought it was in fine shape and we said we saw a specific pause in the month of september and the business tends to be lumpy anyway and we try to encourage everyone of the look through september and say everything is going to be fine which is the way it turned out and so i wish i could give you the exact answer to why we saw this pause in the month of september other than saying that sometimes it does happen in these big systems businesses where orders tend to be lumpy but by and large i think what we characterized in q3 was that our electrical systems and services business was doing great it was in fine shape and we expected that we would continue to post strong growth in that long cycle business and that s essentially what s happened no and to the point around pull ahead no we re not really seeing any pull ahead at all as we talked about we continue to build backlog in that business it s up some 13 from last year and so i would say the way i d characterize electrical systems and services is once again very much like the long cycle businesses it s performing as expected and we will occasionally find a month or so where things tend to be lumpy nigel coe wolfe research analyst okay that s great color thanks craig and then just maybe to address price and in particular lighting price it feels like lighting price is getting a lot better and so i just appreciate your comments in terms of what you re seeing in terms of demand for lighting obviously up low to mid single digits in 2019 but specifically the price component of that what are you seeing in the market craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say that lighting prices in general and some of those could be as a function of trade and other things that are perhaps putting a little bit of a floor underneath some of the pressures that have been coming historically from some of the chinese imports but yeah i would say that it has the pressures in and around lighting have somewhat abated it still remains a very competitive industry and historically speaking if you recall in this business a lot of the lighting price give back was really a function of the fact that you know the price of semi conductors and electronics in general continue to fall and those prices were essentially passed on to our customers into the consumers in the form of lower prices of leds and so some of that is also the price of the core electronic components has not is not falling at the rate that it has historically and we ve reached a little bit of a bottom on some of that and i think that s also influencing the fact that lighting prices are firming somewhat we did have a much better q4 with the mid single digit growth our outlook going forward is low to mid single digits and so we do think that you know that the lighting business performs better for sure going into 2019 for eaton it becomes no longer a headwind for the business it becomes a little bit of a tailwind with respect to growth and so we re enthused by that nigel coe wolfe research analyst okay i ll leave it there thanks craig don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning julian julian mitchell barclays analyst good morning maybe just a first question around the the hydraulics business and the margin profile as you said you had some operating inefficiencies in 2017 and 2018 if you could quantify at all what kind of margin headwind they comprised in 2018 and how quickly you catch up from those in 19 and maybe any other respects in which you re changing how you sort of manage the productivity and the manufacturing pull through in that business craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i appreciate the question julian because this has obviously been one of the segments that we spent quite a bit of time talking about during the course of our earnings calls and one of the segments where we did in fact reduce our guidance for the year and the way we characterize it then and i think it s still largely the case julian is that this industry went through a very significant ramp a v shaped recovery the supply chain and our suppliers in many cases were just not ready for the ramp and so we had a lot of inefficiencies in the business as a function of having to expedite parts we had some challenges in ramping up hiring not only in our facilities but our suppliers had the same issues and so it was just a whole host of inefficiencies associated with an industry that went through a v shape recovery and we were all caught a little bit flat footed and as a result of that those inefficiencies i d say if you think about the reduction in our margin guidance for hydraulics during the course of the year you can largely say that is about equivalent to the level of inefficiencies that we saw in the business is one of the reasons why we as we look at the guidance for 2019 we think most of those efficiencies come out of the system and we get to a business once again that s performing more like what we would expect and so i d say that while we are not 100 out of the woods most of the issues that we dealt with during the course of 2018 and the efficiencies therein are largely behind us now julian mitchell barclays analyst thank you and then my second question i think a lot of the q a so far has been on demand dynamics so maybe switch to talking about capital deployment a little bit you did an accelerated share buyback spend in q4 when the price was down and obviously you ve seen a good rebound since so the timing looks very good on that maybe flesh out a little bit how you re thinking about buybacks versus m a and what kind of m a appetite you have looking out this year craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah appreciate the question no we did like as you articulated we saw that the overdone q4 pullback as a real buying opportunity and we did take that opportunity to accelerate some planned purchases into the end of the year and i d say if you think about our capital deployment strategy i think we ve laid that out historically and we talked about as we think about capital deployment the first call on cash will always be reinvesting in each of our businesses and making sure that every one of our businesses has the capital that they need to be successful and to win in the marketplace with respect to m a versus share buyback we have been out of the m a market for the last several years we do i would say that the environment today is such that we re looking at perhaps more opportunities and more deals than ever pricing continues in some cases to still be a challenge and we ve agreed that we re going to maintain our pricing discipline through this period of perhaps pricing being above what we think is reasonable we ve said that our cost of capital is anywhere from 8 to 9 we want a minimum of 300 basis points over our cost of capital and so we re going to be disciplined through this period but having said that we would like to get back into the m a market and the way i would think about it is our priority will be largely in and around bolt on acquisition where you get a lot of leverage within our existing businesses and therefore we can deliver synergies and value in these acquisitions that we acquire but having said that in the event that we re not able to put capital to work through m a we will generate as i mentioned a lot of free cash flow in 2019 we won t let capital build up on the balance sheet and so we ll certainly in the event that we re not successful in the m a market will certainly be more aggressive in buying back our shares richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer and julian if i might add as you know we ve brought our debt levels actually even a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated after cooper and if you just do a quick little math of our midpoint of 3 2 operating cash flow on take out capex take out of about 600 million take out dividends take out the 400 million repurchases it leaves us with about 1 billion of just excess cash to use on acquisitions or if we don t find them presumably raising our repurchase amount craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer and i d add to that rick and we ve been we ve been quite aggressive quite frankly if you take a look over the last four years in aggregate we bought back some 13 of our shares over the last four years and so we are certainly willing to step in when we see these opportunities of weakness and buy the stock back and given our dividend yield on the current stock prices we think that it s a tremendous value to buy eaton at these levels julian mitchell barclays analyst great thank you very much don bullock senior vice president of investor relations the next question comes from david raso with evercore david michael raso evercore isi analyst hi good morning i apologize i had phone issues earlier so i apologize if this has been asked just trying to figure out the first quarter organic is slower than the full year so obviously there is some assumption of some reacceleration as the year goes on but the comps don t really get any easier you mentioned ess starts the year a little bit slower on the step down but the backlog for that business has been up double digit for three quarters the orders have been obviously lumpy in the third quarter but two of the three quarters have been strong so i m just maybe trying to dig into a little bit more why ess organic slows that much in the first quarter and if we think of the businesses that you said maybe they started a little bit of a pause period the acceleration in growth as the year goes on is that more ess is that aerospace just trying to understand so that we have the cadence correct craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i appreciate the question dave and it s we did talk about this a little bit earlier and i think it s really we talked about just the level of economic uncertainty that exist in the marketplace right now across so many parts of the world that s really giving us a little bit of a pause with respect to how aggressive we are on this q1 number and so i d say it s really that issue more than anything that has been baked into our thinking around acceleration i mean you have brexit coming up you have trade disputes with china you have debt issues in the us and so there is this so many i d say let s call them geopolitical issues that we are dealing with around the world that we thought that it would potentially have an impact on q1 activity levels and naturally what baked into our thinking david michael raso evercore isi analyst well i guess more directly i m just trying to figure out is there something you re actually seeing meaning anything reflective what we saw in september maybe the backlogs that you have have a little more they re a little bit further out than traditional i m just trying to understand how much is again prudent understanding of some economic uncertainty right now versus something you re actually seeing that s what i m trying to dig into it craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yes i d say that if you characterize the backlog there s really been nothing in terms of the characterization of the backlog whether that s in electrical systems and services or hydraulics or the other businesses where we build big backlog the characterization and delivery timeframe of our backlog does not look significantly different than it s looked historically david michael raso evercore isi analyst okay no i appreciate the color thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from steve volkmann with jefferies steve volkmann jefferies co analyst hi good morning guys thanks for fitting me in so just maybe related to that i mean historically i guess when ess orders start to ramp up in backlog stretches out a little bit there is an opportunity to be a little bit excuse me a little bit more aggressive with pricing can you just talk about what pricing looks like in your order book in ess and how much that might have some upside going forward craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think the way we generally think about pricing in general steve is that you know it s neither a net positive or a net negative as we tend to over time offset commodity driven cost increases with price in the marketplace and i would say today the pricing environment overall on electrical systems and services is better than it s been better than it s been largely because the level of economic activity overall has been better over the last 12 months or so so i d say as we think about price in general i wouldn t really think about it being a big contributor to pricing but i think the overall environment today makes it a little bit easier as we think about negotiating with on large projects and with customers simply because from a capacity standpoint in many cases we are sold out our competitors are sold out lead times in some cases have pushed out and so i do think the environment overall is a little better it s a function of volume more than anything else in our in our factories steve volkmann jefferies co analyst okay all right fair enough and maybe i ll ask the only emobility question obviously there s lots of platforms that are getting announced for the early 20s is it too early for you guys to have actually signed any contracts for any of those platforms or is that actually happening craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say that we have signed some contracts already most of what we signed to date has been relatively small but i d ask you to stay tuned steve volkmann jefferies co analyst i will stay tuned thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations the next question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hi just a couple of finer point questions one margins in epg looked a little bit lighter on the incrementals any anything there to point out craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer what we what we what i tried to comment on that one jeff i appreciate the question because as you mentioned margins were a little bit lighter than we anticipated as well and it is largely a function of product mix and as you think about that to be a very large segment and when you have some of the segments that have lower overall margins growing a little faster lighting for example that tends to have an impact on your margins overall but i d say overall absolutely nothing to worry about there the margins in ep are at very high levels and as you saw in our guidance going forward we feel very good about 2019 jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then vehicle looks like you re calling for the markets to be flat to up and yet organic decline is anything to read into that in terms of share shift or is that just the cummins jv moving around craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s really the cummins jv and it s another question i appreciate jeff because there has been a little bit of confusion around the way the jv impacts eaton and so i so as the jv increases as the world continues to consume and move from more manual transmissions to automated transmissions that revenue ends up showing up in the joint venture as i mentioned that the jv revenues grew 45 in q4 and so we obviously get a piece of the profits but you ll find it as we move forward the revenues for our business really have to be looked at i think largely in combination with the joint venture if you really want to get a sense for how we re doing in the marketplace but it s really that issue that is driving essentially the flat revenues jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay great thanks craig don bullock senior vice president of investor relations next question comes from andy casey with wells fargo andy casey wells fargo analyst good morning everybody craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi andy casey wells fargo analyst question on the margin outlook and price cost does the 2019 guide embed neutral price cost you typically do that and i m wondering because you re probably going to have carryover pricing benefit that spills into 19 and you may see raw material cost declines as the year progresses craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say that what we generally do build in andy to exactly your point is we build in neutral and then there is always a little bit of timing you know on the upside and downside depending upon what s happening with commodity prices and so typically speaking as commodity commodity increase environment we tend to be a quarter or two behind it in the deflationary environment we tend to be maybe a quarter or so or two above it but over the period of say a 12 month period it kind of washes out to be neutral and that s really what we baked into our plan specifically as it relates to tariffs and what we said in the q3 earnings call was that we expected 110 million of headwind associated with tariffs as you know since then the implementation had been delayed by two months so we think that number is now at a 100 million but our base assumption today still would assume that the tariffs the phase iii tariffs moving from 10 to 25 go into effect and that our teams essentially go out and offset that with incremental price but don t necessarily get a normal incremental margin on the additional tariff driven cost increases andy casey wells fargo analyst okay thank you craig and then on that 4x impact the 250 million for the year is that heavily weighted to the first quarter craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah it would be more heavily weighted towards the first quarter just given where the how currencies have performed during the course of 2018 that would be largely true andy casey wells fargo analyst okay and does that weigh on the margin for the first quarter at all craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say not really it really doesn t in terms of the margins itself i mean it really doesn t weigh on the margins it certainly weighs on eps for sure but it really doesn t necessarily weigh on the margin rates andy casey wells fargo analyst okay thank you very much don bullock senior vice president of investor relations and next question comes from mig dobre with baird mig dobre baird analyst hi good morning guys going back to ep maybe trying to understand your your growth guidance a little bit better i m trying to figure out exactly how you re thinking about getting to 4 to 5 growth we really haven t seen order growth to that extent yet is this simply a factor of lighting no longer being a headwind and everything else pretty much staying the same or some other end market acceleration in there craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i mean i think you kind of hit the nail on the head with that one if you think about what we talked about during the course of 2018 where we ve made some very specific decisions around our lighting business and walking away from business that wasn t profitable and during the course of 2018 that business actually contracted some low to mid single digits and as we look forward that goes from a negative to a positive and so that s really what s driving the big difference in the relative growth rate in our ep business mig dobre baird analyst all right that s helpful and then back on vehicle you re expecting some margin expansion there even though obviously revenue is not so much so what exactly is generating that and as you look maybe beyond 2019 presumably this this business is going to start to see some volume deterioration how do you plan on managing that richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer i d say you know one of the things i would we talk about is the fact that we set this joint venture up obviously with cummins and we don t consolidate the revenue but we obviously get half of the earnings and so the jv will see revenue growth earnings growth in 2019 and that will actually be will help us with margin expansion and then i would say more broadly i mean this is just a business and a management team that has just done an outstanding job over decades of very efficiently running our business and so operational improvements efficiency improvements cost out it s something that we do extraordinarily well as a company and even better within our vehicle business and so we would fully expect that this business continues to operate at very high levels of margins even in the event of a economic downturn of somewhat mig dobre baird analyst thanks don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from andrew obin with boa merrill lynch andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst hey good morning thanks for fitting me in craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst just with the economic cycle being so healthy and you guys executing well how do you think about your capacity overall and north american capacity specifically how do you deal with these higher volumes craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah no i d say that it s one of the reasons andrew and i appreciate the question our incremental rates as we provided in our guidance in 2019 are perhaps a little bit less than what we experienced in 2018 it s because we are having to make some investments in a lot of our businesses that are running at very high levels whether that s electrical systems and services whether it s in aerospace wemade some really big investments in hydraulics during the course of 2018 and so we are having to reinvest in capacity expansion in many of our businesses that are running at very high levels and so i think that s really the way you deal with it you spend the dollars and you make the investments in in some cases you look at your business models as well around what you invest in and what you rely upon you supply base to do but by and large we are making investments to expand our capacity andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst and are you rethinking your global footprint i mean the ratio where you re investing that s what i mean craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer what we ve always tried to do is really manufacture in the zone of currency and so what we we try to minimize the amount of goods that we ship around the world and so what we today sell in europe we largely make in europe and what we today sell in asia we largely produce in asia and so from a footprint standpoint there was a lot of work that we ve done over let s say the last 15 to 20 years around making sure that we have manufacturing capability and facilities in the right regions of the world most of that work is largely done and so today it s really expanding where we need to in those regions of the world where we have capacity constraints andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst and just a follow up if i can what s your cadence in china through the year what are you expecting craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i m sorry your cadence around andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst oh just a cadence of revenue growth in china in 2019 through the year seasonality however you want to address it thank you craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yes i have to probably go take a look at that question specifically as it relates to china i don t have that level of detail in front of me but i would say that in general what our belief is is that it s the chinese government will likely stimulate at some point we saw as you ve saw as well the significant slowdown in the economy in q4 specifically highlighted by what took place in the light vehicle markets which were down some 16 so we believe and i think it is largely believed that the chinese government will stimulate at some point during the course of the year so we do think that the second half of the year is stronger than the first half but beyond that it s difficult to really estimate at this point andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst thank you very much don bullock senior vice president of investor relations at this point of time we ll have time for one last question rob mccarthy with stephens please rob mccarthy stephens inc analyst thanks for fitting me in for the buzzer beater can you hear me craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer yeah rob mccarthy stephens inc analyst sure yes no two questions one just on oil and gas how do you think about your exposure there given the fact that you ve seen the experience not only the explicit oil and gas exposure but the implied bleeding of that oil and gas exposure into your industrial business how do we think about the outer bound of that as we kind of think about your portfolio going forward and assessing the risk of what could be a continued downdraft here craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i appreciate the question rob especially given what i think we all experienced on the last kind of cyclical downturn in the oil and gas market and i d say the first thing i d just remind the group that we tend to be more downstream focused than we are upstream focused so it s a it has a much longer cycle we saw a little bit of a pullback in oil prices in the fourth quarter but they came rebounding in december and i would say by and large our business performed well through q4 and we ve not really seen today any let s say significant changes in in our business in terms of the outlook the rig count actually for 2018 actually ended up some 20 for the year when you compare the year overall and so we think that you know oil and gas is always a bit of a wildcard and tough to predict exactly where it s going but given that we re really coming off let s call it a three or four year pretty significant down draft in oil and gas markets and we ve just now got our legs underneath us we think oil and gas holds up over the next number of years it s difficult to say for certain but but i think our base case would be that we don t see a significant retrenchment in capital spending around oil and gas rob mccarthy stephens inc analyst i ll leave it there thanks craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations with that ladies and gentlemen we re going to wrap up the

of risks and uncertainties and those are described in the earnings release and the presentation and there will be also outlined in our related 10 q filing with that i ll turn it over to craig craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer okay thanks don i ll start on page 3 with highlights of our q4 results and i ll start by saying that i m very pleased naturally with our reports this morning and another very strong quarter performance which really round it out a solid year overall earnings per share of 1 46 a share up 13 from last year and above the midpoint of our guidance and this was driven by both strong growth in sales as well as higher margins advertisement advertisement sales were actually 5 5 billion in the quarter an increase of 5 and this includes 7 organic growth and this was above our guidance of 6 for the quarter bookings growth in the quarter was also strong led by double digit growth in both electrical systems and services and in aerospace and so we continue to be pleased with our margin performance as well which increased a 100 basis points to 17 4 we had solid margin performance really across all of the segments an all time record margins in electrical systems and services and in aerospace we also generated very strong operating cash flows of 1 1 billion up 27 and a quarterly record if you exclude the 300 million arbitration payment that we made earlier this year and lastly we reported and repurchased 700 million of shares in the quarter taking advantage of what we saw the significant pullback in financial markets and if you ll recall we had planned to purchase 240 million ph in the quarter to achieve our target of 800 million to 1 billion for the year i d say for now you can think about this has an acceleration of purchases and that we were planning to make in 2019 however markets remain weak we ll certainly take advantage of those opportunities as well and buy at higher levels advertisement advertisement moving to page 4 you will see our financial summary for the quarter you can read these numbers for sure but i ll provide maybe just a bit of context here first our operating segment profits increased 11 and we generated strong incrementals of almost 40 our second segment margins of 17 4 with the high end of our guidance range and a 100 basis points above q4 2017 and finally our net income as reported was flat with prior year and prior year included income related to the us tax bill excluding this one time benefit from q3 q4 17 our net income increased 10 on page 5 we ll start our segment overviews for the electrical products revenues grew 3 in q4 this includes 5 of organic growth offset by 2 in currency and its really a strong finish to the year and it was actually our highest organic growth rate for electrical products since q4 of 2014 as we expected growth in our lighting business turn positive and was up mid single digits while orders increased 3 and this was led by solid growth in the americas i d also note here that our backlog increased 15 and while we generally think about this as a book and bill business this increased does suggest that we didn t see any unusual pre buying at the end of the quarter segment margins were 18 2 flat with prior year and this was largely a result of some unfavorable product mix between the business next we can move to page 6 and a summary of our electrical systems and services segment as i noted in my opening commentary this segment posted excellent results for the quarter the business continued to strengthen we posted 10 organic growth in the quarter with strength across all major end markets the 10 growth represented an acceleration of growth which was above our q3 growth rate of 9 and above the q2 growth rate which was up 7 and as you can see we did have some negative impact from foreign exchange and a small divestiture during the course of last year advertisement advertisement orders were even stronger up 12 on strong growth in all major end markets in the americas and in emea and i d say that this strong growth in q4 was against a very strong comp from last year orders were up 12 you ll recall from our q3 earnings call that we noted a pause in orders during the month of september we had expected that this was largely project timing and temporary so things really played out as we expected in this segment in addition our backlog continued to increase and was up 13 so overall the segment is performing very consistent with what we would expect from this long cycle business and lastly segment operating profits were up 19 and we generated all time record margins in this segment of 16 6 so a very strong quarter across the board if you turn to page 7 we ll summarize the results of our hydraulics business here we had another strong quarter of revenue growth with sales up 6 8 organic growth offset by 2 negative currency and we continue to see strength really in mobile and with industrial oems in construction and ag markets and in the distribution channel so pretty broad based orders were down 4 and i would say here on tough comps and if you recall q4 2017 our orders were up 25 in the quarter we did however see continued strength in asia with orders up 10 orders in the americas were flat but at very high levels and we continue to see order weakness in emea with orders down some 24 as lead times continue to improve and i d also add here but this was the region where we had our most difficult comp orders in q4 2017 were actually up 38 and so we feel once again pretty good overall about the activity levels in hydraulics business advertisement advertisement our backlog does remain strong it increased 6 from last year and turning to operating profits we increased profit by 15 and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 13 so i think the right conclusion here is that we made solid progress in this business which was held back in some prior quarters by some supply chain issues but that progress need to continue and is expected to continue going into 2019 on page 8 we moved to aerospace and the business here is clearly firing on all cylinders now begin by noting that growth continued to accelerate in q4 with organic revenue growth up 13 and this is up from 9 growth in q3 and 6 growth in q2 orders also accelerated increasing 17 with strength in commercial transport military fighters and both commercial and military aftermarket and our backlog continue to grow up from 13 in the quarter the business here also demonstrated very strong operating leverage with profits increasing 30 and delivering record operating margins of 22 9 i would add that favorable mix certainly contributed to these record margins as aftermarket revenues continued to perform well but our team also is doing an outstanding job of executing moving to the vehicle segment on page 9 we re also very pleased with how this segment performed in the quarter our revenues were down 2 with flat organic revenues and 2 negative fx the nafta class 8 truck market remained very strong in the quarter and reached 324 000 units for 2018 and this is up some 27 yes you ll recall here that revenues for our automated truck transmission business are now included in the eaton cummins joint venture and are not consolidated in our financials advertisement advertisement the jv actually had revenue growth of 45 in the quarter so our business overall is performing extremely well on the other hand global light vehicle production was down in q4 with north america up modestly offset by slight declines in europe and particular weakness as you ve all heard in china despite flat organic revenues operating profits increased 4 and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 17 9 and finishing up our segment summary emobility is on page 10 organic revenue growth was 11 offset by 1 negative currency not unexpected operating margins declined to 11 3 as we continue to ramp up our r d spending you ll recall that this new segment was created in q1 of last year at last year at the investors meeting we told you that emobility will become a new 2 billion to 4 billion segments of our company and i m pleased to say that we re on track 2018 was a busy year and the year where we ended ahead of schedule we are in ongoing discussions with a large number of customers on new programs and we ll remain very optimistic about the long term growth outlook for the business overall we re ahead of schedule on new product developments these new products are allowing us to quote on a broader range of opportunities and quite frankly to move from selling only components to selling systems so we remain very excited about the future of the segment and the work that our team is doing and what this represents as a growth opportunity for eaton as we move forward and before we turn our attention to 2019 i would like to just take a moment to recap some of the key highlights in 2018 now which we see a strong year as a strong year progress first end markets improved allowing us to generate 6 organic revenue growth and this was double the growth rate of 2017 and above our initial estimate for the year which was 4 we continue to make good progress on enhancing our margin performance with a 100 basis point improvement and setting an all time record for the company at 16 8 advertisement advertisement as a result our net income per share of 5 39 when you exclude the 0 48 impact from the legacy cooper arbitration decision was up 16 over 2017 and our teams very effectively offset both the impact of tariffs and commodity inflation with incremental price we generated 3 billion of operating cash flow and this would exclude to 300 million impact from the arbitration payment this allowed us to return 2 45 billion to shareholders 1 5 billion in dividends and another 1 3 billion of share repurchases and the 1 3 billion represents 4 of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year so overall very proud of the team we exceeded our financial commitments for shareholders we invested in the future of the business and really are building a stronger company now turning to 2019 let me begin by summarizing our growth outlook overall we are expecting 4 to 5 organic growth and this is consistent with the outlook that we provided in q3 2018 during our conference call as we take a look at our individual businesses we expect 4 to 5 organic growth in electrical products with continued strength in industrial and large commercial projects we expect modest growth in lighting and also modest growth in single phase power quality and small commercial projects for electrical systems and services we see 5 to 6 organic growth and here our backlog is very strong we expect continued market strength and power distribution assemblies in the americas and in the data center markets globally we ve also see modest growth in both the utility and harsh and hazardous markets advertisement advertisement for hydraulics growth is expected to be 5 to 6 on inaudible levels that are already very strong but we see continued strength in mobile markets in asia and in north america and aerospace markets really are universally strong and we expect to see 8 to 9 growth on strength in oem and aftermarket and really with both military and commercial customers vehicle markets are expected to be flat for both north american heavy duty truck and for global light vehicles but both are running at i d seen on very high levels and we expect to see strong growth in the brazilian truck market overall our organic revenues are expected to be down 2 to 1 for the year but once again keep in mind that our revenues for automated truck transmissions are expected to grow and are now apart and reported as a part of the eaton cummins joint venture finally we expect emobility to grow 11 to 12 organically consistent with the level of growth that we experienced in 2018 and while we re still a few years away from what we call a major growth inflection point our optimism for this segment continues to grow as we look forward moving on to page 13 we lay out our margin expectations for 2018 for each of those roles we except segment margins to be between 17 and 17 4 at the midpoint this represents a 40 basis point improvement over 2018 and it really places us solidly within the 17 to 18 range that we said as a 2020 goal and i would add one year ahead of schedule and with the exception of new mobility we are investing we re investing heavily in product development margins are expected to increase in each of our segments specifically electrical products at 18 6 to 19 2 a 50 basis point improvement and electrical systems and services at 15 2 to 15 8 up 60 basis points hydraulics at 14 to 14 6 up 90 basis points aerospace at a very strong level already but at 21 4 to 22 up 70 basis points and vehicle at 17 4 to 18 up 20 basis points emobility as we noted we re investing heavily in this segment margins will be down to 6 1 to 6 7 from 70 basis point really just as a function of heavy r d investment and on page 14 we pick up the balance of our guidance for 2019 so we expect our full year eps to be 5 70 to 6 a share at the midpoint this represents a 9 increase excluding the impact of the arbitration decision that reduced 2018 earnings by some 0 48 as we discussed organic revenue is expected to be up 4 to 5 but this growth is expected to be partially offset by some 250 million of negative currency translation we expect our corporate costs including pension interest and other corporate items to be flat with 2018 and our tax rate to be between 14 and 16 this will result in operating cash flows coming in between 3 1 billion and 3 3 billion and we expect capex to be 600 million as i noted we accelerated some 400 million of share repurchases into q4 so the target purchases for 2019 are now at 400 million and for q1 we expect eps to be between 1 80 and 1 28 a 12 increase at the midpoint and q1 we also expect organic growth to be approximately 4 to have segment margins between 15 5 and 15 9 and a tax rate of between 13 and 14 so overall we expect another strong year so don that concludes my opening comments and i ll hand it back to you and you can open the line for q a don bullock senior vice president of investor relations thanks craig before we before i hand it to the operator to open it up for questions i do want to make a couple of comments first we do acknowledge today is the day that has all enormous number of peers out there on earnings announcement so we are going to hold our call to an hour to do that it s important that you limit your questions to a question and a follow up if you would so we can we should cover everyone s questions with that i ll turn it over to the operator to give instructions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our first question today comes from jeff sprague with vertical research jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning saw very solid craig i was wondering if you could provide a little bit of additional color on how you saw things play out during the quarter obviously the quarter thought was very strong but we did have that peculiar slow down in september did you see people tapping the breaks in december as the market got wildly and and what are you seeing here in january craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah jeff i guess you re referencing largely what we talked about on the q3 earnings call and in electrical systems and services where we did see this pause during the month of september we indicated at the time that we thought that was a temporary pause that these projects do at sometime tend to be lumpy and we thought that would come back in q4 which would certainly did now i d say q4 was really pretty much a consistent quarter we saw high level of economic activity really across the quarter pretty consistent across each of our businesses and as i noted with no real significant no measurable pre buy at all as evidenced by the growth in our backlog and so i think it was a solid clean quarter across the board and and despite the level of economic and uncertainty that s out there activity levels are fairly good in through the month of january we ve really seen kind of a continuation of that performance certainly in the context of our guidance for q1 which is a little wider than the growth rate that we saw in q4 we do think there is some economic uncertainty out there which is essentially what we have reflected in our guidance but enlarge activity levels across our businesses are still quite positive and quite strong jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst thanks and on related just on tax rick i mean your guidance is pretty straight forward but we ve seen a couple of companies getting hit by this irs change and deductibility of interest is that an issue for you or a wildcard or is that fully encapsulated in your guide richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer it s fully baked into our guide one of the reasons is that the tax rate jumps from roughly around 13 to 15 in 2019 because we re reflecting the implications of all these regulations that came out last year some of which i think surprise some companies but we had anticipated that they would come out largely as they did so that s why we re comfortable with this 14 to 16 range for 19 jeffrey t sprague vertical research partners analyst great thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations okay our next question comes from joe ritchie with goldman sachs joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst so craig maybe just on the eps range of 0 30 wide versus kind of like typical is closer to 0 20 maybe can you just give us some insight into why you expanded the range and what market conditions have to be in place to drive you to that toward the higher end or the lower end of the range craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would suggest that don t really over read or read much into the fact that the range is a little bit wider i mean i think it s as our eps in absolute dollar terms increases the percentage and the range will naturally widened a little bit but i d say that in for us the big variables as we look forward into 2019 that could potentially influence whether you re on the low end or the high end of the range is largely a function of what happens with our end markets right now i said we re feeling fairly good it was a strong fourth quarter coming in stronger than what most had expected ourselves included and so i think it s really a function of how end markets perform going into 2019 and to what extent some of the geopolitical kind of concerns that we re dealing with in various kind of countries around the world get resolved but i wouldn t read anything into the fact that the range has been opened up a little bit you know it s we re feeling very good about kind of the company s performance overall and degrees of freedom that we have around things that we can do in the event of a little bit of economic slowdown so i would not over read that at all joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst okay that s good to hear and i guess my follow on you guys cited power distribution assemblies and data centers as strong growers in 19 i think data centers are up high single digits this is though a little at odds with some of the announcements we ve heard from some of the chipmakers so maybe talk a little bit about like the strength that you re seeing in data centers that makes you feel good about the prospects for 19 craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean the data center market i d say if you look at the long term trend of what we ve been seeing in general as the whole world generating consumes more and more data i think is pretty compelling for the long term growth prospects we saw strong double digit growth in 2018 as well as a lot of major projects being announced and so as we think about data centers in general while on the hyper scale side of the market it can be somewhat lumpy we do think that what we re looking at in the form of existing backlog and projects that are in the pipeline that the numbers that we re talking about for 2019 which is kind of mid single digit growth are very much in line with what we have visibility to i think the chip maker piece is perhaps one that s a little bit more nuance in terms of whether or not thats a direct proxy for what we are seeing specifically in the data center markets has a lot of the big data center companies are actually in many cases vertically integrating and doing a lot of this work themselves as opposed to relying upon third parties but now we feel very good about the data center market and about how we re positioned and about the number of projects that have already been announced and so we think it s going to be another strong year joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst great thanks craig don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from the nicole deblase at deutsche bank nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst good morning guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer good morning nicole nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst so i guess maybe starting with the 1q outlook it seems to me like the step down to 4 organic growth could be a little bit of conservatism reading between the lines of what you said in response to jeff s question but i guess maybe thinking about from a segment by segment perspective where is the step down is coming from craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i d say that as we take a look at q1 we re certainly seeing a step down in the growth rate actually principally in electrical systems and services is one of the big drivers in the hydraulics i d say would be another one and then also on aerospace and so those would be the three big ones that i d say is a relative step down in the growth rate and i think you know largely the way we think about in the call it s the way i answered the question earlier that there is a lot of economic uncertainty out there whether it s brexit or just funding the us government or trade disputes with china and so we think given the level of uncertainty that still out there in q1 that you could largely see a little bit of a pause in economic activity until some of these major structural issues are resolved and that s kind of what s baked into our forecast could it be conservative it could be but again given kind of just a level of economic uncertainty out there we think it s a prudent to plan for these issues to at least extend through q1 and be resolved at some point and we think all of that logic is baked into our guidance for the year of growing some 4 to 5 nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst okay understood thanks craig and i guess maybe my second one just around hydraulics so one of your big distributors talked about fluid power demand stepping down a bit in the last two weeks of december curious about that as well as the confidence in the outlook for china mobile to remain strong just because i think cat is looking for more like kind of a flattish equipment environment in china in 2019 craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer china has continued to maybe i ll deal with that one first before i get to the distributor one china has continued to perform extremely well if you take a look at excavator sales in q4 and reloader sales excavator sales are up more than 20 in q4 reloader sales up more than 10 and so the china construction equipment market at least in terms of looking at the public data continues to perform extremely well and our business does as well and so we think as we look into 2019 we do think that growth rates moderate but we still think that we see growth in the china mobile market specifically going into 2019 and that s kind of consistent with what we re hearing from many of our customers and quite frankly eaton in the region we ve done extremely well in terms of new wins and gaining some market share on platforms and that also influences our thinking as well but in terms of the distribution market i can t really speak to one distributor and in one part of the reason i would say that our hydraulics business in q4 we had growth of organic growth of 8 and that growth was pretty even throughout the quarter and so we felt very good about the growth rates and we did not see generally speaking or here generally speaking of any slowdown that took place at the end of the year it wouldn t surprise me that if there is a distributor in some place who sold a slowdown some place but more broadly speaking our business continued to perform well nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst understood thanks craig don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from ann duignan with jp morgan ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst yeah hi good morning craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst maybe craig maybe you could dig a little bit deeper into some of your end markets and give us some color in terms of where you re seeing the strength and looking particularly maybe electrical products which specific industrial markets which sub segment of commercial projects and then likewise maybe power distribution just until we get some color as to what s going on at there craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say that in the beginning with electrical products one of the things we noted and was up of our lighting business returned to little growth it s been a business that obviously we were taking some strategic steps to work through some specific market segment issues and so that business for us return to growth in q4 and we think the outlook for lighting going into 2019 as that business will continue to grow low to mid single digits we think that the single phase power quality business another business that grew mid single digits in q4 we had order growth that was a little better than that actually in q4 and so that market continues to do well and then largely the power distribution components a lot of what we sell in the components side goes into small and large commercial projects in general and so when you think about some of the growth that we see today in our electrical systems and services businesses mainly the most of the components that support that business come through our electrical products business some of that goes through distribution as aftermarkets as well and so that business continues to do well so so we saw generally speaking a pretty decent growth as i mentioned the strongest growth that we ve seen since 2014 in electrical products and the orders are performing solidly and so we think that market continues to have a decent year in 2019 in electrical systems and services i mean its really guys i mentioned its almost strength across the board large industrial projects commercial projects those markets continue to perform extremely well and you see many of the same data streams that we see non resi construction numbers continue to be up strongly mid to high single digits the dodge non resi contracts on were up 23 in dollars in q4 and square footage basis up 10 and so we re really seeing strength in most of the non resi construction markets and as we talked about in data centers hyperscale and data centers in general had very strong results to up strong double digits in 2018 and we think a little bit of moderation in that growth rate as we move into 2019 but still strong growth and so we think in general these businesses continued to perform very well and that know no real evidence of any economic slowdown at this point and so we re feeling very good about 2019 and then crouse hinds and while oil and gas is another one of those segments that s been a lot of stuff talked about but we had very good growth in q4 and our craft lines business up strong single digits high single digits and so that business as well despite a little bit of pullback in oil and gas prices at the end of the year we saw some recovery in december and so we think that market also continues to grow going into 2019 ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst okay that s good color i appreciate that and then just a follow up on the sustainability of aerospace margins i mean we know it s great that high margins in aerospace but we also know we have to be investing in the future so can you just talk craig maybe about the near term maybe positive mix versus the longer term you need to be on the next platform in order to sustain those high margins craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer you re absolutely and i appreciate the question you know i think there s two things that are really driving the high margins in aerospace i think one it is the fact that after market is continuing to perform extremely well and as you know in better than most i mean at the end of the day you make most of your money in aerospace and aftermarket and aftermarket is performing extremely well both in commercial and in on the military side the other thing that i d say that we and others are getting a real benefit from right now is really what you alluded to and its the fact that we are in a bit of a pause period and as an industry in terms of new programs we went through a massive refresh over the last 10 years and most of these new programs are actually going into service at this point in time and the next by time you get to the next generation the next refresh you re probably 5 to 10 years out and so i do think that our aerospace margins will continue to be at very high levels for the next number of years and until we get to the point where we have the next round of major investments required for the next generation of commercial and or military aircraft and so we are investing in the future we re doing a lot of investments in offline technology development to be ready for insertion to get to a technology readiness level that says that we are ready to participate on the new platforms but i d say it s really those two things that are really benefiting our business as long as as well as very strong execution by our operational teams ann duignan jp morgan securities analyst right thank you i ll leave it there appreciate it craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations the next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks guys good morning craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi nigel coe wolfe research analyst so what a different three months makes i just want to understand the turnaround in the ff ph because it feels like there s probably more economic uncertainty in the us than it was back in september and october so i m wondering what are you hearing from the field your sales engineers customers whatever in terms of what caused the pause and why the risk now and maybe just in terms of commenting on inaudible activity this quarter pull ahead of price increases et cetera did you see any of that and could you explain some of these first craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i d say nigel i appreciate the question and we spent a fair amount of time talking about on the q3 earnings call and i think the way we characterize it at the time was we said the business we thought it was in fine shape and we said we saw a specific pause in the month of september and the business tends to be lumpy anyway and we try to encourage everyone of the look through september and say everything is going to be fine which is the way it turned out and so i wish i could give you the exact answer to why we saw this pause in the month of september other than saying that sometimes it does happen in these big systems businesses where orders tend to be lumpy but by enlarge i think what we characterized in q3 was that our electrical systems and services business was doing great it was in fine shape and we expected that we would continue to post strong growth in that long cycle business and that s essentially what s happened now into the point around pull ahead no we re not really seeing any pull ahead at all as we talked about we continue to build backlog in that business it s up some 13 from last year and so i would say the way i d characterize electrical systems and services once again very much like the long cycle businesses it s performing as expected and we will occasionally find a month or so where things tend to be lumpy nigel coe wolfe research analyst okay that s great color thanks craig and then just maybe to address price and in particular lighting price it feels like lighting price is getting a lot better and so i just appreciate your comments in terms of what you re seeing in terms of demand for lighting obviously we have loads to assume in 2019 but specifically the price component that s what you seeing in the market craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say that lighting prices in general and some of those could be as a function of trade and other things that are perhaps putting a little bit of a floor underneath some of the pressures that have been coming historically from some of the chinese imports but yeah i would say that it has the pressure in around lighting have somewhat abated it still remains a very competitive industry and historically speaking if you recall in this business a lot of the lighting price give back was really a function of the fact that you know the price of semi conductors and electronics in general continue to fall and those prices were essentially passed on to our customers into the consumers in the form of lower prices of leds and so some of that is also the price of the core electronic components has not is not falling at the rate that it has historically and we ve reached a little bit of a bottom some of that i think that s also influencing the fact that lighting prices are firming somewhat we did have a much better q4 with the mid single digit growth our outlook going forward is low to mid single digits and so we do think that you know that the lighting business performs better for sure going into 2019 for eaton it becomes no longer a headwind for the business becomes a little bit of a tailwind with respect to growth and so we re more enthused by that nigel coe wolfe research analyst okay i leave it their thanks craig don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer good morning julian julian mitchell barclays analyst good morning maybe just a first question around the the hydraulics business and the margin profile as you said you had some operating inefficiencies in 2017 and 2018 if you could quantify at all what kind of margin headwind do they comprised in 2018 and how quickly you catch up from those in 19 and maybe any other respects in which changing how you sort of manage the productivity and the manufacturing costs during that business craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i appreciate the question julian because this obviously been one of the segments that we spent quite a bit of time talking about during the course of our earnings calls and one of the segments where we did in fact reduce our guidance for the year and the way we characterize then and i think it s still largely occasionally is that this industry literally very significant ramp of v shaped recovery the supply chain and our suppliers in many cases but just not ready for the ramp and so we had a lot of inefficiencies in the business as a function of having to expedite parts we had some challenges in ramping up hiring not only in our facilities but our suppliers had the same issues and so it was just a whole host of inefficiencies associated with an industry that went through a v shape recovery and we were all corp a little bit flat footed and as a result of that those inefficiencies i d say if you think about the reduction in our margin guidance for hydraulics during the course of the year you can largely say that is about equivalent to the level of inefficiencies that we saw in the business more of the reasons why we as we look at the guidance for 2019 we think most of those efficiencies come out of the system and we get to a business once again that s performing more like what we would expect and so i d say that while we are not 100 out of the woods most of the issues that we ve dealt with during the course of 2018 and the efficiencies therein are largely behind us now julian mitchell barclays analyst thank you and then my second question i think a lot of the q a so far has been on demand dynamics so maybe switch to talking about capital deployment a little bit you did an accelerated share buyback spend in q4 when the price was down and obviously you ve seen a good rebound since so the timing looks very good on that maybe flesh out a little bit how you re thinking about buybacks versus m a and what kind of m a appetite you have looking out this year craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah appreciate the question no we did like as you articulated we saw that the overdone q4 pullback as a real buying opportunity and we did take that opportunity to accelerate some planned purchases into the end of the year and i d say if you think about our capital deployment strategy i think we will play that out historically and we talked about as we think about capital deployment the first call on cash will always be reinvesting in each of our businesses and making sure that every one of our businesses has the capital that they need to be successful and the win in the market place with respect to m a versus share buyback we have been out of the m a market for the last several years we do i would say that the environment today is such that we re looking at perhaps more opportunities and more deals that have been ever pricing continues in some cases to still be a challenge in and we ve agreed that we re going to maintain our pricing discipline through this period of perhaps in pricing being above what we think is reasonable we ve said that our cost of capital is anywhere from 8 to 9 we want to minimum of 300 basis points over our cost of capital and so we re going to be disciplined through this period but having said that we would like to get back into the m a market and the way i would think about it is our priority will be largely in around bolt on acquisition where you get a lot of leverage within our existing businesses and therefore we can deliver synergies and value in this acquisitions that we acquire but having said that in the event that we re not able to put capital to work through m a we will generate as i mentioned a lot of free cash flow in 2019 we won t let capital build up on the balance sheet and so we ll certainly in the event that we re not successful in the m a market will certainly be more aggressive in buying back our shares richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer and dealing if i might add as you know we ve brought our debt levels actually even a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated after cooper and if you just do a quick little math of our midpoint of 3 2 operating cash flow on take out capex take out of about 600 million take out dividends take out the 400 million repurchases it leaves us with about 1 billion of just excess cash to use on acquisitions or if we don t find them presumably raising our repurchase amount craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer if i d add to that rick we ve been we ve been quite aggressive quite frankly if you take a look over the last four years in aggregate we bought back some 13 of our shares over the last four years and so we are certainly willing to step in when we see these opportunities of weakness and buy the stock back and given our dividend yield on the current stock prices we think that it s a tremendous value to buy eaton at these levels julian mitchell barclays analyst great thank you very much don bullock senior vice president of investor relations the next question comes from david raso with evercore david michael raso evercore isi analyst hi good morning i apologize i had phone issues earlier so i apologize that this is has been asked just trying to figure out the first quarter organic is slower than the full year so obviously there is some assumption of some reacceleration of the year goes on but the comps don t really get any easier you mentioned in ess starts the year a little bit slower on the step down but the backlog for that business has been up double digit for three quarters the orders have been obviously lumpy in the third quarter but two of the three quarters have been strong so i m just maybe trying to dig into a little bit more why ess organic slows that much in the first quarter and as we think of the businesses that you said maybe they started a little bit of a pause period the acceleration in growth as the year goes on is that more ess is that aerospace just trying to understand so that we have the cadence correct craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i appreciate the question dave and its we did talk about these a little bit earlier and i think it s really we talked about just the level of economic uncertainty that exist in the marketplace right now across so many parts of the world that s really giving us a little bit of a pause with respect to how aggressive we are on this q1 number and so i d say it s really that issue more than anything that is its been baked into our thinking around acceleration i mean you have brexit coming up you have trade disputes with china you have debt issues in the us and this is so many let s say let s call it geopolitical issues that we are dealing with around the world that we thought that it would potentially have an impact on q1 activity levels and naturally what baked into our thinking david michael raso evercore isi analyst well i guess more directly i m just trying to figure out is there something you re actually seeing anything reflected what we saw in september maybe the backlog that you have have a little more there little bit further out than traditional i m just to understand how much is again prudent understanding of economic uncertainty right now versus something you re actually saying that s what i m trying to dig into it craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yes i d say that as you characterize the backlog there s really been nothing in terms of the characterization of the backlog whether that s in electrical systems and services or hydraulics or the other businesses where we build big backlog the characterization and delivery timeframe of our backlog does not look significantly different than its look historically david michael raso evercore isi analyst okay now i appreciate the color thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from steve volkmann of jefferies steve volkmann jefferies co analyst hi good morning guys thanks for fitting me in so just maybe related to that i mean historically i guess when ess orders start to ramp up in backlog stretches out a little bit there is an opportunity to be a little bit excuse me a little bit more aggressive with pricing can you just talk about what pricing looks like in your order book in ess and how much that might have some upside going forward craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think the way we generally think about pricing in general steve is that you know it s neither a net positive or a net negative as we tend to over time offset commodity driven cost increases with price in the marketplace and i would say today the pricing environment overall on electrical systems and services is better than it s been better than it s been largely because the level of economic activity overall it s been better over the last 12 months or so so i d say as we think about price in general i wouldn t really think about it being a big contributor to pricing but i think the overall environment today makes it a little bit easier as we think about negotiating with on large projects and with customers simply because from a capacity standpoint in many cases we are sold out our competitors are sold out lead times in some cases that we have pushed out and so i do think the environment overall is a little better it s a function of volume more than anything else in our in our factories steve volkmann jefferies co analyst okay all right fair enough and maybe i ll ask the only emobility question obviously there s lots of platforms that are getting announced for the early 20s is it too early for you guys to have actually sign any contracts for any of those platforms or is that actually happening craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say that we have signed some contracts already most of what we signed to date has been relatively small but i d ask you to stay tuned steve volkmann jefferies co analyst i will stay tuned thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations the next question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst just a couple of finer point questions one margins in epg looked a little bit lighter on the incrementals any anything there to point out craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer what we what we i tried to comment on that one jeff i appreciate the question because as you mentioned margins were a little bit lighter than we anticipated as well and it is largely a function of product mix and as you think about that we have very large segment and when you have some of the segments that have a low overall margins growing a little faster lighting for example that tends to have an impact on your margins overall but i d say overall absolutely nothing to worry about there the margins in ep are at very high levels and as you saw in our guidance going forward we feel very good about 2019 jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay then vehicle looks like you re calling for the markets to be flat to up and yet organic decline is anything to read into that in terms of share shift or is that just the cummins jv moving around craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s really the cummins jv and that s another question were i appreciate jeff because there has been a little bit of confusion around the way the jv impact eaton and so i get it so as this jv increases as the world continues to consume and move from more manual transmissions to automated transmissions that revenue ends up showing up in the joint venture as i mentioned with jv revenues grew 45 in q4 and so we obviously get a piece of the profits but you ll find it as we move forward the revenues for our business really have to be looked at i think largely in combination with the joint venture if you really want to get a sense for how we re doing in the marketplace but it s really that issue that is driving essentially the flat revenues jeffrey d hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay great thanks craig don bullock senior vice president of investor relations next question comes from andy casey with wells fargo andy casey wells fargo analyst good morning everybody craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi andy casey wells fargo analyst question on the margin outlook and price cost does that 2019 guide embed neutral price cost you typically do that and i m wondering because you re probably going to have carryover pricing benefit that spills into 19 and you may see raw material cost declines as the year progresses craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say that what we generally do built in andy through exactly your point is we build in neutral and then there is always a little bit of timing you know on the upside and downside depending upon what s happened with commodity prices and so typically speaking as commodity commodity increase environment we tend to be a quarter to behind it and the deflationary environment we tend to be maybe a quarter or so or two above it but over the period up you don t say a 12 month period it kind of watches out to be neutral and that s really what we ve baked into our plan specifically as it relates to tariffs and what we said in the q3 earnings call was that we expect that 110 million of headwind associated with tariffs as you know since then the implementation had been delayed by two months so we think that number is now at a 100 million but our base assumption today still would assume that the tariffs the phase iii tariffs moving from 10 to 25 go into effect and that our team is essentially go out and offset that with incremental price but don t necessarily getting a normal incremental margin on the additional tariff derivative cost increases andy casey wells fargo analyst okay thank you craig and then on that 4x impact the 250 million for the year is that heavily weighted to the first quarter craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah it would be more heavily weighted toward the first quarter just given with how currencies have performed during the course of 2018 that s been largely true andy casey wells fargo analyst okay does that weigh on the margin for the first quarter at all craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah actually not really it really doesn t in terms of the margins itself and may it really doesn t way on the margins certainly ways on eps for sure but it really doesn t necessarily way on the margin rates andy casey wells fargo analyst okay thank you very much don bullock senior vice president of investor relations and next question comes from mig dobre with baird mig dobre baird analyst hi good morning guys going back to ep maybe trying to understand your your growth guidance a little bit better i m trying to figure out exactly how you re thinking about getting to 4 to 5 growth we really haven t seen order growth to that extent yet is this simply a factor of lighting no longer being a headwind and everything else is pretty much been the same or some other end market acceleration in there craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i mean i think you kind of hit the nail on the head with that one if you think about what we talked about during the course of 2018 where we ve made some very specific decisions around our lighting business and walking away from business that wasn t profitable and during the course of 2018 that business actually contracted some low to mid single digits and as we look forward that goes from a negative to a positive and so that s really what s driving the big difference in the relative growth rate in our e p business mig dobre baird analyst all right that s helpful and then back on vehicle you re expecting some margin expansion there even though obviously revenues not so much so what exactly is generating that and as you look maybe beyond 2019 presumably this this business is going to start to see some volume deterioration how do you plan on managing that richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer i d say you know one of the things that would be when we talk about is the fact that we set this joint venture up obviously with cummins and we don t consolidate the revenue but we obviously get half of the earnings and so the jv will see revenue growth earnings growth in 2019 and that will actually be will help us with margin expansion and then i would say more broadly i mean this is just a business and a management team that has just done an outstanding job over decades of very efficiently running our business and so operational improvements efficiency improvements cost out it s something that we do extraordinarily well as a company and even better within our vehicle business and so we would fully expect that this business continues to operate at very high levels of margins even in the event of a economic downturn of somewhat mig dobre baird analyst thanks you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations our next question comes from andrew obin with boa merrill lynch andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst hey good morning thanks for fitting me in craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer hi andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst just with the economic cycle being so healthy and you guys executing well how do you think about your capacity overall and north american capacity specifically how do you deal with these high volumes craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d say that it s one of the reasons andrew and i appreciate the question our incremental rates as we provide in our guidance in 2019 are perhaps a little bit less than what we experienced in 2018 because we are having to make some investments in a lot of our businesses that are running at very high levels whether that s electrical systems and services whether it s in aerospace we ve made some really big investments in hydraulics during the course of 2018 and so we are having to reinvest in capacity expansion in many of our businesses that are running at very high levels and so i think that s really the way you deal with as you spend the dollars and you make the investments in in some cases you look at your business models as well around what you invest in and what you rely upon you supply base to do by borrowing large we we are making investments to expand our capacity andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst and are you rethinking your global footprint i mean the ratio where you investing that s what i meant craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yes what we ve always tried to do is really manufacture in the zone of currency and so what we try to minimize the amount of goods that we ship around the world and so what we today sell in europe we largely make in europe and what we today sell in asia we largely produce in asia and so from a footprint standpoint that there was a lot of work that we ve done over let s say the last 15 to 20 years around making sure that we have manufacturing capability and facilities in the right regions of the world most of that work is largely done and so today it s really expanding where we need to in those regions of the world where we have capacity constraints andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst and just a follow up if i can what s your cadence in china through the year what are you expecting craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i m sorry your cadence around andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst oh just a cadence of revenue growth in china in 2019 through the year seasonality however you want to address it thank you craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer i have the probably go take a look at that question specifically as it relates to china i don t have that level of detail in front of me but i would say that in general what our belief is is that it s the chinese government will likely stimulate at some point we saw as you ve saw as well the significant slowdown in the economy in q4 specifically highlighted by what took place in the light vehicle markets which were down some 16 so we believe and i think it is largely believed that the chinese government will stimulate at some point during the course of the year so we do think that the second half of the year is stronger than the first half but beyond that it s difficult to really estimate at this point andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst thank you very much don bullock senior vice president of investor relations at this point of time i will have time for one last question rob mccarthy with stifel andrew obin bofa merrill lynch analyst thanks for fitting me in this for the buzzer beater can you hear me craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah richard h fearon vice chairman and chief financial and planning officer yeah rob mccarthy stifel nicolaus analyst sure now two questions one just on the oil and gas how do you think about your exposure there given the fact that you ve seen the experience not only either explicit in oil and gas exposure but implied viding of that oil and gas exposure due to industrial business how do we think about the out of bound of that as we kind of think about your portfolio going forward and assessing the risk of what could be a continued downdraft here craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer yeah i appreciate the question rob especially given what i think we all experienced on the last kind of cyclical downturn in the oil and gas market and i d say the first thing i d just remind the group that we tend to be more downstream focused than we are upstream focus so i would say as a much longer cycle we saw a little bit of a pullback in oil prices in the fourth quarter but they came rebounding in december and i would say buy enlarge in our business performed well through q4 and we ve not really seen today any let s say significant changes in in our business in terms of the outlook the rig count actually for 2018 to actually ended up some 20 for the year when you compare the year overall and so we think that you know oil and gas is always a bit of a wildcard and tough to predict exactly where it s going but given that we re really coming off let s call it a three or four year pretty significant down draft in oil and gas markets and we just now got our legs underneath us we think oil and gas holds up over the next number of years it s difficult to say for certain but but i think our base case would be that we don t see a significant retrenchment and capital spending around oil and gas rob mccarthy stifel nicolaus analyst i ll leave it there thanks craig arnold chairman and chief executive officer thank you don bullock senior vice president of investor relations with that ladies and gentlemen we re going to wrap up the call as always we will be available for follow up and questions following the call thank you duration 61 minutes call participants don bullock senior vice president of investor relations craig arnold

the international monetary fund imf will send a team to colombo in mid february to discuss resuming a postponed loan program to sri lanka whose government faces a ballooning foreign debt and severe debt servicing problems imf managing director christine lagarde made the statement on january 15 following discussions in the us with a sri lankan delegation headed by finance minister mangala samaraweera the deputation included central bank governor indrajit coomaraswamy finance ministry secretary rhs samaratunga and economic reforms minister harsha de silva the imf stalled a scheduled discussion last year and withheld the release of us500 million the last two installments of a 1 5 billion loan approved in 2016 following an attempted political coup by president maithripala sirisena the bank said it postponed the payments in response to political uncertainty in sri lanka on october 26 sirisena dismissed ranil wickremesinghe as prime minister and replaced him with former president mahinda rajapakse when rajapakse was unable to win majority parliamentary support sirisena dissolved parliament the president s coup failed after intense pressure from washington for the reinstatement of wickremesinghe and the sri lankan supreme court ruled that sirisena s actions were unconstitutional washington which has intensified its military geo strategic and trade measures against china was hostile to any return to power by rajapakse whose previous administration developed close relations with beijing postponement of the imf installments led to sri lanka being downgraded by major international rating agencies moody s fitch and standard and poor s and weakened its ability to borrow on the money markets after wickremesinghe was reinstated the government appealed to the imf to resume its funding facility lagarde told the media on january 15 that sri lankan authorities had assured the imf of colombo s continued commitment to the bank s economic reform agenda and the necessity for a strong policy mix this means a ruthless intensification of the bank s austerity program the imf s reforms include slashing subsidies to small farmers and the poor eliminating jobs through the privatisation and commercialisation of state owned enterprises and expanding the tax net to include all working people increased tax concessions will be handed to big business and the value of the country s currency more directly determined by market forces before the sri lankan delegation s meeting with the imf chief wickremesinghe outlined the country s debt problems in a special statement to parliament he spoke of paying 5 9 billion in debt servicing this year when the central bank has just 6 9 billion in foreign currency reserves the treasury paid 1 5 billion due on january 15 by drawing 1 billion from the central bank s foreign currency reserves and borrowing from the indian and chinese central banks addressing a recent ceylon chamber of commerce conference central bank governor indrajit coomaraswamy said he wanted 5 billion raised in the first quarter of 2019 to boost reserves in order to repay foreign debts this was necessary in case of any political uncertainty that may pop up later in the year coomaraswamy said the job of central banks is to prepare for the worst and we learnt this lesson on 26 october 2018 we don t know what political tsunami might come next so we have to plan and get the money in as fast as possible as part of this push the cabinet early this month approved a 2 billion loan via international sovereign bonds the central bank also told the government it intends to raise more funds this year from sovereign bonds in dollars yen renminbi and euros much of the government s loan portfolio consists of commercial short term loans at high interest rates according to a recent study by verite research a think tank most of these loans including international sovereign bonds have a 6 percent interest rate and must be settled within seven years sri lanka s reliance on commercial loans increased dramatically during the past decade rising from 11 percent of its debt in 2008 to a staggering 54 percent in 2017 much of this was to pay for the cost of colombo s long war against the separatist liberation tigers of tamil elam and rising trade deficits loans were obtained through international sovereign bond markets which expanded after the 2008 global financial crisis when the us federal reserve made available trillions of dollars after bailing out the banks and finance houses these investments are now being withdrawn due to rising interest rates in the us according to reports during the first ten months of last year 640 million was withdrawn from sri lankan government securities these withdrawals intensified following the political turmoil that erupted in colombo last october foreign currency outflows have directly affected sri lanka s rupee depreciating it by about 20 percent against the us dollar last year and driving up the price of essentials the central bank governor said the economy faced problems of fiscal and current account deficit while exports which were 33 percent of the gdp in 2000 have now declined to 12 6 percent the rising cost of imports and stagnating exports have continuously expanded the country s trade deficit which cannot be overcome by increased foreign investment or remittances by overseas sri lankan workers a january 27 comment in the colombo based sunday times noted that although loans being sought by the central bank and other sri lankan banks would replenish the reserves and boost international confidence they would increase the country s foreign debt liability the repayment of debt obligations has been by further foreign borrowing foreign reserves were inadequate this reveals the external financial vulnerability of the economy the newspaper warned the deepening economic crisis and planned mid february discussions with the imf will see the sirisena wickremesinghe government unleash even more brutal measures on the working class and the poor
briefing highlights not much can help economy economy contracts in november markets loonie at a glance ge beats profit estimates mastercard tops analyst estimates italy slides back into recession from today s globe and mail wither the economy economists are marking down their forecasts for economic growth in canada both past and future some seeing little that can save the day we saw some of this play out today when statistics canada reported that the economy contracted marginally in november by 0 1 per cent setting the stage for a weak fourth quarter reading that followed october s bounce of 0 3 per cent among the november losers the federal agency said was the manufacturing sector which contracted 0 5 per cent for the third downbeat reading over the course of four months construction also suffered as did finance and insurance amid stock market declines retailers were also hit as was the energy patch october now looks to have been an island in the storm for the canadian economy as november saw a return to weakness said cibc world markets chief economist avery shenfeld real gdp fell 0 1 per cent matching our forecast but that now joins with the flat period for august september to mark three of the last four months in which performance was lacklustre he added projecting fourth quarter growth will now come in at about 1 per cent and while it s in the rear view mirror bank of montreal has now cut its forecast for fourth quarter growth to just 1 2 per cent setting the stage for 2019 looking further out bmo also projects canada s economy will expand at a pace of 1 8 per cent this year bank of america merrill lynch has also just trimmed its 2019 projection for canada matching bmo at 1 8 per cent and down from its earlier forecast of 2 2 per cent and much uncertainty lies ahead warned carlos capistran its canada and mexico economist the economy is facing a deceleration in external demand a negative terms of trade shock from oil prices and uncertainty from u s trade policy mr capistran said part of mr capistran s new forecast is pegged to what bank of america expects will be slower than expected u s economic growth at 2 5 per cent and weak oil prices however we coincide with the that lower oil prices are likely to soften the economic outlook but that the impact should not be nearly as large as in 2015 mr capistran wondered in his report whether exports can save the day that s not likely he declared global trade is decelerating which will have a negative impact on canadian exports through softer demand for u s exports mr capistran said uncertainty over the u s china trade war will likely also have an impact on canada s exports as global trade is likely to remain soft tariffs are likely to remain high and canada china business relations seem likely to remain tense nor are higher oil prices likely to save the day though mr capistran added they may not be a drag and of course as the globe and mail s james keller reports alberta premier rachel notley eased up on the supply cuts wednesday bank of america analysts expect the spread between west texas intermediate the u s oil benchmark and western canada select to hold at between us 15 and us 18 far lower than where it had been before alberta s ordered cut in production a smaller differential means canadian oil fetches increased prices this range assumes that u s gulf coast refiners access to latin american heavy oil will continue to shrink as venezuelan production declines which coupled with broader opec cuts will continue to lend support to wcs prices then there are concerns over approval of the new u s mexico canada pact that would replace the north american free trade agreement while observers such as mr capistran still expect approval they also suggest a showdown between the white house and the democrats could hold things up possibly delaying it into next year don t count on the canadian consumer to bail out the economy the latest we ve seen is a drop in retail sales in november for example and canadians are expected to tighten their spending even further given that they re now juggling higher interest rates among other things there s no doubt that households have become more sensitive to credit costs due to elevated debt and a near record debt service burden with payments gobbling 14 5 per cent of disposable income in q3 up 0 4 of a percentage point from mid 2017 said bmo senior economist sal guatieri projecting that growth in consumer spending will ease 1 6 per cent this year and 1 4 per cent in 2020 compared with 2018 s estimated 2 2 per cent capital economics also forecasts slower growth in consumer spending at about 1 5 per cent in each of the next two years despite what it calculated as a windfall of 60 billion annualized the upshot is that households are likely to save not spend the bulk of their windfall from the drop in gasoline prices said stephen brown its senior canada economist in fact we expect consumer spending growth to lag incomes growth in the coming years as households precautionary saving rises all of this of course makes for a cautious bank of canada which recently signaled a pause in its rate hiking cycle though is still expected to raise its benchmark one or two more times read more markets at a glance read more more news from today s globe and mail

the upside after the fed announced its widely expected decision to leave interest rates unchanged and indicated the central bank will remain patient regarding further rate hikes the fed said following a two day meeting it has decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 25 to 2 50 percent the accompanying statement included some notable changes from last month including dropping a reference to the fed s plan for further gradual rate increases the central bank also removed a sentence describing the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced instead the fed said still sees a sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes but also pointed to global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the fed subsequently said it will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support those outcomes fed chairman jerome powell noted in his press conference that the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat similar to the decision to raise interest rates last month the fed s decision to leave interest rates unchanged was unanimous the next fed meeting is scheduled for march 19th and 20th with cme group s fedwatch tool currently indicating a 98 7 percent chance the central bank will once again leave rates unchanged a march hike was all but ruled out before this meeting but a hike in the second quarter now appears to be in serious doubt said michael pearce senior u s economist at capital economics he added with financial conditions easing over recent weeks and the economic data still solid we still on balance expect one more rate hike

poacher turned gamekeeper is one of the hoariest old cliches around which makes one wonder why the reverse is rarely used gamekeeper turned poacher it is after all a much more alarming proposition this was the role adopted by olivier blanchard the former chief economist at the imf international monetary fund in a recent speech to the american economic association of which he had been president in it mr blanchard seemed to say that a lot of the fears about government debt may be overdone that is startling enough in itself but is made more so by the fact that when it comes to public debt the imf is the ultimate gamekeeper
the u s dollar is expected to rise against other major currencies in the first half of the year before losing ground in the second half analysts said as a combination of slower u s growth expectations for 2019 and federal reserve s more gradual approach toward interest rate hikes will weigh on the currency in a poll conducted by international business times the median forecast from 10 analysts suggests the dollar will fall to 1 1843 against the euro by year end and will weaken to 106 56 against the japanese yen during the same period one analyst did not give forecasts analysts said uncertainties including the u s china trade war and politics in the euro area have the potential to push the u s dollar higher but only in the short term in the second half of 2019 the u s dollar will slip against major currencies as the growth differentials between global economies start to converge u s china trade tensions brexit and euro area politics remain key event risks however each having the potential to push the u s dollar higher over the shorter term bank of america said in its note the impact of a hard brexit will see a sharp depreciation in the pound against the majors michael ferlez economist at moody s analytics said if the trade war with china exacerbates this could signal weaker global demand and could lead to appreciation in safe haven currencies such as the usd and jpy this would also lead to depreciation of currencies that depend on trade with china such as the aud he added the fed whose tightening cycle analysts attribute to being one of the key drivers for the u s dollar s strength in 2018 is largely expected to reduce the number of rate increases this year according to an earlier poll by ibt scott brown chief economist at raymond james said fed tightening lifted the u s dollar in 2018 the fed is expected to be more gradual in raising rates in 2019 and the economy should support a further normalization but the risks to the growth outlook are tilted toward the downside accordingly the u s dollar is likely to be about steady in the first half of the year but may soften in the second half brown did not give any forecasts repricing of the 2019 fed tightening cycle has weighed on the trade weighted u s dollar analysts said the trade weighted u s dollar index is about 1 5 percent lower from its highs in december it was last reported at 126 8701 on tuesday and touched a high of 128 7636 on dec 19 presidential pressure on the fed a stock market sell off and the fed themselves shifting toward a data dependent approach have all contributed to the move ing said analysts also said the u s economic growth is widely expected to decelerate from current levels implying a growth convergence among economies bank of america said in its note by the end of the year the euro zone and the u s will be growing at potential and monetary policies will start converging u s data has already started weakening after growth peaked in q2 last year euro zone data remains weak but we believe that the bottom was in q4 last year we also expect a u s china trade deal in q1 this year which will also be good news for the euro zone economy we expect the combination of shifting growth and interest rate differentials key factors that supported the u s dollar in 2018 to work against it in 2019 the bank said usd versus other majors analysts said the u s dollar will not sustain its 2018 rate of appreciation against most g10 currencies the u s dollar has outperformed other major currencies in 2018 the wsj dollar index that measures the greenback s performance against 16 other currencies gained 4 3 percent in 2018 the safe haven japanese yen was the only other currency to end the year positive gaining 2 percent in 2019 we will see a broad but shallow retracement against the majors due to the fading effects of the tax legislation on repatriation by u s multinationals and more significantly the potential for a pause in u s rate increases by the federal reserve ferlez said in the short term oxford economics expects the eur usd to face more downside risk amid continuing euro zone growth underperformance the research house remains positive on the sterling in the medium term however a hard brexit will weigh on the sterling amid the uncertainties the japanese yen is expected to gain the yen is likely to be the winner in this environment as both higher volatility and slower u s growth will likely encourage repatriation flows oxford economics noted the usd cad will continue to be influenced by oil prices global risk appetite trade policy developments and the broader u s dollar we think these risks are skewed in favor of usd cad correcting lower over a short to medium term horizon bank of america said in its note political uncertainty in australia ahead of new elections will weigh on the australian dollar in the medium term analysts said especially if it continues to be a drag on business and consumer confidence however analysts said they expect the aussie dollar to rise against the greenback around mid year as the fed is expected to restart its tightening cycle in the second half of 2019 yet the aud decline should be temporary as usd will reach its peak embark on the bear cycle from 2h19 onwards and in turn lift aud usd higher ing said

ended and that china ultimately would become some kind of jeffersonian democracy and a capitalist country she said in a recent interview with bloomberg radio that is not at all the case china goes through these cycles of opening and closing again it opens when the country needs cash and that s what happened through the 1990s and the 2000s to date now the cost is getting higher than the benefit and so you ll see china closing again advertisement the cost stevenson yang is talking about is more about control than money to truly open its economy china would have to take its hands off the wheel and allow the market to dictate winners and losers it would have to allow foreign companies or even its own private companies to compete freely without joint ventures with chinese state owned companies these are among the thorniest demands the trump administration is making in trade talks with china they are the demands that commerce secretary wilbur ross says the two countries are miles and miles away on to china the demand to resolve these issues has come unexpectedly china has been opening up its economy at a snail s pace since it joined the world trade organization in 2001 for example american companies like visa mastercard and american express have had major trouble entering china s growing payments market only american express has won regulatory approval to begin clearing transactions and that just happened in november as for the us s demand that china stop stealing technology by force or trickery hong kong property tycoon ronnie chan an american citizen who sits on the council of foreign relations and counts henry kissinger among his friends told the south china morning post advertisement people said china has been stealing technology well first of all everybody steals technology and number two three years ago i had a discussion with general david petraeus and condoleezza rice on this subject of stealing technology from one another is that something that happened in the last one year did it get worse it didn t get worse so what changed your mind to china the us is simply not behaving rationally to the us china is veering off a course it never necessarily charted the kind of opening the trump administration wants costs too much in the only currency china s leaders really care about political control if that were not the case the convulsions we re seeing from china s economy right now might not be so worrisome but they are a credit cycle with chinese characteristics all of china s economic indicators are flashing red the eerily stable labor market is even showing signs of strain in 2018 the country s stock market had its worst performance in a decade the yuan is weakening against the us dollar threatening to dip below an important psychological threshold of 7 to 1 debt has spread from the chinese corporate and financial sectors to households who ve accumulated the same level of household debt to gdp as the us after just around a decade of having credit cards advertisement china s labor market and wage growth are both showing signs of strain societe generale the problem isn t all about the level of debt either as dr keyu jin professor of economics at the london school of economics explained during a discussion at the world economic forum in davos switzerland the problem is how china s system allocates capital it s that china s state controlled system is throwing good credit after bad related stories today s challenge is how do you get credit and resources from the financial sector into the real economy and into the productive firms into the highly innovative private sector with latent potential that s china s problem it s not necessarily the debt levels and slowing growth rate he said autonomous research last year the government shut down china s shadow banking system an increasingly risky capital allocation mechanism that provided credit to private companies and individuals shadow banking exploded after 2009 when the chinese government went on an credit creation and infrastructure spending spree to avoid getting sucked into the global financial crisis but when the shadow banking system was stamped out it took around 40 of china s new credit with it advertisement since the crackdown big state run banks have stuck to lending to big state run companies with implicit explicit government guarantees leaving private enterprise and individuals out to dry this has even china s most successful entrepreneurs wringing their hands especially after an op ed suggesting the state should just take over the private sector went viral on the country s closely monitored internet the government is feverishly trying to figure out how to get capital to the right places through tax cuts for example but their efforts have yet to hit the real economy if they ever do autonomous research to the extent that a pickup is occurring in lending to smes as the authorities have been encouraging for months we suspect it is largely taking place via shorter term loans that can be quickly reassessed if repayment issues emerge charlene chu an analyst at autonomous research wrote in a recent note to clients this is a moment when the world could help china out of an economic mess but it won t advertisement china needs credit and the world has it but credit comes from the latin word for trust and trust is in short supply right now especially since china is unwilling to do the things outlined above that would cede control of the economy to the market oxford economics foreign banks in theory could fill the gap left by maxed out mid sized and city rural banks chu told business insider via email but in reality many of them say they haven t figured out how to lend in china that s why their books remain so small i also don t know that the authorities want a truly independently operating part of the banking system it would be a lot harder to lean on foreign banks to be aggressive with lending to whoever the state wants them to a political cycle of perpetual struggle this turn in china s domestic credit cycle is part of why earlier this month chinese president xi jinping told his cadres to prepare for a worst case situation advertisement xi also outlined all the risks china is facing in the year ahead political ideological economic technological social and international threats as well as those from within the party according to the south china morning post so risks from everywhere enemies everywhere this suits xi s political reality just fine his understanding of socialism and politics is one of perpetual struggle this worldview was outlined in a recent speech by john garnault a former journalist and australian government official who came to have rare access to china s deep red princelings the chinese communist party s ruling class xi and his almost peers garnault gave the speech for the asian strategic and economic seminar series and it was called engineers of the soul ideology in xi jinping s china garnault argues xi understands his party in the same way the ussr s joseph stalin did as a vehicle to engage in a perpetual struggle against enemies internal and external where politics serve as an end unto themselves xi is not an opener he is a closer advertisement because of this garnault says china will only become more totalitarian not less xi s anti corruption campaign will never end much like stalin s purges never did as for the west in this framework it exists only to serve as the chinese communist party s ideological foil from the speech the western conspiracy to infiltrate subvert and overthrow the people s party is not contingent on what any particular western country thinks or does it is an equation a mathematical identity the ccp exists and therefore it is under attack no amount of accommodation and reassurance can ever be enough it can only ever be a tactic a ruse without the conspiracy of western liberalism the ccp loses its reason for existence there would be no need to maintain a vanguard party mr xi might as well let his party peacefully evolve advertisement totalitarianism is the only way to guard against this encroachment from the west and that is why xi who eliminated term limits for himself has worked harder than any of his recent predecessors to stamp out influence in china s physical and digital space garnault does not believe that s where this ends either the challenge for us is that xi s project of total ideological control does not stop at china s borders it is packaged to travel with chinese students tourists migrants and especially money it flows through the channels of the chinese language internet pushes into all the world s major media and cultural spaces and generally keeps pace with and even anticipates china s increasingly global interests so when chinese billionaires like ronnie chan muse as to why the us is suddenly unfriendly it isn t just because of president donald trump and his cabinet of economist war dogs it isn t just because the us is suddenly angry about things that have been going on for years either advertisement it is because xi is a kind of chinese leader the world had not yet seen in this last 40 year cycle one who naturally reorients the country toward a closed society beijing china september 30 chinese president xi jinping walks to the monument to the people s heroes during a ceremony at tiananmen square on the eve of national day on september 30 2018 in beijing china lintao zhang getty images on wednesday china s parliament fast tracked a bill meant to protect foreign companies in the country the body will vote on the bill in march according to chinese state media it includes penalties for failure to report violations to relevant authorities this should be good news but we are experiencing a trust deficit so members of trump s economic team are waiting to see how china says it will enforce these measures this isn t the only gesture to end the trade war china has made that has been met with skepticism officials also reportedly offered to buy enough us imports over the next six years to eliminate the trade deficit between the two countries advertisement but as analysts at barclay s pointed out sticking to that commitment would throw china s economy off kilter it isn t realistic important details like that which only amplify the trust deficit between the two countries will only spur more talk of decoupling in us circles that conversation isn t about whether or not decoupling is valid either as paulson mentioned in his speech it s about whether or not decoupling will be comprehensive or carefully calibrated too much and the world could end up split behind an economic iron curtain he said none of this ends with the trade war it transitions in this new reality it is more important than ever to recognize china s agency over its own destiny independent of the west s ambitions it s xi s understanding not ours of where china is in its cycle of opening and closing that could mean the difference between peace and prosperity and confrontation and calamity

the us federal reserve signaled its three year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the american economy due to global headwinds and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations as it held interest rates steady the us central bank also discarded its promises of further gradual increases in interest rates saying it would be patient before any further moves fed chairman jerome powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks with neither rising inflation nor financial stability considered a risk and factors including slowing growth overseas and the self inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the us outlook less certain we are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong us macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross currents he said common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity the current fed policy rate of between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent is well below historical averages and if it does not go higher the fed will have little room to battle any future downturn with rate cuts alone the fed raised rates four times last year including in december when it indicated it would do so twice more this year the outlook however has become more clouded as a result of recent volatility in financial markets and signs that growth overseas is slowing including in china and the euro zone there are also concerns about the impact of global trade tensions and fears the recent 35 day partial shutdown of the us government over a budget dispute may crimp consumer spending in light of such factors and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient in determining rate hikes the fed s rate setting committee said in its policy statement the fed made no change to the us 50 billion hk 389 billion maximum monthly runoff of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities from its balance sheet after the release of the fed s statement us stocks added to gains with the s p 500 index ending the day about 1 5 percent higher while the dollar and short term yields fell as investors gauged an even lower probability of additional rate hikes any time soon onshore yuan rose over 300 basis points to a new six month high at 6 7025 against the us dollar in hong kong the hang seng index surged 1 08 percent to 27 942 with tencent ping an insurance and china construction bank rising by 0 52 percent 2 64 percent and 1 01 percent respectively a hong kong monetary authority official said the fed s points were noted and it reminded investors to be cautious with the changing face of macroeconomics and hong kong s outlook was unclear by factors including the sino us trade war and brexit issue hongkong and shanghai banking corp and the bank of china hong kong both announced they will not be adjusting their best lending rates

highlights pm modi led government s sixth and final budget before the polls fitch warns of fiscal slippage if govt goes for populist interim budget income tax concessions for individuals may be part of the budget new delhi finance minister piyush goyal will be presenting modi government s interim budget tomorrow according to convention which has always been followed by successive governments in independent india an outgoing government does not present a full budget rather they seek the parliament s approval for necessary expenditure for the next three four months till the new government is in place and ready to present a full budget whether goyal junks this convention entirely and launches into myriad new schemes complete with outlays and financing details this remains to be seen income tax concessions for individuals a farm relief package support for small businesses and possible populist spending measures may be part of the budget that finance minister piyush goyal will present friday as the government makes a last ditch attempt to woo voters ahead of the general elections prime minister narendra modi led government s sixth and final budget before the polls due by may is supposed to be an interim budget or a vote on account but it is widely expected that goyal may go beyond seeking parliament nod for government expenditure for four months of next fiscal and announce sops to woo rural and urban middle class voters industry sources and experts said as per convention the outgoing government only seeks parliamentary approval for limited period spending leaving the full budget presentation for the new regime in july under pressure from a resurgent congress which is going all out to lure voters with the promise of debt waiver for farmers and a minimum income for the poor if voted to power goyal may announce some form of a direct transfer of cash to farmers this may or may not replace subsidies that the farmer gets but will certainly be aimed at addressing rural distress which was primarily blamed for bjp s defeat in recent assembly elections in key states the farm relief package may cost anywhere between rs 70 000 crore to rs 1 lakh crore according to sources goyal who stepped in as interim finance minister after arun jaitley had to fly to new york for medical treatment is widely expected to raise income tax exemption thresholds basic exemption limit may be raised from rs 2 5 lakh to rs 3 lakh for individuals of less than 60 years of age and from rs 3 lakh to rs 3 5 lakh for those aged 60 years or more but less than 80 women taxpayers may get higher basic exemption of rs 3 25 lakh or even at par with senior citizens as per sources an alternative to raising the exemption limit is to raise the 80c deduction to rs 2 lakh from rs 1 5 lakh to encourage taxpayers to save more for their future considering delay in housing projects and also rising interest rates deduction of interest amount on housing loan for a self occupied house property may be enhanced to rs 2 5 lakh from rs 2 lakh the set off cap of adjusting loss from house property against other heads of income may also be accordingly raised to rs 2 5 lakh from rs 2 lakh according to sources the increase in personal income tax exemption limit is unlikely to meaningfully reduce collections unless the successive tax slabs are also changed also being speculated are cheap loans for small businesses and increased rural spending for the farm sector the possible options include direct transfer of money to farmers like in the telangana model of rythu bandhu interest free crop loan for those farmers who pay on time and zero premium for insurance of food grain crops the measures industry and informed sources say could include those to create employment as the government faces a tag of giving a jobless high gdp growth for investors these sops may translate into another breach in the budget deficit target of 3 3 per cent of gdp for the current fiscal and a possible record borrowing in the coming financial year in 2018 19 the largest downside to revenues has been from the gst collections with the shortfall likely at around rs 1 4 lakh crore goyal may also look at higher interim dividend from rbi and deferring subsidy payouts on fertiliser as well as lpg and kerosene to provide funds for the populist schemes credit rating agencies have warned that without bringing down other spending a higher farm subsidy bill will increase future fiscal deficits fitch ratings thursday warned of a second consecutive year of fiscal slippage in the event of goyal resorting to populist spending to win over lost vote base higher pre election spending could risk a second consecutive year of fiscal slippage relative to the government s targets and would further delay plans to reduce the high general government fiscal deficit and debt burden it said sources said the interim budget would provide an opportunity for the government to outline its medium term economic priorities specifically with regards to improving farm rural incomes it would be important to continue its focus on overall infrastructure expansion especially as private sector investments remain tepid and a nascent recovery hinges on government spending there is also a talk of the government looking at the idea of a quasi universal basic income scheme qubi the concept of a universal basic income ubi in the context of india was outlined in the economic survey 2016 17 however a ubi for the entire population and even for the bpl population will entail a prohibitively high fiscal outgo in fact without a commensurate reduction in various transfers subsidies and social programmes it might not be feasible to implement a ubi for the entire population however the government could target the poorest of the poor possibly 40 per cent of the bpl population based on the 2011 census some say a hypothetical rs 700 to rs 1 200 per month can be provided to the poorest of the population around 12 crore people this will entail an outgo of rs 1 lakh crore or 0 5 per cent of the gdp rupee ends 4 paise higher at 71 08 usd focus on interim budget the indian rupee thursday edged higher by

inflation rate last year at 100 000 with prices doubling roughly once a month the imf reckons that in 2019 it may reach 10 000 000 listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element hyperinflations are not an exclusively modern problem rome suffered one under the emperor diocletian but the spread of fiat currencies backed by the credibility of a government rather than a physical commodity such as gold has made them more common they came in devastating bursts over the past century in the aftermath of the first and second world wars during the post soviet transition from communism to capitalism and more recently in misgoverned poor countries mostly in africa and latin america they are not cases of garden variety inflation run amok rather they demonstrate a catastrophic breakdown in a state s capacity to govern in a narrow sense they are a monetary phenomenon with printing presses running nonstop yet the important question for economists and for those trying to end them is why the presses ran out of control in the first place the culprit nearly always is a politically unmanageable fiscal burden huge budget deficits can erode confidence in a state s fiscal discipline causing the currency to weaken heavy government borrowing and a worsening exchange rate which raises the cost of imports fuel inflation most governments in such circumstances avert looming crisis by reining in borrowing and money growth indeed periods of high inflation are not that unusual according to stanley fischer a former vice chairman of the federal reserve ratna sahay of the imf and carlos végh of the world bank during the post war period they note a fifth of a sample of 133 countries experienced inflation in excess of 100 at some point but most avoided hyperinflation indeed a country with annual inflation of 100 200 was more than twice as likely to see inflation decline the following year as it was to see it rise but sometimes the situation deteriorates politicians may be unable to impose the necessary reforms without losing the backing of the interest groups keeping them in power excessive spending continues increasingly funded by seigniorage spending power captured by the government thanks to the gap between the face value of new banknotes and the cost of printing them as the bills mount so does inflation hyperinflation often occurs against the backdrop of war or other social chaos germany s weimar government beset by political unrest and burdened with war debts and reparations stumbled into economic oblivion but it can begin in more prosaic circumstances in the 1970s bolivia enjoyed a commodity driven boom under the rule of a military leader hugo banzer during which it borrowed heavily from abroad banzer was pushed from power in 1978 during the ensuing upheaval global economic conditions turned interest rates soared and resource prices tumbled the left leaning government that came to power in 1982 inherited annual inflation of 300 a shrinking economy and the loss of access to foreign creditors but as jeffrey sachs of columbia university documented in an analysis published in 1987 bolivia s new leadership had won support by promising to increase social spending attempts to limit spending or raise taxes enraged interest groups on which the government depended the reliance on seigniorage continued and inflation rose to 60 000 economists once thought that high inflation should prove damnably persistent as expectations of soaring prices became embedded yet in a seminal paper in 1981 tom sargent a nobel prizewinner argued otherwise rather expectations of high inflation reflect candid assessments of government policy people anticipate high inflation when politicians are unserious about reform a credible policy shift he notes can change expectations quickly and at little or no cost he examined four great inflations in the 1920s and showed that once a credible policy regime change occurred hyperinflation ended in weeks stop the presses more recent experience confirms that hyperinflation can end quickly under the right conditions that usually means a sustainable fiscal consolidation a credible pledge to stop funding the government via seigniorage and a commitment to a new monetary framework most often via an exchange rate peg new political leadership often helps as does external financial support a new government took over in bolivia in 1985 after three years of raging inflation it raised taxes slashed public investment froze public salaries and stopped paying interest on its debt thus restoring fiscal balance and it stabilised the exchange rate against the dollar with help from the imf the programme started in earnest late in august 1985 by early september a five digit inflation rate had flipped to deflation not every case concludes so neatly countries with histories of high inflation can stagger on with it rather than tumbling into hyperinflation it then proves frustratingly difficult to escape this was the situation in argentina and brazil in the 1980s and 1990s as repeated attempts at stabilisation failed to solve the problem conclusively after extended periods of ineffectual leadership people may become jaded about reform campaigns and shock and awe may be required if they are to to be taken seriously venezuela despite a long record of double digit inflation rates may dodge this fate inflation there has rocketed only in the past few years amid an impressive display of fiscal incontinence for its people the sooner regime change comes the better

greater political and social antagonism ray dalio bridgewater associates dalio made the remarks in a panel discussion at the world economic forum s annual meeting in davos on tuesday where he

4 4 the comments come at a time when a brief market correction has turned monetary and fiscal policy concerns on a dime as noted by michael lebowitz yesterday afternoon at ria pro in our opinion the fed s new warm and cuddly tone is all about supporting the stock market the market fell nearly 20 from record highs in the fourth quarter and fear set in there is no doubt president trump s tweets along with strong advisement from the shareholders of the fed the large banks certainly played an influential role in persuading powell to pivot speaking on cnbc shortly after the powell press conference james grant stated the current situation well jerome powell is a prisoner of the institutions and the history that he has inherited among this inheritance is a 4 trillion balance sheet under which the fed has 39 billon of capital representing 100 to 1 leverage that s a symptom of the overstretched state of our debts and the dollar as an institution as mike correctly notes all it took for jerome powell to completely abandon any facsimile of independence was a rough december pressure from wall street s member banks and a disgruntled white house to completely flip their thinking in other words the federal reserve is now the market s bitch however while the markets are celebrating the very clear confirmation that the fed put is alive and well it should be remembered these emergency measures are coming at a time when we are told the economy is booming we re the hottest economy in the world trillions of dollars are flowing here and building new plants and equipment almost every other data point suggests that the economy is very strong we will beat 3 economic growth in the fourth quarter when the commerce department reopens we are seeing very strong chain sales we don t get the retail sales report right now and we see very strong manufacturing production and in particular this is my favorite with our corporate tax cuts and deregulation we re seeing a seven month run up of the production of business equipment which is you know one way of saying business investment which is another way of saying the kind of competitive business boom we expected to happen is happening larry kudlow jan 24 2019 of course the reality is that while he is certainly spinning the yarn for the media the fed is likely more concerned about reality which as the data through the end of december shows the u s economy is beginning to slow as shown over the last six months the decline in the lei has actually been sharper than originally anticipated importantly there is a strong historical correlation between the 6 month rate of change in the lei and the eoci index as shown the downturn in the lei predicted the current economic weakness and suggests the data is likely to continue to weaken in the months ahead limited monetary tool box as dalio noted one of the biggest issues facing global central banks is the ongoing effectiveness of quantitative easing programs as previously discussed of course after a decade of central bank interventions it has become a commonly held belief the fed will quickly jump in to forestall a market decline at every turn while such may have indeed been the case previously the problem for the fed is their ability to bail out markets in the event of a credit related crisis in 2008 when the fed launched into their accommodative policy emergency strategy to bail out the financial markets the fed s balance sheet was only about 915 billion the fed funds rate was at 4 2 if the market fell into a recession tomorrow the fed would be starting with roughly a 4 trillion dollar balance sheet with interest rates 2 lower than they were in 2009 in other words the ability of the fed to bail out the markets today is much more limited than it was in 2008 but it isn t just the issue of the fed s limited toolbox but the combination of other issues outside of those noted by dalio which have the ability to spur a much larger the nonprofit national institute on retirement security released a study in march stating that nearly 40 million working age households about 45 percent of the u s total have no retirement savings at all and those that do have retirement savings don t have enough as i discussed recently the federal reserve s 2016 survey of consumer finances found that the mean holdings for the bottom 80 of families with holdings was only 199 750 such levels of financial savings are hardly sufficient to support individuals through retirement this is particularly the case as life expectancy has grown and healthcare costs skyrocket in the latter stages of life due historically high levels of obesity and poor physical health the lack of financial stability will ultimately shift almost entirely onto the already grossly underfunded welfare system however that is for those with financial assets heading into retirement after two major bear markets since the turn of the century weak employment and wage growth and an inability to expand debt levels the majority of american families are financially barren here are some recent statistics here is the problem with all of this we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us despite central bank s best efforts globally to stoke economic growth by pushing asset prices higher the effect is nearly entirely mitigated when only a very small percentage of the population actually benefit from rising asset prices the problem for the federal reserve is in an economy that is roughly 70 based on consumption when the vast majority of american s are living paycheck to paycheck the aggregate end demand is not sufficient to push economic growth higher while monetary policies increased the wealth of those that already have wealth the fed has been misguided in believing that the trickle down effect would be enough to stimulate the entire economy it hasn t the sad reality is that these policies have only acted as a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy and created one of the largest wealth gaps in human history the real problem for the economy wage growth and the future of the economy is clearly seen in the employment to population ratio of 16 54 year olds this is the group that should be working and saving for their retirement years the current economic expansion is already set to become the longest post wwii expansion on record of course that expansion was supported by repeated artificial interventions rather than stable organic economic growth as noted while the financial markets have soared higher in recent years it has bypassed a large portion of americans not because they were afraid to invest but because they have no capital to invest with to dalio s point the real crisis will come during the next economic recession while the decline in asset prices which are normally associated with recessions will have the majority of its impact at the upper end of the income scale it will be the job losses through the economy that will further damage and already ill equipped population in their prime saving and retirement years furthermore the already grossly underfunded pension system will implode an april 2016 moody s analysis pegged the total 75 year unfunded liability for all state and local pension plans at 3 5 trillion that s the amount not covered by current fund assets future expected contributions and investment returns at assumed rates ranging from 3 7 to 4 1 another calculation from the american enterprise institute comes up with 5 2 trillion presuming that long term bond yields average 2 6 the massive amount of corporate debt when it begins to default will trigger further strains on the financial and credit systems of the economy dalio s view is likely understated the real crisis comes when there is a run on pensions with a large number of pensioners already eligible for their pension the next decline in the markets will likely spur the fear that benefits will be lost entirely the combined run on the system which is grossly underfunded at a time when asset prices are dropping will cause a debacle of mass proportions it will require a massive government bailout to resolve it but it doesn t end there consumers are once again heavily leveraged with sub prime auto loans mortgages and student debt when the recession hits the reduction in employment will further damage what remains of personal savings and consumption ability the downturn will increase the strain on an already burdened government welfare system as an insufficient number of individuals paying into the scheme is being absorbed by a swelling pool of aging baby boomers now forced to draw on it yes more government funding will be required to solve that problem as well as debts and deficits swell in the coming years the negative impact to economic growth will continue at some point there will be a realization of the real crisis it isn t a crash in the financial markets that is the real problem but the ongoing structural shift in the economy that is depressing the living standards of the average american family there has indeed been a redistribution of wealth in america since the turn of the century unfortunately it has been in the wrong direction as the u s has created its own class of royalty and serfdom the issue for future politicians won t be the breadlines of the 30 s but rather the number of individuals collecting benefit checks and the dilemma of how to pay for it all the good news if you want to call it that is that the next crisis will be the great reset which will also make it the last crisis

asian equities rallied and the dollar extended losses after the federal reserve signalled it would slow down its pace of interest rate hikes providing some much needed respite to investors fretting over the cost of borrowing dealers are also keeping an eye on top level talks between china and the united states aimed at resolving their long running trade war which kicked off on wednesday the us central bank sparked a flurry of equity buying after chairman jerome powell said the case for lifting rates had weakened somewhat as the global economy stutters in this environment we believe we can best support the economy by being patient in evaluating the outlook before making any future adjustment to policy he said the fed also said it could slow down the reduction of its securities holdings which would also help keep rates lower wow powell to markets we hear you and we have adjusted policy accordingly chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank said the fed also caved on the balance sheet by saying interest rates are still the primary policy making tool but they are prepared to adjust the pace of balance sheet normalisation if economic and financial developments require it mr rupkey added the news provided a further boost to markets which were dragged for most of 2018 by concerns that rising rates would make it costlier for them to borrow to invest wall street rallied with dealers there also cheering healthy earnings from big hitters including facebook and boeing those gains filtered through to asia where tokyo ended the morning 0 9 per cent higher trade talks in focus hong kong and shanghai were also up as a gauge of factory activity in china improved slightly in january from last month while the purchasing managers index pmi showed contraction it beat forecasts though observers warned the figures were helped by producers stepping up work ahead of the lunar new year next week elsewhere singapore rose 0 5 per cent and sydney added 0 2 per cent while wellington and manila were sharply higher seoul however dipped 0 1 per cent the dovish signal from the fed sent the dollar tumbling against most other currencies wednesday and extending the losses in asia the greenback remained stuck below 109 yen while the euro and the pound which have suffered some turbulence over the brexit saga in recent days were also slightly higher the australian dollar rallied 0 8 per cent while the south korean won was 0 4 per cent higher and indonesia s rupiah put on 0 4 per cent the new zealand dollar the south african rand and the russian ruble were also well up china s yuan was sitting at a six month high focus now turns to the much anticipated trade talks with china s top economic envoy in washington as the world s economic superpowers try to bring an end to a long running crisis that has sent shudders through global markets however the two day talks are taking place under a cloud after the us charged chinese telecom titan huawei on numerous counts of fraud and tech theft afp
by melissa luz t lopez senior reporter the overall increase in prices of widely used goods likely dropped sharply in january for the third straight month the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp said as lower rice prices and power rates may have offset higher fuel prices as the year opened the bsp department of economic research said it expects inflation to have settled at 4 3 5 1 last month hence could decline further from december s 5 1 this will also be the slowest pace since at least april s 4 5 but will still be faster than the 3 4 recorded in january 2018 the philippine statistics authority will release official january inflation data on feb 5 domestic oil price hikes due to higher international crude oil prices and the second tranche of the excise tax adjustment from the train republic act no 10963 or the tax reform for acceleration and inclusion law are seen to be the primary driver of inflation for the month the central bank unit said in a statement released on thursday retail pump prices rose for three consecutive weeks last month mirroring adjustments in global oil prices amid fresh production cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and concerns about the trade dispute between the united states and china as of jan 22 gasoline prices had gone up by p1 per liter while that of diesel climbed by p1 55 liter kerosene also saw prices go up by p0 65 liter so far on top of this the excise tax on petroleum products rose by another p2 liter effective jan 1 on top of a p2 50 per liter increase last year as provided under the train law that took effect a year ago higher fish and vegetable prices amid colder weather coupled with a fresh round of an excise tax increase for alcoholic drinks under the sin tax law may have also driven consumer prices up the bsp said however these price movements were likely offset by lower rice prices a reduction in electricity rates and a slightly stronger peso which returned to the p52 level versus the dollar power distributor manila electric co said electricity rates went down by p0 5260 per kilowatt hour in january due to a lower generation charge the central bank has been closely watching inflation following last year s multiyear high price spikes fueled largely by rice and other food items price increases shot past the bsp s 2 4 target band as early as march 2018 and ascended to a nine year peak of 6 7 in september and october which prompted the monetary authority to raise benchmark interest rates from three percent to 4 75 by yearend in an attempt to rein in inflation expectations the bsp halted its five consecutive tightening moves in december amid early signs that inflation was on its way down now central bank officials are saying that they can be prudent as they see enough room to let 2018 s rate hikes be absorbed by the system hinting that rates may be kept steady at its first policy review for 2019 next thursday the bsp is also certain that inflation will return to below four percent this year with the full year forecast average at 3 2 versus last year s actual 5 2 market analysts now see the bsp keeping rates steady with some noting that monetary authorities can start policy unwinding by reducing bank reserves by one percentage point to boost money supply

significant earnings improvement this quarter said modine president and chief executive officer thomas a burke the cis and building hvac segments delivered strong performances with significant market share gains and earnings growth however cost pressures in the vts segment continued to drive lower operating margins due primarily to tariff related costs and temporary operating inefficiencies the operating inefficiencies are a function of new program launches but we have made leadership changes in the affected areas and are seeing improvements net sales increased 6 percent in the third quarter to 541 0 million compared with 512 7 million in the prior year on a constant currency basis net sales increased 8 percent from the prior year this increase was a result of sales growth across all business segments with the building hvac segment showing the greatest percentage increase gross profit increased 7 percent in the third quarter to 91 7 million compared with 85 4 million in the prior year gross margin increased 20 basis points to 16 9 percent primarily due to conversion on higher sales in the cis and building hvac segments this was partially offset by the direct and indirect impact of tariffs on raw material costs and operating inefficiencies in the vts segment selling general and administrative sg a expenses were 57 2 million in the third quarter 3 6 million lower than

condensed consolidated financial statements 1 basis of preparation these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of royal dutch shell plc the company and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as shell have been prepared on the basis of the same accounting principles as those used in the annual report and form 20 f for the year ended december 31 2017 pages 142 to 148 as filed with the us securities and exchange commission except for the adoption of ifrs 9 financial instruments and ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers on january 1 2018 and should be read in conjunction with that filing ifrs 9 sets out the requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets financial liabilities and certain contracts to buy or sell non financial items furthermore this standard facilitates the use of hedge accounting and results in different income recognition upon the sale of certain investments in securities the adoption of ifrs 9 resulted in a decrease of 83 million in equity at january 1 2018 mainly representing the recognition of additional provisions for impairment of receivables under the expected loss model in addition changing the measurement basis from amortised cost to fair value for certain financial assets resulted in an increase of 33 million in equity at january 1 2018 furthermore a reclassification within equity between other reserves and retained earnings primarily representing deferred cost of hedging was recognised ifrs 15 provides a single model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers based on the identification and satisfaction of performance obligations and revenue from contracts with customers that is distinguished from other sources shell has adopted ifrs 15 with effect from january 1 2018 and has elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach although ifrs 15 does not generally represent a change from shell s current practice the accounting for certain contracts such as those with provisional pricing or take or pay arrangements and underlifts and overlifts has been identified as an area of change however these do not have a significant effect on shell s accounting or disclosures and therefore no transition adjustment is presented ifrs 16 leases will be applied by shell with effect from january 1 2019 under the new standard all lease contracts with limited exceptions are recognised in the financial statements by way of right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities shell will apply the modified retrospective transition approach without restating comparative information compared with the existing accounting for operating leases under ias 17 application of the new standard will have a significant impact on the classification of expenditures and consequently the classification of cash flow from operating activities cash flow from investing activities and cash flow from financing activities it will also impact the timing of expenses recognised in the statement of income differences between the operating lease commitments under the current standard and the additional lease liabilities recognised on balance sheet at january 1 2019 are expected to be mainly driven by the impact of discounting lease payments short term leases the use of hindsight to assess options to extend or terminate leases and commencement of lease contracts after january 1 2019 the detailed analysis which will determine the impact upon application of the new standard is close to completion the quantitative impact at transition date will be disclosed in the 2018 annual report and form 20 f no impact is expected in relation to lease contracts previously classified as finance leases the financial information presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 3 of the companies act 2006 the act statutory accounts for the year ended december

contracts in the ordinary course of business shell enters into contracts to supply or purchase oil and gas products as well as power and environmental products shell also enters into contracts for tolling pipeline and storage capacity derivative contracts are entered into for mitigation of resulting economic exposures generally price exposure and these derivative contracts are carried at period end market price fair value with movements in fair value recognised in income for the period supply and purchase contracts entered into for operational purposes as well as contracts for tolling pipeline and storage capacity are by contrast recognised when the transaction occurs furthermore inventory is carried at historical cost or net realisable value whichever is lower as a consequence accounting mismatches occur because a the supply or purchase transaction is recognised in a different period or b the inventory is measured on a different basis in addition certain contracts are due to pricing or delivery conditions deemed to contain embedded derivatives or written options and are also required to be carried at fair value even though they are entered into for operational purposes the accounting impacts are reported as identified items impacts of exchange rate movements on tax balances represent the impact on tax balances of exchange rate movements arising on a the conversion

suggest that the trend in japan s economy has been firm however some market participants hold excessively pessimistic views and risks to overseas economies have been increasingly tilted to the downside and there are concerns that some may materialize boj also noted that recent fall in stocks prices to a certain extent indicates the anticipation of a global decline in the real economic growth rate and this is clear from developments in exports and imports rather than gdp which is declining marginally the central bank also reiterated the stance to maintain current monetary easing and

aud the australian dollar opens higher this morning having surged through resistance in the wake of the fomc policy decision and rate statement the aud bounced off intraday lows early as domestic cpi data showed prices advanced at a faster pace than expected in the three months to december last year the marginal uptick in broader data sets and stability across trimmed cpi prints helped ease the pressure on the rba to move away from its current neutral policy setting toward an easing bias the aud jumped back to 0 72 before trading sideways as investors took stock ahead of the fed s fomc policy announcement while the markets largely expected the fed to leave rates on hold the exceedingly dovish undertone forced a sharp correction in the world s base currency fostering and aud rally through resistance at 0 7230 to touch highs at 0 7274 the fed made two small amendments in its broader messaging that had a marked impact on longer term rate expectations the fomc explicitly adopted a patient approach removing its commitment to further gradual rate increases while made a commitment to adjust the specifics of balance sheet normalization to ensure there is ample supply in light of recent financial and economic uncertainty the shift to a more accommodative language especially with the balance sheet increasing expectation the fomc will remain on hold moving through 2019 attentions now turn to chinese manufacturing data thursday a strong read could help consolidate the recent upturn and break above 0 7230 as we move into next weeks rba policy meeting a move back below 0 7230 could see a sustained period of trade between 0 7140 and 0 7230 while an extended break above resistance could prompt a move into a new trading band aud nzd expected range 1 0450 1 0550 the nzd jumped from an intraday low of 0 68222 to jump to an open of 0 68995 against the usd this morning this follows the release of fomc statement that resulted in the decline on the us dollar across the board as the fed offered no signals about a rate high soon and would be patient about lifting borrowing costs the next major release for the new zealand dollar is scheduled to go out next week as the statistics new zealand will announce their data on employment change and the unemployment rate these are early indicators of the employment situations and important signals of overall economic health

usd expected range 0 7150 0 7300 the united states dollar stumbled and fell throughout the overnight session as the fomc undermined the greenbacks valuations opening this morning at 95 42 the us dollar index shed 0 4 after the fomc kept rates on hold and released a markedly more dovish statement as expected this weeks big hitting news came from the fomc which held rates on hold as widely predicted nevertheless the devil was in the detail with the fomc statement providing the impetus for market movements in particular the omission of language citing the economic outlook as roughly balanced led to a decidedly more dovish market interpretation the fomc ultimately replaced their us economic outlook with a clearly more uncertain one and cited patience as the best policy forward undermining rate hike guidance for the rest of the year adding fuel to the fire the federal reserve released a separate statement stating that their monthly balance sheet reduction will continue as expected but they may alter the pace in light of economic and financial developments after a busy day on the economic calendar the greenback is set to enjoy a quiet day direction will be driven by the headlines and off shore releases aud eur expected range 0 6250 0 6350 the euro traded in a fairly muted range overnight in the lead up to the united states federal reserve interest rate decision this morning opening at 1 1425 against the greenback the eur usd slid to intraday lows of 1 1410 as german preliminary inflation figures declined for the month of january by 1 0 and remained steady at 1 7 on an annualised basis the federal reserve kept interest rates on hold overnight with a more dovish statement headlining the day as the further gradual increases was dropped from the latest fomc statement the greenback was sold off in droves lifting the eur usd to 1 1502 its highest level of 1 1502 since january 11th with the greenback now under pressure following the likelihood that there will be potentially less hikes in the future the eur usd went back above the 100 day moving average as it looks to sustain its rally and could see a test of this year s high of 1 1560 a number of gdp

appreciating 0 93 to hit 0 7606 against its us counterpart the loonie benefitted primarily through the fomc s dovish statement which saw the greenback fall significantly overnight there wasn t too much news on the economic calendar for the canadian dollar to digest with direction being driven from south of the border tellingly the us federal reserve released a markedly more dovish statement that previous meetings omitting language suggesting a balanced view on the economic outlook only to be replaced with uncertainty the federal reserve now seems committed to the wait and see approach undermining us expected rate hike guidance for the rest of 2019 the canadian dollar enjoyed the fallout from the weakening greenback and took the opportunity to advance handsomely by nearly 1 moving

release as a result of new information future events or otherwise non ifrs financial measures adjusted ebitda to provide investors with additional information regarding its financial results the company has disclosed within this press release adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are non ifrs financial measures and they do not represent cash flows from operations for the periods indicated and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s results of operations or as an alternative to cash flows from

property plant and equipment including capitalized customer in vehicle devices and right of use assets amortization of intangible assets including capitalized in house development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination share based compensation costs restructuring costs profits losses on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries insurance reimbursements relating to impaired assets and certain litigation costs the company has included adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in this press release because they are key measures that the company s management and board of directors use to understand and evaluate its core operating performance and trends to prepare and approve its annual budget and to develop short and long term operational plans in particular the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin can provide a useful measure for period to period comparisons of the company s core business accordingly the company believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results the company s use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under ifrs some of these limitations are although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for the company s working capital needs adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity based compensation adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments or the payment of lease liabilities that may represent a reduction in cash available to the company and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including operating profit profit for the period and our other results adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share adjusted earnings per share is defined as profit attributable to owners of the parent mix telematics excluding net foreign exchange gains losses net of tax and share based compensation costs related to performance share awards net of tax divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period we have included adjusted earnings per share in this press release because it provides a useful measure for period to period comparisons of the company s core business by excluding net foreign exchange gains losses from earnings as well as share based compensation costs related to performance share awards performance share awards were awarded under the mix telematics long term incentive plan for the first time in november 2018 and are aimed at incentivising management to achieve cumulative subscription revenue and adjusted ebitda targets for the 2019 and 2020 fiscal years accordingly we believe that adjusted earnings per share provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the company s operating results free cash flow free cash flow is determined as net cash generated from operating activities less capital expenditure for investing activities we believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating

for the group from april 1 2018 ifrs 15 permits a modified retrospective cumulative catch up approach for the adoption which the group has decided to apply under this approach the group has recognized transitional adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application i e april 1 2018 without restating the comparative period under the practical expedient the new requirements were only applied to contracts that were not completed as of april 1 2018 ifrs 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 but can be early adopted given that the group applied ifrs 15 from april 1 2018 the group decided to early adopt ifrs 16 from this date the group has chosen to apply the simplified approach on adoption of ifrs 16 that includes certain relief related to the measurement of the right of use asset and the lease liability at april 1 2018 rather than full retrospective application furthermore the simplified approach does not require a restatement of comparatives refer to note 2 1 1 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended march 31 2018 for further details on the adoption of the above mentioned standards summary of the impact

additional information regarding its financial results the company has disclosed within this press release adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are non ifrs financial measures and they do not represent cash flows from operations for the periods indicated and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s

including capitalized in house development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination share based compensation costs restructuring costs profits losses on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries insurance reimbursements relating to impaired assets and certain litigation costs the company has included adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in this press release because they are key measures that the company s management and board of directors use to understand and evaluate its core operating performance and trends to prepare and approve its annual budget and to develop short and long term operational plans in particular the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin can provide a useful measure for period to period comparisons of the company s core business accordingly the company believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results the company s use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under ifrs some of these limitations are although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for the company s working capital needs adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity based compensation adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments or the payment of lease liabilities that may represent a reduction in cash available to the company and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including operating profit profit for the period and our other results adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share adjusted earnings per share is defined as profit attributable to owners of the parent mix telematics excluding net foreign exchange gains losses net of tax and share based compensation costs related to performance share awards net of tax divided by

awards were awarded under the mix telematics long term incentive plan for the first time in november 2018 and are aimed at incentivising management to achieve cumulative subscription revenue and

review adoption of ifrs 9 ifrs 15 and ifrs 16 ifrs 9 is effective for the group from april 1 2018 ifrs 15 permits a modified retrospective cumulative catch up approach for the adoption which the group has decided to apply under this approach the group has recognized transitional adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application i e april 1 2018 without restating the comparative period under the practical expedient the new requirements were only applied to contracts that were not completed as of april 1 2018 ifrs 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 but can be early adopted given that the group applied ifrs 15 from april 1 2018 the group decided to early adopt ifrs 16 from this date the group has chosen to apply the simplified approach on adoption of ifrs 16 that includes certain relief related to the measurement of the right of use asset and the lease liability at april 1 2018 rather than full retrospective application furthermore the simplified approach does not require a restatement of comparatives refer to note 2 1 1 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended march 31 2018 for further details

impact on the third quarter of fiscal 2019 of adopting ifrs 9 ifrs 15 and ifrs 16 other than a r2 2 million 0 2 million increase in finance costs primarily as a result of ifrs 15 significant financing

material the only adjustment to the statement of cash flows was an outflow of r3 4 million 0 2 million in respect of lease liability payments being recorded in cash flows from financing activities as a result of the adoption of ifrs 16 this outflow was previously accounted for as an operating lease expense and included under cash generated from operations the results have not been audited or

introduction and summary unfortunately this social and economic foundation is crumbling the american society of civil engineers asce gives the united states an overall infrastructure grade of d estimating a more than 2 trillion funding gap between needs and expected spending by all levels of government over the next 10 years 1 this gap is troubling because inadequate facilities drag down economic productivity especially in growing dynamic regions many smaller communities struggle to repair crumbling older facilities pushing out businesses and creating a downward spiral of population loss and a reduced tax base infrastructure is the foundation that makes the economy possible shaping how americans move communicate and earn a living it is also essential to national competitiveness when done right infrastructure investments produce broad based prosperity for american workers facilitating social mobility and access to jobs essential services educational opportunities people and ideas infrastructure investments are about more than steel and concrete they represent the direction the country should take making progressive investments will help to create thriving healthy communities that deliver inclusive and sustainable prosperity for decades to come this report discusses the need for a comprehensive infrastructure package exploring the size and scope of current u s infrastructure investments and highlighting underinvestment in a number of important policy areas it then provides more detail on financing the infrastructure investments as well as making sure they support climate smart policies ones that help american workers and that are targeted equitable and transparent the best opportunity to meaningfully address these challenges is a comprehensive package of national infrastructure investments designed to raise wages rebuild struggling communities and achieve a greenhouse gas reduction target a federal infrastructure bill should have the following five characteristics there is a long overdue need for major new federal investments in infrastructure but increasing federal spending alone is not enough to ensure the benefits of federal investments are shared broadly an infrastructure bill should include policies designed to protect labor rights fight workplace discrimination set high standards for wages and benefits and support high quality training and apprenticeships additionally federal funds should be targeted to those communities facing the greatest need as well as redress the unequal burden of pollution and geographic isolation that neglectful and discriminatory investment policies and projects cause 5 in addition congress should ensure that investments expand access to opportunity raise wages and improve job quality for millions of working americans as well as help rebuild communities left behind even as the overall unemployment rate has fallen many workers have not received a pay increase in inflation adjusted terms since the 1970s by comparison corporate profits have soared over that same period of time 3 during 2018 real corporate earnings increased by more than 16 percent while average wages for workers rose by a meager 0 2 percent 4 historically infrastructure and protection of the environment have been treated as separate with the former a foundational element of economic production and the latter an amenity something nice to have but incidental to the economy and economic issues of wages growth and competitiveness the increasing severity and frequency of catastrophic wildfires droughts floods and hurricanes have laid waste to this false dichotomy in truth the economy and the environment are intricately linked and mutually reinforcing infrastructure investments not only facilitate growth but they also affect the production of greenhouse gases and other harmful pollutants in both direct and indirect ways infrastructure investments should help the united states transform its economy away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy at the same time the global scientific community has reached a consensus that transformational change is needed to rapidly decarbonize the economy in order to avoid the most catastrophic consequences from climate change the international panel on climate change estimates that the world has a little more than a decade to take decisive action 2 size and scope to truly address america s infrastructure economic development and climate needs the federal government should spend 1 trillion above baseline when adjusted for inflation over the next 10 years an essential down payment on the future considering the needs estimates above these outlays should be comprehensive covering transportation water affordable housing community facilities energy k 12 schools and rural broadband internet among other areas the needs of the energy sector are equally substantial the path to true decarbonization requires investment and change from generating transmitting and storing electricity without pollution to using it more efficiently in u s homes businesses factories and vehicles beyond adding proven clean energy technologies to the u s electric grid and buildings the federal government should fund pilot and demonstration projects that advance the frontiers of clean energy and carbon removal to invest further in a clean energy future beyond brick and mortar access to affordable high speed internet is essential to economic development according to the federal communications commission fcc approximately 24 million american households lack high speed internet 24 roughly 80 percent of these households are in rural areas 25 each year several agencies most notably the fcc and the u s department of agriculture provide grants and loans for internet infrastructure and monthly service support principally in rural areas in fiscal year 2017 subsidies across the federal government totaled 8 5 billion 26 while important these expenditures are modest compared with the estimated 80 billion in potential costs to deploy high speed internet connections to all american households 27 many sectors that are essential to rebuilding communities have substantial need but no standing cost estimates community redevelopment is one example in fiscal year 2017 congress appropriated 3 billion for the community development block grant cdbg program 22 the cdbg program supports a host of activities including construction of affordable housing and community facilities however the number of localities that qualify for assistance has increased significantly while funding has not kept pace with inflation as a result the average annual entitlement grant to eligible local governments is a little more than 200 000 which is down from a peak of roughly 1 6 million in constant dollar terms 23 to say the least this amount is not enough to meaningfully assist communities facing sustained economic hardship the need for robust federal investment does not stop with transportation and water laying the foundation for inclusive and equitable economic growth also means investing in the suite of facilities that local communities need to attract new economic development and that working families need to thrive these include k 12 schools child care centers community health affordable housing and broadband internet among others historically however these community facilities have received either no federal assistance or an amount woefully inadequate to meet local needs for instance there is no federal program to support public school construction and rehabilitation by one estimate underinvestment in capital construction and ongoing maintenance for k 12 schools exceeds 46 billion annually 21 similarly the federal government does not provide capital support for child care facilities congress must increase spending on transportation and water but with a focus on lowering greenhouse gas emissions creating equitable economic growth and improving public health this means that the federal government should prioritize investments that increase resilience and reduce dependence on automobiles deploy nonpolluting alternatives such as electric vehicles and increase affordable access to opportunity including biking walking and public transportation for water this means prioritizing threats to public health such as clean air and water especially among vulnerable populations as well as improving the energy efficiency of drinking water and wastewater operations unfortunately even with these estimates in hand the congressional budget office reports that following the brief uptick in infrastructure spending as part of the 2009 american recovery and reinvestment act federal expenditures on transportation and water have fallen as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp 20 traditional infrastructure sectors including transportation and water have more clearly defined needs estimates however the following needs estimates do not take into consideration the substantial additional cost that climate change imposes beyond the usual wear and tear of heavy use for instance transportation agencies will need to reconstruct many facilities to withstand more frequent and severe flooding higher temperatures and stronger winds at the same time changing rainfall patters will alter the chemistry of drinking water sources adding to the cost and complexity of delivering safe drinking water 11 while addressing this shortfall is important surface transportation is only one area of critical need to achieve inclusive equitable prosperity and transformational decarbonization of the economy federal infrastructure investments must break with business as usual in both scale and scope this means dramatically increasing outlays for traditional infrastructure sectors as well as expanding federal support to include k 12 public schools child care centers and other facilities that serve as community anchor institutions currently the federal government focuses most of its infrastructure spending on surface transportation through the highway trust fund htf the htf is slated to become insolvent at the end of fiscal year 2021 and run a cumulative shortfall of 159 billion for the period fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2029 10 the asce estimates a 2 trillion shortfall in infrastructure spending by all levels of government over the next 10 years 9 yet even this sobering estimate does not account for the unprecedented challenges climate change creates the pressing needs of communities left behind during the economic recovery and the need to address social inequity exacerbated by discriminatory infrastructure investment policies further details of progressive infrastructure investments the following sections provide more details about the robust financing required for a progressive infrastructure package in addition to highlighting the necessity of climate smart policies policies that raise wages and improve job quality and policies that are targeted equitable and transparent financing the united states has more than enough economic and fiscal capacity to make substantial much needed investments in its infrastructure as it has done at other points in its history in fact the investments described above would cost significantly less than the tax giveaway that congress passed in december of 2017 the 1 9 trillion tax cuts and jobs act tcja cut tax rates for the wealthiest individuals and corporations while creating deeply problematic loopholes that will lead to tax abuses and potentially encourage new offshoring of american jobs 28 the tcja represents an enormous and immoral upward redistribution of wealth and has already reduced federal tax revenue to just 16 5 percent of gdp an exceptionally low level for a high point in the business cycle 29 repealing the most egregious provisions of the tcja could provide more than enough tax revenue to cover the cost of comprehensive infrastructure investment and the united states has available many other progressive revenue options as well climate smart at its core climate change is an infrastructure problem for the last century the united states government at all levels has invested in infrastructure that centers around the consumption and combustion of fossil fuels from how homes and businesses are powered to how people physically get from home to work the burning of coal oil and natural gas has been inextricably embedded in the functioning of the u s economy local state and federal infrastructure decisions largely have reflected this reality with each new coal fired power plant or multilane freeway the nation has been baking in decades of greenhouse gas emissions in addition the impacts of climate change including stronger storms rising sea levels and heat waves are already straining the nation s aging water transportation and energy infrastructure these impacts will only grow more severe as the planet continues to warm low income communities and communities of color are on the front lines of climate change as their infrastructure is more likely to be older and chronically underserved they also may have fewer resources with which to adapt to withstand these impacts or rebuild after a devastating storm for these reasons infrastructure policy sits at the center of climate change policy the united states cannot become a 100 percent clean energy economy at the pace and scale that the scientific community has said is needed without conscious and ambitious infrastructure policy intervention at the same time state and local leaders need federal help to build a strong and equitable defense against the climate impacts that are already here and against the more damaging ones to come therefore any infrastructure bill needs to tackle both parts of the problem driving the clean energy transition to reduce carbon pollution while making communities more resilient to the climate change impacts that cannot be averted first the bill should include robust spending to expedite the clean energy transition and make a down payment on the long term and sustained investments needed to put the u s economy on a low carbon path most of these investments are proven ideas using now familiar technologies they include installing more electric vehicle chargers and replacing dirty diesel buses with cleaner electric buses deploying more clean energy retrofitting homes and businesses to make them more energy efficient repairing leaky natural gas pipelines and modernizing the electricity grid to accommodate more renewable energy just to name a few second the bill should ensure that all infrastructure investments from roads and bridges to schools and hospitals are built to stand the test of time which increasingly will include the worst impacts of climate change it is not a question of if the next extreme weather event or devastating wildfire will come but when and how severe will it be any infrastructure bill needs to help communities in both rural and urban areas prepare for climate change impacts particularly in flood prone and under resourced areas given the urgency of the climate crisis policymakers need to know that these investments will reduce carbon pollution and other greenhouse gas emissions as such house leadership should set a clear ambitious and specific goal for reducing carbon pollution through the suite of infrastructure investments importantly however a single bill cannot solve a problem given the scope of climate change infrastructure investment therefore is just one element of a broad suite of policies that is necessary to decarbonize the u s economy by 2050 which is the date by which the global scientific community estimates carbon emissions must drop to zero to avoid catastrophic effects from warming 30 able to raise wages and improve job quality a robust and comprehensive federal infrastructure plan would create millions of jobs however in the absence of strong job quality standards many of those jobs would pay low wages provide few benefits and offer too few opportunities for advancement 31 this would not only harm american workers but also put responsible businesses that respect their workers and offer decent pay and benefits at a competitive disadvantage 32 and when workers are poorly compensated research shows that taxpayers often bear hidden costs first the goods and services produced by low road firms are often of poorer quality second the government often must supplement workers incomes with medicaid earned income tax credits and nutrition assistance 33 for nearly a century federal lawmakers have sought to uphold the basic guarantee that government spending should create good jobs through a variety of protections such as prevailing wage laws and discrimination protections yet today these protections are under constant attack and cover less than half of all federal spending 34additionally existing job quality standards too often allow employers to pay very low wages and do not protect workers attempting to form a union from employer opposition leaving workers with little power to negotiate for better wages and benefits the bill should require all jobs created through federal infrastructure spending to provide family supporting wages and benefits opportunities for advancement and a voice for workers on the job this includes funds obtained through federal grants loans contracts and public private partnerships that include federal participation moreover these standards should apply not only to initial construction work but ongoing maintenance service and operations jobs as well all jobs created by the bill should include coverage under existing prevailing wage and benefit laws as well as a 15 wage floor so that the investment does not support poverty wage jobs and helps build momentum for legislation to raise the federal minimum wage for all workers the jobs should also include requirements that companies respect workplace laws including workers right to join a union and that companies cannot attempt to persuade workers in the union selection process finally the jobs should expand training and apprenticeship programs as well as discrimination protections in order to raise workplace standards and help ensure that women workers of color and other historically disadvantaged groups are able to access decent jobs 35 to help sustain american manufacturing the infrastructure package should expand the coverage of buy america and buy american preference which are federal procurement laws designed to maximize the use of u s materials including steel iron and other manufactured goods to include more types of spending programs as well as strengthen monitoring and enforcement of existing standards 36 in the last session progressive leaders in congress made it clear that any infrastructure package must include prevailing wage protections and contain endorsed protections on all government spending to ensure that workers who want to form unions are able to do so 37 targeted equitable and transparent federal infrastructure programs overwhelmingly distribute money based on the geography of political power rather than need moreover most federal programs function as lightly structured block grants for states with few requirements about how these dollars are spent this means that national policy goals have little meaning beyond the rhetorical all too often federal dollars flow to projects based on politics and industry pressure instead of to communities that face the greatest challenges and need additionally federal infrastructure policy does not account for the harms caused by investments that displace residents create barriers to opportunity and result in unequal infrastructure burdens this means that congress should set a national policy of redressing the harms caused by past and present projects and avoiding harm with future infrastructure projects for example constructing the interstate highway system tore through local communities often siting routes through low income areas and communities of color 38 this resulted in displacement and dislocation from employment services and social networks something that is especially true for americans with disabilities even though the americans with disabilities act ada is approaching its 30 year anniversary many americans with disabilities still lack access to much of what society has to offer federal infrastructure investments should expedite the implementation of projects that achieve ada compliance as well as reform infrastructure planning requirements to ensure that state and local governments better account for the needs of americans with disabilities yet state and local governments continue to plan and build infrastructure projects that create unequal burdens instead of maximizing community benefits for example when a port authority expands its maritime port complex to allow for larger cargo volumes the regional economy and consumers nationally benefit but residents living in proximity to the port or along connecting highway corridors disproportionately bear the weight of higher levels of harmful air pollution noise vibrations accidents and even reduced property values as discussed above climate change will require major infrastructure investments to manage rising water levels increased flooding and more severe fires these projects will present their own challenges including the hard reality that certain at risk communities will need to relocate to reduce their extreme weather exposure and to accommodate new facilities federal policy must recognize that infrastructure projects deliver both benefits and burdens and it must start with a goal of promoting equity inclusion and restitution this will ensure that federal dollars are not discriminatory in their intent or their effect moreover federal infrastructure policy and funding must incorporate and support the needs of americans with disabilities infrastructure and climate progress cannot come at the expense of foundational civil rights increased federal spending must come with clear objectives for targeting resources to achieve national policy goals for environmental sustainability community health and inclusive economic development among other areas this means establishing transparent regularly updated and quantifiable performance metrics for both existing and new programs additionally it involves continuing to require project sponsors to undertake a comprehensive environmental review under the national environmental policy act with robust public engagement and disclosure of potential harms 39 only through regular and substantive community input will infrastructure projects deliver the maximum benefit with the least harm possible how the federal government spends money is just as important as how much and where money is spent and performance management based on progressive metrics combined with public input is essential to ensuring that public dollars deliver the greatest social economic and environmental return on investment for the workers families and communities facing the greatest challenges
monrovia liberia s central bank says it is preparing to embark on another venture to salvage the country s declining currency announcing on wednesday a set of new strategies report by alpha daffae senkpeni details about how these new approaches would impact the local economy is still unknown but the cbl in a press release disclosed that it is concluding arrangements on the use of various monetary policy instruments to ensure a more stable macroeconomic environment in 2019 the measure includes the introduction of a standing deposit facility a standing credit facility and cbl indexed bills and notes the the release added the announcement by the cbl comes following president george weah s second state of the nation address on monday january 28 when he hinted that his government was formulating plans to rescue the struggling liberian economy said weah as a sustainable remedy to the exchange rate problems the central bank is concluding arrangements on the use of various monetary policy instruments including the introduction of a standing deposit facility a standing credit facility and cbl indexed bills and notes to ensure a more stable macroeconomic environment in 2019 what are the strategies standing deposit facility or sdf is an economic strategy viewed by many economists as a strong tool to suck out the surplus liquidity and alleviate the banking system s problem applied by other countries including india sdf also involves the lending of money by the central bank without a collateral guarantee on a rate which is less than the official government rate as for standing credit facility it is the collateralization of loan facility that provides funds to financial institutions and businesses at a predetermined interest rate so as to cover end of day shortfalls that may arise in the daily settlement of payments the cbl is yet to reveal details about how these reforms will impact the economy the long and short term benefits declining liberian dollar the exchange rate between the us and liberian dollars has been steadily increasing since 2018 leaving a massive impact on ordinary liberians efforts by the country s technical economic management team headed by finance minister samuel tweah in 2018 to mop up excess liquidity of liberian dollars have shown little or no impact as the exchange rate is is now trading at l 162 to a us dollar the government has consistently backed its decision to infused the us 17 million out of a package of us 25 million in the economy the cbl on wednesday claimed that the rate was at its lowest value before the government intervention adding that 1 00 united states dollar was being exchange at l 180 liberia dollars prior to the intervention the liberian dollar performed poorly against the united state dollar the average liberian dollar exchange rate with reference to the united states dollar depreciated from l 117 liberian dollars to 1 00 united states dollar in 2017 to l 157 8 liberian dollars to 1 00 united states dollar at the end of 2018 the release said president weah had earlier said on monday that the us 25 million mop up was a short term quick fix intended to enable the cbl intervene in the foreign exchange market trade deficit issues at the same time president george weah has blamed the situation on the deficit in liberia s balance of trade which includes the increasing demand for united states dollars to service imports said pres weah in sona this massive depreciation of the liberian dollar was primarily driven by the deterioration of the country s terms of trade and an increase in demand for united states dollars to service imports other factors were the legacy of the unmil drawdown and the lingering adverse impact of the ebola crisis trade deficit is an amount by which the cost of a country s imports exceeds the cost of its exports a way of measuring international trade calculated by subtracting the total value of a country s exports from the total value of its imports liberia s real economy is performing very weak characterized by low export earnings as compared to payments for imports between january and november 2018 liberia s trade deficit was us 561 8 million representing 17 1 percent improvement as compared to 677 3 million for the same period in 2017 said president weah the president however stressed that despite optimism of recovery liberia s projected growth rates are still below the pre ebola period when the economy grew on average by 7 5 percent annually
us fed keeps rates on hold signals end of tightening in policy shift jerome powell credit reuters the federal reserve on wednesday signalled its three year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the u s economy due to global headwinds and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations as it held interest rates steady the u s central bank also discarded its promises of further gradual increases in interest rates and said it would be patient before making any further moves fed chairman jerome powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks with neither rising inflation or financial stability considered a risk and cross currents including slowing growth overseas and the self inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the u s outlook less certain advertisement we are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong u s macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross currents common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity powell told reporters after the end of a two day policy meeting continued u s economic growth was still the likeliest outcome powell said but was now less certain than a month ago when the fed said the economy was just as likely to grow faster than expected as it was to face a sharp downturn combined with comments that the fed s balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected the fed s meeting this week may mark a somewhat anticlimactic end to its years long battle to normalise monetary policy after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession advertisement the current fed policy rate of between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent is well below historical averages and if it goes no higher the fed will have little room to battle any future downturn with rate cuts alone it may also raise questions about whether the fed s shifting stance until recently powell and other officials said monetary policy was unnecessarily loose is a response to pressure from volatile financial markets or president donald trump trump has repeatedly attacked the fed for raising rates arguing that it was undercutting economic growth advertisement powell took advantage of a new regimen of press conferences after every policy meeting to lay out the series of touchy changes and insist the fed was only reacting to economic data not other pressures he termed the fed s new posture one of wait and see not necessarily a hard stop on rate increases but he also made clear the central bank is no longer in any rush after raising rates almost every quarter during the past two years and that absent some threatening rebound of inflation or evidence of risky financial behaviour the pause would likely last taken together with the balance sheet announcement the fed s statement gives maximum flexibility to a central bank criticized by investors who saw the fed itself becoming a source of market turbulence that was reflexively tightening policy even as economic risks mounted advertisement this marks a full 180 from what the fed was signalling just a few months ago said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz in newport beach california after the release of the fed s statement u s stocks added to gains with the s p 500 index ending the day about 1 5 percent higher while the dollar and short term yields fell as investors gauged an even lower probability of additional rate hikes any time soon market expectations of future rates fell further contracts tied to the fed s policy rate continued to price about a one in four chance of a hike in 2019 and contracts maturing in 2020 were signalling a small but rising chance of a rate cut then advertisement cloudier outlook the fed raised rates four times last year including in december when it signalled it would do so twice more this year the economic outlook however has become more clouded as a result of recent volatility in financial markets and signs that growth is slowing overseas including in china and the euro zone there are also ongoing concerns about the impact of global trade tensions and fears the recent 35 day partial shutdown of the u s government over a budget dispute may crimp consumer spending in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient in determining future rate hikes the fed s rate setting committee said in its policy statement the fed made no change to the 50 billion maximum monthly runoff of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities from its balance sheet some traders have urged it to slow or halt its pullback from the bond markets at least for now in a separate statement the fed said it had decided to continue managing policy with a system of ample reserves reinforcing the notion that the rundown may end sooner than expected overall this signals the fed will not be on autopilot going forward said justin lederer treasury analyst at cantor fitzgerald in new york the downgrade in the fed s language around rate increases included a change in its description of economic growth from strong to solid and it noted that market based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months the fed s policy decision was unanimous share article on leave your comments
nokia corporation financial statement release january 31 2019 at 08 00 cet 1 nokia corporation financial report for q4 and full year 2018 nokia delivers strong growth and improved profitability in q4

corporation financial report for q4 and full year 2018 published today the complete financial report for q4 and full year 2018 with tables is available at www nokia com financials investors should not rely on summaries of our financial reports only but should review the complete financial reports with tables rajeev suri president and ceo on q4 2018 results nokia ended the year with a strong fourth quarter we saw the second consecutive quarter of year on year sales growth across all five of our networks business groups as well as improved profitability in both networks and nokia technologies the execution of our strategy also proceeded well with the work we have put into building a solid foundation for nokia software showing clear results and our enterprise business rapidly becoming a pillar of growth looking forward i expect nokia s performance to strengthen for the full year 2019 versus 2018 and our view of a fast and meaningful shift to 5g remains unchanged given that 5g rollouts will be staggered over the course of the year we expect 2019 to have a soft first half followed by a much more robust second half over the longer term we expect a virtuous cycle of investment where operators update their networks across multiple domains from optical to macro radio fixed wireless access to cloud core small cells to ip routing network agnostic software and more following this we expect a second wave where industrial customers will invest in private wireless technology including lte and 5g ready networks with our end to end portfolio nokia is well positioned to tap this

results in brand and technology licensing costs to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and the regulatory landscape additionally our outlook is based on the following assumptions nokia s recurring free cash flow is expected to improve over the longer term due to lower cash outflows related to restructuring and network equipment swaps and improved operational results over time non ifrs financial income and expenses to be an expense of approximately eur 300 million in full year 2019 and over the longer term non ifrs income taxes at a rate of approximately 28 in full year

2017 of one time licensing net sales grew by 6 year on year with growth across all five of our networks business groups as well as in nokia technologies driven by particularly strong execution in our

transport ip routing and network agnostic software we continued to build momentum in our end to end strategy including good performance converting our sales pipeline into net sales at the end of q4 2018 approximately 41 of our sales pipeline was comprised of cross business group deals we also made progress with our strategy to diversify and grow with particularly strong performance in nokia software and continued solid performance in our enterprise business in our networks business higher operating expenses were due to customer trials related to 5g as well as higher pre sales expenses to drive future growth and higher returns partially offset by the benefits from our cost savings program and lower incentive accruals in nokia technologies the decrease in net sales on a year on year basis was primarily due to lower one time licensing net sales on a recurring basis we maintained our strong track record with 11 year on year growth also we continued to make good progress in patent licensing extending our patent licensing agreement with samsung and signing a new patent license agreement with oppo further validating our global licensing program nokia non ifrs diluted eps amounted to eur 0 13 compared to eur 0 13 in the year ago period non ifrs diluted eps increased by eur 0 02 year on year on a recurring basis the increase in non ifrs diluted eps on a recurring basis was primarily driven by higher gross profit across all three reportable segments of our networks business and improved recurring gross profit performance in nokia technologies as well as lower operating expenses in nokia technologies partially offset by a net negative fluctuation in other income and expense related to foreign exchange hedging higher income tax expenses and higher financial expenses nokia reported diluted eps amounted to eur 0 03 compared to negative eur 0 07 in the year ago period primarily driven by lower income tax expenses related to the re measurement of deferred tax assets which resulted in deferred tax expenses and allowances of eur 143 million compared to eur 738 million in the fourth quarter 2017 in addition nokia reported diluted eps was driven by higher gross profit across all three reportable segments of our networks business and improved recurring gross profit performance in nokia technologies partially offset by a net negative fluctuation in other

extending our patent licensing agreement with samsung and signing a new patent license agreement with oppo further validating our global licensing program nokia reported operating loss amounted to eur 59 million compared to an operating profit of eur 16 million in the year ago period this was primarily driven by lower gross profit across all three reportable segments in our networks business lower one time licensing net sales in nokia technologies and a negative impact from foreign exchange hedging this was partially offset by lower restructuring and associated charges and lower impairment of assets nokia reported diluted eps amounted to negative eur 0 10 compared to negative eur 0 26 in the year ago period this was primarily driven by lower income tax expenses related to the re measurement of deferred tax assets which resulted in deferred tax expenses and allowances of eur 155 million compared to eur 815 million in full year 2017 in addition nokia reported diluted eps was driven by the absence of expenses related to the early redemption of debt partially offset by lower gross profit across all three reportable segments in our networks business lower restructuring and

fourth quarter 2018 nokia generated an increase in net cash related to net working capital of approximately eur 400 million excluding approximately eur 140 million of restructuring and associated cash outflows nokia generated an approximately eur 540 million increase in net cash related to net working capital primarily due to an increase in liabilities and to a lesser extent a decrease in receivables and a decrease in inventories the decrease in receivables was approximately eur 50 million primarily due to an increase in the sale of receivables partially offset by the seasonal increase in receivables the decrease in inventories was approximately eur 30 million primarily due to a seasonal decrease in inventories partially offset by our decision to ensure sufficient flexibility to

see non gaap measures section of the md a 2 see adjusted results section of the md a refer to the md a for additional details on the consolidated results of the company with the mark to market of all derivative financial instruments and embedded derivatives in non financial instruments at the end of each reporting period our accounting income does not represent a complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the business consistent with previous reporting we prepared adjusted gross margin and adjusted earnings results to reflect the performance of the company during the period without the impact of the mark to market of derivative financial instruments and embedded derivatives in non financial instruments earnings before interest and income taxes ebit included a mark to market loss of 2 5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which was added to calculate the adjusted ebit and adjusted gross margin results adjusted ebitda represents ebit adjusted for the total adjustment to cost of sales for mark to market of derivative financial instruments depreciation and amortization expenses the sugar segment acquisition costs and the maple products segment non recurring costs see non gaap measures section in the md a free cash flow on a rolling twelve month basis was 46 4 million which represents an increase of 3 0 million versus the comparable period last year the variation is mainly explained by an increase in adjusted ebit of 13 3 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization expenses and lower financing charges paid of 0 6 million this positive variation was somewhat offset by 4 0 million paid to purchase and cancel common shares as opposed to 0 1 million received to issue shares in the prior comparative period also reducing the positive variance is an increase in interest and income taxes paid of 4 3 million and 1 8 million respectively as well as higher pension contributions and capital and intangible assets spending net of operational excellence capital expenditure of 0 4 million each sugar during the first quarter the industrial market segment increased by approximately 5 900 metric tonnes when compared to the same quarter last year as a result of opportunistic sales demand related to competitor s production issues as well as growth from existing accounts volume in the consumer market increased by approximately 1 500 metric tonnes when compared to the same quarter last year mainly explained by timing in customers promotional activities liquid volume was approximately 3 800 metric tonnes higher than the first quarter of last year mainly due to the recapture of some business temporarily lost to high fructose corn syrup hfcs as well as additional demand from new and existing customers exports were approximately 3 000 metric tonnes higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to additional sales to mexico and u s high tier sales adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 29 2 million compared to 31 2 million for the same quarter last year fiscal 2018 included a non cash pension income of 1 5 million recorded as a result of an amendment to the alberta hourly pension plan and therefore excluding this non cash income adjusted gross margin decreased by approximately 0 5 million the increase in sales volume was more than offset by the lower 11 raw sugar values when compared to last year which has a negative impact on taber s domestic sales gross margin rate in addition installation and commissioning issues of an energy saving capital project in vancouver resulted in incremental operating expenses during the quarter adjusted gross margin per metric tonne amounted to 155 16 for the current quarter versus 179 19 for the same period last year or 170 70 when excluding the non cash pension plan income of 8 49 per metric tonne the decrease is due mainly to lower 11 raw sugar values which as mentioned above had a negative impact on taber s domestic sales gross margin the slightly unfavorable sales mix also had an impact on adjusted gross margin per metric tonne as most of the increase in volume versus last fiscal period was in typically lower margin rate segments such as industrial liquid and export sales finally higher operating costs in vancouver also had a negative impact on adjusted gross margin per metric tonne administration and selling expenses were 0 4 million higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to timing distribution costs for the current quarter were 0 5 million higher than the comparable period last year due to additional freight costs during the quarter as a result of additional sales volume and due to product transfers between locations adjusted ebitda for the first quarter amounted to 24 5 million versus 27 1 million for the comparable period last year representing a decrease of 2 6 million the decrease for the quarter is mainly explained by lower adjusted gross margin as explained above and higher selling and administrative expenses and distribution costs maple products adjusted gross margin for the current quarter was 7 8 million representing an adjusted gross margin percentage of 14 2 of revenues compared to 6 1 million or 12 4 of revenues in the comparable quarter last year however included in cost of sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was an amount of 0 3 million due to an increase in value of the finished goods inventory at the date of acquisition of decacer without this adjustment adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been 6 4 million or 13 0 of revenues representing an increase of 1 4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the improvement versus last year is mostly due to the financial impact of decacer for the full quarter of the current year while the increase in adjusted gross margin percentage is mainly due to an increase in net selling price and savings from procurement initiatives administration and selling expenses amounted to 2 4 million for the current quarter versus 3 2 million for the comparable period but the latter includes non recurring costs of 0 3 million and 0 7 million in consulting fees and other costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of decacer in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 excluding these non recurring costs administration and selling expenses were higher than last year mostly due to the impact of decacer for the full quarter additional amortization of intangible assets somewhat offset by savings from operational excellence initiatives distribution expenses were comparable quarter over quarter adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 amounted to 5 8 million an increase of 1 6 million quarter over quarter the increase is mainly explained by the financial impact of decacer for the full quarter as well as savings attributable to procurement and operational excellence initiatives and an increase in net selling prices outlook sugar volume is expected to increase by approximately 25 000 metric tonne mostly explained by an increase in liquid and consumer volume of approximately 15 000 metric tonne and approximately 5 000 metric tonne respectively industrial segment is also expected to increase slightly while the export segment should be comparable to the prior fiscal year additional information is provided in the md a in light of the additional volume as well as the first quarter result we expect that distribution costs should be approximately 1 0 million higher than fiscal 2018 consistent with previous communications the sugar segment s capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are expected to increase compared to fiscal 2018 as the company will undertake the capital project in taber to be fully compliant with air emission standards by fiscal 2020 with spending ranging between 6 5 million and 8 5 million left to be spent on this specific project this year as approximately 1 5 million was spent in fiscal 2018 the remaining capital spend for the sugar segment is expected to be similar to fiscal 2018 including a high proportion of return on investment capital expenditures maple products during the quarter the company completed its second phase of the footprint optimization analysis the first phase of the project was announced last fiscal year with the relocation from the current leased bottling facility in granby québec to a new built for purpose state of the art leased property this move will allow us to better align production flow and install a new high capacity bottling line the completion of the first phase is expected to occur at the end of fiscal 2019 early fiscal 2020 as a result of this decision approximately 4 5 million will be spent on return on investment capital expenditures towards new equipment and leasehold improvements this fiscal year after a thorough analysis of our canadian footprint the company concluded that plant specialization would be the most efficient approach to reduce costs and respond to industry growth this analysis determined that the st honoré de shenley bottling facility should be re purposed to focus on the production of industrial products and the reception and storage of maple syrup barrels the bottling production at this facility is being re distributed to our granby or degelis operations granby will focus on plastic bottling production while degelis will primarily produce glass bottles and cans the transfer of production is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter to support this plan approximately 1 8 million will be invested in degelis to increase capacity of its bottling lines increase automation and enhance site storage and logistics the degelis investment provides an attractive return the investment should be completed by the end of march 2019 once the optimization project is fully executed the new manufacturing footprint will double our capacity lower our costs and improve our overall manufacturing capabilities allowing us to participate fully in the maple syrup market growth each of the three quebec facilities will continue to receive and store maple syrup barrels no changes are expected in our vermont facility with the optimization project behind us we continue to expect that the maple products segment adjusted ebitda for fiscal 2019 should be approximately 21 0 million excluding non recurring costs of approximately 1 1 million non recurring costs are mostly attributable to lease payments for two locations moving costs severance costs and other additional miscellaneous costs management remains positive on the future outlook for this segment as the maple syrup market growth remains strong as such with a sales team that is now fully organized and a clear operational path forward we are confident that we are well positioned to capture and participate in the market growth in addition operational savings are expected in fiscal 2020 from the move to a new granby facility as well as the transfer of production from st honoré de shenley for the board of directors dallas h ross chairman vancouver british columbia january 31 2019 management s discussion analysis this management s discussion and analysis md a of rogers sugar inc s rogers rsi or the company dated january 31 2019 should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated interim

referred to as lbmt or the maple products segment management is responsible for preparing the md a this md a has been reviewed and approved by the audit committee of rogers and its board of directors adjusted results in the normal course of business the company uses derivative financial instruments consisting of sugar futures foreign exchange forward contracts natural gas futures and interest rate swaps for fiscal 2016 and prior years all derivative financial instruments were marked to market at each reporting date with the unrealized gains losses charged to the consolidated statement of earnings as of october 2 2016 the company adopted all the requirements of ifrs 9 2014 financial instruments as a result the company has designated as effective hedging instruments its natural gas futures and its interest rate swap agreements entered into in order to protect itself against natural gas price and interest rate fluctuations as cash flow hedges derivative financial instruments pertaining to sugar futures and foreign exchange forward contracts continue to be marked to market at each reporting date and are charged to the consolidated statement of earnings in addition the derivative financial instruments pertaining to foreign exchange forward contracts on maple syrup sales were marked to market as at december 29 2018 and also charged to the consolidated statement of earnings the unrealized gains losses related to natural gas futures and interest rate swaps are accounted for in other comprehensive income the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is removed and included in net earnings under the same line item in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income as the hedged item in the same period that the hedged cash flows affect net earnings reducing earnings volatility related to the movements of the valuation of these derivatives hedging instruments the transitional marked to market balances outstanding as of october 1 2016 will be amortized over time based on their settlements until all existing natural gas futures and all existing interest rate swaps agreements have expired the company sells refined sugar to some clients in u s dollars prior to october 1 2016 these sales contracts were viewed as having an embedded derivative if the functional currency of the customer was not u s dollars the embedded derivative being the source currency of the transaction the embedded derivatives were marked to market at each reporting date with the unrealized gains losses charged to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of earnings with a corresponding offsetting amount charged to the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of october 2 2016 the u s dollars of these sales contract were no longer considered as being an embedded derivative as it was determined that the u s dollar is commonly used in canada this change in estimate was applied prospectively as a result only the embedded derivatives relating to sales contracts outstanding as of october 1 2016 continued to be marked to market every quarter until all the volume on these contracts has been delivered as at december 29 2018 there were no embedded derivatives on sales contracts outstanding from the october 1 2016 balance management believes that the company s financial results are more meaningful to management investors analysts and any other interested parties when financial results are adjusted by the gains losses from financial derivative instruments and from embedded derivatives these adjusted financial results provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business this measurement is a non gaap measurement see non gaap measures section management uses the non gaap adjusted results of the operating company to measure and to evaluate the performance of the business through its adjusted gross margin adjusted ebit and adjusted net earnings in addition management believes that these measures are important to our investors and parties evaluating our performance and comparing such performance to past results management also uses adjusted gross margin adjusted ebitda maple products segment adjusted ebitda adjusted ebit and adjusted net earnings when discussing results with the board of directors analysts investors banks and other interested parties

differences as a result of mark to market gains or losses are recognized by the company only when sugar or maple products are sold to a customer the gains or losses on sugar and related foreign exchange paper transactions are largely offset by corresponding gains or losses from the physical transactions namely sale and purchase contracts with customers and suppliers see non gaap measures section as previously mentioned starting on october 2 2016 natural gas futures were designated as an effective cash flow hedging instrument and as a result mark to market adjustments are now recorded in other comprehensive income the transitional balances representing the mark to market value recorded as of october 1 2016 will be subsequently removed from other comprehensive income when the natural gas futures will be liquidated in other words when the natural gas is used as a result in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the company removed a gain of 0 4 million from other comprehensive income and recorded a gain of the same amount in cost of sales the transitional balance relating to natural gas futures will be fully depleted in fiscal 2020 see non gaap measures section the above described adjustments are added or deducted to the mark to market results to arrive at the total adjustment to cost of sales for the first quarter of the current year the total cost of sales adjustment is a loss of 2 5 million to be added to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim operating results versus a gain of 5 8 million to be deducted to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim results for the comparable quarter last year see non gaap measures section segmented information the company has two distinct segments namely refined sugar and by products together referred to

year the decrease in revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 is mainly explained by a decrease in the weighted average raw sugar values in the current fiscal year which more than offset the benefits of the increase in sales volume during the first quarter the industrial market segment increased by approximately 5 900 metric tonnes when compared to the same quarter last

revenues for the current quarter amounted to 206 0 million an increase of 1 1 million versus last year s comparable period as explained above the company benefited from a full quarter of revenues generated by decacer in fiscal 2019 as opposed to 6 weeks in fiscal 2018 however this positive variation was reduced by lower revenues in the sugar segment whereby the increase in volume was more than offset by lower 11 raw sugar values in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 gross margin gross margin of 34 5 million for the first quarter of the current fiscal year does not reflect the economic margin of the company as it includes a loss of 2 5 million for the mark to market of derivative financial instruments as explained above see adjusted results section in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 a mark to market gain of 5 8 million was recorded resulting in a gross margin of 43 1 million excluding the mark to market of derivative financial instruments adjusted gross margin amounted to 37 0 million compared to 37 3 million last year a decrease of 0 3 million the maple products segment contributed an additional 1 7 million versus last year mainly due to the impact of decacer as well as an increase in net selling price and savings from procurement initiatives as mentioned above however this favorable variance was more than offset by a reduction of 2 0 million from the sugar segment mainly explained by a lower 11 raw sugar values and incremental operating costs in vancouver as mentioned above results from operating activities ebit for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 ebit amounted to 23 0 million compared to 31 7 million last year as mentioned above the gross margin comparison does not reflect the economic results from operating activities which were negatively impacted by 8 3 million due to the quarter over quarter variation in mark to market of derivative financial instruments excluding the mark to market of derivative financial instruments ebit for the current quarter stood at 25 4 million a decrease of 0 4 million as mentioned above maple products segment contributed positively to the ebit as a result of a full quarter of operations for decacer an increase in adjusted gross margin and a reduction in non recurring costs of 1 2 million in fiscal 2019 this was offset by a lower contribution from the sugar segment due mainly to lower adjusted gross margin and to higher distribution costs and administrative and selling expenses in addition fiscal 2018 included a non cash pension income of 1 5 million net finance costs net finance costs consisted of interest paid under the revolving credit facility as well as interest expense on the convertible unsecured subordinated debentures and other interest it also includes a mark to market gain on the interest swap agreements the net finance costs breakdown is as follows in thousands of dollars first quarter 2019 2018 interest expense on convertible unsecured subordinated debentures 2 087 1 698 interest on revolving credit facility 1 230 1 426 amortization of deferred financing fees 294 249 other interest expense 1 129 766 net change in fair value of interest rate swap agreements 98 135 net finance costs 4 642 4 004 on march 28 2018 the fifth series 5 75 convertible unsecured subordinated debentures fifth series debentures of 60 0 million was repaid using a portion of the funds raised on the same day from the issuance of the seventh series 4 75 convertible unsecured subordinated debentures seventh series debentures of 97 8 million the increased borrowing level from the seventh series debentures more than offset the reduction in interest rate which mainly explains the increase of 0 4 million in interest expense on the convertible unsecured subordinated debentures in the first quarter in addition accretion expense on the equity component of the convertible unsecured subordinated debentures also had a negative impact versus last year the decrease in interest on the revolving credit facility is due mainly to a decrease in the average drawdown during the current quarter as compared to the same period last year which was somewhat tempered by an increase in interest rate the other interest expense pertains mainly to interest payable to the federation des producteurs acéricoles du québec fpaq on syrup purchases in accordance with the fpaq payment terms the increase quarter over quarter is due to the level of syrup purchases as well as an increase in interest rate starting on october 2 2016 interest rate swap agreements were designated as effective cash flow hedging instruments and as a result mark to market adjustments are now recorded in other comprehensive income the transitional balances representing the mark to market value recorded as of october 1 2016 will be subsequently removed from other comprehensive income when each of the fixed interest rate tranches will be liquidated in other words when the fixed interest rate is paid as a result the company removed a gain of 0 1 million for the current quarter and the comparative period from other comprehensive income and recorded a gain of the same amount in net finance costs the transitional balance relating to interest rate swap agreements will be fully depleted in fiscal 2020 see adjusted results section taxation the income tax expense is as follows in thousands of dollars first quarter 2019 2018 current 6 260 5 761 deferred 1 331 1 704 income tax expense 4 929 7 465 the variation in current and deferred tax expense quarter over quarter is consistent with the variation in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2019 deferred income taxes reflect temporary differences which result primarily from the difference between depreciation claimed for tax purposes and depreciation amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes employee future benefits and derivative financial instruments deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates anticipated to apply to income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be realized or reversed the effect of a change in income tax rates on future income taxes is recognized in income in the period in which the change occurs net earnings net earnings for the first quarter were 13 4 million compared to 20 2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the decrease in net earnings is mostly explained by a loss on the mark to market of derivative financial instruments as well as a negative impact of the after tax impact of a decrease in ebit and the additional finance costs as explained above summary of quarterly results the following is a summary of selected financial information of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial

segment only historically the first quarter october to december of the fiscal year is the best quarter of the sugar segment for adjusted gross margins and adjusted net earnings due to the favourable sales mix associated with an increased proportion of consumer sales during that period of the year at the same time the second quarter january to march historically has the lowest volume as well as an unfavourable customer mix resulting in lower revenues adjusted gross margins and adjusted net earnings quarterly results reflect the lbmtc acquisition on august 5 2017 and the acquisition of decacer on november 18 2017 liquidity cash flow generated by lantic is paid to rogers by way of dividends and return of capital on the common shares and by the payment of interest on the subordinated notes of lantic held by rogers after taking a reasonable reserve for capital expenditures debt reimbursement and working capital the cash received by rogers is used to pay administrative expenses interest on

changes in exchange rate on cash 319 68 net increase decrease in cash 5 393 7 949 net cash flow from operating activities was positive 1 0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to negative 10 8 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2018 resulting in a positive variance of 11 8 million the positive variance is mainly explained by a positive non cash working capital variation of 12 1 million mainly due to the movement in trade and other payables offset by the movement in trade and other receivables cash flow from financing activities decreased for the current quarter from 47 9 million to 7 3 million a reduction of 40 6 million overall during the current quarter total borrowings were 35 5 million less than last year s comparable quarter further contributing to the negative variance is a decrease in bank overdraft during the current quarter of 5 2 million the cash outflow used in investing activities decreased compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by 41 9 million mainly explained by the acquisition of decacer in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 for 42 1 million somewhat offset by additional property plant and equipment and intangible assets spending during the current quarter in order to provide additional information the company believes it is appropriate to measure free cash flow that is generated by the operations of the company free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations excluding changes in non cash working capital mark to market and derivative timing adjustments amortization of transitional balances financial instruments non cash amount and includes funds received or paid from the issue or purchase of shares deferred financing charges paid and capital expenditures net of operational excellence capital expenditures free cash flow is a non gaap measure free cash flow is as follows in thousands of dollars rolling twelve months 2019 2018 net cash flow from operating activities 60 893 60 571 adjustments

charges 150 751 free cash flow 1 46 377 43 335 declared dividends 37 902 35 953 1 see non gaap measures section free cash flow on a rolling twelve month basis was 46 4 million which represents an increase of 3 0 million versus the comparable period last year the variation is mainly explained by an increase in adjusted ebit of 13 3 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization expenses and lower financing charges paid of 0 6 million this positive variation was somewhat offset by 4 0 million paid to purchase and cancel common shares as opposed to 0 1 million received to issue shares in the prior comparative period also reducing the positive variance is an increase in interest and income taxes paid of 4 3 million and 1 8 million respectively as well as higher pension contributions and capital and intangible assets spending net of operational excellence capital expenditure of 0 4 million each capital and intangible assets expenditures net of operational excellence expenditures were comparable to last year s rolling twelve months operational excellence capital expenditures were 0 2 million higher when compared to the same period last year free cash flow is not reduced by operational excellence capital expenditures as these projects are not necessary for the operation of the plants but are undertaken because of the substantial operational savings that are realized once the projects are completed financing charges are paid when a new debt financing is completed and such charges are deferred and amortized over the term of that debt the cash used in the year to pay for such fees is therefore not available and as a result is deducted from free cash flow the company declared a quarterly dividend of 9 0 cents per common share every quarter totalling 0 36 cents for both trailing twelve months periods the increase in 2019 versus the comparable period is due to the issuance of shares in july 2017 which increased the dividend payment starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 changes in non cash operating working capital represent year over year movements in current assets such as accounts receivable and inventories and current liabilities such as accounts payables movements in these accounts are due mainly to timing in the collection of receivables receipts of raw sugar and payment of liabilities increases or decreases in such accounts are due to timing issues and therefore do not constitute free cash flow such increases or decreases are financed from available cash or from the company s available credit facility of 265 0 million increases or decreases in bank indebtedness are also due to timing issues from the above and therefore do not constitute available free cash flow the combined impact of the mark to market and derivative timing adjustments amortization of transitional balances and financial instruments non cash negative amount of 3 2 million for the current rolling twelve months does not represent cash items as these contracts will be settled when the physical transactions occur which is the reason for the adjustment to free cash flow contractual obligations there are no significant changes in the contractual obligations table disclosed in the management s discussion and analysis of the september 29 2018 annual report as at december 29 2018 lantic had commitments to purchase a total of 1 337 000 metric tonnes of raw sugar of which 328 000 metric tonnes had been priced for a total dollar commitment of 134 7 million capital resources the company has a total of 265 0 million of available working capital from which it can borrow at prime rate libor rate or under bankers acceptances plus 20 to 250 basis points based on achieving certain financial ratios as at december 29 2018 a total of 393 1 million have been pledged as security for the revolving credit facility compared to 390 4 million as at december 30 2017 including trade receivables inventories and property plant and equipment at december 28 2018 194 0 million had been drawn from the working capital facility 0 2 million was drawn as bank overdraft and 7 5 million in cash was also available cash requirements for working capital and other capital expenditures are expected to be paid from available cash resources and funds generated from operations management believes that the unused credit under the revolving facility is adequate to meet any future cash requirements outstanding securities a total of 105 008 070 shares were outstanding as at december 28 2018 and january 31 2019 105 743 582 as at december 30 2017 on

discussed in the management s discussion and analysis of our annual report for the year ended september 29 2018 this document is available on sedar at www sedar com or on our website at www lanticrogers com outlook sugar in light of the first quarter result the industrial sugar market segment is now expected to slightly increase when compared to fiscal 2018 in the first quarter the company was able to gain additional business with an existing consumer account and as a result we anticipate this segment should increase by approximately 5 000 metric tonne over last fiscal year the company also acquired new liquid business during the past quarter as a result of the acquisition of a new account and the conversion of hfcs users to liquid sucrose this additional volume combined with the first quarter improvement over last year should result in an increase of approximately 15 000 metric tonne when compared to fiscal 2018 as for the export segment the total volume is anticipated to be comparable to last fiscal year as additional sales to mexico will offset lower than expected high tier duty sales to the u s the company will continue to aggressively pursue any additional export sales that would be beneficial to the overall results it is also worth commenting that the company does not anticipate that the additional canada specific quota of 9 600 metric tonnes granted under the united states mexico canada agreement usmca would take effect in fiscal 2019 and therefore should not have any impact on the overall export volume for this year as a result of the increase in volume in most segments we now expect our overall volume to be approximately 25 000 metric tonne above last fiscal year in light of the additional volume as well as the first quarter result we expect that distribution costs should be approximately 1 0 million higher than fiscal 2018 approximately 65 of fiscal 2019 s natural gas requirements have been hedged at average prices comparable to those realized in fiscal 2018 some futures positions for fiscal 2020 to 2024 have also been taken some of these positions are at prices higher than current market value but are at the same or better levels than those achieved in fiscal 2018 consistent with prior communications the sugar segment s capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are expected to increase compared to fiscal 2018 as the company will undertake the capital project in taber to be fully compliant with air emission standards by fiscal 2020 with spending ranging between 6 5 million and 8 5 million left to be spent on this specific project this year as approximately 1 5 million was spent in fiscal 2018 the remaining capital spend for the sugar segment is expected to be similar to fiscal 2018 including a high proportion of return on investment capital expenditures the beet slicing campaign is expected to be completed in late february if no significant beet storage issues arise we expect that the current crop should derive approximately 125 000 metric tonnes of refined sugar which is comparable to fiscal 2018 s production volume maple products during the quarter the company completed its second phase of the footprint optimization analysis the first phase of the project was announced last fiscal year with the relocation from the current leased bottling facility in granby québec to a new built for purpose state of the art leased property this move will allow us to better align production flow and install a new high capacity bottling line the completion of the first phase is expected to occur at the end of fiscal 2019 early fiscal 2020 as a result of this decision approximately 4 5 million will be spent on return on investment capital expenditures towards new equipment and leasehold improvements this fiscal year after a thorough analysis of our canadian footprint the company concluded that plant specialization would be the most efficient approach to reduce costs and respond to industry growth this analysis determined that the st honoré de shenley bottling facility should be re purposed to focus on the production of industrial products and the reception and storage of maple syrup barrels the bottling production at this facility is being re distributed to our granby or degelis operations granby will focus on plastic bottling production while degelis will primarily produce glass bottles and cans the transfer of production is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter to support this plan approximately 1 8 million will be invested in degelis to increase capacity of its bottling lines increase automation and enhance site storage and logistics the degelis investment provides an attractive return the investment should be completed by the end of march 2019 once the optimization project is fully executed the new manufacturing footprint will double our capacity lower our costs and improve our overall manufacturing capabilities allowing us to participate fully in the maple syrup market growth each of the three quebec facilities will continue to receive and store maple syrup barrels no changes are expected in our vermont facility with the optimization project behind us we continue to expect that the maple products segment adjusted ebitda for fiscal 2019 should be approximately 21 0 million excluding non recurring costs of approximately 1 1 million non recurring costs are mostly attributable to lease payments for two locations moving costs severance costs and other additional miscellaneous costs management remains positive on the future outlook for this segment as the maple syrup market growth remains strong as such with a sales team that is now fully organized and a clear operational path forward we are confident that we are

by howard schneider and jason lange washington reuters the federal reserve on wednesday signalled its three year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the u s economy due to global headwinds and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations as it held interest rates steady the u s central bank also discarded its promises of further gradual increases in interest rates and said it would be patient before making any further moves fed chairman jerome powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks with neither rising inflation or financial stability considered a risk and cross currents including slowing growth overseas and the self inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the u s outlook less certain we are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong u s macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross currents common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity powell told reporters after the end of a two day policy meeting continued u s economic growth was still the likeliest outcome powell said but was now less certain than a month ago when the fed said the economy was just as likely to grow faster than expected as it was to face a sharp downturn combined with comments that the fed s balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected the fed s meeting this week may mark a somewhat anticlimactic end to its years long battle to normalise monetary policy after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession the current fed policy rate of between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent is well below historical averages and if it goes no higher the fed will have little room to battle any future downturn with rate cuts alone it may also raise questions about whether the fed s shifting stance until recently powell and other officials said monetary policy was unnecessarily loose is a response to pressure from volatile financial markets or president donald trump trump has repeatedly attacked the fed for raising rates arguing that it was undercutting economic growth powell took advantage of a new regimen of press conferences after every policy meeting to lay out the series of touchy changes and insist the fed was only reacting to economic data not other pressures he termed the fed s new posture one of wait and see not necessarily a hard stop on rate increases but he also made clear the central bank is no longer in any rush after raising rates almost every quarter during the past two years and that absent some threatening rebound of inflation or evidence of risky financial behaviour the pause would likely last taken together with the balance sheet announcement the fed s statement gives maximum flexibility to a central bank criticized by investors who saw the fed itself becoming a source of market turbulence that was reflexively tightening policy even as economic risks mounted this marks a full 180 from what the fed was signalling just a few months ago said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz in newport beach california after the release of the fed s statement u s stocks added to gains with the s p 500 index ending the day about 1 5 percent higher while the dollar and short term yields fell as investors gauged an even lower probability of additional rate hikes any time soon market expectations of future rates fell further contracts tied to the fed s policy rate continued to price about a one in four chance of a hike in 2019 and contracts maturing in 2020 were signalling a small but rising chance of a rate cut then cloudier outlook the fed raised rates four times last year including in december when it signalled it would do so twice more this year the economic outlook however has become more clouded as a result of recent volatility in financial markets and signs that growth is slowing overseas including in china and the euro zone there are also ongoing concerns about the impact of global trade tensions and fears the recent 35 day partial shutdown of the u s government over a budget dispute may crimp consumer spending in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient in determining future rate hikes the fed s rate setting committee said in its policy statement the fed made no change to the 50 billion maximum monthly runoff of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities from its balance sheet some traders have urged it to slow or halt its pullback from the bond markets at least for now in a separate statement the fed said it had decided to continue managing policy with a system of ample reserves reinforcing the notion that the rundown may end sooner than expected overall this signals the fed will not be on autopilot going forward said justin lederer treasury analyst at cantor fitzgerald in new york the downgrade in the fed s language around rate increases included a change in its description of economic growth from strong to solid and it noted that market based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months the fed s policy decision was unanimous reporting by howard schneider and jason lange additional reporting by jonathan spicer editing by paul simao
nokia corporation financial statement release january 31 2019 at 08 00 cet 1 nokia corporation financial report for q4 and full year 2018 nokia delivers strong growth and improved profitability in q4 strategic momentum in software and enterprise board of directors plans to propose a dividend of eur 0 20 per share for 2018 up 5 compared to eur 0 19 for 2017 this is a summary of the nokia corporation financial report for q4 and full year 2018 published today the complete financial report for q4 and full year 2018 with tables is available at www nokia com financials investors should not rely on summaries of our financial reports only but should review the complete financial reports with tables rajeev suri president and ceo on q4 2018 results nokia ended the year with a strong fourth quarter we saw the second consecutive quarter of year on year sales growth across all five of our networks business groups as well as improved profitability in both networks and nokia technologies the execution of our strategy also proceeded well with the work we have put into building a solid foundation for nokia software showing clear results and our enterprise business rapidly becoming a pillar of growth looking forward i expect nokia s performance to strengthen for the full year 2019 versus 2018 and our view of a fast and meaningful shift to 5g remains unchanged given that 5g rollouts will be staggered over the course of the year we expect 2019 to have a soft first half followed by a much more robust second half over the longer term we expect a virtuous cycle of investment where operators update their networks across multiple domains from optical to macro radio fixed wireless access to cloud core small cells to ip routing network agnostic software and more following this we expect a second wave where industrial customers will invest in private wireless technology including lte and 5g ready networks with our end to end portfolio nokia is well positioned to tap this extended cycle q4 and january december 2018 reported and non ifrs results refer to note 1 basis of preparation note 2 non ifrs to reported reconciliation and note 15 performance measures in the

sales in q4 2018 were eur 6 9bn compared to eur 6 7bn in q4 2017 net sales grew by 3 year on year on both a reported and constant currency basis our robust topline performance reflects the strong competitiveness across our portfolio and that our strategy execution is tracking well we maintained good momentum with strong 5g customer engagement in all key markets particularly strong performance in nokia software and solid performance in our enterprise business non ifrs diluted eps in q4 2018 was eur 0 13 compared to eur 0 13 in q4 2017 particularly strong execution in q4 enabled us to achieve our full year 2018 operational guidance with year on year operating profit growth in networks as well as in nokia technologies on a recurring basis non ifrs diluted eps increased by eur 0 02 year on year on a recurring basis driven by our gross profit performance and continued operating expense reduction partially offset by foreign exchange hedging and higher income tax expenses reported diluted eps in q4 2018 was eur 0 03 compared to negative eur 0 07 in q4 2017 primarily driven by lower income tax expenses and our gross profit performance partially offset by lower one time licensing net sales foreign exchange hedging and higher financial expenses in q4 2018 net cash and current financial investments increased sequentially by approximately eur 1 2bn and we ended 2018 with a strong financial position in q4 2018 net cash from operating activities benefitted from strong seasonality and positive changes in net working capital consequently recurring free cash flow for full year 2018 was slightly negative annual distribution to shareholders the dividend to shareholders is nokia s principal method of distributing earnings to shareholders over the long term nokia targets to deliver an earnings based growing dividend by distributing approximately 40 to 70 of non ifrs diluted eps taking into account nokia s cash position and expected cash flow generation beginning with the distribution for 2018 nokia plans to pay dividends in quarterly installments in addition nokia intends to implement a dividend fee for american depository receipt adr holders for 2018 nokia s board of directors plans to propose that the annual general meeting in 2019 authorizes the board to resolve on the maximum annual distribution of eur 0 20 per share compared to eur 0 19 for 2017 to be paid quarterly during the authorization period unless the board decides otherwise for a justified reason the board would make separate resolutions on each distribution and such resolutions would be separately disclosed following the annual general meeting 2019 and in connection with our financial reports for q2 q3 and q4 the annual distribution would be paid as quarterly dividends from retained earnings and or assets from the fund for invested unrestricted equity at the end of 2018 the distributable funds on the statement of financial position of the parent company amounted to eur 17 393 million including eur 15 197 million of invested unrestricted equity the board proposal to the annual general meeting will be published in connection with other proposals later in the spring new financial reporting structure beginning q1 2019 nokia announced organizational changes to accelerate its strategy execution on october 25 november 22 and december 31 2018 nokia will revise its financial reporting structure to better reflect its strategy organizational structure and the way it evaluates operational performance and allocates resources as of the first quarter 2019 nokia will have three reportable segments i networks ii nokia software and iii nokia technologies in addition nokia will disclose segment level data for group common and other for each reportable segment nokia will provide detailed financial disclosure including net sales and operating profit additionally nokia will provide adjusted financial disclosure for its networks and nokia software reportable segments with amounts related to nokia technologies and nokia bell labs allocated 85 to networks and 15 to nokia software this is also in accordance with industry practice and improves comparability with peer companies in addition nokia will provide net sales disclosure for the following businesses i mobile access ii fixed access iii ip routing and iv optical networks which together comprise the new networks reportable segment nokia will also provide separate net sales disclosure for its different customer types i communication service providers ii enterprises and iii licensees net sales by region will be provided at the nokia level to provide a basis for comparison nokia will present a recasting of financial results on an unaudited basis for all four quarters of 2018 prior to publishing its q1 2019 financial report note that certain reclassifications will be made in order to reflect the new organizational structure of the company the most significant of which are i activities related to our cloud core offering will be reclassified from the former mobile networks business group and former global services reportable segment to the new nokia software reportable segment and ii activities related to the former mobile networks business group and former global services reportable segment that are not reclassified to the new nokia software reportable segment will be reported together under the new mobile access business outlook we are now providing guidance at the nokia level in alignment with how we manage our business this is also intended to improve comparability with

of nokia s outlook net sales and operating margin for networks and nokia software are expected to be influenced by factors including our expectation that we will outperform our primary addressable market in full year 2019 and over the longer term driven by our strategy which includes competing in 5g more effectively due to our strong end to end portfolio focusing on targeted growth opportunities in attractive adjacent markets and building a strong network agnostic software business on a constant currency basis we expect our primary addressable market to be flattish in full year 2019 this is an update to earlier commentary for growth and to grow in full year 2020 and to grow in full year 2020 the timing of completions and acceptances of certain projects particularly related to 5g based on the evolving readiness of the 5g ecosystem and the staggered nature of 5g rollouts in lead countries we expect full year 2019 to follow a similar pattern as full year 2018 a soft first half followed by a robust second half with a particularly weak q1 new commentary our expectation that we will improve our r d productivity and reduce support function costs through the successful execution of our cost savings program potential mergers or acquisitions by our customers our product and regional mix and macroeconomic industry and competitive dynamics net sales and operating margin for nokia technologies is expected to be influenced by factors including the timing and value of new and existing patent licensing agreements with smartphone vendors automotive companies and consumer electronics companies results in brand and technology licensing costs to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and the regulatory landscape additionally our outlook is based on the following assumptions nokia s recurring free cash flow is expected to improve over the longer term due to lower cash outflows related to restructuring and network equipment swaps and improved operational results over time non ifrs financial income and expenses to be an expense of approximately eur 300 million in full year 2019 and over the longer term non ifrs income taxes at a rate of

2017 of one time licensing net sales grew by 6 year on year with growth across all five of our networks business groups as well as in nokia technologies driven by particularly strong execution in our networks business our order backlog was strong at the end of q4 2018 and we continue to see strong customer engagement related to 5g across multiple parts of our portfolio including radio cloud core transport ip routing and network agnostic software we continued to build momentum in our end to end strategy including good performance converting our sales pipeline into net sales at the end of q4 2018 approximately 41 of our sales pipeline was comprised of cross business group deals we also made progress with our strategy to diversify and grow with particularly strong performance in nokia software and continued solid performance in our enterprise business in our networks business higher operating expenses were due to customer trials related to 5g as well as higher pre sales expenses to drive future growth and higher returns partially offset by the benefits from our cost savings program and lower incentive accruals in nokia technologies the decrease in net sales on a year on year basis was primarily due to lower one time licensing net sales on a recurring basis we maintained our strong track record with 11 year on year growth also we continued to make good progress in patent licensing extending our patent licensing agreement with samsung and signing a new patent license agreement with oppo further validating our global licensing program nokia non ifrs diluted eps amounted to eur 0 13 compared to eur 0 13 in the year ago period non ifrs diluted eps increased by eur 0 02 year on year on a recurring basis the increase in non ifrs diluted eps on a recurring basis was primarily driven by higher gross profit across all three reportable segments of our networks business and improved recurring gross profit performance in nokia technologies as well as lower operating expenses in nokia technologies partially offset by a net negative fluctuation in other income and expense related to foreign exchange hedging higher income tax expenses and higher financial expenses nokia reported diluted eps amounted to eur 0 03 compared to negative eur 0 07 in the year ago period primarily driven by lower income tax expenses related to the re measurement of deferred tax assets which resulted in deferred tax expenses and allowances of eur 143 million compared to eur 738 million in the fourth quarter 2017 in addition nokia reported diluted eps was driven by higher gross profit across all three reportable segments of our networks business and improved recurring gross profit performance in nokia technologies partially offset by a net negative fluctuation in other income and expense related to foreign exchange hedging and higher financial expenses nokia january december 2018 compared to january december 2017 nokia reported net sales decreased 3 year on year on

strategy to diversify and grow with continued strong performance in both our enterprise business and in nokia software in nokia technologies the decrease in net sales on a year on year basis was primarily due to lower one time licensing net sales on a recurring basis we maintained our strong track record with 11 year on year growth also we continued to make good progress in patent licensing extending our patent licensing agreement with samsung and signing a new patent license agreement with oppo further validating our global licensing program nokia reported operating loss amounted to eur 59 million compared to an operating profit of eur 16 million in the year ago period this was primarily driven by lower gross profit across all three reportable segments in our networks business lower one time licensing net sales in nokia technologies and a negative impact from foreign exchange hedging this was partially offset by lower restructuring and associated charges and lower impairment of assets nokia reported diluted eps amounted to negative eur 0 10 compared to negative eur 0 26 in the year ago period this was primarily driven by lower income tax expenses related to the re measurement of deferred tax assets which resulted in deferred tax expenses and allowances of eur 155 million compared to eur 815 million in full year 2017 in addition nokia reported diluted eps was driven by the absence of expenses related to the early redemption of debt partially offset by lower gross profit across all three reportable segments in our networks business lower restructuring and

based on management s current expectations or beliefs actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements slide 2 of our earnings release presentation includes important information regarding previous sec filings and reconciliation of non gaap measures jonas prising chairman chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks jack revenue in the fourth quarter came in at 5 4 billion a decrease of 1 in constant currency on a same day basis our underlying organic constant currency revenue decreased by 3 the weaker revenue performance is primarily attributable to our businesses in europe which continued to slow through the fourth quarter partially offsetting revenues decline in europe with strong revenue growth in apme and within portions of the americas specifically in latin america and canada operating profit for the fourth quarter was 218 million down 4 in constant currency operating profit margin came in at 4 down 20 basis points from the prior year our performance in the quarter reflects stronger than expected gross profit margin of 16 3 which represents a 30 basis points decrease from the prior year we continued to manage sg a well in the quarter and continued to take appropriate management actions in view of the softer revenue trends earnings per share for the quarter was 2 54 this was a decrease of 18 in constant currency year over year but it actually reflected 25 growth in constant currency compared to the prior year if you exclude the us tax reform related gains that we experienced in the prior year period turning to the full year results for a few moments earnings per share for the year was 8 56 this represented a constant currency increase of 5 over the prior year and an increase of 22 in constant currency excluding the one time benefit of tax reform in the prior year revenues for the year increased 2 in constant currency to 22 billion and operating profit was 797 million which was flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis advertisement advertisement our fourth quarter results continue to reflect the more challenging market environment especially in europe we experienced declining revenue trends across a number of our european businesses notably in france italy and germany among our larger businesses we re applying strong pricing discipline and are very focused on improved productivity and executing cost mitigation actions in countries experiencing a softening environment at the same time we continue to add resources in markets that provide us with opportunities for profitable growth and invest in our technology initiatives in various countries across the world we participated in the world economic forum in davos last week and as you can imagine the outlook for the european economy was a prominent topic of discussion as was the topic of access to human capital and skills we led many discussions on workforce trends and the impact of ai and technology on the workforce we also shared our latest thought leadership research which generated significant discussion this included the latest research in skills revolution series providing a real time view of the impact of technology on job growth called humans wanted robots need you contrary to media headlines this research shows that organizations that are automating tasks are hiring more people creating more jobs and upskilling their people to perform new and complementary roles to those done by machines augmenting human capability more than replacing it we also launched manpowergroup solutions total workforce index at davos sharing our new digital evolution pathway assessment tool and promoting experience tech academy alongside other workforce solutions for me the biggest takeaway from davos is that despite concerns around lower growth outlook in some parts of the world the importance of the workforce strategy and access to skilled talent is top of mind for most companies our strong manpowergroup value proposition remains highly relevant in this environment as we can support companies execution of the business strategies with our leading global workforce solutions wherever they are we know the skills revolution is in full flow and we have an important opportunity and role to play in solving the talent shortage for companies by upskilling and reskilling people for them to stay employable today and in the future turning back to our digital transformation we have previously discussed many of the technology initiatives we have implemented over the past years and continue to advance our investments in technology is core to our strategy of maintaining our leadership and workforce solutions and enabling our teams to help clients and candidates win through better data insights and innovative delivery models 2018 was a year of significant investment and progress in advancing our digital capabilities 2019 will be no different as we continue implementing world class front office systems cloud based and mobile applications as well as other enhancements to our global technology infrastructure across a number of our markets we re also investing in the digitalization of our workforce solutions offerings to ensure our clients have access to the best class workforce analytics and tools advertisement advertisement and with that i would like to turn it over to jack to provide additional financial information and a review of our segment results and our first quarter outlook jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jonas turning back to fourth quarter results as jonas as mentioned we experienced a challenging revenue environment in the fourth quarter operating profit declined 4 on a constant currency basis this performance resulted in an operating profit margin of 4 which exceeded our guidance range a revenue decline of 1 in constant currency came in at the lower end of our constant currency guidance range our gross profit margin declined 30 basis points year over year which also exceeded our guidance range as we experienced favorable direct cost accrual adjustments particularly in france during the quarter our sg a was well managed during the quarter and included a benefit from a gain on disposition of a non core business which i ll cover in more detail advertisement advertisement breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail our reported revenue decline of 4 includes the negative currency impact on a constant currency basis our revenue decline was 1 acquisitions contributed about 20 basis points to our growth rate in the quarter and as we had an extra billing day the organic constant currency days adjusted revenue decline was 2 the revenue decline was primarily driven by various businesses in europe most notably in france germany and the netherlands i will discuss this further in the segment review s turning to the epf bridge on a reported basis earnings per share was 2 54 starting with our guidance eps midpoint of 2 19 improved operational performance contributed 0 12 driven by france we sold our non core language translation business in the netherlands during the quarter which resulted in a gain of 8 million which contributed 0 10 the other income expenses contributed 0 9 as equity pickup losses on investments related to our past ownership interests in our switzerland franchise we re more than offset by other foreign currency adjustments and non controlling interest income related to our china joint venture foreign currency translation impact was 0 06 worse than the estimated in guidance a lower effective tax rate contributed 0 04 and lower weighted average shares resulting from repurchases during the quarter contributed 0 06 looking at our gross profit margin in detail our gross margin came in at 16 3 staffing interim margin declines drove the 30 basis points reduction in the overall gross margin year over year although we experienced a loss of cice subsidy in france for the month of december as expected which represented 30 basis points of margin at the consolidated level this was largely offset by favorable direct cost adjustments in france the remaining 30 basis point decline represented the underlying gross profit margin trend in the fourth quarter advertisement advertisement next let s review our gross profit by business line during the quarter the manpower brand comprised 63 of gross profit our experienced professional business comprised 20 manpowergroup solutions comprise 14 and right management 3 during the quarter our manpower brand reported a 4 decrease in gross profit on a constant currency basis this represents a decrease from the 1 constant currency growth rate in the third quarter this was driven by declines in germany the uk the us the netherlands sweden italy and spain among our larger countries within our manpower brand approximately 60 of the gross profit is derived from light industrial skills and 40 is derived from office and clerical skills gross profit from staffing within light industrial skills decreased during the quarter while office in clerical skills experienced a slight increase in the rate of growth in the quarter gross profit in our experienced brand decrease 1 on a constant currency basis year over year this represented a decrease from the flat constant currency growth rate achieved in the third quarter the decrease was primarily driven by the netherlands sweden and australia manpowergroup solutions includes our global market leading rpo and msp offerings as well as talent based outsourcing solutions including proservia our european it infrastructure and end user support business msp offerings as well as talent based outsourcing solutions including serbia ph our european it infrastructure and end user support business gross profit growth in the quarter was up 2 in constant currency which represents a decrease from the 8 constant currency growth rate achieved in the third quarter driven by lower rpo and proservia activity which was partially offset by strong msp activity in the quarter our pipeline for rpo and msp opportunities is strong into 2019 while management experienced a decline in gross profit of 5 in constant currency during the quarter as our outplacement activity continued to decline this represents an improvement from the 8 constant currency decline experienced in the third quarter i will comment further on right management in my segment review sga expense was 662 million a decrease of 35 million from the prior year this included a year over year reduction of 22 million from currency changes 1 million increase from acquisitions a 5 million decrease from operations and a decrease of 8 million related to the gain on the sale of our language translation business in the netherlands sga expenses as a percentage of revenue in the quarter represented 12 3 and after excluding the gain on sale it represented 12 4 this result reflects our focus on operational efficiency across our businesses during a challenging revenue environment while we continue to implement new technology across a number of operations globally the americas segment comprise 19 of consolidated revenue revenue in the quarter was 1 billion representing 2 growth year over year in constant currency inaudible of 53 million represented a decrease of 3 in constant currency driven by the us which i will discuss next similarly oup margin decreased by 30 basis points year over year the us is the largest country in the americas segment comprising 61 of segment revenues revenue in the us was 632 million down 5 compared to the prior year this represented a slight decline from the 4 decrease in the third quarter during the quarter oup for our us business decreased 13 to 33 million and oup margin was 5 2 a reduction of 50 basis points from the prior year driven by the manpower business which i will discuss next within the us the manpower brand comprise 42 of gross profit during the quarter advertisement advertisement revenue for the manpower brand in the us was down 70 in the quarter which represented a decline from the third quarter trend largely due to the non recurrence of seasonal holiday activity associated with select clients although the us manpower business experience decreased holiday activity in the fourth quarter we expect to see improvement in the trend in the first quarter due to new business wins and improved trends the experis brand in the us comprise 35 of gross profit in the quarter with in experis in the us it skills comprise approximately 70 percent of the revenues during the quarter our experis revenues declined 6 from the prior year compared to the 8 decline experienced in the third quarter experis us has been very focused on profitable business and this resulted in gross profit margin expansion during the quarter experis us experienced an improved december and we expect to see continued improvement in the revenue trend in the first quarter manpowergroup solutions in the us contributed 23 of gross profit and experienced 9 revenue growth in the quarter which was an improvement from the 5 growth in the third quarter we continue to see good opportunities for growth in both our higher value msp and our rpo solutions in the us our mexico operation had 9 constant currency revenue growth in the quarter the business in mexico continue to perform well in the quarter and we expect good growth into the first quarter revenue in argentina was up 14 in constant currency which continues to reflect the impact of inflation we are operatingin argentina in a disciplined and cautious manner in view of the hyper inflationary environment as a result billable hours were down 16 year over year in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on margin and payment terms improvement due to the extended duration of the high inflationary environment we have been reducing billable hours for many quarters in argentina and the business has become less significant to the region as a result beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we will replace the separate revenue trend reporting for argentina business with our canada business which is now larger than our argentina business our canada business represented 7 of the segment revenues during the quarter and experienced a constant currency revenue growth rate of 17 in the quarter capping off a year of very strong performance revenue growth in the other countries within americas was up 17 in constant currency or 12 on an organic basis this growth was driven primarily by the very strong revenue growth in canada which i just referenced as well as solid growth in colombia brazil and peru southern europe revenue comprise 43 of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue in southern europe came in at 2 3 billion a decrease of 1 in constant currency this represented a decline from the 2 constant currency revenue growth rate in the third quarter driven by revenue declines in france italy and spain oup decreased 2 in the prior year in constant currency and oup margin decreased 10 basis points which was driven by italy italy had strong performance but was running against very high 31 percent days adjusted growth rate in the prior year period france experienced better than expected profitability which i will discuss next france revenue comprised 62 of the southern europe segment in the quarter and declined 2 from the prior year in constant currency on the billing days adjusted constant currency basis revenues declined 3 in the first three weeks of january we continue to see activity levels that reflected 2 to 3 revenue decline year over year as discussed on the previous quarters earnings call transition from cic program at the end of 2018 to the new subsidy program in january of 2019 resulted in the loss of the december cic subsidy as expected the cice related gross profit loss in the fourth quarter was offset by favorable direct cost to cool ph adjustments in the quarter this drove a better than expected level of profit in france and oup was 81 million an increase of 3 percent in constant currency and oup margin was up 30 basis points in constant currency to 5 7 permanent recruitment growth was 5 percent in constant currency during the quarter we have incorporated the current trend of a 3 days adjusted decline into our first quarter revenue guidance during the previous quarters earnings call i provided a detailed description of the anticipated impact of the new subsidy program on our france gross profit in 2019 the preliminary budget was passed as expected in december and as a result our guidance remains unchanged in summary this item is expected to result in a reduction of our gdp margin in france of about 50 basis points in the first three quarters of 2019 and beginning in the fourth quarter after the incremental inaudible subsidies are received the reduction would then represent about 15 basis points going forward similar to our successful effort in 2019 to offset a large part of the scheduled cice decrease we will again strive to offset the net impact in 2019 with ongoing initiatives revenue in italy decreased 3 in constant currency to 404 million on a billing days adjusted constant currency basis revenues declined 5 italy also experienced a non recurrence of select client holiday related activity in the fourth quarter that contributed to the revenue decline we saw another consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in the staffing gross profit margin trend in italy during the fourth quarter advertisement advertisement permanent recruitment represented 6 growth in the quarter oup margin represented 7 our italy business is performing well in a more challenging economic environment as we continue to anniversary very high growth we expect a low to mid single digit percentage revenue decline into the first quarter we continue to believe that the dignity decree legislation in italy is manageable and we do not expect this legislation to influence our revenue trend significantly in spain revenues also decreased 3 in constant currency or 5 on a billing days adjusted basis we expect spain will have a similar level of revenue performance in the first quarter our northern europe segment comprise 24 percent of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue was down 7 in constant currency to 1 3 billion this represents a decrease from the 4 constant currency decline in the third quarter primarily driven by germany the netherlands and the uk oup decreased 6 in constant currency and oup margin was flat to the prior year included within oup is the previously referenced onetime gain of 8 million related to the sale of our language translation business in the netherlands the underlying decrease in oup was driven by germany and to a lesser extent the netherlands as discussed last quarter in addition to the declining market environment our germany business has also experienced reduced revenues and incremental costs associated with technology and operational improvement initiatives our largest market in northern europe segment is the uk which represented 31 of segment revenue in the quarter uk revenues decreased 3 in constant currency and represented a 4 decrease on a billing days adjusted constant currency basis this represents a decline from the flat growth in the third quarter our manpower business in the uk experienced a 13 constant currency revenue decline in the fourth quarter which included reductions in production from large automotive clients as mentioned last quarter conversely our experis business experience another quarter of revenue improvement and improved their constant currency revenue growth rate to 16 in the fourth quarter we expect the overall revenue trend for the uk business to experience a high single digit percentage decline in revenue in the first quarter due to the reduced volume in the large automotive client and to a lesser degree reduced activity in a few other select clients revenue in germany declined 18 on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter or 21 on a billing days adjusted basis this represented a further decline from the 14 constant currency decrease in the third quarter although we made progress during the quarter advancing key initiatives which will strengthen our business in germany we continued to experience further declines in the fourth quarter market activity in germany has been very difficult to estimate and as a result our revenue guidance for the first quarter is being set at the january today trends which approximate our fourth quarter rate of decline in the nordics we experienced the 1 constant currency revenue growth during the fourth quarter or adjusted for billing days a 2 growth rate this represents an improvement from the 3 decline in the third quarter norway has been the driver of the improved revenue growth we expect norway to continue to perform well in the first quarter which will offset the soft revenue environment in sweden for the nordics overall we expect to see a similar rate of revenue growth in the first quarter revenue in the netherlands decreased 15 in constant currency on a billing days adjusted basis during the fourth quarter this representative declined from the 4 decrease in the third quarter we had anticipated a further decline in the fourth quarter as our language translation business was a fee based business the sale in december 2018 will have a modest impact on the revenue trend in the netherlands going forward we expect the first quarter revenue trend will be similar to the fourth quarter trend belgium experienced revenue growth of 1 in constant currency during the fourth quarter this represented an improvement from the billing days adjusted 1 constant currency decline in the third quarter our belgium business has been performing as expected and we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter other markets in northern europe had a revenue decline of 1 in constant currency the asia pacific middle east segment comprises 13 of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue was up 9 in constant currency to 732 million representing a decrease from the 10 growth rate in the third quarter permanent recruitment growth was 3 in constant currency oup was 27 million in the quarter representing flat growth in constant currency and oup margin decreased 30 basis points driven by gross profit margin mix as staffing gross profit increased at a greater rate than permanent recruitment fees revenue growth in japan was up 4 on a constant currency basis or 2 adjusting for billing days and represented a slight decrease in the rate of growth in the third quarter japan experienced gross profit margin expansion year over year as a result of underlying improvement in staffing margin oup and oup margin improved once again during the fourth quarter in japan we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter on the billing days adjusted basis revenues in australia and new zealand decreased 1 in constant currency which represented a decline from the 6 revenue growth in the third quarter this was driven by the timing of certain client volumes and we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter revenue in other markets in asia pacific middle east continued to be very strong up 17 in constant currency and represents a continuation of the third quarter revenue trend this was a result of strong double digit growth in a number of markets including operations in india greater china thailand malaysia and vietnam our greater china business which is operated through a joint venture owned a majority stake in a china based payrolling firm with the minority stake held by the founder as this activity was no longer considered core we sold the majority ownership stake to its founder in december 2018 and since then no longer consolidate the results of this business the impact of the disposition on oup was not significant in the fourth quarter and due to the low margin nature of this business it s not expected to significantly impact future oup trends in the apme region however the revenue trend will be impacted as a result our first quarter revenue guidance for apme will provide an additional organic constant currency growth rate to exclude the impact of this disposition separately our china joint venture in which we own a controlling interest continues to perform very well it has become a leader in china for higher margin workforce solutions and permanent recruitment we are pleased with our progress in china and are working closely with our jv partner on future market expansion opportunities our right management business experienced a 4 constant currency revenue decline in the fourth quarter this was driven by reduced outplacement activity the rate of revenue decline represents an improvement from the 7 constant currency decline in the third quarter and represents three consecutive quarters of improvement lower gross profits driven oup decreased 10 on a constant currency basis and the oup margin declined by 130 basis points i ll now turn to cash flow and balance sheet free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures was 418 million for the full year compared to 346 million in the prior year the fourth quarter experienced positive free cash flow of 156 million which compared to 99 million in the year ago period at quarter end day sales outstanding increased by two days consistent with prior quarters changes in our business mix have driven some of the overall dso increase we continue to execute our initiatives to improve the trend of dso capital expenditures represented 65 million during 2018 during the quarter we purchased 2 6 million shares of stock for 202 million bringing total purchases for the year to 5 7 million shares for 501 million as of december 31st we have 3 1 million shares remaining for repurchase under the 6 million share program approved in august of 2018 our balance sheet was strong at quarter end with cash of 592 million and total debt of 1 08 billion bringing our net debt to 483 million our debt ratios are very comfortable at quarter end with total debt to trailing twelve months adjusted ebitda of 1 2 and total debt to total capitalization at 28 our debt and credit facilities did not change in the quarter at quarter end we had a 500 million euro note outstanding with an effective interest rate of 1 8 maturing in june of 2026 and the 400 million euro note with an effective interest rate of 1 9 maturing in september of 2022 in addition we have a revolving credit agreement for 600 million which remained unused next i ll review our outlook for the first quarter of 2019 we are forecasting earnings per share to be in the range of 1 30 to 1 38 which includes a negative impact from foreign currency of 0 13 per share our constant currency revenue guidance range is a decline between 3 and 5 the impact of dispositions represents 50 basis points of our decline in the first quarter there are slightly fewer billing days in the first quarter as a result this represents a billing days adjusted organic constant currency revenue decline of 3 at the midpoint this represents the current trends in key markets particularly europe and the anniversary of higher growth rates in various markets from a segment standpoint we expect constant currency revenue growth in the americas to be in the flat to low single digits with declines in southern europe in the low to mid single digits we expect a revenue decline in northern europe in the high single digit range with about 70 basis points of the decline representing the recent disposition in the netherlands we expect organic revenue growth in asia pacific middle east in the low single digits as the impact of the china related disposition decreases first quarter revenues by about 4 we expect the constant currency revenue decline for the apme region in the first quarter in the low single digits we expect a revenue decline in right management in the low single digits our operating profit margin during the first quarter should be down 30 basis points which includes an incremental 10 basis points of increased costs and global technology related initiatives compared to the year ago period as we mentioned last year our global effective tax rate increases in 2019 due to the discontinuation of the tax exempt cice program in france we expect our global effective tax rate to approximate 34 for 2019 we expect our income tax rate in the first quarter to approximate 37 there have been reports that the government of france is considering deferring the scheduled 2 decrease in their corporate tax rate in 2019 as this has not been enacted we have not incorporated this into our guidance should france enact this change it would increase our global effective tax rate by 50 basis points as usual our guidance does not incorporate additional share repurchases and we estimate our weighted average shares to be 61 5 million reflecting share repurchases through december 31st our guidance also does not include any restructuring charges or estimate for hyperinflationary accounting related foreign currency gains or losses related to our argentina business with that i d like to turn it back to jonas jonas prising chairman chief executive officer thanks jack we see our q1 trends essentially similar to what we saw at the end of 2018 we don t know how long the current slowdown in some european markets will continue having said that we know permanent recruitment demand remains strong in many markets and companies looking for more operational and strategic flexibility in a more uneven uncertain environment will be looking for skills that our manpower business provides as companies invest in new digital infrastructure it creates demand for the technology skills that experis provides and finally we continue to see good opportunities to deliver our market leading manpowergroup solutions offerings in many european markets and support people transition to new careers with our right management offerings we also believe the us market will provide us with opportunities for revenue improvement in 2019 in addition our emerging market footprints continues to provide a solid growth outlook our diversified geographic footprint and business mix should provide us with opportunities to generate new business in growth markets against slowing business in some markets experiencing headwinds we will balance our investments in those markets that provide us with growth opportunities and always look for operational excellence cost optimization and productivity initiatives especially where we are experiencing softening demand lastly i want to take this opportunity to thank the entire manpowergroup team for their great engagement and disciplined execution in 2018 and we look forward to building on that progress in 2019 and beyond our people are the reason we were recently named one of fortune magazine s 2019 world s most admired companies for the 17th time also receiving top scores for social responsibility and global competitiveness this accolade is a testament to our people who are delivering on our commitment to help our clients win in the changing world of work while connecting millions of people to meaningful and sustainable employment every year and with that i would now like to open the call for q a operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from the line of andrew steinerman from jpmorgan your line is now open andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst good morning jonas and jack jonas you mentioned that you don t know when you ll see stability in europe instead of giving kind of the timing of when could you give us a sense of sort of what has to happen for you to see stability in europe and then another comment that caught my ear in your final remarks was that you saw opportunity for growth in manpower us which has been a segment of turnaround for you did you mean that kind of give us a timeline of when you think that segment could grow jonas prising chairman chief executive officer hey morning andrew this is the headquarters of the polar vortex so we re looking out at some very cold weather here and your first question on the outlook for europe and the timing of course that s difficult now we re in two consecutive quarters you might have seen the numbers from the eurozone growth at 0 2 for both of those quarters so it s all going to be a question of resolving some of the uncertainties that are related to trade brexit and some of the political issues that might be in some of the european countries but overall i would say to give you a sense of what our conversations with clients are like this still feels very much like a slowdown and not the beginning of the downturn because by the same token of looking back at the past quarters with lower economic growth in the eurozone you re looking at labor markets that are still that are now at a 10 year low in terms of unemployment so that s positive that s why we think we will have opportunities in a number of our brands in countries across europe and also when you look at the projected outlook for growth for the year it is significantly higher than what the current run rate is so if that were to happen there should be some good opportunities for a pickup and the question is of course when that would happen but our conversations with our clients still feel very much like a slowdown and not a downturn related to the question in the us we still think of the us as a good market for revenue improvement for us and we believe that we ll see some revenue improvements in the manpower business we were very pleased to see that experis continued to improve also in the fourth quarter so we think this is one of the markets where we ll have some good opportunities and we re adding recruiters here in the us because we think the market will be good here in the us andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of jeff silber from bmo capital markets your line is now open jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thanks so much i wanted to start actually focusing on right management can you just remind us what percentage of that business comes from europe and is the european business growing there would we expect that to be growing considering what s going on in that environment jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jeff i would say the biggest parts of the business are in us we have seen good progress in europe and it has been an opportunity for us the uk is a market where we have some concentration as well so i d say still trends overall trends are still being driven by the us predominantly but we ve actually seen very good opportunities in europe and we continue to see that as an area of opportunity particularly in 2019 as we look at the pipeline jonas prising chairman chief executive officer and even in 2018 jeff the europe is the best performing business in our right management business globally so you are seeing a reflection of some of this environment come through in the performance of that business jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great and then shifting over to just your capital allocation strategy given what s going on are there any major changes here over the next few quarters are you going to hold back on m a repurchasing stock is that something you might be accelerating your thoughts would be really appreciated jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jeff in terms of capital allocation i guess i d start by saying we really haven t changed our strategy at all it remains the same if there is acquisition activity that goes first that will be a use of free cash flow to your point there hasn t been and if there isn t then we re going to continue to look at share repurchases as a vehicle to return cash to our shareholders and you saw what we did in the fourth quarter and with share repurchases we do continue to do that opportunistically so we don t have a set amount that we declare that we have to do each quarter and we ll continue that approach going forward jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst all right great thanks so much operator thank you and our next question is from the line of kevin mcveigh from credit suisse your line is now open kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst great thanks hey nice job on the margins overall could you just remind us what the it sounds like there is a bit of an offset of an accrual against ccie headwind what was that and should we expect that kind of sensitivity over the course of 2019 jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes kevin regarding the gross profit margin impacts what we anticipated was the loss of the december cice in france and we called out that we expect that that would be about a 30 basis point drag in the fourth quarter what we effectively had were direct cost adjustments that pretty much canceled that out so on an underlying basis we re really where the reported amount is about 30 basis points down the majority of those direct cost adjustments came out of france there s always direct cost adjustments as part of the normal process but there was one larger one in france related to training fund accruals which was one of the bigger items but i would characterize it as more of a one off i wouldn t anticipate that that s going to be a trend that continues into future periods kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst got it and then just as this cice runs off how have the pricing conversations gone with clients around kind of the headwind on that or just any thoughts on pricing in general jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer so i would say in france particularly one of the items we ve seen in recent quarters if you put the cice decrease aside in 2018 we ve actually seen good underlying improvement so our objective is to try and offset the regulatory impacts and we did that in 2018 in a very successful way and we re continuing to see progress there for 2019 so i called out the change to the new subsidy the headwind that that will create of about 50 basis points and we re optimistic that we re going to continue to be able to offset part of that pressure as well doing the same things we ve been doing so i d say from that perspective it continues to be a good labor market and in view of the regulatory changes we are actually having good progress on bill pay spreads on an overall basis so that is an opportunity for us and i d say that it s not just unique to france we ve actually seen i called out the fact that we saw improvement in italy in our staffing margin during the quarter as well and we ve been actually making progress in the us as well and i ve talked about experis experis saw an expansion in their gross profit margin during the quarter as well so there definitely is opportunity for us when we look at pricing going forward and we re starting to see that come through and that s actually part of what s happening in terms of our outlook into the first quarter on gp margin as well jonas prising chairman chief executive officer and kevin just to add on your question on pricing what it looks like pricing remains rational overall it s as usual a competitive environment but pricing pressures have not changed and to jack s point we ve seen some positive evolution of our ability to be able to compensate for any direct cost increases through our pricing in a number of markets kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst super thank you both operator thank you and our next question is from the line of hamzah mazari from macquarie capital your line is now open hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst good morning my question is around the cost side maybe just any thoughts as to how much more room you have on the cost side either through technology or consolidation of back office in europe i think us is behind you and the reason i ask is because you had this big restructuring about five years ago i think you took out 180 million of costs so just as you look at the portfolio is there any incremental room on the cost side jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes hamzah i d say yes there definitely is i d really go back to our financial targets and when we talked about our ebitda margin expansion goals one of the key levers that we continue to pull are ongoing efficiencies particularly in our back office processes so you referenced the us we did a lot in the us and we are seeing that as an underlying improvement in our cost structure there that s helping fund the technology investments that we re making and we re looking at that in a very similar way in our other large businesses around the world we did some of that last year in europe and we expect we ll continue to be making advancements in our back office optimization in those key markets and that will continue to be an opportunity for us so in the current environment where we ve seen some deleveraging due to the revenue pressure that we ve seen you can t see that coming out as strongly as it was before but it is happening and it will continue to be an area that gives us some ability to continue to improve the bottom line and fund our technology investments george tong goldman sachs analyst great and then just a follow up question on the experis side i know you ve touched on it but any further color as to what s driving the improvement is that just a market is that just better execution your back filling projects because i know that business had not issues but it was slow relative to what you re seeing now in terms of improvement so just any further color there thank you jonas prising chairman chief executive officer i think it s just a continuation of our improvement in terms of our execution as we ve said before we want to improve the business we want to get to where the market is but we want to get there in the right way so we re gradually executing we re adding recruiters in the areas where we see good demand and overall i think in the us in particular we have continued to see very good demand so it s just a continued progress from improvements in execution jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer and the one item i would just go back to that we ve emphasized in the past as in the us particularly we ve been very focused on growing the right way and growing profitably and we have been emphasizing the expansion of gross profit margin in the experis business in us so we saw a 2 improvement in the rate of decline in the fourth quarter and we are making progress to jonas s point but we re doing it while very focused on gp margin and we expanded that again in the fourth quarter and as i said we do continue to see improvement into the first quarter for experis as well hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks hamzah operator thank you and our next question is from the line of mark marcon from rw baird your line is now open mark marcon robert w baird analyst good morning good cold morning hey with regards to france can you just talk a little bit about what you re seeing in terms of the ongoing impact from the yellow vest protest and to what extent do you think that potentially the fee on changes that are currently scheduled for the fourth quarter could potentially change and then i have a follow up with regards to germany jonas prising chairman chief executive officer good morning mark yes no i was in france last week and so i was of course very interested in hearing what the impact was as it relates to the yellow vest and the impact that has been noted is primarily in the retail sector around the seasonal shopping as well as hospitality i mean those are the two sectors that have been hit quite hard at the end of the year but at this point the protests seem to be well contained they re predictable which means people work around them they don t disrupt working life and president macron ph has instituted a number of initiatives that at least for now appears to have calmed the situation quite a lot so i would say that this is now manageable from the french government s perspective and they have instituted a number of different initiatives to try and placate the part of the population that feels that they ve been left behind we don t know whether any change would happen but i would say the initiatives that the government put in to reduce the pressure on budget did not include any change on the fee on subsidies the way they ve been projected to kick in on the 1st of october and of course i m sure that that was part of the consideration when they looked at how to bridge a budget gap as they made some other changes but at least for now what they have said is that no this is going to happen and the date is the 1st of october and that s as recent as last week with the meetings that i had with government ministers so we feel pretty good about them sticking to that commitment because in the end it is a commitment to make france more competitive by reducing the cost of labor and enabling companies to invest and grow their workforce in france so i don t think that it s likely that it will change at least at this point mark marcon robert w baird analyst okay and then with regards to germany can you just shed a little bit more color with regards to what is the major driver behind the decline i mean i know there s multiple factors including the auto industry and the emissions changes but how would you characterize it and when do you think that we may end up inflicting or is there any light at the end of the tunnel as it relates to germany jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer mark it s jack i d say on germany going back to what we talked about in the third quarter we highlighted the disruption we saw from some of the systems in delivery model changes but we did make progress in the fourth quarter advancing initiatives around that so these are all changes that are going to make our germany business stronger going forward but the reality is we re still working through some of that and we saw some of that trend in the third quarter continue into the fourth quarter in terms of some of that disruption at the same time in the fourth quarter the market deteriorated and that really goes to your point about the auto sector we certainly have a we re very manufacturing focused in germany the auto sector is a big part of our business there no with that being said we actually have seen stabilization as we look in 2000 if we look in 2019 in the first few weeks of january here it stabilized so as i said in my outlook what we re holding right now for the first quarter guidance is what we re seeing as we exit the fourth quarter so a trend similar to the fourth quarter but it is encouraging that we in january have seen stabilization now and i think it s going to be dependent on what happens in the market activity going forward mark marcon robert w baird analyst i guess what i m wondering is from your field people and from your client conversations are you hearing anything about when they think they re basically going to run through the inventory i m specifically talking about the auto factoring and when that potentially ends up turning jonas prising chairman chief executive officer well i think you have germany that is their economic growth has come down pretty sharply and the projections for 19 is of the growth rate is projected to be much lower than it was in 2018 the flip side of that is there s the labor markets are still very strong unemployment is at 3 3 so again in germany the feeling is certainly not of a discussion around a downturn it is more of a slowdown but it s hard to predict when companies are going to feel better i think it hangs together with the overall outlook for europe and global trade with china trade wars potentially with the us being settled so i think that could be an inflection point when that gets resolved mark marcon robert w baird analyst great thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of gary bisbee from bank of america merill lynch your line is now open gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst hi guys good morning i guess the first question so i want to go back to the capital allocation and just get any incremental color you can provide on your appetite for share repurchases and i ask against the context of obviously in 2008 2009 a much more difficult environment but the company basically went two years and halted buybacks and then in 2013 when there was a mild double dip recession in parts of europe there was 18 months without any buybacks both times moving to a net cash position on the balance sheet how do you think about like at what level do you think about moving to that more of a safety mode or is there something different today in how you think about the liquidity the business the balance sheet strength et cetera that might make you act differently if we do see some further weakening thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer gary i d say it is as you refer we have a very strong balance sheet currently so when we look at capital allocation as i mentioned before we continue to think share repurchases are a great way to return cash to our shareholders we do that opportunistically and you ve seen what we ve done in the last two quarters to your point in terms of how we think of that going forward i d go back to what jonas said in terms of his overall points about europe so we continue to think this is a slowdown we don t think we re currently approaching a recessionary environment we re in a recessionary environment in europe at the moment and as a result that s how we think about our balance sheet now with that being said one of our goals is to continue to have a very strong balance sheet and you ve seen us be prudent in the past in the way we look at our overall balance sheet and we ll continue to do that but at the moment we feel very good about our capacity and you saw what we did in the fourth quarter and i d say we ll continue to look at that very opportunistically going forward gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst great thanks then a quick follow up on the french margin just how they re trending the 50 basis points for the change in the regulatory environment you ve talked about but before that and excluding the accrual adjustments should we think that on top of that 50 basis points drag there s beginning to be some more meaningful just deleveraging from the weaker revenue or is some of the price discipline stuff you talked about really limiting that and i guess i m thinking more forward looking than what happened in q4 thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i d say we don t really do a lot in terms of oup margin guidance by specific country gary but what i would say to kind of get to your question is we feel pretty good about the ability to make up some of that pressure we re going to see from the switchover to the new subsidies and france continues to be a pretty efficiently run organization for us so i think we feel good about the opportunity going forward revenue has been the trends we ve seen in revenue certainly over the last couple of quarters has been declining but with that being said we ve seen stabilization in january so we will continue to look at our efficiency on an overall basis i think as we move forward if we were to see more severe revenue declines then as jonas said in his comments we re very very good at looking at our cost structure and making adjustments as needed to protect the oup margin and we would we certainly would consider that if the environment dictated that going forward gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst great thanks i appreciate the commentary operator thank you and our next question is from the line of tim mchugh from william blair your line is now open tim mchugh william blair company analyst yes thanks just a question i guess related to spending but the sales force i recognize you re kind of cutting broadly expenses as you try and drive efficiency but as you see a downturn like this how are you managing kind of your sales resources are you keeping capacity in the hopes this is just a temporary kind of slowdown and not a downturn jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes good morning tim i would so first of all we saw some great performance in growth in latin america asia pacific parts of the americas so clearly in those countries we re adding resources and feel that we have good growth opportunities and we do the same in the us when then it comes to countries where we have a slowdown that we can see is a reduction in demand we manage it very carefully because we know that things can change but of course we are very good at managing productivity and operational excellence as we make sure that we have an expense base that supports the business in the state that it s in and as you could see in the fourth quarter we re actually quite agile in terms of how we can do that and adjust and clearly as we were managing this with our thoughts around it being a slowdown we manage it prudently because we also don t want to miss opportunities in markets even though they might be slowing down now they could come back and also we have opportunities due to the tight labor markets in many of those countries so inaudible could be a good opportunity for us despite the slowing manpower business in some cases as experis and others so it s really it is really the experience of the management been through many different cycles over many years of their tenure in the business that enables us to optimize that those management actions tim mchugh william blair company analyst okay thanks and then just can you elaborate on italy that you made the comment the dignity degree is not having an impact i guess it s more market weakness that you attribute to declines too but i guess what do you inaudible for that jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes that s right tim so first of all of course last year we were coming up against extremely high growth rates so that will be the first observation i would make and then the second observation as you may might have seen this morning italy is now technically in a recession the fourth quarter was in negative territory so the economy is not very good but we feel very good about our business in italy it s well managed our outlook for the first quarter remains positive although with a little bit of a weaker revenue outlook our profitability and our ability to manage our staffing margins is strong so we still feel good about our italian business tim mchugh william blair company analyst okay thanks operator thank you and our next question is from the line of george tong from goldman sachs your line is now open george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning operating margins came in at 4 this quarter which was ahead of guidance part of the improvement came from direct cost adjustments on the gain on sale from your language translation business can you unpack the remainder of the upside drivers this quarter and how these may carry over to 1q margin performance jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes george what i d say is you re right there are a couple of different moving parts there but i guess on the overlying basis what i d say is in the current revenue environment think of it as the underlying running of about 20 basis points down year over year considering the year ago period where we had very strong growth and as we look into the first quarter really i d say that s going to that trend s going to continue about 20 basis points down and we did call out that the first quarter is our latest quarter in terms of revenues and as a result of that our technology spend in the first quarter has another 10 basis points of an impact so think of it that way think of it as an underlying 20 basis points and then the additional technology spend is another 10 in the first quarter george tong goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful in france you indicated that you re seeing evidence of good underlying improvement in the labor market that s helping to offset the regulatory impact can you lay out the timeline over the rest of this year for how you expect regulatory changes to impact growth and margins in basis points and how effectively the underlying environment will offset these headwinds jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer george i was referring to the ability to have discussions with clients regarding bill pay spreads and the opportunity in view of what s happening with the regulatory environment with the changes in the subsidy programs which are additional headwind so that was what i was referring to i think if we look at the outlook for 2019 from a regulatory standpoint i think we know the major components at this stage i think it s going to be the transition of the cic program we have a pretty good handle on that and what i just go back to the point that we have a good opportunity to make up that headwind in france due to ongoing discussions with clients and we re seeing that momentum in the current quarter and we see that trend continuing george tong goldman sachs analyst got it thank you jonas prising chairman chief executive officer okay we have reached the end of our allotted time and that will conclude our call operator thank you everyone and that concludes today s conference thank you for joining and you may now disconnect duration 65 minutes call participants jonas prising chairman chief executive

the president of the world bank jim yong kim will step down on 1 february three and a half years before the end of his term in search of greener pastures his readiness to resign from the leadership of one the two most powerful international financial institutions is a worrying omen but it is also an important wake up call the world bank and the imf are the last remaining columns of the bretton woods edifice under which capitalism experienced its golden age in the 1950s and 1960s while that system and the fixed exchange rate regime it relied upon bit the dust in 1971 the two institutions continued to support global finance along purely atlanticist lines with europe s establishment choosing the imf s managing director and the united states selecting the head of the world bank kim a career physician who presented himself as a champion of poverty alleviation now leaves the fate of the bank s leadership in the hands of donald trump the global equivalent of a progressive supreme court justice hanging up his robes in the middle of a republican white house adding a touch of the absurd to the drama it is the us president s daughter ivanka trump who is now leading the search committee for kim s replacement but like every crisis of the trump era this sordid affair is an excellent opportunity to mobilize around an entirely new vision for the bretton woods institutions to push for radical reforms that would put the resources of the world bank and the imf in the service of the many rather than lubricating the wheels of global finance in the interest of the very few such a progressive vision would bring the bretton woods system much closer to the lofty intentions of its framers prosperity like peace is indivisible said the us treasury secretary henry morgenthau in his inaugural speech to the bretton woods conference which gave birth to the world bank then the international bank for reconstruction and development and to the imf we cannot afford to have it scattered here or there among the fortunate or enjoy it at the expense of others the original bretton woods plan was for exchange rates to be fixed with the imf helping heavily indebted countries restructure their debt and a stabilization fund curbing capital flight meanwhile the world bank would offer development finance and an international commodity stabilization corporation would bring about the orderly marketing of staple commodities at prices fair to the producer and consumer alike finally the whole system would be dollar denominated with the greenback being the only currency exchangeable for gold at a fixed rate if we do not act quickly demanding a radical change of direction the world bank will likely fade into irrelevance john maynard keynes the chief british negotiator at bretton woods was worried that the new system could only rely on the dollar as long as america had a trade surplus the moment the united states became a deficit country the system would collapse so keynes suggested that instead of building the new world order on the dollar all major economies would subscribe to a multilateral international clearing union icu while keeping their own currencies and central banks countries would agree to denominate all international payments in a common accounting unit which keynes named the bancor and to clear all international payments through the icu once set up the icu would tax persistent surpluses and deficits symmetrically so as to balance out capital flows volatility global aggregate demand and productivity had it been instituted the icu would have worked alongside the world bank to keep the global economy in balance and build shared prosperity worldwide but keynes s icu was rejected the united states was unwilling to replace the dollar as the anchor of the new monetary system and so the imf was downgraded to a bailout fund the world bank was limited to lending from its own reserves contributed by stressed member states and crucially any possibility of the imf leveraging the world bank s investments like a central bank might have done was jettisoned following large us trade deficits then president richard nixon announced on 15 august 1971 the effective end of the bretton woods system just as keynes had predicted immediately the private banks which the bretton woods system had been keeping under a lid sprang up and the world was taken over by financialization rather than supporting governments and prosperity the world bank and the imf led the so called washington consensus an orchestrated campaign of mass privatization austerity and financial deregulation there are virtually no limits on what can be privatized wrote mary shirley the chief of the public sector management and private sector development division in 1992 view image in fullscreen jim yong kim s departure must be our cue to review role of the world bank and the imf photograph chip somodevilla getty images jim yong kim was once a fierce critic of the washington consensus in his book dying for growth published in 2000 kim railed against the world bank s free marketeering the costs of which have been borne by the poor the infirm and the vulnerable in poor countries that accepted the experts designs yet as president kim turbocharged the bank s commitment to private profits against the public interest maximizing finance for development mfd the strategy he adopted in 2015 transformed the world bank from a direct investor in developing countries to a mere facilitator of private finance the bank s core activity would not be lending to governments but to de risk projects sectors and entire countries in effect socializing the risks on behalf of the private investors and privatizing any gains from this perspective it makes perfect sense that mr kim resigned early to take up a post at a private equity firm his decision must however be our cue to review the role of the world bank and the imf today and perhaps to revisit keynes s prescient idea circa 1944 the world today needs as much as it did in 1944 a massive international investment program back then humanity needed reconstruction after a lethal world war today the planet is crying out for a green transition that will cost at least 8tn annually jim yong kim s departure makes one thing clear the world bank is on the brink where will the money come from surely not from the stressed budgets of our states here s an idea build a new bretton woods and fund the international green new deal by simply mobilizing idle savings via a linkup between the revamped world bank and the new imf the imf can become the issuer of a digital currency unit in which all international payments are denominated countries can retain their currencies that will float freely against the imf s unit and a wealth fund can be built by depositing in it currency units in proportion to every country s trade deficits and surpluses meanwhile backed by the imf s capacity to issue the world currency unit the world bank can crowd idle savings from across the world into green investments reclaiming its soul after decades of investing in environmental destruction and human displacement kim s departure makes one thing clear the world bank is on the brink new development banks are growing in size and in scope filling the space that the world bank has long since abandoned now is the time to mobilize to push a new crop of progressive leaders to start thinking internationally taking their enthusiasm for the green new deal to the global level if we do not act quickly demanding a radical change of direction the world bank will likely fade into irrelevance or worse it will become a plaything for the trump family and its associates making the world into their great golf course

forward looking statements slide 2 of our earnings release presentation includes important information regarding previous sec filings and reconciliation of non gaap measures jonas prising chairman chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks jack revenue in the fourth quarter came in at 5 4 billion a decrease of 1 in constant currency on a same day basis our underlying organic constant currency revenue decreased by 3 the weaker revenue performance is primarily attributable to our businesses in europe which continued to slow through the fourth quarter partially offsetting revenues decline in europe with strong revenue growth in apme and within portions of the americas specifically in latin america and canada operating profit for the fourth quarter was 218 million down 4 in constant currency operating profit margin came in at 4 down 20 basis points from the prior year our performance in the quarter reflects stronger than expected gross profit margin of 16 3 which represents a 30 basis points decrease from the prior year we continued to manage sg a well in the quarter and continued to take appropriate management actions in view of the softer revenue trends earnings per share for the quarter was 2 54 this was a decrease of 18 in constant currency year over year but it actually reflected 25 growth in constant currency compared to the prior year if you exclude the us tax reform related gains that we experienced in the prior year period turning to the full year results for a few moments earnings per share for the year was 8 56 this represented a constant currency increase of 5 over the prior year and an increase of 22 in constant currency excluding the one time benefit of tax reform in the prior year revenues for the year increased 2 in constant currency to 22 billion and operating profit was 797 million which was flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis advertisement advertisement our fourth quarter results continue to reflect the more challenging market environment especially in europe we experienced declining revenue trends across a number of our european businesses notably in france italy and germany among our larger businesses we re applying strong pricing discipline and are very focused on improved productivity and executing cost mitigation actions in countries experiencing a softening environment at the same time we continue to add resources in markets that provide us with opportunities for profitable growth and invest in our technology initiatives in various countries across the world we participated in the world economic forum in davos last week and as you can imagine the outlook for the european economy was a prominent topic of discussion as was the topic of access to human capital and skills we led many discussions on workforce trends and the impact of ai and technology on the workforce we also shared our latest thought leadership research which generated significant discussion this included the latest research in skills revolution series providing a real time view of the impact of technology on job growth called humans wanted robots need you contrary to media headlines this research shows that organizations that are automating tasks are hiring more people creating more jobs and upskilling their people to perform new and complementary roles to those done by machines augmenting human capability more than replacing it we also launched manpowergroup solutions total workforce index at davos sharing our new digital evolution pathway assessment tool and promoting experience tech academy alongside other workforce solutions for me the biggest takeaway from davos is that despite concerns around lower growth outlook in some parts of the world the importance of the workforce strategy and access to skilled talent is top of mind for most companies our strong manpowergroup value proposition remains highly relevant in this environment as we can support companies execution of the business strategies with our leading global workforce solutions wherever they are we know the skills revolution is in full flow and we have an important opportunity and role to play in solving the talent shortage for companies by upskilling and reskilling people for them to stay employable today and in the future turning back to our digital transformation we have previously discussed many of the technology initiatives we have implemented over the past years and continue to advance our investments in technology is core to our strategy of maintaining our leadership and workforce solutions and enabling our teams to help clients and candidates win through better data insights and innovative delivery models 2018 was a year of significant investment and progress in advancing our digital capabilities 2019 will be no different as we continue implementing world class front office systems cloud based and mobile applications as well as other enhancements to our global technology infrastructure across a number of our markets we re also investing in the digitalization of our workforce solutions offerings to ensure our clients have access to the best class workforce analytics and tools advertisement advertisement and with that i would like to turn it over to jack to provide additional financial information and a review of our segment results and our first quarter outlook jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jonas turning back to fourth quarter results as jonas as mentioned we experienced a challenging revenue environment in the fourth quarter operating profit declined 4 on a constant currency basis this performance resulted in an operating profit margin of 4 which exceeded our guidance range a revenue decline of 1 in constant currency came in at the lower end of our constant currency guidance range our gross profit margin declined 30 basis points year over year which also exceeded our guidance range as we experienced favorable direct cost accrual adjustments particularly in france during the quarter our sg a was well managed during the quarter and included a benefit from a gain on disposition of a non core business which i ll cover in more detail advertisement advertisement breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail our reported revenue decline of 4 includes the negative currency impact on a constant currency basis our revenue decline was 1 acquisitions contributed about 20 basis points to our growth rate in the quarter and as we had an extra billing day the organic constant currency days adjusted revenue decline was 2 the revenue decline was primarily driven by various businesses in europe most notably in france germany and the netherlands i will discuss this further in the segment review s turning to the epf bridge on a reported basis earnings per share was 2 54 starting with our guidance eps midpoint of 2 19 improved operational performance contributed 0 12 driven by france we sold our non core language translation business in the netherlands during the quarter which resulted in a gain of 8 million which contributed 0 10 the other income expenses contributed 0 9 as equity pickup losses on investments related to our past ownership interests in our switzerland franchise we re more than offset by other foreign currency adjustments and non controlling interest income related to our china joint venture foreign currency translation impact was 0 06 worse than the estimated in guidance a lower effective tax rate contributed 0 04 and lower weighted average shares resulting from repurchases during the quarter contributed 0 06 looking at our gross profit margin in detail our gross margin came in at 16 3 staffing interim margin declines drove the 30 basis points reduction in the overall gross margin year over year although we experienced a loss of cice subsidy in france for the month of december as expected which represented 30 basis points of margin at the consolidated level this was largely offset by favorable direct cost adjustments in france the remaining 30 basis point decline represented the underlying gross profit margin trend in the fourth quarter advertisement advertisement next let s review our gross profit by business line during the quarter the manpower brand comprised 63 of gross profit our experienced professional business comprised 20 manpowergroup solutions comprise 14 and right management 3 during the quarter our manpower brand reported a 4 decrease in gross profit on a constant currency basis this represents a decrease from the 1 constant currency growth rate in the third quarter this was driven by declines in germany the uk the us the netherlands sweden italy and spain among our larger countries within our manpower brand approximately 60 of the gross profit is derived from light industrial skills and 40 is derived from office and clerical skills gross profit from staffing within light industrial skills decreased during the quarter while office in clerical skills experienced a slight increase in the rate of growth in the quarter gross profit in our experienced brand decrease 1 on a constant currency basis year over year this represented a decrease from the flat constant currency growth rate achieved in the third quarter the decrease was primarily driven by the netherlands sweden and australia manpowergroup solutions includes our global market leading rpo and msp offerings as well as talent based outsourcing solutions including proservia our european it infrastructure and end user support business msp offerings as well as talent based outsourcing solutions including serbia ph our european it infrastructure and end user support business gross profit growth in the quarter was up 2 in constant currency which represents a decrease from the 8 constant currency growth rate achieved in the third quarter driven by lower rpo and proservia activity which was partially offset by strong msp activity in the quarter our pipeline for rpo and msp opportunities is strong into 2019 while management experienced a decline in gross profit of 5 in constant currency during the quarter as our outplacement activity continued to decline this represents an improvement from the 8 constant currency decline experienced in the third quarter i will comment further on right management in my segment review sga expense was 662 million a decrease of 35 million from the prior year this included a year over year reduction of 22 million from currency changes 1 million increase from acquisitions a 5 million decrease from operations and a decrease of 8 million related to the gain on the sale of our language translation business in the netherlands sga expenses as a percentage of revenue in the quarter represented 12 3 and after excluding the gain on sale it represented 12 4 this result reflects our focus on operational efficiency across our businesses during a challenging revenue environment while we continue to implement new technology across a number of operations globally the americas segment comprise 19 of consolidated revenue revenue in the quarter was 1 billion representing 2 growth year over year in constant currency inaudible of 53 million represented a decrease of 3 in constant currency driven by the us which i will discuss next similarly oup margin decreased by 30 basis points year over year the us is the largest country in the americas segment comprising 61 of segment revenues revenue in the us was 632 million down 5 compared to the prior year this represented a slight decline from the 4 decrease in the third quarter during the quarter oup for our us business decreased 13 to 33 million and oup margin was 5 2 a reduction of 50 basis points from the prior year driven by the manpower business which i will discuss next within the us the manpower brand comprise 42 of gross profit during the quarter advertisement advertisement revenue for the manpower brand in the us was down 70 in the quarter which represented a decline from the third quarter trend largely due to the non recurrence of seasonal holiday activity associated with select clients although the us manpower business experience decreased holiday activity in the fourth quarter we expect to see improvement in the trend in the first quarter due to new business wins and improved trends the experis brand in the us comprise 35 of gross profit in the quarter with in experis in the us it skills comprise approximately 70 percent of the revenues during the quarter our experis revenues declined 6 from the prior year compared to the 8 decline experienced in the third quarter experis us has been very focused on profitable business and this resulted in gross profit margin expansion during the quarter experis us experienced an improved december and we expect to see continued improvement in the revenue trend in the first quarter manpowergroup solutions in the us contributed 23 of gross profit and experienced 9 revenue growth in the quarter which was an improvement from the 5 growth in the third quarter we continue to see good opportunities for growth in both our higher value msp and our rpo solutions in the us our mexico operation had 9 constant currency revenue growth in the quarter the business in mexico continue to perform well in the quarter and we expect good growth into the first quarter revenue in argentina was up 14 in constant currency which continues to reflect the impact of inflation we are operatingin argentina in a disciplined and cautious manner in view of the hyper inflationary environment as a result billable hours were down 16 year over year in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on margin and payment terms improvement due to the extended duration of the high inflationary environment we have been reducing billable hours for many quarters in argentina and the business has become less significant to the region as a result beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we will replace the separate revenue trend reporting for argentina business with our canada business which is now larger than our argentina business our canada business represented 7 of the segment revenues during the quarter and experienced a constant currency revenue growth rate of 17 in the quarter capping off a year of very strong performance revenue growth in the other countries within americas was up 17 in constant currency or 12 on an organic basis this growth was driven primarily by the very strong revenue growth in canada which i just referenced as well as solid growth in colombia brazil and peru southern europe revenue comprise 43 of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue in southern europe came in at 2 3 billion a decrease of 1 in constant currency this represented a decline from the 2 constant currency revenue growth rate in the third quarter driven by revenue declines in france italy and spain oup decreased 2 in the prior year in constant currency and oup margin decreased 10 basis points which was driven by italy italy had strong performance but was running against very high 31 percent days adjusted growth rate in the prior year period france experienced better than expected profitability which i will discuss next france revenue comprised 62 of the southern europe segment in the quarter and declined 2 from the prior year in constant currency on the billing days adjusted constant currency basis revenues declined 3 in the first three weeks of january we continue to see activity levels that reflected 2 to 3 revenue decline year over year as discussed on the previous quarters earnings call transition from cic program at the end of 2018 to the new subsidy program in january of 2019 resulted in the loss of the december cic subsidy as expected the cice related gross profit loss in the fourth quarter was offset by favorable direct cost to cool ph adjustments in the quarter this drove a better than expected level of profit in france and oup was 81 million an increase of 3 percent in constant currency and oup margin was up 30 basis points in constant currency to 5 7 permanent recruitment growth was 5 percent in constant currency during the quarter we have incorporated the current trend of a 3 days adjusted decline into our first quarter revenue guidance during the previous quarters earnings call i provided a detailed description of the anticipated impact of the new subsidy program on our france gross profit in 2019 the preliminary budget was passed as expected in december and as a result our guidance remains unchanged in summary this item is expected to result in a reduction of our gdp margin in france of about 50 basis points in the first three quarters of 2019 and beginning in the fourth quarter after the incremental inaudible subsidies are received the reduction would then represent about 15 basis points going forward similar to our successful effort in 2019 to offset a large part of the scheduled cice decrease we will again strive to offset the net impact in 2019 with ongoing initiatives revenue in italy decreased 3 in constant currency to 404 million on a billing days adjusted constant currency basis revenues declined 5 italy also experienced a non recurrence of select client holiday related activity in the fourth quarter that contributed to the revenue decline we saw another consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in the staffing gross profit margin trend in italy during the fourth quarter advertisement advertisement permanent recruitment represented 6 growth in the quarter oup margin represented 7 our italy business is performing well in a more challenging economic environment as we continue to anniversary very high growth we expect a low to mid single digit percentage revenue decline into the first quarter we continue to believe that the dignity decree legislation in italy is manageable and we do not expect this legislation to influence our revenue trend significantly in spain revenues also decreased 3 in constant currency or 5 on a billing days adjusted basis we expect spain will have a similar level of revenue performance in the first quarter our northern europe segment comprise 24 percent of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue was down 7 in constant currency to 1 3 billion this represents a decrease from the 4 constant currency decline in the third quarter primarily driven by germany the netherlands and the uk oup decreased 6 in constant currency and oup margin was flat to the prior year included within oup is the previously referenced onetime gain of 8 million related to the sale of our language translation business in the netherlands the underlying decrease in oup was driven by germany and to a lesser extent the netherlands as discussed last quarter in addition to the declining market environment our germany business has also experienced reduced revenues and incremental costs associated with technology and operational improvement initiatives our largest market in northern europe segment is the uk which represented 31 of segment revenue in the quarter uk revenues decreased 3 in constant currency and represented a 4 decrease on a billing days adjusted constant currency basis this represents a decline from the flat growth in the third quarter our manpower business in the uk experienced a 13 constant currency revenue decline in the fourth quarter which included reductions in production from large automotive clients as mentioned last quarter conversely our experis business experience another quarter of revenue improvement and improved their constant currency revenue growth rate to 16 in the fourth quarter we expect the overall revenue trend for the uk business to experience a high single digit percentage decline in revenue in the first quarter due to the reduced volume in the large automotive client and to a lesser degree reduced activity in a few other select clients revenue in germany declined 18 on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter or 21 on a billing days adjusted basis this represented a further decline from the 14 constant currency decrease in the third quarter although we made progress during the quarter advancing key initiatives which will strengthen our business in germany we continued to experience further declines in the fourth quarter market activity in germany has been very difficult to estimate and as a result our revenue guidance for the first quarter is being set at the january today trends which approximate our fourth quarter rate of decline in the nordics we experienced the 1 constant currency revenue growth during the fourth quarter or adjusted for billing days a 2 growth rate this represents an improvement from the 3 decline in the third quarter norway has been the driver of the improved revenue growth we expect norway to continue to perform well in the first quarter which will offset the soft revenue environment in sweden for the nordics overall we expect to see a similar rate of revenue growth in the first quarter revenue in the netherlands decreased 15 in constant currency on a billing days adjusted basis during the fourth quarter this representative declined from the 4 decrease in the third quarter we had anticipated a further decline in the fourth quarter as our language translation business was a fee based business the sale in december 2018 will have a modest impact on the revenue trend in the netherlands going forward we expect the first quarter revenue trend will be similar to the fourth quarter trend belgium experienced revenue growth of 1 in constant currency during the fourth quarter this represented an improvement from the billing days adjusted 1 constant currency decline in the third quarter our belgium business has been performing as expected and we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter other markets in northern europe had a revenue decline of 1 in constant currency the asia pacific middle east segment comprises 13 of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue was up 9 in constant currency to 732 million representing a decrease from the 10 growth rate in the third quarter permanent recruitment growth was 3 in constant currency oup was 27 million in the quarter representing flat growth in constant currency and oup margin decreased 30 basis points driven by gross profit margin mix as staffing gross profit increased at a greater rate than permanent recruitment fees revenue growth in japan was up 4 on a constant currency basis or 2 adjusting for billing days and represented a slight decrease in the rate of growth in the third quarter japan experienced gross profit margin expansion year over year as a result of underlying improvement in staffing margin oup and oup margin improved once again during the fourth quarter in japan we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter on the billing days adjusted basis revenues in australia and new zealand decreased 1 in constant currency which represented a decline from the 6 revenue growth in the third quarter this was driven by the timing of certain client volumes and we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter revenue in other markets in asia pacific middle east continued to be very strong up 17 in constant currency and represents a continuation of the third quarter revenue trend this was a result of strong double digit growth in a number of markets including operations in india greater china thailand malaysia and vietnam our greater china business which is operated through a joint venture owned a majority stake in a china based payrolling firm with the minority stake held by the founder as this activity was no longer considered core we sold the majority ownership stake to its founder in december 2018 and since then no longer consolidate the results of this business the impact of the disposition on oup was not significant in the fourth quarter and due to the low margin nature of this business it s not expected to significantly impact future oup trends in the apme region however the revenue trend will be impacted as a result our first quarter revenue guidance for apme will provide an additional organic constant currency growth rate to exclude the impact of this disposition separately our china joint venture in which we own a controlling interest continues to perform very well it has become a leader in china for higher margin workforce solutions and permanent recruitment we are pleased with our progress in china and are working closely with our jv partner on future market expansion opportunities our right management business experienced a 4 constant currency revenue decline in the fourth quarter this was driven by reduced outplacement activity the rate of revenue decline represents an improvement from the 7 constant currency decline in the third quarter and represents three consecutive quarters of improvement lower gross profits driven oup decreased 10 on a constant currency basis and the oup margin declined by 130 basis points i ll now turn to cash flow and balance sheet free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures was 418 million for the full year compared to 346 million in the prior year the fourth quarter experienced positive free cash flow of 156 million which compared to 99 million in the year ago period at quarter end day sales outstanding increased by two days consistent with prior quarters changes in our business mix have driven some of the overall dso increase we continue to execute our initiatives to improve the trend of dso capital expenditures represented 65 million during 2018 during the quarter we purchased 2 6 million shares of stock for 202 million bringing total purchases for the year to 5 7 million shares for 501 million as of december 31st we have 3 1 million shares remaining for repurchase under the 6 million share program approved in august of 2018 our balance sheet was strong at quarter end with cash of 592 million and total debt of 1 08 billion bringing our net debt to 483 million our debt ratios are very comfortable at quarter end with total debt to trailing twelve months adjusted ebitda of 1 2 and total debt to total capitalization at 28 our debt and credit facilities did not change in the quarter at quarter end we had a 500 million euro note outstanding with an effective interest rate of 1 8 maturing in june of 2026 and the 400 million euro note with an effective interest rate of 1 9 maturing in september of 2022 in addition we have a revolving credit agreement for 600 million which remained unused next i ll review our outlook for the first quarter of 2019 we are forecasting earnings per share to be in the range of 1 30 to 1 38 which includes a negative impact from foreign currency of 0 13 per share our constant currency revenue guidance range is a decline between 3 and 5 the impact of dispositions represents 50 basis points of our decline in the first quarter there are slightly fewer billing days in the first quarter as a result this represents a billing days adjusted organic constant currency revenue decline of 3 at the midpoint this represents the current trends in key markets particularly europe and the anniversary of higher growth rates in various markets from a segment standpoint we expect constant currency revenue growth in the americas to be in the flat to low single digits with declines in southern europe in the low to mid single digits we expect a revenue decline in northern europe in the high single digit range with about 70 basis points of the decline representing the recent disposition in the netherlands we expect organic revenue growth in asia pacific middle east in the low single digits as the impact of the china related disposition decreases first quarter revenues by about 4 we expect the constant currency revenue decline for the apme region in the first quarter in the low single digits we expect a revenue decline in right management in the low single digits our operating profit margin during the first quarter should be down 30 basis points which includes an incremental 10 basis points of increased costs and global technology related initiatives compared to the year ago period as we mentioned last year our global effective tax rate increases in 2019 due to the discontinuation of the tax exempt cice program in france we expect our global effective tax rate to approximate 34 for 2019 we expect our income tax rate in the first quarter to approximate 37 there have been reports that the government of france is considering deferring the scheduled 2 decrease in their corporate tax rate in 2019 as this has not been enacted we have not incorporated this into our guidance should france enact this change it would increase our global effective tax rate by 50 basis points as usual our guidance does not incorporate additional share repurchases and we estimate our weighted average shares to be 61 5 million reflecting share repurchases through december 31st our guidance also does not include any restructuring charges or estimate for hyperinflationary accounting related foreign currency gains or losses related to our argentina business with that i d like to turn it back to jonas jonas prising chairman chief executive officer thanks jack we see our q1 trends essentially similar to what we saw at the end of 2018 we don t know how long the current slowdown in some european markets will continue having said that we know permanent recruitment demand remains strong in many markets and companies looking for more operational and strategic flexibility in a more uneven uncertain environment will be looking for skills that our manpower business provides as companies invest in new digital infrastructure it creates demand for the technology skills that experis provides and finally we continue to see good opportunities to deliver our market leading manpowergroup solutions offerings in many european markets and support people transition to new careers with our right management offerings we also believe the us market will provide us with opportunities for revenue improvement in 2019 in addition our emerging market footprints continues to provide a solid growth outlook our diversified geographic footprint and business mix should provide us with opportunities to generate new business in growth markets against slowing business in some markets experiencing headwinds we will balance our investments in those markets that provide us with growth opportunities and always look for operational excellence cost optimization and productivity initiatives especially where we are experiencing softening demand lastly i want to take this opportunity to thank the entire manpowergroup team for their great engagement and disciplined execution in 2018 and we look forward to building on that progress in 2019 and beyond our people are the reason we were recently named one of fortune magazine s 2019 world s most admired companies for the 17th time also receiving top scores for social responsibility and global competitiveness this accolade is a testament to our people who are delivering on our commitment to help our clients win in the changing world of work while connecting millions of people to meaningful and sustainable employment every year and with that i would now like to open the call for q a operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from the line of andrew steinerman from jpmorgan your line is now open andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst good morning jonas and jack jonas you mentioned that you don t know when you ll see stability in europe instead of giving kind of the timing of when could you give us a sense of sort of what has to happen for you to see stability in europe and then another comment that caught my ear in your final remarks was that you saw opportunity for growth in manpower us which has been a segment of turnaround for you did you mean that kind of give us a timeline of when you think that segment could grow jonas prising chairman chief executive officer hey morning andrew this is the headquarters of the polar vortex so we re looking out at some very cold weather here and your first question on the outlook for europe and the timing of course that s difficult now we re in two consecutive quarters you might have seen the numbers from the eurozone growth at 0 2 for both of those quarters so it s all going to be a question of resolving some of the uncertainties that are related to trade brexit and some of the political issues that might be in some of the european countries but overall i would say to give you a sense of what our conversations with clients are like this still feels very much like a slowdown and not the beginning of the downturn because by the same token of looking back at the past quarters with lower economic growth in the eurozone you re looking at labor markets that are still that are now at a 10 year low in terms of unemployment so that s positive that s why we think we will have opportunities in a number of our brands in countries across europe and also when you look at the projected outlook for growth for the year it is significantly higher than what the current run rate is so if that were to happen there should be some good opportunities for a pickup and the question is of course when that would happen but our conversations with our clients still feel very much like a slowdown and not a downturn related to the question in the us we still think of the us as a good market for revenue improvement for us and we believe that we ll see some revenue improvements in the manpower business we were very pleased to see that experis continued to improve also in the fourth quarter so we think this is one of the markets where we ll have some good opportunities and we re adding recruiters here in the us because we think the market will be good here in the us andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of jeff silber from bmo capital markets your line is now open jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thanks so much i wanted to start actually focusing on right management can you just remind us what percentage of that business comes from europe and is the european business growing there would we expect that to be growing considering what s going on in that environment jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jeff i would say the biggest parts of the business are in us we have seen good progress in europe and it has been an opportunity for us the uk is a market where we have some concentration as well so i d say still trends overall trends are still being driven by the us predominantly but we ve actually seen very good opportunities in europe and we continue to see that as an area of opportunity particularly in 2019 as we look at the pipeline jonas prising chairman chief executive officer and even in 2018 jeff the europe is the best performing business in our right management business globally so you are seeing a reflection of some of this environment come through in the performance of that business jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great and then shifting over to just your capital allocation strategy given what s going on are there any major changes here over the next few quarters are you going to hold back on m a repurchasing stock is that something you might be accelerating your thoughts would be really appreciated jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jeff in terms of capital allocation i guess i d start by saying we really haven t changed our strategy at all it remains the same if there is acquisition activity that goes first that will be a use of free cash flow to your point there hasn t been and if there isn t then we re going to continue to look at share repurchases as a vehicle to return cash to our shareholders and you saw what we did in the fourth quarter and with share repurchases we do continue to do that opportunistically so we don t have a set amount that we declare that we have to do each quarter and we ll continue that approach going forward jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst all right great thanks so much operator thank you and our next question is from the line of kevin mcveigh from credit suisse your line is now open kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst great thanks hey nice job on the margins overall could you just remind us what the it sounds like there is a bit of an offset of an accrual against ccie headwind what was that and should we expect that kind of sensitivity over the course of 2019 jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes kevin regarding the gross profit margin impacts what we anticipated was the loss of the december cice in france and we called out that we expect that that would be about a 30 basis point drag in the fourth quarter what we effectively had were direct cost adjustments that pretty much canceled that out so on an underlying basis we re really where the reported amount is about 30 basis points down the majority of those direct cost adjustments came out of france there s always direct cost adjustments as part of the normal process but there was one larger one in france related to training fund accruals which was one of the bigger items but i would characterize it as more of a one off i wouldn t anticipate that that s going to be a trend that continues into future periods kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst got it and then just as this cice runs off how have the pricing conversations gone with clients around kind of the headwind on that or just any thoughts on pricing in general jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer so i would say in france particularly one of the items we ve seen in recent quarters if you put the cice decrease aside in 2018 we ve actually seen good underlying improvement so our objective is to try and offset the regulatory impacts and we did that in 2018 in a very successful way and we re continuing to see progress there for 2019 so i called out the change to the new subsidy the headwind that that will create of about 50 basis points and we re optimistic that we re going to continue to be able to offset part of that pressure as well doing the same things we ve been doing so i d say from that perspective it continues to be a good labor market and in view of the regulatory changes we are actually having good progress on bill pay spreads on an overall basis so that is an opportunity for us and i d say that it s not just unique to france we ve actually seen i called out the fact that we saw improvement in italy in our staffing margin during the quarter as well and we ve been actually making progress in the us as well and i ve talked about experis experis saw an expansion in their gross profit margin during the quarter as well so there definitely is opportunity for us when we look at pricing going forward and we re starting to see that come through and that s actually part of what s happening in terms of our outlook into the first quarter on gp margin as well jonas prising chairman chief executive officer and kevin just to add on your question on pricing what it looks like pricing remains rational overall it s as usual a competitive environment but pricing pressures have not changed and to jack s point we ve seen some positive evolution of our ability to be able to compensate for any direct cost increases through our pricing in a number of markets kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst super thank you both operator thank you and our next question is from the line of hamzah mazari from macquarie capital your line is now open hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst good morning my question is around the cost side maybe just any thoughts as to how much more room you have on the cost side either through technology or consolidation of back office in europe i think us is behind you and the reason i ask is because you had this big restructuring about five years ago i think you took out 180 million of costs so just as you look at the portfolio is there any incremental room on the cost side jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes hamzah i d say yes there definitely is i d really go back to our financial targets and when we talked about our ebitda margin expansion goals one of the key levers that we continue to pull are ongoing efficiencies particularly in our back office processes so you referenced the us we did a lot in the us and we are seeing that as an underlying improvement in our cost structure there that s helping fund the technology investments that we re making and we re looking at that in a very similar way in our other large businesses around the world we did some of that last year in europe and we expect we ll continue to be making advancements in our back office optimization in those key markets and that will continue to be an opportunity for us so in the current environment where we ve seen some deleveraging due to the revenue pressure that we ve seen you can t see that coming out as strongly as it was before but it is happening and it will continue to be an area that gives us some ability to continue to improve the bottom line and fund our technology investments george tong goldman sachs analyst great and then just a follow up question on the experis side i know you ve touched on it but any further color as to what s driving the improvement is that just a market is that just better execution your back filling projects because i know that business had not issues but it was slow relative to what you re seeing now in terms of improvement so just any further color there thank you jonas prising chairman chief executive officer i think it s just a continuation of our improvement in terms of our execution as we ve said before we want to improve the business we want to get to where the market is but we want to get there in the right way so we re gradually executing we re adding recruiters in the areas where we see good demand and overall i think in the us in particular we have continued to see very good demand so it s just a continued progress from improvements in execution jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer and the one item i would just go back to that we ve emphasized in the past as in the us particularly we ve been very focused on growing the right way and growing profitably and we have been emphasizing the expansion of gross profit margin in the experis business in us so we saw a 2 improvement in the rate of decline in the fourth quarter and we are making progress to jonas s point but we re doing it while very focused on gp margin and we expanded that again in the fourth quarter and as i said we do continue to see improvement into the first quarter for experis as well hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks hamzah operator thank you and our next question is from the line of mark marcon from rw baird your line is now open mark marcon robert w baird analyst good morning good cold morning hey with regards to france can you just talk a little bit about what you re seeing in terms of the ongoing impact from the yellow vest protest and to what extent do you think that potentially the fee on changes that are currently scheduled for the fourth quarter could potentially change and then i have a follow up with regards to germany jonas prising chairman chief executive officer good morning mark yes no i was in france last week and so i was of course very interested in hearing what the impact was as it relates to the yellow vest and the impact that has been noted is primarily in the retail sector around the seasonal shopping as well as hospitality i mean those are the two sectors that have been hit quite hard at the end of the year but at this point the protests seem to be well contained they re predictable which means people work around them they don t disrupt working life and president macron ph has instituted a number of initiatives that at least for now appears to have calmed the situation quite a lot so i would say that this is now manageable from the french government s perspective and they have instituted a number of different initiatives to try and placate the part of the population that feels that they ve been left behind we don t know whether any change would happen but i would say the initiatives that the government put in to reduce the pressure on budget did not include any change on the fee on subsidies the way they ve been projected to kick in on the 1st of october and of course i m sure that that was part of the consideration when they looked at how to bridge a budget gap as they made some other changes but at least for now what they have said is that no this is going to happen and the date is the 1st of october and that s as recent as last week with the meetings that i had with government ministers so we feel pretty good about them sticking to that commitment because in the end it is a commitment to make france more competitive by reducing the cost of labor and enabling companies to invest and grow their workforce in france so i don t think that it s likely that it will change at least at this point mark marcon robert w baird analyst okay and then with regards to germany can you just shed a little bit more color with regards to what is the major driver behind the decline i mean i know there s multiple factors including the auto industry and the emissions changes but how would you characterize it and when do you think that we may end up inflicting or is there any light at the end of the tunnel as it relates to germany jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer mark it s jack i d say on germany going back to what we talked about in the third quarter we highlighted the disruption we saw from some of the systems in delivery model changes but we did make progress in the fourth quarter advancing initiatives around that so these are all changes that are going to make our germany business stronger going forward but the reality is we re still working through some of that and we saw some of that trend in the third quarter continue into the fourth quarter in terms of some of that disruption at the same time in the fourth quarter the market deteriorated and that really goes to your point about the auto sector we certainly have a we re very manufacturing focused in germany the auto sector is a big part of our business there no with that being said we actually have seen stabilization as we look in 2000 if we look in 2019 in the first few weeks of january here it stabilized so as i said in my outlook what we re holding right now for the first quarter guidance is what we re seeing as we exit the fourth quarter so a trend similar to the fourth quarter but it is encouraging that we in january have seen stabilization now and i think it s going to be dependent on what happens in the market activity going forward mark marcon robert w baird analyst i guess what i m wondering is from your field people and from your client conversations are you hearing anything about when they think they re basically going to run through the inventory i m specifically talking about the auto factoring and when that potentially ends up turning jonas prising chairman chief executive officer well i think you have germany that is their economic growth has come down pretty sharply and the projections for 19 is of the growth rate is projected to be much lower than it was in 2018 the flip side of that is there s the labor markets are still very strong unemployment is at 3 3 so again in germany the feeling is certainly not of a discussion around a downturn it is more of a slowdown but it s hard to predict when companies are going to feel better i think it hangs together with the overall outlook for europe and global trade with china trade wars potentially with the us being settled so i think that could be an inflection point when that gets resolved mark marcon robert w baird analyst great thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of gary bisbee from bank of america merill lynch your line is now open gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst hi guys good morning i guess the first question so i want to go back to the capital allocation and just get any incremental color you can provide on your appetite for share repurchases and i ask against the context of obviously in 2008 2009 a much more difficult environment but the company basically went two years and halted buybacks and then in 2013 when there was a mild double dip recession in parts of europe there was 18 months without any buybacks both times moving to a net cash position on the balance sheet how do you think about like at what level do you think about moving to that more of a safety mode or is there something different today in how you think about the liquidity the business the balance sheet strength et cetera that might make you act differently if we do see some further weakening thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer gary i d say it is as you refer we have a very strong balance sheet currently so when we look at capital allocation as i mentioned before we continue to think share repurchases are a great way to return cash to our shareholders we do that opportunistically and you ve seen what we ve done in the last two quarters to your point in terms of how we think of that going forward i d go back to what jonas said in terms of his overall points about europe so we continue to think this is a slowdown we don t think we re currently approaching a recessionary environment we re in a recessionary environment in europe at the moment and as a result that s how we think about our balance sheet now with that being said one of our goals is to continue to have a very strong balance sheet and you ve seen us be prudent in the past in the way we look at our overall balance sheet and we ll continue to do that but at the moment we feel very good about our capacity and you saw what we did in the fourth quarter and i d say we ll continue to look at that very opportunistically going forward gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst great thanks then a quick follow up on the french margin just how they re trending the 50 basis points for the change in the regulatory environment you ve talked about but before that and excluding the accrual adjustments should we think that on top of that 50 basis points drag there s beginning to be some more meaningful just deleveraging from the weaker revenue or is some of the price discipline stuff you talked about really limiting that and i guess i m thinking more forward looking than what happened in q4 thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i d say we don t really do a lot in terms of oup margin guidance by specific country gary but what i would say to kind of get to your question is we feel pretty good about the ability to make up some of that pressure we re going to see from the switchover to the new subsidies and france continues to be a pretty efficiently run organization for us so i think we feel good about the opportunity going forward revenue has been the trends we ve seen in revenue certainly over the last couple of quarters has been declining but with that being said we ve seen stabilization in january so we will continue to look at our efficiency on an overall basis i think as we move forward if we were to see more severe revenue declines then as jonas said in his comments we re very very good at looking at our cost structure and making adjustments as needed to protect the oup margin and we would we certainly would consider that if the environment dictated that going forward gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst great thanks i appreciate the commentary operator thank you and our next question is from the line of tim mchugh from william blair your line is now open tim mchugh william blair company analyst yes thanks just a question i guess related to spending but the sales force i recognize you re kind of cutting broadly expenses as you try and drive efficiency but as you see a downturn like this how are you managing kind of your sales resources are you keeping capacity in the hopes this is just a temporary kind of slowdown and not a downturn jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes good morning tim i would so first of all we saw some great performance in growth in latin america asia pacific parts of the americas so clearly in those countries we re adding resources and feel that we have good growth opportunities and we do the same in the us when then it comes to countries where we have a slowdown that we can see is a reduction in demand we manage it very carefully because we know that things can change but of course we are very good at managing productivity and operational excellence as we make sure that we have an expense base that supports the business in the state that it s in and as you could see in the fourth quarter we re actually quite agile in terms of how we can do that and adjust and clearly as we were managing this with our thoughts around it being a slowdown we manage it prudently because we also don t want to miss opportunities in markets even though they might be slowing down now they could come back and also we have opportunities due to the tight labor markets in many of those countries so inaudible could be a good opportunity for us despite the slowing manpower business in some cases as experis and others so it s really it is really the experience of the management been through many different cycles over many years of their tenure in the business that enables us to optimize that those management actions tim mchugh william blair company analyst okay thanks and then just can you elaborate on italy that you made the comment the dignity degree is not having an impact i guess it s more market weakness that you attribute to declines too but i guess what do you inaudible for that jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes that s right tim so first of all of course last year we were coming up against extremely high growth rates so that will be the first observation i would make and then the second observation as you may might have seen this morning italy is now technically in a recession the fourth quarter was in negative territory so the economy is not very good but we feel very good about our business in italy it s well managed our outlook for the first quarter remains positive although with a little bit of a weaker revenue outlook our profitability and our ability to manage our staffing margins is strong so we still feel good about our italian business tim mchugh william blair company analyst okay thanks operator thank you and our next question is from the line of george tong from goldman sachs your line is now open george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning operating margins came in at 4 this quarter which was ahead of guidance part of the improvement came from direct cost adjustments on the gain on sale from your language translation business can you unpack the remainder of the upside drivers this quarter and how these may carry over to 1q margin performance jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes george what i d say is you re right there are a couple of different moving parts there but i guess on the overlying basis what i d say is in the current revenue environment think of it as the underlying running of about 20 basis points down year over year considering the year ago period where we had very strong growth and as we look into the first quarter really i d say that s going to that trend s going to continue about 20 basis points down and we did call out that the first quarter is our latest quarter in terms of revenues and as a result of that our technology spend in the first quarter has another 10 basis points of an impact so think of it that way think of it as an underlying 20 basis points and then the additional technology spend is another 10 in the first quarter george tong goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful in france you indicated that you re seeing evidence of good underlying improvement in the labor market that s helping to offset the regulatory impact can you lay out the timeline over the rest of this year for how you expect regulatory changes to impact growth and margins in basis points and how effectively the underlying environment will offset these headwinds jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer george i was referring to the ability to have discussions with clients regarding bill pay spreads and the opportunity in view of what s happening with the regulatory environment with the changes in the subsidy programs which are additional headwind so that was what i was referring to i think if we look at the outlook for 2019 from a regulatory standpoint i think we know the major components at this stage i think it s going to be the transition of the cic program we have a pretty good handle on that and what i just go back to the point that we have a good opportunity to make up that headwind in france due to ongoing discussions with clients and we re seeing that momentum in the current quarter and we see that trend continuing george tong goldman sachs analyst got it thank you jonas prising chairman chief executive officer okay we have reached the end of our allotted time and that will conclude our call operator thank you everyone and that concludes today s conference thank you for joining and you may now disconnect duration 63 minutes call participants jonas prising chairman chief executive

the federal reserve on wednesday signaled its three year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the us economy due to global headwinds and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations as it held interest rates steady the us central bank also discarded its promises of further gradual increases in interest rates and said it would be patient before making any further moves fed chairman jerome powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks with neither rising inflation or financial stability considered a risk and cross currents including slowing growth overseas and the self inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the u s outlook less certain advertisement we are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong u s macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross currents common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity powell told reporters after the end of a two day policy meeting continued u s economic growth was still the likeliest outcome powell said but was now less certain than a month ago when the fed said the economy was just as likely to grow faster than expected as it was to face a sharp downturn combined with comments that the fed s balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected the fed s meeting this week may mark a somewhat anticlimactic end to its years long battle to normalize monetary policy after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession the current fed policy rate of between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent is well below historical averages and if it goes no higher the fed will have little room to battle any future downturn with rate cuts alone it may also raise questions about whether the fed s shifting stance until recently powell and other officials said monetary policy was unnecessarily loose is a response to pressure from volatile financial markets or president donald trump advertisement trump has repeatedly attacked the fed for raising rates arguing that it was undercutting economic growth powell took advantage of a new regimen of press conferences after every policy meeting to lay out the series of touchy changes and insist the fed was only reacting to economic data not other pressures he termed the fed s new posture one of wait and see not necessarily a hard stop on rate increases but he also made clear the central bank is no longer in any rush after raising rates almost every quarter during the past two years and that absent some threatening rebound of inflation or evidence of risky financial behavior the pause would likely last taken together with the balance sheet announcement the fed s statement gives maximum flexibility to a central bank criticized by investors who saw the fed itself becoming a source of market turbulence that was reflexively tightening policy even as economic risks mounted advertisement this marks a full 180 from what the fed was signaling just a few months ago said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz in newport beach california after the release of the fed s statement u s stocks added to gains with the s p 500 index ending the day about 1 5 percent higher while the dollar and short term yields fell as investors gauged an even lower probability of additional rate hikes any time soon market expectations of future rates fell further contracts tied to the fed s policy rate continued to price about a one in four chance of a hike in 2019 and contracts maturing in 2020 were signaling a small but rising chance of a rate cut then cloudier outlook the fed raised rates four times last year including in december when it signaled it would do so twice more this year advertisement the economic outlook however has become more clouded as a result of recent volatility in financial markets and signs that growth is slowing overseas including in china and the euro zone there are also ongoing concerns about the impact of global trade tensions and fears the recent 35 day partial shutdown of the u s government over a budget dispute may crimp consumer spending in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient in determining future rate hikes the fed s rate setting committee said in its policy statement the fed made no change to the 50 billion maximum monthly runoff of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities from its balance sheet some traders have urged it to slow or halt its pullback from the bond markets at least for now advertisement in a separate statement the fed said it had decided to continue managing policy with a system of ample reserves reinforcing the notion that the rundown may end sooner than expected overall this signals the fed will not be on autopilot going forward said justin lederer treasury analyst at cantor fitzgerald in new york the downgrade in the fed s language around rate increases included a change in its description of economic growth from strong to solid and it noted that market based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months the fed s policy decision was unanimous

adjusted gross profit is a non gaap financial measure that excludes the gain from antitrust litigation settlements certain pharmedium remediation costs lifo expense credit and costs credit related to

are described above and excluded from adjusted operating income in addition the loss on the early retirement of debt is also excluded from adjusted income before income taxes management believes that

from applying a lower u s federal income tax rate to the company s net deferred tax liabilities as of december 31 2017 offset in part by a one time transition tax on historical foreign earnings and

expense credit pharmedium remediation costs costs credit related to the new york state opioid stewardship act acquisition related intangibles amortization employee severance litigation and other and the loss on early retirement of debt in each case net of the tax effect calculated using the applicable effective tax rate for those items in addition the per share impact of tax reform is excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share management believes that this non gaap financial measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the per share impact of the items that are outside the control of the company or that we consider to not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual non operating unpredictable non recurring or non cash nature in addition the company has provided non gaap fiscal year 2019 guidance for diluted earnings per share operating expense operating income and effective income tax rate that excludes the same or similar items as those that are excluded from the historical non gaap financial measures as well as significant items that are outside the control of the company or inherently unusual non operating unpredictable non recurring or non cash in nature in addition it has provided fiscal year 2019 adjusted free cash flow guidance for fiscal year 2019 we have defined the non gaap financial measure of adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities excluding other significant unpredictable or non recurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements minus capital expenditures the company does not provide forward looking guidance on a gaap basis for such metrics because certain financial information the probable significance of which cannot be determined is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated for example lifo expense credit is largely dependent upon the future inflation or deflation of brand and generic pharmaceuticals which is out of the company s control and acquisition related intangibles amortization depends on the timing and amount of future acquisitions which cannot be reasonably estimated similarly the timing and amount of litigation settlements is unpredictable and non recurring

quarter was 2 54 this was a decrease of 18 in constant currency year over year but it actually reflected 25 growth in constant currency compared to the prior year if you exclude the us tax reform related gains that we experienced in the prior year period turning to the full year results for a few moments earnings per share for the year was 8 56 this represented a constant currency increase of 5 over the prior year and an increase of 22 in constant currency excluding the one time benefit of tax reform in the prior year revenues for the year increased 2 in constant currency to 22 billion and operating profit was 797 million which was flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis our fourth quarter results continue to reflect the more challenging market environment especially in europe we experienced declining revenue trends across a number of our european businesses notably in france italy and germany among our larger businesses we re applying strong pricing discipline and are very focused on improved productivity and executing cost mitigation actions in countries experiencing a softening environment at the same time we continue to add resources in markets that provide us with opportunities for profitable growth and invest in our technology initiatives in various countries across the world we participated in the world economic forum in davos last week and as you can imagine the outlook for the european economy was a prominent topic of discussion as was the topic of access to human capital and skills we led many discussions on workforce trends and the impact of ai and technology on the workforce we also shared our latest thought leadership research which generated significant discussion this included the latest research in skills revolution series providing a real time view of the impact of technology on job growth called humans wanted robots need you contrary to media headlines this research shows that organizations that are automating tasks are hiring more people creating more jobs and upskilling their people to perform new and complementary roles to those done by machines augmenting human capability more than replacing it we also launched manpowergroup solutions total workforce index at davos sharing our new digital evolution pathway assessment tool and promoting experience tech academy alongside other workforce solutions for me the biggest takeaway from davos is that despite concerns around lower growth outlook in some parts of the world the importance of the workforce strategy and access to skilled talent is top of mind for most companies our strong manpowergroup value proposition remains highly relevant in this environment as we can support companies execution of the business strategies with our leading global workforce solutions wherever they are we know the skills revolution is in full flow and we have an important opportunity and role to play in solving the talent shortage for companies by upskilling and reskilling people for them to stay employable today and in the future turning back to our digital transformation we have previously discussed many of the technology initiatives we have implemented over the past years and continue to advance our investments in technology is core to our strategy of maintaining our leadership and workforce solutions and enabling our teams to help clients and candidates win through better data insights and innovative delivery models 2018 was a year of significant investment and progress in advancing our digital capabilities 2019 will be no different as we continue implementing world class front office systems cloud based and mobile applications as well as other enhancements to our global technology infrastructure across a number of our markets we re also investing in the digitalization of our workforce solutions offerings to ensure our clients have access to the best class workforce analytics and tools and with that i would like to turn it over to jack to provide additional financial information and a review of our segment results and our first quarter outlook jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jonas turning back to fourth quarter results as jonas as mentioned we experienced a challenging revenue environment in the fourth quarter operating profit declined 4 on a constant currency basis this performance resulted in an operating profit margin of 4 which exceeded our guidance range a revenue decline of 1 in constant currency came in at the lower end of our constant currency guidance range our gross profit margin declined 30 basis points year over year which also exceeded our guidance range as we experienced favorable direct cost accrual adjustments particularly in france during the quarter our sg a was well managed during the quarter and included a benefit from a gain on disposition of a non core business which i ll cover in more detail breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail our reported revenue decline of 4 includes the negative currency impact on a constant currency basis our revenue decline was 1 acquisitions contributed about 20 basis points to our growth rate in the quarter and as we had an extra billing day the organic constant currency days adjusted revenue decline was 2 the revenue decline was primarily driven by various businesses in europe most notably in france germany and the netherlands i will discuss this further in the segment review s turning to the epf bridge on a reported basis earnings per share was 2 54 starting with our guidance eps midpoint of 2 19 improved operational performance contributed 0 12 driven by france we sold our non core language translation business in the netherlands during the quarter which resulted in a gain of 8 million which contributed 0 10 the other income expenses contributed 0 9 as equity pickup losses on investments related to our past ownership interests in our switzerland franchise we re more than offset by other foreign currency adjustments and non controlling interest income related to our china joint venture foreign currency translation impact was 0 06 worse than the estimated in guidance a lower effective tax rate contributed 0 04 and lower weighted average shares resulting from repurchases during the quarter contributed 0 06 looking at our gross profit margin in detail our gross margin came in at 16 3 staffing interim margin declines drove the 30 basis points reduction in the overall gross margin year over year although we experienced a loss of cice subsidy in france for the month of december as expected which represented 30 basis points of margin at the consolidated level this was largely offset by favorable direct cost adjustments in france the remaining 30 basis point decline represented the underlying gross profit margin trend in the fourth quarter next let s review our gross profit by business line during the quarter the manpower brand comprised 63 of gross profit our experienced professional business comprised 20 manpowergroup solutions comprise 14 and right management 3 during the quarter our manpower brand reported a 4 decrease in gross profit on a constant currency basis this represents a decrease from the 1 constant currency growth rate in the third quarter this was driven by declines in germany the uk the us the netherlands sweden italy and spain among our larger countries within our manpower brand approximately 60 of the gross profit is derived from light industrial skills and 40 is derived from office and clerical skills gross profit from staffing within light industrial skills decreased during the quarter while office in clerical skills experienced a slight increase in the rate of growth in the quarter gross profit in our experienced brand decrease 1 on a constant currency basis year over year this represented a decrease from the flat constant currency growth rate achieved in the third quarter the decrease was primarily driven by the netherlands sweden and australia manpowergroup solutions includes our global market leading rpo and msp offerings as well as talent based outsourcing solutions including proservia our european it infrastructure and end user support business msp offerings as well as talent based outsourcing solutions including serbia ph our european it infrastructure and end user support business gross profit growth in the quarter was up 2 in constant currency which represents a decrease from the 8 constant currency growth rate achieved in the third quarter driven by lower rpo and proservia activity which was partially offset by strong msp activity in the quarter our pipeline for rpo and msp opportunities is strong into 2019 while management experienced a decline in gross profit of 5 in constant currency during the quarter as our outplacement activity continued to decline this represents an improvement from the 8 constant currency decline experienced in the third quarter i will comment further on right management in my segment review sga expense was 662 million a decrease of 35 million from the prior year this included a year over year reduction of 22 million from currency changes 1 million increase from acquisitions a 5 million decrease from operations and a decrease of 8 million related to the gain on the sale of our language translation business in the netherlands sga expenses as a percentage of revenue in the quarter represented 12 3 and after excluding the gain on sale it represented 12 4 this result reflects our focus on operational efficiency across our businesses during a challenging revenue environment while we continue to implement new technology across a number of operations globally the americas segment comprise 19 of consolidated revenue revenue in the quarter was 1 billion representing 2 growth year over year in constant currency inaudible of 53 million represented a decrease of 3 in constant currency driven by the us which i will discuss next similarly oup margin decreased by 30 basis points year over year the us is the largest country in the americas segment comprising 61 of segment revenues revenue in the us was 632 million down 5 compared to the prior year this represented a slight decline from the 4 decrease in the third quarter during the quarter oup for our us business decreased 13 to 33 million and oup margin was 5 2 a reduction of 50 basis points from the prior year driven by the manpower business which i will discuss next within the us the manpower brand comprise 42 of gross profit during the quarter revenue for the manpower brand in the us was down 70 in the quarter which represented a decline from the third quarter trend largely due to the non recurrence of seasonal holiday activity associated with select clients although the us manpower business experience decreased holiday activity in the fourth quarter we expect to see improvement in the trend in the first quarter due to new business wins and improved trends the experis brand in the us comprise 35 of gross profit in the quarter with in experis in the us it skills comprise approximately 70 percent of the revenues during the quarter our experis revenues declined 6 from the prior year compared to the 8 decline experienced in the third quarter experis us has been very focused on profitable business and this resulted in gross profit margin expansion during the quarter experis us experienced an improved december and we expect to see continued improvement in the revenue trend in the first quarter manpowergroup solutions in the us contributed 23 of gross profit and experienced 9 revenue growth in the quarter which was an improvement from the 5 growth in the third quarter we continue to see good opportunities for growth in both our higher value msp and our rpo solutions in the us our mexico operation had 9 constant currency revenue growth in the quarter the business in mexico continue to perform well in the quarter and we expect good growth into the first quarter revenue in argentina was up 14 in constant currency which continues to reflect the impact of inflation we are operatingin argentina in a disciplined and cautious manner in view of the hyper inflationary environment as a result billable hours were down 16 year over year in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on margin and payment terms improvement due to the extended duration of the high inflationary environment we have been reducing billable hours for many quarters in argentina and the business has become less significant to the region as a result beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we will replace the separate revenue trend reporting for argentina business with our canada business which is now larger than our argentina business our canada business represented 7 of the segment revenues during the quarter and experienced a constant currency revenue growth rate of 17 in the quarter capping off a year of very strong performance revenue growth in the other countries within americas was up 17 in constant currency or 12 on an organic basis this growth was driven primarily by the very strong revenue growth in canada which i just referenced as well as solid growth in colombia brazil and peru southern europe revenue comprise 43 of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue in southern europe came in at 2 3 billion a decrease of 1 in constant currency this represented a decline from the 2 constant currency revenue growth rate in the third quarter driven by revenue declines in france italy and spain oup decreased 2 in the prior year in constant currency and oup margin decreased 10 basis points which was driven by italy italy had strong performance but was running against very high 31 percent days adjusted growth rate in the prior year period france experienced better than expected profitability which i will discuss next france revenue comprised 62 of the southern europe segment in the quarter and declined 2 from the prior year in constant currency on the billing days adjusted constant currency basis revenues declined 3 in the first three weeks of january we continue to see activity levels that reflected 2 to 3 revenue decline year over year as discussed on the previous quarters earnings call transition from cic program at the end of 2018 to the new subsidy program in january of 2019 resulted in the loss of the december cic subsidy as expected the cice related gross profit loss in the fourth quarter was offset by favorable direct cost to cool ph adjustments in the quarter this drove a better than expected level of profit in france and oup was 81 million an increase of 3 percent in constant currency and oup margin was up 30 basis points in constant currency to 5 7 permanent recruitment growth was 5 percent in constant currency during the quarter we have incorporated the current trend of a 3 days adjusted decline into our first quarter revenue guidance during the previous quarters earnings call i provided a detailed description of the anticipated impact of the new subsidy program on our france gross profit in 2019 the preliminary budget was passed as expected in december and as a result our guidance remains unchanged in summary this item is expected to result in a reduction of our gdp margin in france of about 50 basis points in the first three quarters of 2019 and beginning in the fourth quarter after the incremental inaudible subsidies are received the reduction would then represent about 15 basis points going forward similar to our successful effort in 2019 to offset a large part of the scheduled cice decrease we will again strive to offset the net impact in 2019 with ongoing initiatives revenue in italy decreased 3 in constant currency to 404 million on a billing days adjusted constant currency basis revenues declined 5 italy also experienced a non recurrence of select client holiday related activity in the fourth quarter that contributed to the revenue decline we saw another consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in the staffing gross profit margin trend in italy during the fourth quarter permanent recruitment represented 6 growth in the quarter oup margin represented 7 our italy business is performing well in a more challenging economic environment as we continue to anniversary very high growth we expect a low to mid single digit percentage revenue decline into the first quarter we continue to believe that the dignity decree legislation in italy is manageable and we do not expect this legislation to influence our revenue trend significantly in spain revenues also decreased 3 in constant currency or 5 on a billing days adjusted basis we expect spain will have a similar level of revenue performance in the first quarter our northern europe segment comprise 24 percent of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue was down 7 in constant currency to 1 3 billion this represents a decrease from the 4 constant currency decline in the third quarter primarily driven by germany the netherlands and the uk oup decreased 6 in constant currency and oup margin was flat to the prior year included within oup is the previously referenced onetime gain of 8 million related to the sale of our language translation business in the netherlands the underlying decrease in oup was driven by germany and to a lesser extent the netherlands as discussed last quarter in addition to the declining market environment our germany business has also experienced reduced revenues and incremental costs associated with technology and operational improvement initiatives our largest market in northern europe segment is the uk which represented 31 of segment revenue in the quarter uk revenues decreased 3 in constant currency and represented a 4 decrease on a billing days adjusted constant currency basis this represents a decline from the flat growth in the third quarter our manpower business in the uk experienced a 13 constant currency revenue decline in the fourth quarter which included reductions in production from large automotive clients as mentioned last quarter conversely our experis business experience another quarter of revenue improvement and improved their constant currency revenue growth rate to 16 in the fourth quarter we expect the overall revenue trend for the uk business to experience a high single digit percentage decline in revenue in the first quarter due to the reduced volume in the large automotive client and to a lesser degree reduced activity in a few other select clients revenue in germany declined 18 on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter or 21 on a billing days adjusted basis this represented a further decline from the 14 constant currency decrease in the third quarter although we made progress during the quarter advancing key initiatives which will strengthen our business in germany we continued to experience further declines in the fourth quarter market activity in germany has been very difficult to estimate and as a result our revenue guidance for the first quarter is being set at the january today trends which approximate our fourth quarter rate of decline in the nordics we experienced the 1 constant currency revenue growth during the fourth quarter or adjusted for billing days a 2 growth rate this represents an improvement from the 3 decline in the third quarter norway has been the driver of the improved revenue growth we expect norway to continue to perform well in the first quarter which will offset the soft revenue environment in sweden for the nordics overall we expect to see a similar rate of revenue growth in the first quarter revenue in the netherlands decreased 15 in constant currency on a billing days adjusted basis during the fourth quarter this representative declined from the 4 decrease in the third quarter we had anticipated a further decline in the fourth quarter as our language translation business was a fee based business the sale in december 2018 will have a modest impact on the revenue trend in the netherlands going forward we expect the first quarter revenue trend will be similar to the fourth quarter trend belgium experienced revenue growth of 1 in constant currency during the fourth quarter this represented an improvement from the billing days adjusted 1 constant currency decline in the third quarter our belgium business has been performing as expected and we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter other markets in northern europe had a revenue decline of 1 in constant currency the asia pacific middle east segment comprises 13 of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue was up 9 in constant currency to 732 million representing a decrease from the 10 growth rate in the third quarter permanent recruitment growth was 3 in constant currency oup was 27 million in the quarter representing flat growth in constant currency and oup margin decreased 30 basis points driven by gross profit margin mix as staffing gross profit increased at a greater rate than permanent recruitment fees revenue growth in japan was up 4 on a constant currency basis or 2 adjusting for billing days and represented a slight decrease in the rate of growth in the third quarter japan experienced gross profit margin expansion year over year as a result of underlying improvement in staffing margin oup and oup margin improved once again during the fourth quarter in japan we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter on the billing days adjusted basis revenues in australia and new zealand decreased 1 in constant currency which represented a decline from the 6 revenue growth in the third quarter this was driven by the timing of certain client volumes and we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter revenue in other markets in asia pacific middle east continued to be very strong up 17 in constant currency and represents a continuation of the third quarter revenue trend this was a result of strong double digit growth in a number of markets including operations in india greater china thailand malaysia and vietnam our greater china business which is operated through a joint venture owned a majority stake in a china based payrolling firm with the minority stake held by the founder as this activity was no longer considered core we sold the majority ownership stake to its founder in december 2018 and since then no longer consolidate the results of this business the impact of the disposition on oup was not significant in the fourth quarter and due to the low margin nature of this business it s not expected to significantly impact future oup trends in the apme region however the revenue trend will be impacted as a result our first quarter revenue guidance for apme will provide an additional organic constant currency growth rate to exclude the impact of this disposition separately our china joint venture in which we own a controlling interest continues to perform very well it has become a leader in china for higher margin workforce solutions and permanent recruitment we are pleased with our progress in china and are working closely with our jv partner on future market expansion opportunities our right management business experienced a 4 constant currency revenue decline in the fourth quarter this was driven by reduced outplacement activity the rate of revenue decline represents an improvement from the 7 constant currency decline in the third quarter and represents three consecutive quarters of improvement lower gross profits driven oup decreased 10 on a constant currency basis and the oup margin declined by 130 basis points i ll now turn to cash flow and balance sheet free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures was 418 million for the full year compared to 346 million in the prior year the fourth quarter experienced positive free cash flow of 156 million which compared to 99 million in the year ago period at quarter end day sales outstanding increased by two days consistent with prior quarters changes in our business mix have driven some of the overall dso increase we continue to execute our initiatives to improve the trend of dso capital expenditures represented 65 million during 2018 during the quarter we purchased 2 6 million shares of stock for 202 million bringing total purchases for the year to 5 7 million shares for 501 million as of december 31st we have 3 1 million shares remaining for repurchase under the 6 million share program approved in august of 2018 our balance sheet was strong at quarter end with cash of 592 million and total debt of 1 08 billion bringing our net debt to 483 million our debt ratios are very comfortable at quarter end with total debt to trailing twelve months adjusted ebitda of 1 2 and total debt to total capitalization at 28 our debt and credit facilities did not change in the quarter at quarter end we had a 500 million euro note outstanding with an effective interest rate of 1 8 maturing in june of 2026 and the 400 million euro note with an effective interest rate of 1 9 maturing in september of 2022 in addition we have a revolving credit agreement for 600 million which remained unused next i ll review our outlook for the first quarter of 2019 we are forecasting earnings per share to be in the range of 1 30 to 1 38 which includes a negative impact from foreign currency of 0 13 per share our constant currency revenue guidance range is a decline between 3 and 5 the impact of dispositions represents 50 basis points of our decline in the first quarter there are slightly fewer billing days in the first quarter as a result this represents a billing days adjusted organic constant currency revenue decline of 3 at the midpoint this represents the current trends in key markets particularly europe and the anniversary of higher growth rates in various markets from a segment standpoint we expect constant currency revenue growth in the americas to be in the flat to low single digits with declines in southern europe in the low to mid single digits we expect a revenue decline in northern europe in the high single digit range with about 70 basis points of the decline representing the recent disposition in the netherlands we expect organic revenue growth in asia pacific middle east in the low single digits as the impact of the china related disposition decreases first quarter revenues by about 4 we expect the constant currency revenue decline for the apme region in the first quarter in the low single digits we expect a revenue decline in right management in the low single digits our operating profit margin during the first quarter should be down 30 basis points which includes an incremental 10 basis points of increased costs and global technology related initiatives compared to the year ago period as we mentioned last year our global effective tax rate increases in 2019 due to the discontinuation of the tax exempt cice program in france we expect our global effective tax rate to approximate 34 for 2019 we expect our income tax rate in the first quarter to approximate 37 there have been reports that the government of france is considering deferring the scheduled 2 decrease in their corporate tax rate in 2019 as this has not been enacted we have not incorporated this into our guidance should france enact this change it would increase our global effective tax rate by 50 basis points as usual our guidance does not incorporate additional share repurchases and we estimate our weighted average shares to be 61 5 million reflecting share repurchases through december 31st our guidance also does not include any restructuring charges or estimate for hyperinflationary accounting related foreign currency gains or losses related to our argentina business with that i d like to turn it back to jonas jonas prising chairman chief executive officer thanks jack we see our q1 trends essentially similar to what we saw at the end of 2018 we don t know how long the current slowdown in some european markets will continue having said that we know permanent recruitment demand remains strong in many markets and companies looking for more operational and strategic flexibility in a more uneven uncertain environment will be looking for skills that our manpower business provides as companies invest in new digital infrastructure it creates demand for the technology skills that experis provides and finally we continue to see good opportunities to deliver our market leading manpowergroup solutions offerings in many european markets and support people transition to new careers with our right management offerings we also believe the us market will provide us with opportunities for revenue improvement in 2019 in addition our emerging market footprints continues to provide a solid growth outlook our diversified geographic footprint and business mix should provide us with opportunities to generate new business in growth markets against slowing business in some markets experiencing headwinds we will balance our investments in those markets that provide us with growth opportunities and always look for operational excellence cost optimization and productivity initiatives especially where we are experiencing softening demand lastly i want to take this opportunity to thank the entire manpowergroup team for their great engagement and disciplined execution in 2018 and we look forward to building on that progress in 2019 and beyond our people are the reason we were recently named one of fortune magazine s 2019 world s most admired companies for the 17th time also receiving top scores for social responsibility and global competitiveness this accolade is a testament to our people who are delivering on our commitment to help our clients win in the changing world of work while connecting millions of people to meaningful and sustainable employment every year and with that i would now like to open the call for q a operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from the line of andrew steinerman from jpmorgan your line is now open andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst good morning jonas and jack jonas you mentioned that you don t know when you ll see stability in europe instead of giving kind of the timing of when could you give us a sense of sort of what has to happen for you to see stability in europe and then another comment that caught my ear in your final remarks was that you saw opportunity for growth in manpower us which has been a segment of turnaround for you did you mean that kind of give us a timeline of when you think that segment could grow jonas prising chairman chief executive officer hey morning andrew this is the headquarters of the polar vortex so we re looking out at some very cold weather here and your first question on the outlook for europe and the timing of course that s difficult now we re in two consecutive quarters you might have seen the numbers from the eurozone growth at 0 2 for both of those quarters so it s all going to be a question of resolving some of the uncertainties that are related to trade brexit and some of the political issues that might be in some of the european countries but overall i would say to give you a sense of what our conversations with clients are like this still feels very much like a slowdown and not the beginning of the downturn because by the same token of looking back at the past quarters with lower economic growth in the eurozone you re looking at labor markets that are still that are now at a 10 year low in terms of unemployment so that s positive that s why we think we will have opportunities in a number of our brands in countries across europe and also when you look at the projected outlook for growth for the year it is significantly higher than what the current run rate is so if that were to happen there should be some good opportunities for a pickup and the question is of course when that would happen but our conversations with our clients still feel very much like a slowdown and not a downturn related to the question in the us we still think of the us as a good market for revenue improvement for us and we believe that we ll see some revenue improvements in the manpower business we were very pleased to see that experis continued to improve also in the fourth quarter so we think this is one of the markets where we ll have some good opportunities and we re adding recruiters here in the us because we think the market will be good here in the us andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of jeff silber from bmo capital markets your line is now open jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thanks so much i wanted to start actually focusing on right management can you just remind us what percentage of that business comes from europe and is the european business growing there would we expect that to be growing considering what s going on in that environment jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jeff i would say the biggest parts of the business are in us we have seen good progress in europe and it has been an opportunity for us the uk is a market where we have some concentration as well so i d say still trends overall trends are still being driven by the us predominantly but we ve actually seen very good opportunities in europe and we continue to see that as an area of opportunity particularly in 2019 as we look at the pipeline jonas prising chairman chief executive officer and even in 2018 jeff the europe is the best performing business in our right management business globally so you are seeing a reflection of some of this environment come through in the performance of that business jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great and then shifting over to just your capital allocation strategy given what s going on are there any major changes here over the next few quarters are you going to hold back on m a repurchasing stock is that something you might be accelerating your thoughts would be really appreciated jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jeff in terms of capital allocation i guess i d start by saying we really haven t changed our strategy at all it remains the same if there is acquisition activity that goes first that will be a use of free cash flow to your point there hasn t been and if there isn t then we re going to continue to look at share repurchases as a vehicle to return cash to our shareholders and you saw what we did in the fourth quarter and with share repurchases we do continue to do that opportunistically so we don t have a set amount that we declare that we have to do each quarter and we ll continue that approach going forward jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst all right great thanks so much operator thank you and our next question is from the line of kevin mcveigh from credit suisse your line is now open kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst great thanks hey nice job on the margins overall could you just remind us what the it sounds like there is a bit of an offset of an accrual against ccie headwind what was that and should we expect that kind of sensitivity over the course of 2019 jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes kevin regarding the gross profit margin impacts what we anticipated was the loss of the december cice in france and we called out that we expect that that would be about a 30 basis point drag in the fourth quarter what we effectively had were direct cost adjustments that pretty much canceled that out so on an underlying basis we re really where the reported amount is about 30 basis points down the majority of those direct cost adjustments came out of france there s always direct cost adjustments as part of the normal process but there was one larger one in france related to training fund accruals which was one of the bigger items but i would characterize it as more of a one off i wouldn t anticipate that that s going to be a trend that continues into future periods kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst got it and then just as this cice runs off how have the pricing conversations gone with clients around kind of the headwind on that or just any thoughts on pricing in general jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer so i would say in france particularly one of the items we ve seen in recent quarters if you put the cice decrease aside in 2018 we ve actually seen good underlying improvement so our objective is to try and offset the regulatory impacts and we did that in 2018 in a very successful way and we re continuing to see progress there for 2019 so i called out the change to the new subsidy the headwind that that will create of about 50 basis points and we re optimistic that we re going to continue to be able to offset part of that pressure as well doing the same things we ve been doing so i d say from that perspective it continues to be a good labor market and in view of the regulatory changes we are actually having good progress on bill pay spreads on an overall basis so that is an opportunity for us and i d say that it s not just unique to france we ve actually seen i called out the fact that we saw improvement in italy in our staffing margin during the quarter as well and we ve been actually making progress in the us as well and i ve talked about experis experis saw an expansion in their gross profit margin during the quarter as well so there definitely is opportunity for us when we look at pricing going forward and we re starting to see that come through and that s actually part of what s happening in terms of our outlook into the first quarter on gp margin as well jonas prising chairman chief executive officer and kevin just to add on your question on pricing what it looks like pricing remains rational overall it s as usual a competitive environment but pricing pressures have not changed and to jack s point we ve seen some positive evolution of our ability to be able to compensate for any direct cost increases through our pricing in a number of markets kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst super thank you both operator thank you and our next question is from the line of hamzah mazari from macquarie capital your line is now open hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst good morning my question is around the cost side maybe just any thoughts as to how much more room you have on the cost side either through technology or consolidation of back office in europe i think us is behind you and the reason i ask is because you had this big restructuring about five years ago i think you took out 180 million of costs so just as you look at the portfolio is there any incremental room on the cost side jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes hamzah i d say yes there definitely is i d really go back to our financial targets and when we talked about our ebitda margin expansion goals one of the key levers that we continue to pull are ongoing efficiencies particularly in our back office processes so you referenced the us we did a lot in the us and we are seeing that as an underlying improvement in our cost structure there that s helping fund the technology investments that we re making and we re looking at that in a very similar way in our other large businesses around the world we did some of that last year in europe and we expect we ll continue to be making advancements in our back office optimization in those key markets and that will continue to be an opportunity for us so in the current environment where we ve seen some deleveraging due to the revenue pressure that we ve seen you can t see that coming out as strongly as it was before but it is happening and it will continue to be an area that gives us some ability to continue to improve the bottom line and fund our technology investments george tong goldman sachs analyst great and then just a follow up question on the experis side i know you ve touched on it but any further color as to what s driving the improvement is that just a market is that just better execution your back filling projects because i know that business had not issues but it was slow relative to what you re seeing now in terms of improvement so just any further color there thank you jonas prising chairman chief executive officer i think it s just a continuation of our improvement in terms of our execution as we ve said before we want to improve the business we want to get to where the market is but we want to get there in the right way so we re gradually executing we re adding recruiters in the areas where we see good demand and overall i think in the us in particular we have continued to see very good demand so it s just a continued progress from improvements in execution jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer and the one item i would just go back to that we ve emphasized in the past as in the us particularly we ve been very focused on growing the right way and growing profitably and we have been emphasizing the expansion of gross profit margin in the experis business in us so we saw a 2 improvement in the rate of decline in the fourth quarter and we are making progress to jonas s point but we re doing it while very focused on gp margin and we expanded that again in the fourth quarter and as i said we do continue to see improvement into the first quarter for experis as well hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks hamzah operator thank you and our next question is from the line of mark marcon from rw baird your line is now open mark marcon robert w baird analyst good morning good cold morning hey with regards to france can you just talk a little bit about what you re seeing in terms of the ongoing impact from the yellow vest protest and to what extent do you think that potentially the fee on changes that are currently scheduled for the fourth quarter could potentially change and then i have a follow up with regards to germany jonas prising chairman chief executive officer good morning mark yes no i was in france last week and so i was of course very interested in hearing what the impact was as it relates to the yellow vest and the impact that has been noted is primarily in the retail sector around the seasonal shopping as well as hospitality i mean those are the two sectors that have been hit quite hard at the end of the year but at this point the protests seem to be well contained they re predictable which means people work around them they don t disrupt working life and president macron ph has instituted a number of initiatives that at least for now appears to have calmed the situation quite a lot so i would say that this is now manageable from the french government s perspective and they have instituted a number of different initiatives to try and placate the part of the population that feels that they ve been left behind we don t know whether any change would happen but i would say the initiatives that the government put in to reduce the pressure on budget did not include any change on the fee on subsidies the way they ve been projected to kick in on the 1st of october and of course i m sure that that was part of the consideration when they looked at how to bridge a budget gap as they made some other changes but at least for now what they have said is that no this is going to happen and the date is the 1st of october and that s as recent as last week with the meetings that i had with government ministers so we feel pretty good about them sticking to that commitment because in the end it is a commitment to make france more competitive by reducing the cost of labor and enabling companies to invest and grow their workforce in france so i don t think that it s likely that it will change at least at this point mark marcon robert w baird analyst okay and then with regards to germany can you just shed a little bit more color with regards to what is the major driver behind the decline i mean i know there s multiple factors including the auto industry and the emissions changes but how would you characterize it and when do you think that we may end up inflicting or is there any light at the end of the tunnel as it relates to germany jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer mark it s jack i d say on germany going back to what we talked about in the third quarter we highlighted the disruption we saw from some of the systems in delivery model changes but we did make progress in the fourth quarter advancing initiatives around that so these are all changes that are going to make our germany business stronger going forward but the reality is we re still working through some of that and we saw some of that trend in the third quarter continue into the fourth quarter in terms of some of that disruption at the same time in the fourth quarter the market deteriorated and that really goes to your point about the auto sector we certainly have a we re very manufacturing focused in germany the auto sector is a big part of our business there no with that being said we actually have seen stabilization as we look in 2000 if we look in 2019 in the first few weeks of january here it stabilized so as i said in my outlook what we re holding right now for the first quarter guidance is what we re seeing as we exit the fourth quarter so a trend similar to the fourth quarter but it is encouraging that we in january have seen stabilization now and i think it s going to be dependent on what happens in the market activity going forward mark marcon robert w baird analyst i guess what i m wondering is from your field people and from your client conversations are you hearing anything about when they think they re basically going to run through the inventory i m specifically talking about the auto factoring and when that potentially ends up turning jonas prising chairman chief executive officer well i think you have germany that is their economic growth has come down pretty sharply and the projections for 19 is of the growth rate is projected to be much lower than it was in 2018 the flip side of that is there s the labor markets are still very strong unemployment is at 3 3 so again in germany the feeling is certainly not of a discussion around a downturn it is more of a slowdown but it s hard to predict when companies are going to feel better i think it hangs together with the overall outlook for europe and global trade with china trade wars potentially with the us being settled so i think that could be an inflection point when that gets resolved mark marcon robert w baird analyst great thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of gary bisbee from bank of america merill lynch your line is now open gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst hi guys good morning i guess the first question so i want to go back to the capital allocation and just get any incremental color you can provide on your appetite for share repurchases and i ask against the context of obviously in 2008 2009 a much more difficult environment but the company basically went two years and halted buybacks and then in 2013 when there was a mild double dip recession in parts of europe there was 18 months without any buybacks both times moving to a net cash position on the balance sheet how do you think about like at what level do you think about moving to that more of a safety mode or is there something different today in how you think about the liquidity the business the balance sheet strength et cetera that might make you act differently if we do see some further weakening thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer gary i d say it is as you refer we have a very strong balance sheet currently so when we look at capital allocation as i mentioned before we continue to think share repurchases are a great way to return cash to our shareholders we do that opportunistically and you ve seen what we ve done in the last two quarters to your point in terms of how we think of that going forward i d go back to what jonas said in terms of his overall points about europe so we continue to think this is a slowdown we don t think we re currently approaching a recessionary environment we re in a recessionary environment in europe at the moment and as a result that s how we think about our balance sheet now with that being said one of our goals is to continue to have a very strong balance sheet and you ve seen us be prudent in the past in the way we look at our overall balance sheet and we ll continue to do that but at the moment we feel very good about our capacity and you saw what we did in the fourth quarter and i d say we ll continue to look at that very opportunistically going forward gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst great thanks then a quick follow up on the french margin just how they re trending the 50 basis points for the change in the regulatory environment you ve talked about but before that and excluding the accrual adjustments should we think that on top of that 50 basis points drag there s beginning to be some more meaningful just deleveraging from the weaker revenue or is some of the price discipline stuff you talked about really limiting that and i guess i m thinking more forward looking than what happened in q4 thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i d say we don t really do a lot in terms of oup margin guidance by specific country gary but what i would say to kind of get to your question is we feel pretty good about the ability to make up some of that pressure we re going to see from the switchover to the new subsidies and france continues to be a pretty efficiently run organization for us so i think we feel good about the opportunity going forward revenue has been the trends we ve seen in revenue certainly over the last couple of quarters has been declining but with that being said we ve seen stabilization in january so we will continue to look at our efficiency on an overall basis i think as we move forward if we were to see more severe revenue declines then as jonas said in his comments we re very very good at looking at our cost structure and making adjustments as needed to protect the oup margin and we would we certainly would consider that if the environment dictated that going forward gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst great thanks i appreciate the commentary operator thank you and our next question is from the line of tim mchugh from william blair your line is now open tim mchugh william blair company analyst yes thanks just a question i guess related to spending but the sales force i recognize you re kind of cutting broadly expenses as you try and drive efficiency but as you see a downturn like this how are you managing kind of your sales resources are you keeping capacity in the hopes this is just a temporary kind of slowdown and not a downturn jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes good morning tim i would so first of all we saw some great performance in growth in latin america asia pacific parts of the americas so clearly in those countries we re adding resources and feel that we have good growth opportunities and we do the same in the us when then it comes to countries where we have a slowdown that we can see is a reduction in demand we manage it very carefully because we know that things can change but of course we are very good at managing productivity and operational excellence as we make sure that we have an expense base that supports the business in the state that it s in and as you could see in the fourth quarter we re actually quite agile in terms of how we can do that and adjust and clearly as we were managing this with our thoughts around it being a slowdown we manage it prudently because we also don t want to miss opportunities in markets even though they might be slowing down now they could come back and also we have opportunities due to the tight labor markets in many of those countries so inaudible could be a good opportunity for us despite the slowing manpower business in some cases as experis and others so it s really it is really the experience of the management been through many different cycles over many years of their tenure in the business that enables us to optimize that those management actions tim mchugh william blair company analyst okay thanks and then just can you elaborate on italy that you made the comment the dignity degree is not having an impact i guess it s more market weakness that you attribute to declines too but i guess what do you inaudible for that jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes that s right tim so first of all of course last year we were coming up against extremely high growth rates so that will be the first observation i would make and then the second observation as you may might have seen this morning italy is now technically in a recession the fourth quarter was in negative territory so the economy is not very good but we feel very good about our business in italy it s well managed our outlook for the first quarter remains positive although with a little bit of a weaker revenue outlook our profitability and our ability to manage our staffing margins is strong so we still feel good about our italian business tim mchugh william blair company analyst okay thanks operator thank you and our next question is from the line of george tong from goldman sachs your line is now open george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning operating margins came in at 4 this quarter which was ahead of guidance part of the improvement came from direct cost adjustments on the gain on sale from your language translation business can you unpack the remainder of the upside drivers this quarter and how these may carry over to 1q margin performance jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes george what i d say is you re right there are a couple of different moving parts there but i guess on the overlying basis what i d say is in the current revenue environment think of it as the underlying running of about 20 basis points down year over year considering the year ago period where we had very strong growth and as we look into the first quarter really i d say that s going to that trend s going to continue about 20 basis points down and we did call out that the first quarter is our latest quarter in terms of revenues and as a result of that our technology spend in the first quarter has another 10 basis points of an impact so think of it that way think of it as an underlying 20 basis points and then the additional technology spend is another 10 in the first quarter george tong goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful in france you indicated that you re seeing evidence of good underlying improvement in the labor market that s helping to offset the regulatory impact can you lay out the timeline over the rest of this year for how you expect regulatory changes to impact growth and margins in basis points and how effectively the underlying environment will offset these headwinds jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer george i was referring to the ability to have discussions with clients regarding bill pay spreads and the opportunity in view of what s happening with the regulatory environment with the changes in the subsidy programs which are additional headwind so that was what i was referring to i think if we look at the outlook for 2019 from a regulatory standpoint i think we know the major components at this stage i think it s going to be the transition of the cic program we have a pretty good handle on that and what i just go back to the point that we have a good opportunity to make up that headwind in france due to ongoing discussions with clients and we re seeing that momentum in the current quarter and we see that trend continuing george tong goldman sachs analyst got it thank you jonas prising chairman chief executive officer okay we have reached the end of our allotted time and that will conclude our call operator thank you everyone and that concludes today s conference thank you for joining and you may now disconnect duration 63 minutes call participants jonas prising chairman chief executive officer jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer andrew steinerman jpmorgan

nokia corporation financial report for q4 and full year 2018 tweet nokia corporation financial statement release january 31 2019 at 08 00 cet 1 nokia corporation financial report for q4 and full year 2018 nokia delivers strong growth and improved profitability in q4 strategic momentum in software and enterprise board of directors plans to propose a dividend of eur 0 20 per share for 2018 up 5 compared to eur 0 19 for 2017 this is a summary of the nokia corporation financial report for q4 and full year 2018 published today the complete financial report for q4 and full year 2018 with tables is available at www nokia com financials investors should not rely on summaries of our financial reports only but should review the complete financial reports with tables rajeev suri president and ceo on q4 2018 results nokia ended the year with a strong fourth quarter we saw the second consecutive quarter of year on year sales growth across all five of our networks business groups as well as improved profitability in both networks and nokia technologies the execution of our strategy also proceeded well with the work we have put into building a solid foundation for nokia software showing clear results and our enterprise business rapidly becoming a pillar of growth looking forward i expect nokia s performance to strengthen for the full year 2019 versus 2018 and our view of a fast and meaningful shift to 5g remains unchanged given that 5g rollouts will be staggered over the course of the year we expect 2019 to have a soft first half followed by a much more robust second half over the longer term we expect a virtuous cycle of investment where operators update their networks across multiple domains from optical to macro radio fixed wireless access to cloud core small cells to ip routing network agnostic software and more following this we expect a second wave where industrial customers will invest in private wireless technology including lte and 5g ready networks with our end

our robust topline performance reflects the strong competitiveness across our portfolio and that our strategy execution is tracking well we maintained good momentum with strong 5g customer engagement in all key markets particularly strong performance in nokia software and solid performance in our enterprise business non ifrs diluted eps in q4 2018 was eur 0 13 compared to eur 0 13 in q4 2017 particularly strong execution in q4 enabled us to achieve our full year 2018 operational guidance with year on year operating profit growth in networks as well as in nokia technologies on a recurring basis non ifrs diluted eps increased by eur 0 02 year on year on a recurring basis driven by our gross profit performance and continued operating expense reduction partially offset by foreign exchange hedging and higher income tax expenses reported diluted eps in q4 2018 was eur 0 03 compared to negative eur 0 07 in q4 2017 primarily driven by lower income tax expenses and our gross profit performance partially offset by lower one time licensing net sales foreign exchange hedging and higher financial expenses in q4 2018 net cash and current financial investments increased sequentially by approximately eur 1 2bn and we ended 2018 with a strong financial position in q4 2018 net cash from operating activities benefitted from strong seasonality and positive changes in net working capital consequently recurring free cash flow for full year 2018 was slightly negative annual distribution to shareholders the dividend to shareholders is nokia s principal method of distributing earnings to shareholders over the long term nokia targets to deliver an earnings based growing dividend by distributing approximately 40 to 70 of non ifrs diluted eps taking into account nokia s cash position and expected cash flow generation beginning with the distribution for 2018 nokia plans to pay dividends in quarterly installments in addition nokia intends to implement a dividend fee for american depository receipt adr holders for 2018 nokia s board of directors plans to propose that the annual general meeting in 2019 authorizes the board to resolve on the maximum annual distribution of eur 0 20 per share compared to eur 0 19 for 2017 to be paid quarterly during the authorization period unless the board decides otherwise for a justified reason the board would make separate resolutions on each distribution and such resolutions would be separately disclosed following the annual general meeting 2019 and in connection with our financial reports for q2 q3 and q4 the annual distribution would be paid as quarterly dividends from retained earnings and or assets from the fund for invested unrestricted equity at the end of 2018 the distributable funds on the statement of financial position of the parent company amounted to eur 17 393 million including eur 15 197 million of invested unrestricted equity the board proposal to the annual general meeting will be published in connection with other proposals later in the spring new financial reporting structure beginning q1 2019 nokia announced organizational changes to accelerate its strategy execution on october 25

allocates resources as of the first quarter 2019 nokia will have three reportable segments i networks ii nokia software and iii nokia technologies in addition nokia will disclose segment level data

service providers ii enterprises and iii licensees net sales by region will be provided at the nokia level to provide a basis for comparison nokia will present a recasting of financial results on an unaudited basis for all four quarters of 2018 prior to publishing its q1 2019 financial report note that certain reclassifications will be made in order to reflect the new organizational structure of the company the most significant of which are i activities related to our cloud core offering will be reclassified from the former mobile networks business group and former global services reportable segment to the new nokia software reportable segment and ii activities related to the former mobile networks business group and former global services reportable segment that are not reclassified to

acceptances of certain projects particularly related to 5g based on the evolving readiness of the 5g ecosystem and the staggered nature of 5g rollouts in lead countries we expect full year 2019 to follow a similar pattern as full year 2018 a soft first half followed by a robust second half with a particularly weak q1 new commentary our expectation that we will improve our r d productivity and reduce support function costs through the successful execution of our cost savings program potential mergers or acquisitions by our customers our product and regional mix and macroeconomic industry and competitive dynamics net sales and operating margin for nokia technologies is expected to be influenced by factors including the timing and value of new and existing patent licensing agreements with smartphone vendors automotive companies and consumer electronics companies results in brand and technology licensing costs to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and the regulatory landscape additionally our outlook is based on the following assumptions nokia s recurring free cash flow is expected to improve over the longer term due to lower cash outflows related to restructuring and network equipment swaps and improved operational results over time non ifrs financial income and expenses to be an expense of approximately eur 300 million in full year 2019 and over

in q4 2018 excluding approximately eur 60 million eur 210 million in q4 2017 of one time licensing net sales grew by 6 year on year with growth across all five of our networks business groups as well as in nokia technologies driven by particularly strong execution in our networks business our order backlog was strong at the end of q4 2018 and we continue to see strong customer engagement related to 5g across multiple parts of our portfolio including radio cloud core transport ip routing and network agnostic software we continued to build momentum in our end to end strategy including good performance converting our sales pipeline into net sales at the end of q4 2018 approximately 41 of our sales pipeline was comprised of cross business group deals we also made progress with our strategy to diversify and grow with particularly strong performance in nokia software and continued solid performance in our enterprise business in our networks business higher operating expenses were due to customer trials related to 5g as well as higher pre sales expenses to drive future growth and higher returns partially offset by the benefits from our cost savings program and lower incentive accruals in nokia technologies the decrease in net sales on a year on year basis was primarily due to lower one time licensing net sales on a recurring basis we maintained our strong track record with 11 year on year growth also we continued to make good progress in patent licensing extending our patent licensing agreement with samsung and signing a new patent license agreement with oppo further validating our global licensing program nokia non ifrs diluted eps amounted to eur 0 13 compared to eur 0 13 in the year ago period non ifrs diluted eps increased by eur 0 02 year on year on a recurring basis the increase in non ifrs diluted eps on a recurring basis was primarily driven by higher gross profit across all three reportable segments of our networks business and improved recurring gross profit performance in nokia technologies as well as lower operating expenses in nokia technologies partially offset by a net negative fluctuation in other income and expense related to foreign exchange hedging higher income tax expenses and higher financial expenses nokia reported diluted eps amounted to eur 0 03 compared to negative eur 0 07 in the year ago period primarily driven by lower income tax expenses related to the re measurement of deferred tax assets which resulted in deferred tax expenses and allowances of eur 143 million compared to eur 738 million in the fourth quarter 2017 in addition nokia reported diluted eps was driven by higher gross profit across all three reportable segments of our networks business and improved recurring gross profit performance in nokia technologies partially offset by a net negative fluctuation in other income and expense related to foreign exchange hedging and higher financial expenses nokia january december 2018 compared to

our global licensing program nokia reported operating loss amounted to eur 59 million compared to an operating profit of eur 16 million in the year ago period this was primarily driven by lower gross profit across all three reportable segments in our networks business lower one time licensing net sales in nokia technologies and a negative impact from foreign exchange hedging this was partially offset by lower restructuring and associated charges and lower impairment of assets nokia reported diluted eps amounted to negative eur 0 10 compared to negative eur 0 26 in the year ago period this was primarily driven by lower income tax expenses related to the re measurement of deferred tax assets which resulted in deferred tax expenses and allowances of eur 155 million compared to eur 815

company stated we ve started off our 2019 fiscal year with a strong first quarter and we expect our momentum will continue through the whole year as we transitioned into the winter heating season the operating teams in our utility and pipeline and storage businesses have our pipeline systems ready to safely deliver natural gas to the more than 750 000 customers within our service territories and across the northeast ensuring that homes and businesses continue to benefit from the reliability of natural gas when needed most our operations employees were also able to provide mutual aid to other northeast utilities that recently experienced operational issues on their systems in our exploration and production and gathering operations both quarterly production and gathering throughput continue to grow at a healthy clip and we re on track to achieve our targeted production growth while also growing our earnings and cash flows with a balanced portfolio of long term sales and transportation contracts and line of sight on incremental transportation capacity out of the basin we remain focused on efficiently developing both the marcellus and utica shale horizons across our more than 700 000 acre fee owned acreage position in the western development area as has been the case for decades across our operations we remain focused on prudently deploying capital driving shareholder value with the development of our integrated assets and returning capital to shareholders through our long standing dividend fiscal 2019 guidance national fuel is tightening and raising its full year earnings guidance for fiscal 2019 the company is now projecting that earnings on a non gaap basis will be within the range of 3 45 to 3 65 per share or 3 55 per share at the midpoint of the range the 0 05 per share increase from the midpoint of the previous guidance range reflects the impact of actual results for the three months ended december 31 2018 and updates to key forecast assumptions including natural gas and oil prices the company is also reaffirming its guidance for its exploration and production segment s fiscal 2019 net production of 210 to 230 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe which represents a 24 percent increase over fiscal 2018 at the midpoint of the range projections for consolidated and individual segment capital expenditures are also unchanged the revised earnings guidance range does not include the impact of certain items that impacted the comparability of earnings during the first quarter including 1 the remeasurement of deferred income taxes resulting from the 2017 tax reform act which reduced the company s income tax expense and benefited consolidated earnings in the first quarter by 0 06 per share 2 the full year impact of the exploration and production segment s unrealized gain on hedging ineffectiveness which increased earnings by 0 06 per share in the first quarter 3 2 million or 0 03 per share of the unrealized gain relates to hedge contracts that will settle during the remaining nine months ending september 30 2019 and 3 the unrealized loss on other investments due to the change in an accounting rule discussed on page 6 which lowered earnings by 0 06 per share while the company expects to record additional adjustments to one or more of these items during the remaining nine months ending september 30 2019 the amounts of these and other potential adjustments are not reasonably determinable at this time as such the company is unable to provide earnings guidance other than on a non gaap basis additional details on the company s forecast assumptions and business segment guidance for fiscal 2019 are outlined in the table on page 8 discussion of results by segment the following discussion of the earnings of each operating segment is summarized in a tabular form on pages 9 and 10 of this report it may be helpful to refer to those tables while reviewing this discussion note that management defines adjusted operating results as reported gaap earnings adjusted for items impacting comparability and adjusted ebitda as reported gaap earnings before the following items interest expense income taxes depreciation depletion and amortization other income and deductions impairments and other items reflected in operating income that impact comparability the 2017 tax reform act which was passed during the prior year first quarter reduced the statutory federal tax rate and resulted in the remeasurement of the company s deferred income taxes for the company s non rate regulated activities the net decrease in the company s deferred income taxes lowered income tax expense and benefited the prior year first quarter consolidated earnings by 111 0 million or 1 29 per share a removal of a valuation allowance related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes from the 2017 tax reform act during the current year first quarter lowered income tax expense and benefited consolidated earnings by 5 0 million or 0 06 per share the remeasurement of deferred income taxes due to 2017 tax reform which was a significant driver of the company s first quarter segment gaap earnings when compared to the prior year is outlined in the tables below that reconcile gaap earnings to adjusted operating results by segment upstream business exploration and production segment the exploration and production segment operations are carried out by seneca resources company llc seneca seneca explores for develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves primarily in pennsylvania and california three months ended

production segment s first quarter gaap earnings decreased 68 5 million versus the prior year driven primarily by the impact of 2017 tax reform on deferred taxes discussed above and the net impact of unrealized gains and losses that were recognized due to hedge accounting ineffectiveness see further discussion below excluding these items the exploration and production segment s first quarter earnings increased 2 4 million as higher natural gas production and better realized crude oil prices were partially offset by the negative impacts of lower realized natural gas prices lower crude oil production and higher operating expenses seneca s first quarter net production was 49 2 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe an increase of 9 1 bcfe or 23 percent from the prior year natural gas production increased 9 7 billion cubic feet bcf or 27 percent due primarily to production from new marcellus and utica wells completed and connected to sales in pennsylvania seneca increased production by 5 7 bcf in the eda lycoming area where development was timed to fill interstate pipeline capacity contracted on the atlantic sunrise project which went in service during the quarter production from the wda clermont area increased 3 3 bcf due to increased utica development seneca s average realized natural gas price after the impact of hedging and transportation costs was 2 61 per thousand cubic feet mcf a decrease of 0 11 per mcf from the prior year the decline in seneca s average realized natural gas price is primarily attributable to the expiration of physical firm sales and financial hedge contracts over the past 12 months that had favorable pricing relative to firm sales and hedges settled in the current quarter offset partially by improved realizations on unhedged production tied to nymex and sold into the spot markets in pennsylvania seneca s oil production for the first quarter decreased 101 thousand barrels mbbl due largely to the impact of the sale of seneca s sespe properties in california in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 seneca s average realized oil price after the impact of hedging was 61 70 per barrel bbl an increase of 1 91 per bbl over the prior year the improvement in oil price realizations was due primarily to higher market prices for west texas intermediate wti crude oil during the quarter and stronger price differentials relative to wti at local sales points in california the improving local price differentials also required seneca to record the net 6 5 million unrealized mark to market gain on its wti and brent financial swap contracts due to accounting rules on measuring hedge ineffectiveness total operating expenses increased 14 4 million during the first quarter lease operating and transportation loe expense increased 2 9 million due mostly to higher gathering expenses in appalachia resulting from the increase in natural gas production partially offset by lower operating costs in california

company stated we ve started off our 2019 fiscal year with a strong first quarter and we expect our momentum will continue through the whole year as we transitioned into the winter heating season the operating teams in our utility and pipeline and storage businesses have our pipeline systems ready to safely deliver natural gas to the more than 750 000 customers within our service territories and across the northeast ensuring that homes and businesses continue to benefit from the reliability of natural gas when needed most our operations employees were also able to provide mutual aid to other northeast utilities that recently experienced operational issues on their systems in our exploration and production and gathering operations both quarterly production and gathering throughput continue to grow at a healthy clip and we re on track to achieve our targeted production growth while also growing our earnings and cash flows with a balanced portfolio of long term sales and transportation contracts and line of sight on incremental transportation capacity out of the basin we remain focused on efficiently developing both the marcellus and utica shale horizons across our more than 700 000 acre fee owned acreage position in the western development area as has been the case for decades across our operations we remain focused on prudently deploying capital driving shareholder value with the development of our integrated assets and returning capital to shareholders through our long standing dividend fiscal 2019 guidance national fuel is tightening and raising its full year earnings guidance for fiscal 2019 the company is now projecting that earnings on a non gaap basis will be within the range of 3 45 to 3 65 per share or 3 55 per share at the midpoint of the range the 0 05 per share increase from the midpoint of the previous guidance range reflects the impact of actual results for the three months ended december 31 2018 and updates to key forecast assumptions including natural gas and oil prices the company is also reaffirming its guidance for its exploration and production segment s fiscal 2019 net production of 210 to 230 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe which represents a 24 percent increase over fiscal 2018 at the midpoint of the range projections for consolidated and individual segment capital expenditures are also unchanged the revised earnings guidance range does not include the impact of certain items that impacted the comparability of earnings during the first quarter including 1 the remeasurement of deferred income taxes resulting from the 2017 tax reform act which reduced the company s income tax expense and benefited consolidated earnings in the first quarter by 0 06 per share 2 the full year impact of the exploration and production segment s unrealized gain on hedging ineffectiveness which increased earnings by 0 06 per share in the first quarter 3 2 million or 0 03 per share of the unrealized gain relates to hedge contracts that will settle during the remaining nine months ending september 30 2019 and 3 the unrealized loss on other investments due to the change in an accounting rule discussed on page 6 which lowered earnings by 0 06 per share while the company expects to record additional adjustments to one or more of these items during the remaining nine months ending september 30 2019 the amounts of these and other potential adjustments are not reasonably determinable at this time as such the company is unable to provide earnings guidance other than on a non gaap basis additional details on the company s forecast assumptions and business segment guidance for fiscal 2019 are outlined in the table on page 8 discussion of results by segment the following discussion of the earnings of each operating segment is summarized in a tabular form on pages 9 and 10 of this report it may be helpful to refer to those tables while reviewing this discussion note that management defines adjusted operating results as reported gaap earnings adjusted for items impacting comparability and adjusted ebitda as reported gaap earnings before the following items interest expense income taxes depreciation depletion and amortization other income and deductions impairments and other items reflected in operating income that impact comparability the 2017 tax reform act which was passed during the prior year first quarter reduced the statutory federal tax rate and resulted in the remeasurement of the company s deferred income taxes for the company s non rate regulated activities the net decrease in the company s deferred income taxes lowered income tax expense and benefited the prior year first quarter consolidated earnings by 111 0 million or 1 29 per share a removal of a valuation allowance related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes from the 2017 tax reform act during the current year first quarter lowered income tax expense and benefited consolidated earnings by 5 0 million

unrealized gains and losses that were recognized due to hedge accounting ineffectiveness see further discussion below excluding these items the exploration and production segment s first quarter earnings increased 2 4 million as higher natural gas production and better realized crude oil prices were partially offset by the negative impacts of lower realized natural gas prices lower crude oil production and higher operating expenses seneca s first quarter net production was 49 2 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe an increase of 9 1 bcfe or 23 percent from the prior year natural gas production increased 9 7 billion cubic feet bcf or 27 percent due primarily to production from new marcellus and utica wells completed and connected to sales in pennsylvania seneca increased production by 5 7 bcf in the eda lycoming area where development was timed to fill interstate pipeline capacity contracted on the atlantic sunrise project which went in service during the quarter production from the wda clermont area increased 3 3 bcf due to increased utica development seneca s average realized natural gas price after the impact of hedging and transportation costs was 2 61 per thousand cubic feet mcf a decrease of 0 11 per mcf from the prior year the decline in seneca s average realized natural gas price is primarily attributable to the expiration of physical firm sales and financial hedge contracts over the past 12 months that had favorable pricing relative to firm sales and hedges settled in the current quarter offset partially by improved realizations on unhedged production tied to nymex and sold into the spot markets in pennsylvania seneca s oil production for the first quarter decreased 101 thousand barrels mbbl due largely to the impact of the sale of seneca s sespe properties in california in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 seneca s average realized oil price after the impact of hedging was 61 70 per barrel bbl an increase of 1 91 per bbl over the prior year the improvement in oil price realizations was due primarily to higher market prices for west texas intermediate wti crude oil during the quarter and stronger price differentials relative to wti at local sales points in california the improving local price differentials also required seneca to record the net 6 5 million unrealized mark to market gain on its wti and brent financial swap contracts due to accounting rules on measuring hedge ineffectiveness total operating expenses increased 14 4 million during the first quarter lease operating and transportation loe expense increased 2 9 million due mostly to higher gathering expenses in appalachia resulting from the increase in natural gas production partially offset by lower operating costs in california following the sale of seneca s sespe properties general and administrative g a expense increased 1 6 million due mainly to higher personnel costs depreciation depletion and amortization dd a expense increased 7 3 million due to the increase in production and a higher per unit depletion rate property franchise and other taxes increased 2 8 million due to higher impact fees in pennsylvania which

this item the pipeline and storage segment s first quarter earnings increased 0 7 million as higher operating revenues lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate were partially offset by higher operating expenses operating revenues increased 1 8 million versus the prior year due primarily to other revenues recorded during the quarter for funds received relating to the early termination of a transportation contract operation and maintenance o m expense increased 4 0 million over the prior year due primarily to an increase in compressor and facility maintenance activity during the quarter higher long term incentive compensation expense and the impact in the prior year of the reversal of a reserve for preliminary engineering and survey costs relating to projects in development the combined 0 7 million increase in dd a expense and property franchise and other taxes was due to projects and new facilities placed in service over the past year the 2017 tax reform act

pipeline capacity on the atlantic sunrise project throughput on the covington and clermont gathering systems increased 1 4 bcf and 4 1 bcf respectively operating expenses increased 1 3 million during

was due primarily to higher margin operating revenues less purchased gas expense lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate the increase in the utility s margin was largely attributable to the impacts of higher usage and weather on residential and commercial customer margins also contributing to the increase were revenues relating to the recovery of the segment s increased capital investment in its distribution system under a system modernization mechanism interest expense decreased 0 9 million due primarily to the company s early refinancing of an 8 75 percent coupon 10 year note that was set to mature in may 2019 the 2017 tax reform act lowered the company s statutory federal income tax rate from a blended 24 5 percent in fiscal 2018 to 21 percent in fiscal 2019 which

excluding this item the energy marketing segment s first quarter net loss of 0 5 million was a decrease of 1 7 million over the prior year earnings of 1 2 million the decrease is due largely to lower margins operating revenues less purchased gas costs nfr s customer margins were negatively impacted by stronger natural gas prices at local purchase points relative to nymex based customer sales contracts the average cost per mcf of gas purchased on a spot basis at local purchase points increased 42 percent during the quarter compared to the average increase in nymex monthly settlement prices of 24 percent corporate and all other corporate and all other operations had a combined loss of 0 2 million for the current year first quarter which was 13 7 million lower than the loss of 13 9 million for prior year first quarter the decrease in the loss was primarily attributable to the impact of the 2017 tax reform act which resulted in a remeasurement of deferred income taxes that increased prior quarter income tax expense by 15 1 million a removal of a valuation allowance related to the 2017 tax reform act during the quarter ended december 31 2018 resulted in an adjustment to corporate and all other s remeasured deferred income taxes and lowered current quarter income tax expense by 3 3 million this increase in earnings was partially offset by the impact of 6 3 million of

outlook we will close with q a and with that i ll now turn the call over to dirk dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer thank you shep and good afternoon last september at our investor day i shared with you our long term strategy to refocus the company on sustainable top line growth which we saw as a natural evolution from our more cost and margin oriented strategy over the last five years this new strategy leverages our unique difference from other food companies which is our strong global presence our iconic brands and our leaner supply model but above all what really sets us apart in today s difficult food environment is our unique position as a global snacking leader because we are in snacking we are not in general food we are also all over the world not just in north america and we have global and local brands that have unique place in consumer s mind as such we are a truly global company operating in attractive large and growing markets and in those markets we have a strong manufacturing distribution and marketing network this means for instance that our scale and strong presence in emerging markets is an asset and a competitive advantage as an example in the fourth quarter our emerging markets grew at 6 5 and around 6 for the full year more than 40 of this was volume mix driven indicating that consumers around the world consume more on the go snacks and treats we connect with consumers in those markets through a portfolio of powerful global brands as well as local items and in each market we also strive to be the industry leader in understanding consumers to advance insights and analytical capabilities during the last five years we ve gone through a significant restructuring and a cost focused approach which has created a solid foundation for investment these strengths of our company are amplified through our unique group of people who have an incredible capability to really make a difference when they put their minds to it witness to that has been our margin improvement over the last five years 2018 was my first full year as ceo i joined in november 2017 and today i feel good about what we have achieved in that short term in the first half of 2018 we developed a new strategy that we think will make a difference in the second half we started to execute against that strategy and that has translated into good results and momentum going into 2019 so we are pretty excited about our future this new strategy creates more growth by focusing on three pillars first is a new more consumer centric marketing and sales second an obsession with operational excellence to optimize our demand fulfillment but also to drive efficiency and lower our costs and third there is a step change in our corporate culture from short term cost focus to a purpose driven long term growth focus the combination of these three levels of growth creation will lead to what is an attractive long term financial algorithm 3 plus organic net revenue growth high single digit adjusted eps growth dividend growth that exceeds adjusted eps growth and over 3 billion of yearly free cash flow now in switching to the highlights of the year i would characterize 2018 as a strong year for mondelez we met or exceeded our financial and strategic commitments we accelerated our top line growth with a good balance between volume mix and price our execution in emerging markets drove 6 growth our local brands are showing improvements as we balance investment with our global brands we expanded adjusted gross profit dollars in q4 by approximately 5 on a constant currency basis this was due to solid productivity volume leverage and a good balance of pricing net of costs we also delivered another year of double digit adjusted eps growth which brings our five year average to 18 per year our focus on turning profit into cash flow and returning capital to shareholders also paid off 2018 was a year of strong free cash flow generating 2 9 billion of cash and returning more than 3 billion to investors we continued our commitment to our impact strategy and announced all our packaging will be recyclable by 2025 i believe this strong 2018 financial performance is just a first indication of what is the potential of this company now maybe a few words on our progress against that new strategy i was talking about before as 2018 came to a strong close i am pleased to see that many of the elements of our new approach are being put in place so let me take you may be through a few highlights 2019 will be the first full year of increased investment in our growth agenda but as we saw good momentum as q4 progressed we made additional investments in a c and go to market to give you a few examples we put incremental a c behind areas like chocolate in india which grew double digits biscuits in china where we saw mid single digit growth chocolate and biscuits in russia which increased double digit for the year biscuits and chocolates in germany with low single digit overall country growth for the year or chocolates in the uk which posted low single digit growth oreo in the us which posted high single digit increase for the year or we invested in our recent mexico oreo chocolate launch which has received very positive feedback from our customers we have also further invested in our research development and quality capabilities in q4 we opened a new r d technical center in india to drive innovation in chocolate and beverages and we also expanded our state of the art facility in wroclaw poland with further investment in gum and candy research capabilities the creation of the snackfutures innovation hub will help us explore future trends and opportunities we are also pleased with our recent acquisition of the tate s premium cookies business which delivered another quarter of strong double digit growth as a second big step in accelerating our consumer centric growth we launched our new marketing playbook which drives shifts in several areas of our commercial approach while in the past we focused mostly on our global brands in our new strategy we are achieving a better balance between investment in global brands like oreo milka and belvita and local jewels like fontaneda in spain or lu in france freia marabou in the nordics kinh do in vietnam the combination of those two is generating stronger growth than focus on global brands alone all combined our brands drove overall organic net revenue growth of 2 5 for the quarter in our second strategic pillar which is all about driving operational excellence we also started to show good progress particularly as it relates to excellence in our sales channels to give you some recent examples we ve launched initiatives to drive e commerce excellence with key partners in china where online sales were up strong double digit and overall growth in china was mid single digits in india we are making significant enhancements to our sales and route to market excellence where we also grew double digits we are making similar shifts to tap into the significant opportunities in other emerging markets such as africa southeast asia russia and mexico where our investments are accelerating growth as you know in recent quarters we have put particular focus on our north american supply chain performance where we are aiming to significantly improve its operational excellence q4 was a good quarter where our gradual improvement continued in the right direction an important enabler of our future growth is our third pillar of building a winning growth culture at the start of 2019 we implemented a new more locally oriented commercial structure with 13 business units within our existing regional framework this shift reduces our complexity improves our speed and encourages more entrepreneurial approaches to marketing sales and product development we are encouraging our colleagues to test learn and scale which means we are implementing a faster more cost effective and locally driven approach to innovation we are also changing our incentive structure to drive better overall alignment with our key financial metrics of volume and revenue growth gross profit progression and solid translation into earnings and cash flow there is also a stronger direct link to local performance versus overall global performance and another important change here is that we are refocusing the organization on volume and absolute profit dollar growth we are also making sure that the quality of the financial results is taken into account into our incentives to further enhance this new consumer oriented but also performance based culture we launched the new purpose of the company empower people to snack right we believe this will lead to higher engagement as well as new ideas on how we will fulfill our vision of being the best and biggest snacking company one of the expressions of our new purpose is to make sure we offer the consumer the right snack made the right way for example in this quarter we added brazil to the cocoa life program which is our signature sustainability approach in chocolates and we also announced the commitment to make all our packaging around the world recyclable by 2025 so in summary i find that 2018 was a strong year for us which has created good momentum in the business as we head into 2019 we are building on this momentum by increasing our investment behind key initiatives this includes continuing to invest in our brands and portfolio to capture opportunities in broader snacking as well as driving further growth through innovation we are also focusing our investment in higher growth geographies and under indexed channels we will amplify this growth by continuing to work on improving execution across our business and i am also very excited by the energy that our new growth focused culture is creating across the organization our tangible progress and the proof points i see around the world of how we are accelerating sustainable growth underscore my belief and confidence that we are in the right segment with the right footprint and the right portfolio snacking is an attractive and growing global trend and we are well positioned to continue to lead the industry let me now turn to luca for more detail on our q4 and full year performance luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer thank you dirk and good afternoon it was a good quarter and a good year as we delivered on all our key financial metrics for both periods especially as it relates to organic top line growth earnings growth and free cash flow generation we are also pleased with the quality of the delivery throughout the year we had generated broad based growth with a good balance of volume and pricing gross profit on a constant currency basis grew more than revenue in both q4 and the full year in q4 we also started accelerating some investments to further support our brands so we feel good about the momentum we had coming into 2019 as our teams executed well and made progress toward our strategic roadmap net revenue increased 2 4 for the full year and 2 5 for the fourth quarter our strong emerging market footprint propelled our growth for the year delivering an increase of nearly 6 with clear trends in russia india china southeast asia mexico and africa in fact brazil was the only notable emerging market where results were soft excluding argentina emerging markets grew 4 5 on a regional basis and for the full year europe continues to execute well as it delivered net revenue growth of 2 5 consistent with recent years this growth was volume driven and broad based with solid increases across biscuits chocolate and candy russia posted double digit revenue growth behind share gains in both biscuits and chocolate while germany delivered another solid year of growth our chocobakery business continues to demonstrate the power of test and learn innovation and excellent execution turning in high single digit growth for the year and approaching 600 million in annual sales we are pleased with our capabilities in this region and encouraged regarding the opportunity that remain in front of us amea grew 3 5 and is accelerating with strength coming from several key markets india delivered double digit growth powered by great execution robust market dynamics share gains and innovation in chocolate and biscuit china posted its sixth consecutive quarter of growth increasing mid single digits behind continued momentum and share gains in biscuits and gum southeast asia also turned in robust growth propelled by demand for biscuit and chocolate including a strong mooncake season in q4 we are also pleased with the progress we are making in africa latin america grew 3 6 impacted by inflation driven growth in argentina however we delivered another good year in mexico posting mid single digit growth as our gum and candy business executed well we also delivered growth in the western andean cluster brazil declined low single digits primarily due to competitive dynamics in our powdered beverage business earlier in the year the business was also impacted by a national strike however we delivered positive results in our brazilian biscuits business which grew mid single digits behind strengths in club social and oreo and although down for the year the chocolate business finished on a positive note with low single digit growth in q4 and share gains north america grew approximately 0 5 for the year us biscuits continued to see good momentum with low single digit growth and share gains driven by brands like oreo we are proud that the team delivered material progress for the quarter that said there is still work to be done to drive improved levels of consistency and we continue to expect progress in 2019 albeit not linear now let s review our profit performance in 2018 gross profit dollars grew by approximately 4 on a constant currency basis and ahead of revenue gains were driven by continued productivity volume leverage and pricing we look to build on this progress over the long term gross profit growth partially offset by additional investment drove adjusted operating income dollar expansion of more than 6 on a constant currency basis this translated into operating income margin of 16 7 up 60 basis points in q4 consistent with our long term strategy we invested additional dollars in growth initiatives including point of sales and holiday season activations in europe and asia a c investments in europe and mexico chocolate and investments in china and russia biscuit to sustain and accelerate momentum additionally we spent in some r d and marketing areas on a regional basis gross margin expansion and cost execution drove margin improvement europe grew 60 basis points to 19 6 north america was flat at 20 3 as higher conversion costs in us factories and customer service and logistics cost limited expansion latin america increased by 90 basis points to 16 4 and amea improved by 140 basis points to 14 4 i ll now briefly cover category highlights our three snacking categories continue to demonstrate solid growth as they have all year growing at 2 7 this is the strongest they have been in three years and we remain encouraged by the underlying trends and untapped opportunities overall we held or gained share in 60 of our business year to date biscuits grew 2 8 approximately 80 of our revenue grew or held share in this category including our us france china germany and russia businesses in chocolate our business grew 3 5 approximately 40 of our revenue grew or held share including germany russia china and india the percent of businesses growing or holding shares was 50 in q4 and it is further improving in the latest period gum and candy growth was slightly positive reflecting modestly improved results in developed markets about 40 of our revenue in this business gained or held share including strength in china gum and solid us candy performance now turning to earnings per share as is mentioned 2018 was another year of strong adjusted eps growth increasing 15 on a constant currency basis these results were driven primarily by strong operating gains share repurchases taxes with our jv investments also performing well i ll now move on to our free cash flow results for the year we executed with excellence and delivered 2 9 billion of free cash flow which was consistent with our outlook and a great outcome despite currency headwinds this performance was driven by better net income conversion due to strong working capital management as i mentioned at our investor day this is a critical focus area for me my team and the entire company turning to capital return 2018 also marked another year of significant return of capital to our shareholders we returned 3 4 billion in total as we repurchased 2 billion in stock and paid 1 4 billion in dividends this includes an 18 increase to our cash dividends in q3 as we continue to target dividend growth in excess of earnings now let me provide some details around our outlook for 2019 which remains consistent with what we provided at our investor day last fall i d like to remind you that this is an important year of investment as we continue to focus on accelerating volume driven revenue growth for the long term for the top line we expect organic net revenue growth of 2 to 3 with respect to earnings we expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 3 to 5 which reflects a step up in investment levels in a c sales r d and quality these investments will reinforce a growth cycle which we expect to lead to a high single digit earnings growth over the long term our outlook for the free cash flow is approximately 2 8 billion consistent with our results in 2018 recall this outlook includes additional cash tax impact resulting from us tax reform in this outlook we also expect our 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the low 20s and expect interest expense to be approximately 450 million reflecting the increasing rate environment 2019 is an important year for mondelez international it will mark the first full year of our new approach to investing behind our strategic growth initiatives our new approach will set the stage for our long term growth algorithm of 3 plus organic net revenue growth with a ramp up in the outer years high single digit adjusted eps dividends greater than adjusted earnings and free cash flow of more than 3 billion with that let s open the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays andrew lazar barclays bank analyst good afternoon everybody dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer hi andrew luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer hi andrew andrew lazar barclays bank analyst hi two questions from me if i could i ll start with dirk you ve been in the ceo seat for just over a year now and recently detailed the company strategy and growth algorithm along with a new organizational structure to support it i m trying to get a sense of how you re feeling about the company s momentum heading into this year and i ask with particular interest in terms of organic sales trends because you ve got incremental pricing that you ve announced incremental investments that we saw in both 4q and then expect it again throughout this year i guess if anything it would seem like the organic sales growth target for this year perhaps could end up as a bit conservative and i wanted to get your perspective on that and then i have a quick follow up dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer okay ok so well i would say a few reflections on how i feel after about a year and three months in the job probably the most important for me was to deliver 2018 and i think we over delivered on what we said we would do and the quality i think was good if i think about it we accelerated our net revenue growth which was volume driven and you said that we also had some good price discipline we continue to focus on our cost and so we had good gross profit growth and roi and eps growth was solid as well as the free cash flow generation and on top we were able to start reinvesting in q4 to sustain the accelerated growth so i feel good about all that second as you pointed out we developed our new strategy and financial algorithm for the company which creates growth on the three levels said more demand creation to a new approach to sales and marketing more demand fulfillment through better execution and then new ideas and innovation through a different mindset or a different culture in the company there s a number of big shifts in the company one is about the balance between top and bottom line not just focus on the bottom line dollars over percentage focus speed over perfection and a stronger focus on volume and market share and it s giving us momentum as you said and so that confirms my observation that we have good potential because snacking categories are doing well they ve been probably the best in the last three years in 2018 we ve got good margin expansion and we have good competitive levels that allow us to unlock investment and shift our focus to volume growth and we can generate substantial free cash flow so yeah of course that makes you think you re stronger than you were a few years back why are you guiding toward the 2 3 top line growth and yes we have momentum in emerging markets and if i think about 2018 and the mix of the pluses and the minuses that we had overall we probably had a few more pluses as you remember the main driver of it was that we are lapping the malware year of 2017 so 2019 is a year that we need to even if we guide toward that 2 3 we need to step up our growth and we need to solidify our progress if i would look at today and reflect about 2019 probably the mix of risks and opportunities raise it a little bit more toward risk i m talking largely the macroeconomics brexit some of the commodity things we are seeing and so we also are stepping up and we are probably will point that out our investments we re doing it largely so that 2020 will be the year that we are starting to see some good growth so we feel that 2019 outlook is appropriate but we are clearly entering the year with a bit of good momentum andrew lazar barclays bank analyst great i ll leave it there thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel christopher growe stifel nicolaus company analyst hi good evening luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer hi chris christopher growe stifel nicolaus company analyst hi i had a question for you you ve had a pretty strong sustainable growth in your categories over the past few years and including in 2018 it seems like that category growth rates continue and i think it was up 2 7 for your snacking categories is that what you would expect for 2019 as well dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yes yes that s in our long term strategic plan we estimated that we will be circling around the 3 growth and we are at this stage we will not see that 2 7 has been sort of consistent throughout 2018 what we were saying and we are not seeing an immediate change for that and going into 2019 so yeah we reconfirm that christopher growe stifel nicolaus company analyst okay and then as you look at your margin performance in 2019 i know there is a much more heavier focus on reinvestment and accelerating revenue growth so you have cost savings coming through from simplified to grow and then i suspect you re going to have some more is it mostly sg a investments so could we see a stronger gross margin performance and then maybe some of that given back if you will in the form of sg a investments when it comes to a c and route to market that kind of thing is that the way to think about the investment levels in 2019 luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer so chris i think look as we said many times we are trying to create a little bit of a cultural shift in the company and moving away from simple percentages the clear commitment we have is to drive gross profit growth and oi growth and eps growth and as you think about that in the past by guiding to gross margin percentages and oi percentages we left on the table we believe some opportunities we gave you in the past a couple of examples namely around channels and incrementality we see there or for that matter also local brands i think we have what it takes to generate incrementality there and to deliver good return on investment make no mistake when we say that we are focusing on dollar growth it doesn t mean that we will live outside productivity or the restructuring program that we announced in at the investor day the continuation of the current program or for that matter things that we have done quite well like zbb and mbs over the last few years so i think as you think about the quality of the p l in 2019 if you take out the additional investments we have that are as we said in a c but also in route to market or in quality or in r d and marketing i think if you take those out the shape and the quality of the p l is very consistent with what we did in 2018 christopher growe stifel nicolaus company analyst okay that s very helpful thanks for that color operator your next question comes from the line of bryan spillane with bank of america bryan spillane bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good afternoon everyone dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer hi bryan luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer hi bryan bryan spillane bank of america merrill lynch analyst just i guess just two questions for me one just in the fourth quarter the margins in north america were pretty good and i guess i just wanted to understand since there it sounds like there were some reinvestment there was there anything else there that was sort of unusual or flowed through in north america i guess or was it just the pricing the pnoc that helped i m just trying to understand the margin performance in north america in the fourth quarter luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer the margin was good as you say in north america i think as you think about it we did make improvements in reliability of the supply chain and the logistics network and i think as we stabilize the situation a bit in terms of service levels we were able to deliver efficiencies that in the other part of the year we were not i think you also saw that there was a little bit of a pricing favorability above and beyond the average of the year there were some phasing quite frankly in there so i think as you think about pricing it was roundabout the number you have to keep in mind is the number that you see for the year which was roundabout 1 but i think in stepping back and looking into it quite pleased in north america with the continued momentum we ve seen in biscuit still some challenges in categories like gum but in general the margin that came through in q4 was a good news for us and that s something ph to the team that did a nice job by stabilizing the situation in supply chain bryan spillane bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then i guess as a follow up to that as we re thinking about if service levels are improving in north america and hopefully continue to improve some in 2019 are you going to be able to how are you thinking about the balance between investing and spending in north america and then actually being able to service the programs do you feel like you ve you re maybe not spending as much or doing as much as you might ordinarily want to if you had full confidence in the ability to service it luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer the outlook we have in place at the moment it clearly has investments in north america now having said that there are still things that we need to look into as we said in the last call we implemented pricing and we are about see the effect in the marketplace so we need to stay flexible there and see how to best balance investments with pricing we also want to be clear that while we believe we are making good progress and we ve seen growth coming through there is still work to be done in north america so in general terms i would say we will invest more behind categories like biscuits or categories like candy even in gum but the reality is we need to take an inventory of where we stand at the end of q1 in terms of pricing and supply chain and then i think we need to adjust is the case bryan spillane bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great i ll leave it there thank you dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer thank you luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken goldman with j p morgan kenneth goldman j p morgan analyst hi thank you very much dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer good morning ken luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer hi ken kenneth goldman j p morgan analyst hi guys the primary pushback again on your stock is valuation and specifically on ebitda and i think i talked to investors many of them understand that the value of your joint ventures needs to be added back but plenty at least not at first glance seem to get that so to me this issue is increasing right investors are weighing ebitda more heavily because debt levels have risen higher so i guess my question is this if your thesis is correct that investors are sort of i guess punishing companies like mondelez for relying on unconsolidated operations does that you does that make you i guess internally rethink the value of your joint ventures to your stock price or is that not really a way for you to factor that luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer look i think we can clearly debate if we are overvalued or undervalued i believe when i step back and i look at the opportunities we have as a company and the quality of the results that we delivered in 2018 i feel quite good about the long term guidance that we gave and as a leading snacking company ability to generate sustainably volume driven growth of and resulting in revenue of 3 high single digit eps and cash flow of 3 billion plus i think it is something that is quite compelling my reply to your specific question is look the jvs clearly don t roll up into our ebitda they are around about 10 of our eps i believe that clearly it was a great investment i believe there is still upside potential so i think they are still undervalued but the premise of mondelez i think tangibly looking back at 2018 and handing us delivering in face of all the forex inaudible that we had a cash flow that was 2 9 billion with a conversion of net income that was excluding the jvs for which we don t get much dividend 130 i think that should reassure investors that we have what it takes to win and again the premise of us being in emerging markets seeing emerging markets growing 6 for the year more than 6 for q4 40 of that growth being volume driven i mean i can tell you we are quite pleased and i think as you think about the valuation think about what our potential is as a leading snacking company in emerging markets or for that matter globally so that will be my reply kenneth goldman j p morgan analyst okay thank you for that and then a quick follow up at the end of your prepared remarks you reiterated your desire to grow dividends ahead of eps growth can you elaborate on why this is the right decision it feels to me we just talked about i think investors are increasingly sensitive to debt your company that s also increasingly emphasizing growth and that requires reinvestment it just may be feels to me like raising your dividend above earnings isn t the ideal strategy but i m just curious to hear the rationale behind the take there luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer i think it is the confidence we have in the overall capital structure of the company if you step back and if you think about the ability we have to generate free cash flow and our commitment that materialized in 2018 of 3 billion plus from 2020 on if you think about the balance sheet flexibility we have at our current leverage but also with the fact that we were fairly clear the coffee stake is an investment for us and it is not strategic that gives us flexibility so if you put the ability we have to generate cash if you take into account the leverage that we have today the coffee stake that we have even in premise of m a i think we have what it takes to be able to have the flexibility to do share buybacks to get dividend and also to make m a so i think you can update one piece you have to look at all of this together and all the elements are there pointing in the direction that there is confidence in being able to raise dividends the last time we did it it was 18 so we feel good about that kenneth goldman j p morgan analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein alexia howard sanford c bernstein co analyst good afternoon everyone dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer hi alexia alexia howard sanford c bernstein co analyst hi so just a quick question the emerging market growth ex argentina being in the 4 to 5 two things a little lackluster i m just trying to understand how much of that was brazilian gum and what s the prognosis there it sounds as though brazil was down low single digits and some of the categories were positive but gum business must have been in quite some trouble so maybe some commentary there and then just as a follow up some of the household products companies have complained local competition in places like china have slowed them down quite a bit what are you seeing out there in china relative to your local competitors do you think that s relevant to you and is that something that you re worried about in terms of getting the emerging markets growing again thank you and i ll pass it on dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer okay well on brazil yes brazil was of the emerging markets probably the one that didn t perform as we would have hoped in 2018 but we feel that over the medium term the growth prospects for brazil are quite good it wasn t really because of gum that 2018 was more difficult for us it was really driven by two things there was a bit of a price scuffle i would say in the chocolate category which we are getting through we see at the moment we see good volume growth in chocolate in brazil we addressed the price gaps and we started to gain share in the last quarter in biscuits we were largely flat as it relates to share so it was really on top of the chocolate issue it was the powdered beverages which in brazil we are seeing a colder summer so a slowdown in q4 and we are expecting the same in q1 of our powdered beverages sales and then on top overall the powdered beverage category is doing a little bit less than cold drinks in general and then us within that category losing some market share so that was the real driver for brazil as it relates to china we obviously like everybody else have the local competition but we are pretty happy with our performance in china we had another solid quarter which is the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for us in china all of our categories are growing in gum we are increasing our market share quite considerably because we launched a new product called stride waves which is the same as the trident vibes here in the us and then in chocolate we launched our milka magic cup and there also we have about 0 5 point of market share gains and then in biscuits where we have the most local competition we have been really doing well with more than 1 point gain of our market share combined between online offline we ve got some pretty heavy growth going on in our e commerce business in china which is up almost 80 for the year so overall yes there is a competition but at this stage we feel like we are doing quite well in china alexia howard sanford c bernstein co analyst great thank you very much i ll pass it on dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse robert moskow credit suisse analyst hi two quick questions you mentioned a c investments in the quarter i don t know if i heard you quantify how much a c was up year over year can you give us a sense of what it was in the quarter and then the year ago i m sorry for the overall year how much it was up and then secondly pricing down a lot in europe my impression is that especially in the uk that a lot of pricing needs to go higher to offset higher input costs and then of course the brexit situation might make that accentuate that do you have a contingency plan if there is a hard brexit this year thanks luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer thank you robert so may be dirk will take the brexit i ll start by commenting a bit on your a c question and pricing as we said we activated more investments in q4 but we are not going to quantify by the way it was a c and as we saw good momentum in india chocolate in china biscuits and gum in russia chocolate and biscuits we gained in russia alone more than 2 points of share in the last 12 months so as we saw these economies doing very well as we saw volume driven growth i think we put more a c and i think it was the right decision as we said we are trying to invest in our local brands as well but it was not only a c i think if you look at what we did in q4 for instance we spent in seasonal activation in big countries like the uk germany and for instance in india in australia but we also spent in route to market and finally we had investments in marketing and r d i think if you think about the quantum it was clearly materializing so the quality of the earnings we had gross margin growing 90 basis points for the quarter off of it dropped to the bottom line so we reinvested quite a bit going forward we will reinvest even more the difference is going to be that it will involve more countries and more brands as to pricing i wouldn t get quite frankly where it s fixated on the q4 pricing impact for europe there were some phasing in there what i can tell you is that in general the total pricing for the company was in the right place europe specifically was able to generate nice gross profit growth so gross margin was up in europe again so it was puts and takes between pricing and commodities at forex that we had effectively covered for europe i don t think there is much to worry at this point in time on pricing in europe with the exception of may be brexit that dirk is going to talk about in a minute dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer so as it relates to brexit yes i mean the uk is an important business for us and we have a very good team there that s very solid and i think they re very well equipped to weather through this situation we don t know and that s the difficulty of brexit we don t quite know what s going to happen here so we have to really prepare for the worst and hope for the best and the worst is clearly a hard brexit we are assessing all the potential scenarios and we do feel that brexit will for sure have a short term and a medium term impact over the long term we believe that it will stabilize itself and we will come back to where we are today and obviously there s a huge difference between a hard brexit and a softer brexit so as it relates to the hard brexit our contingency plan is quite extensive and it basically is focused on the disruption and the ease of the flow of the goods so we ve invested in additional resources in logistics operations that means we ve rented many more trucks we ve rented much more warehousing space we ve increased our inventories we are making sure that we are capable even in difficult circumstances to maintain our customer service and we are very focused on demand planning and so we have also increased for instance our additional raw and packaging materials in the uk and in europe now brexit could come with other effects like devaluations or tariffs may be a loss of consumer confidence in the first part those types of things we have not included in our current guidance but we are preparing for it in case it would happen i hope that yesterday s vote helps a little bit to avoid the hard brexit and then as it relates to pricing i think we will have to see what happens particularly with brexit itself to make decisions at the moment our pricing is adapted to the current situation but we are ready to adapt a pricing as brexit would start to happen robert moskow credit suisse analyst okay thank you very much luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer okay dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of jason english with goldman sachs jason english goldman sachs analyst hi good evening folks luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer hi jason dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer hi jason english goldman sachs analyst thanks for sliding me in i appreciate that you re focused on the holistic portfolio now and don t want to spend time dwelling on the legacy sort of power brands versus non power brands but i m going to try anyways because the strategy clearly is one of trying to activate the periphery of the portfolio and i d love to get a bit more context of how it s working so far so is there any sort of performance metric you can give us and how these non power brands are progressing as you extend the investment dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yeah we can explain that a little bit so i wouldn t say it s the periphery of the portfolio our non power brands or our non global brands are sometimes quite important and we are really using them in synergy to try to cover as many aspects of the consumer needs that exist and so for instance in russia we become leaders in chocolate by using the combination of alpen gold and milka to be the winners in the market so it s more than the periphery it s really playing off brands against each other and making sure that we activate all of those brands so that is still of course a work in progress but i would say that we have seen the power brands continuing largely on their trend of about 3 growth and then we ve seen the local brands go down go up sorry from a negative growth in the past two or close to 1 growth in the last quarter that sort of the shift we re seeing and obviously that s only after about four months of activation of those local brands so we re expecting to see more growth in 2019 jason english goldman sachs analyst excellent thank you for sharing that and i want to come back to a comment you made in the prepared remarks about empowering people to snack right i guess snack right means lots of things to lots of people but to me it seems to connote ph a degree of health and wellness which is not something i think comes top of mind when we think about your portfolio so can you talk about the context around that statement in terms of your vision and whether or not it does entail a bigger push in health and wellness and if so how much of this would be sort of strategic m a and priority versus organic dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yeah it means many things it does have a health and wellness connotation but if i take it up one step it is a recognition that the same consumer depending on the moment of the day and the situation in which she finds he or she finds himself can make different decisions and when we say right we mean that we want to offer the right product for the right occasion and we see as we look around at what s going on and what s growing in percentage it s the more health and wellness categories but in dollars it s still the old biscuits chocolate ice cream and categories like that that are getting the biggest growth as it relates to health and wellness yes we clearly have an intent to do several things it probably starts with constantly trying to improve the ingredients on our product the sourcing of our raw materials and may be that s not necessarily health related but we re thinking about cocoa life or our harmony wheat programs that we have which are about more sustainability of the raw materials and so on but i think that s also these days something that the consumer appreciates as we do that in our brands we will also eliminate as much as we can fat and salt and things like that and yes we will need to have more pure health oriented brands we have several belvita would be the one that comes most to mind but we have clearly an intent apart from continuing to improve our current brands to launch more health oriented options under our current brands or to launch new brands or and you re right that might has to be partially also through m a but i wouldn t say it s more biased in one or another direction it s a little bit of a whole spectrum of activity that we have in mind jason english goldman sachs analyst got it thank you guys dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer okay luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer thank you jason operator your next question comes from the line of steven strycula with ubs steven strycula ubs investment bank analyst hi good evening and i hope everyone in chicago staying warm dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yes in the officer we are ok steven strycula ubs investment bank analyst but i figure shep was handing out hand warmers or something like that around the order of table but so my question is for dirk to kick it off would be how do i think about some of the more impactful investments in a c and just in your broader route to market you re making this year specifically dirk what are the key markets where sales force headcount for mondelez employee is increasing and then which emerging markets with local iconic brands matter most in your opinion then i have a short follow up for luca dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yeah well i would say where the manpower matters is largely in emerging markets the reason being that a lot of the sales are still happening to mom and pop and smaller stores which you have to physically cover and so the countries that come to mind to be able to do that are of course india but even russia southeast asia africa the middle east those are the markets where we are planning to invest overall in how we cover the stores and get a bigger universe of coverage it s not only people it s also driven by the equipment that we might need trucks or in store display equipment in the hotter climates for our chocolate business we need coolers so that s really what for us is what we mean when we say we are going to invest in route to market and i think i took you through the markets that we are going to do that as it relates to the significant emerging markets for us well we are seeing at the moment we are seeing double digit growth in india we are seeing double digit growth in russia we talked about brazil that wasn t 2018 wasn t a great year but that s a key market for us we are also china of course we need to the look at the opportunity we have for mid single digit that we would like to increase that and then the markets where i would say our presence all those markets i ve talked about there s probably close to a 1 billion for us more or less give or take southeast asia there s still a few markets there where our presence is not as big as it should be our market share is not as big as it should be so we are also planning to do quite some investments in there steven strycula ubs investment bank analyst okay great and then luca since your trying to direct our attention to focus more on profit dollar growth as an industry how should we think of or as a company how should we think about for 2019 ebit dollar trends on a constant currency basis currency ph headwind luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer yeah look we again i think if you look at the guidance we gave in terms of eps 3 to 5 we guided on interest cost at 450 million i can you can walk it back up and see that it is i guess roundabout the same eps growth that you have there are puts and takes obviously but that s what it is steven strycula ubs investment bank analyst all right thank you congrats on the good quarter luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer thank you dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve operator your next question comes from the line of david driscoll with citi david driscoll citigroup analyst great thank you and good evening dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer hi david luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer hi david david driscoll citigroup analyst hi two small modeling questions and then just one bigger question what s your inflation forecast for 2019 and then on the organic revenue forecast of 2 to 3 would it be correct to assume that that would skew toward pricing as opposed to vol mix and then i have a follow up please luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer look on the inflation we are not going to break that out in terms of composition of cost inflation forex inflation commodity i think as you model think about commodities being pretty much in line with what we have seen this year in terms of inflation there is clearly logistics cost that is creating a little bit of a pressure point that was one of the key drivers that drove us increasing pricing in north america for 2019 but we also see some packaging and the forex to a certain extent is one of the components that is creating a little bit of pressure in terms of inflation and again we are taking action obviously clearly we are covering our exchange rate exposure throughout the year and we had good coverage at this point i think we took advantage of some of the dips that we saw recently for instance for the brazilian reais on the composition of the 2 to 3 i prefer not to go there we are not going to give guidance on that specifically clearly as you think about what we said in the context of investor day we believe that volume growth is the right thing and when you think about the various regions i think we will continue seeing good momentum in terms of volume in eu same in amea la clearly there is argentina and some inflationary pressure and in north america we need to wait and see what happens with the price increase as it becomes effective in the marketplace and so i think there we have to see if the elasticity we model is the right one or if it is better or worse david driscoll citigroup analyst and then on the investments that you re making in 2019 can you give us some color on the pacing of those investments and then also one clarification on your fourth quarter comment i believe you used the phrase something like you accelerated your investments and they began in the fourth quarter does that mean that the dollar amount of investments in 2019 is now less because some of it took place in the fourth quarter or is it just in aggregate going up because you had flexibility in the fourth quarter again please don t forget the pacing part of the investment question for 2019 thank you luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer no i didn t forget the pacing term so let me answer that first i think as you think about it it is fairly even throughout the various quarters bear in mind that there are seasonal events throughout the year so easter for instance happens to fall in 2019 a little bit but later than it did in 2018 so it is a q2 event and there are other seasonal events but specifically on a c it is equally phased throughout the quarter i would say give or take dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer the other part was does it mean we are going to reduce our investment in 2019 and no the answer is no it s clear that our intent that the investment pace of 2019 is we are going to increase on that in 2020 maybe not at the same pace as in 2019 but we are trying to change our circle here to a virtuous circle so our objective is to keep on growing and in that way increase our top line growth david driscoll citigroup analyst thank you very much dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer no problem luca zaramella executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator and our final question comes from the line of david palmer with rbc capital markets david palmer rbc capital markets analyst thanks just a real general one on execution you ve talked about trying to improve that execution and accountability by pushing some decision making down to the regional level it looks like from the outside like europe has been executing pretty well perhaps that will be tested by higher input prices and that requiring pricing which is never easy there and then conversely north america is seemingly struggled far longer than it should have post malware especially with some of the competition pretty distracted but it seems to be a little bit of an early stage here of getting tied together could you perhaps just walk us around the world over the regions as you see where the execution is today and where you see it going dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer yes may be before i do that we look at execution in more than in general execution we are trying to split that up in several different groups if i can and of course there is the supply chain execution and that has to see with how good are we at buying our raw materials and our packs how good are we running our plants how well are we doing our demand planning and our deployment and so on and so on and as you can imagine there s always area anywhere in the world people can improve but apart from the supply chain it also has to see with commercial execution then it goes from marketing and our roi and our marketing activities around the world and how are we going to drive that and can we use the latest technology to drive that as an in store presence and that improvement of our route to market that we were talking about so it s wider than you might think if i go around the world i would say in general we have an objective in all regions of the world to clearly increase our roi and our marketing and our sales activities and everybody has an opportunity there as it relates to the execution in the supply chain you re right in general our supply chain in europe is clearly performing better and a well oiled machine and the us is getting there or north america is getting there but it s going to take a little bit of time and if you take into account that they are still using some of our older factories to do so as it relates to the rest of the world i would say latin america is making big strides as it relates to their supply chain and it s working very well and in amea we are also pretty happy with where we stand the differences between the different countries but also going quite well but i think you cannot see this as a black and white they are doing well or they re not doing it well every single region can lift itself to the next level and that s really the challenge if you re in a company like ours and we focus on margin and cost to just make sure that we are running our plants in a better way we run our supply chain in a better way get the waste out of there bring down overtime run our lines optimally that s really what we re talking about here and i can tell you that anywhere in the world we have opportunity to improve that it s more difficult in some areas but the opportunity in my opinion is quite big like it would be in any other big company to my opinion david palmer rbc capital markets analyst that s great thank you dirk van de put chairman and chief executive officer thanks i think that brings us to the end of today so in closing i would say that 2018 was a great year for us we had good top line growth we had solid profitability we improved our free cash flow we created a steady motion a new strategy that i think is the right approach and it s the right time to deliver higher quality sustainable growth for the company as i look at 2019 and the year ahead i am encouraged by the health of our snacking markets and the categories in which we operate i think our teams are energized we are happy about what we have achieved we are excited about the future and i think the new structure and incentive plans we ve put in place are giving people the liberty and then the potential to really go and do and make things happen it will be a year of investment as we pointed out but we think it s the right thing to do because we believe we can lift this business to a higher level of growth and that will lead to better returns for investors so i look forward to continuing to share our progress i will probably see you all in cagny and thank you again for your interest in the company operator this concludes

based on management s current expectations or beliefs actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements slide 2 of our earnings release presentation includes important information regarding previous sec filings and reconciliation of non gaap measures jonas prising chairman chief executive officer thanks jack revenue in the fourth quarter came in at 5 4 billion a decrease of 1 in constant currency on a same day basis our underlying organic constant currency revenue decreased by 3 the weaker revenue performance is primarily attributable to our businesses in europe which continued to slow through the fourth quarter partially offsetting revenues decline in europe with strong revenue growth in apme and within portions of the americas specifically in latin america and canada operating profit for the fourth quarter was 218 million down 4 in constant currency operating profit margin came in at 4 down 20 basis points from the prior year our performance in the quarter reflects stronger than expected gross profit margin of 16 3 which represents a 30 basis points decrease from the prior year we continued to manage sg a well in the quarter and continued to take appropriate management actions in view of the softer revenue trends earnings per share for the quarter was 2 54 this was a decrease of 18 in constant currency year over year but it actually reflected 25 growth in constant currency compared to the prior year if you exclude the us tax reform related gains that we experienced in the prior year period turning to the full year results for a few moments earnings per share for the year was 8 56 this represented a constant currency increase of 5 over the prior year and an increase of 22 in constant currency excluding the one time benefit of tax reform in the prior year revenues for the year increased 2 in constant currency to 22 billion and operating profit was 797 million which was flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis our fourth quarter results continue to reflect the more challenging market environment especially in europe we experienced declining revenue trends across a number of our european businesses notably in france italy and germany among our larger businesses we re applying strong pricing discipline and are very focused on improved productivity and executing cost mitigation actions in countries experiencing a softening environment at the same time we continue to add resources in markets that provide us with opportunities for profitable growth and invest in our technology initiatives in various countries across the world we participated in the world economic forum in davos last week and as you can imagine the outlook for the european economy was a prominent topic of discussion as was the topic of access to human capital and skills we led many discussions on workforce trends and the impact of ai and technology on the workforce we also shared our latest thought leadership research which generated significant discussion this included the latest research in skills revolution series providing a real time view of the impact of technology on job growth called humans wanted robots need you contrary to media headlines this research shows that organizations that are automating tasks are hiring more people creating more jobs and upskilling their people to perform new and complementary roles to those done by machines augmenting human capability more than replacing it we also launched manpowergroup solutions total workforce index at davos sharing our new digital evolution pathway assessment tool and promoting experience tech academy alongside other workforce solutions for me the biggest takeaway from davos is that despite concerns around lower growth outlook in some parts of the world the importance of the workforce strategy and access to skilled talent is top of mind for most companies our strong manpowergroup value proposition remains highly relevant in this environment as we can support companies execution of the business strategies with our leading global workforce solutions wherever they are we know the skills revolution is in full flow and we have an important opportunity and role to play in solving the talent shortage for companies by upskilling and reskilling people for them to stay employable today and in the future turning back to our digital transformation we have previously discussed many of the technology initiatives we have implemented over the past years and continue to advance our investments in technology is core to our strategy of maintaining our leadership and workforce solutions and enabling our teams to help clients and candidates win through better data insights and innovative delivery models 2018 was a year of significant investment and progress in advancing our digital capabilities 2019 will be no different as we continue implementing world class front office systems cloud based and mobile applications as well as other enhancements to our global technology infrastructure across a number of our markets we re also investing in the digitalization of our workforce solutions offerings to ensure our clients have access to the best class workforce analytics and tools and with that i would like to turn it over to jack to provide additional financial information and a review of our segment results and our first quarter outlook jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jonas turning back to fourth quarter results as jonas as mentioned we experienced a challenging revenue environment in the fourth quarter operating profit declined 4 on a constant currency basis this performance resulted in an operating profit margin of 4 which exceeded our guidance range a revenue decline of 1 in constant currency came in at the lower end of our constant currency guidance range our gross profit margin declined 30 basis points year over year which also exceeded our guidance range as we experienced favorable direct cost accrual adjustments particularly in france during the quarter our sg a was well managed during the quarter and included a benefit from a gain on disposition of a non core business which i ll cover in more detail breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail our reported revenue decline of 4 includes the negative currency impact on a constant currency basis our revenue decline was 1 acquisitions contributed about 20 basis points to our growth rate in the quarter and as we had an extra billing day the organic constant currency days adjusted revenue decline was 2 the revenue decline was primarily driven by various businesses in europe most notably in france germany and the netherlands i will discuss this further in the segment review s turning to the epf bridge on a reported basis earnings per share was 2 54 starting with our guidance eps midpoint of 2 19 improved operational performance contributed 0 12 driven by france we sold our non core language translation business in the netherlands during the quarter which resulted in a gain of 8 million which contributed 0 10 the other income expenses contributed 0 9 as equity pickup losses on investments related to our past ownership interests in our switzerland franchise we re more than offset by other foreign currency adjustments and non controlling interest income related to our china joint venture foreign currency translation impact was 0 06 worse than the estimated in guidance a lower effective tax rate contributed 0 04 and lower weighted average shares resulting from repurchases during the quarter contributed 0 06 looking at our gross profit margin in detail our gross margin came in at 16 3 staffing interim margin declines drove the 30 basis points reduction in the overall gross margin year over year although we experienced a loss of cice subsidy in france for the month of december as expected which represented 30 basis points of margin at the consolidated level this was largely offset by favorable direct cost adjustments in france the remaining 30 basis point decline represented the underlying gross profit margin trend in the fourth quarter next let s review our gross profit by business line during the quarter the manpower brand comprised 63 of gross profit our experienced professional business comprised 20 manpowergroup solutions comprise 14 and right management 3 during the quarter our manpower brand reported a 4 decrease in gross profit on a constant currency basis this represents a decrease from the 1 constant currency growth rate in the third quarter this was driven by declines in germany the uk the us the netherlands sweden italy and spain among our larger countries within our manpower brand approximately 60 of the gross profit is derived from light industrial skills and 40 is derived from office and clerical skills gross profit from staffing within light industrial skills decreased during the quarter while office in clerical skills experienced a slight increase in the rate of growth in the quarter gross profit in our experienced brand decrease 1 on a constant currency basis year over year this represented a decrease from the flat constant currency growth rate achieved in the third quarter the decrease was primarily driven by the netherlands sweden and australia manpowergroup solutions includes our global market leading rpo and msp offerings as well as talent based outsourcing solutions including proservia our european it infrastructure and end user support business msp offerings as well as talent based outsourcing solutions including serbia ph our european it infrastructure and end user support business gross profit growth in the quarter was up 2 in constant currency which represents a decrease from the 8 constant currency growth rate achieved in the third quarter driven by lower rpo and proservia activity which was partially offset by strong msp activity in the quarter our pipeline for rpo and msp opportunities is strong into 2019 while management experienced a decline in gross profit of 5 in constant currency during the quarter as our outplacement activity continued to decline this represents an improvement from the 8 constant currency decline experienced in the third quarter i will comment further on right management in my segment review sga expense was 662 million a decrease of 35 million from the prior year this included a year over year reduction of 22 million from currency changes 1 million increase from acquisitions a 5 million decrease from operations and a decrease of 8 million related to the gain on the sale of our language translation business in the netherlands sga expenses as a percentage of revenue in the quarter represented 12 3 and after excluding the gain on sale it represented 12 4 this result reflects our focus on operational efficiency across our businesses during a challenging revenue environment while we continue to implement new technology across a number of operations globally the americas segment comprise 19 of consolidated revenue revenue in the quarter was 1 billion representing 2 growth year over year in constant currency inaudible of 53 million represented a decrease of 3 in constant currency driven by the us which i will discuss next similarly oup margin decreased by 30 basis points year over year the us is the largest country in the americas segment comprising 61 of segment revenues revenue in the us was 632 million down 5 compared to the prior year this represented a slight decline from the 4 decrease in the third quarter during the quarter oup for our us business decreased 13 to 33 million and oup margin was 5 2 a reduction of 50 basis points from the prior year driven by the manpower business which i will discuss next within the us the manpower brand comprise 42 of gross profit during the quarter revenue for the manpower brand in the us was down 70 in the quarter which represented a decline from the third quarter trend largely due to the non recurrence of seasonal holiday activity associated with select clients although the us manpower business experience decreased holiday activity in the fourth quarter we expect to see improvement in the trend in the first quarter due to new business wins and improved trends the experis brand in the us comprise 35 of gross profit in the quarter with in experis in the us it skills comprise approximately 70 percent of the revenues during the quarter our experis revenues declined 6 from the prior year compared to the 8 decline experienced in the third quarter experis us has been very focused on profitable business and this resulted in gross profit margin expansion during the quarter experis us experienced an improved december and we expect to see continued improvement in the revenue trend in the first quarter manpowergroup solutions in the us contributed 23 of gross profit and experienced 9 revenue growth in the quarter which was an improvement from the 5 growth in the third quarter we continue to see good opportunities for growth in both our higher value msp and our rpo solutions in the us our mexico operation had 9 constant currency revenue growth in the quarter the business in mexico continue to perform well in the quarter and we expect good growth into the first quarter revenue in argentina was up 14 in constant currency which continues to reflect the impact of inflation we are operatingin argentina in a disciplined and cautious manner in view of the hyper inflationary environment as a result billable hours were down 16 year over year in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on margin and payment terms improvement due to the extended duration of the high inflationary environment we have been reducing billable hours for many quarters in argentina and the business has become less significant to the region as a result beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we will replace the separate revenue trend reporting for argentina business with our canada business which is now larger than our argentina business our canada business represented 7 of the segment revenues during the quarter and experienced a constant currency revenue growth rate of 17 in the quarter capping off a year of very strong performance revenue growth in the other countries within americas was up 17 in constant currency or 12 on an organic basis this growth was driven primarily by the very strong revenue growth in canada which i just referenced as well as solid growth in colombia brazil and peru southern europe revenue comprise 43 of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue in southern europe came in at 2 3 billion a decrease of 1 in constant currency this represented a decline from the 2 constant currency revenue growth rate in the third quarter driven by revenue declines in france italy and spain oup decreased 2 in the prior year in constant currency and oup margin decreased 10 basis points which was driven by italy italy had strong performance but was running against very high 31 percent days adjusted growth rate in the prior year period france experienced better than expected profitability which i will discuss next france revenue comprised 62 of the southern europe segment in the quarter and declined 2 from the prior year in constant currency on the billing days adjusted constant currency basis revenues declined 3 in the first three weeks of january we continue to see activity levels that reflected 2 to 3 revenue decline year over year as discussed on the previous quarters earnings call transition from cic program at the end of 2018 to the new subsidy program in january of 2019 resulted in the loss of the december cic subsidy as expected the cice related gross profit loss in the fourth quarter was offset by favorable direct cost to cool ph adjustments in the quarter this drove a better than expected level of profit in france and oup was 81 million an increase of 3 percent in constant currency and oup margin was up 30 basis points in constant currency to 5 7 permanent recruitment growth was 5 percent in constant currency during the quarter we have incorporated the current trend of a 3 days adjusted decline into our first quarter revenue guidance during the previous quarters earnings call i provided a detailed description of the anticipated impact of the new subsidy program on our france gross profit in 2019 the preliminary budget was passed as expected in december and as a result our guidance remains unchanged in summary this item is expected to result in a reduction of our gdp margin in france of about 50 basis points in the first three quarters of 2019 and beginning in the fourth quarter after the incremental inaudible subsidies are received the reduction would then represent about 15 basis points going forward similar to our successful effort in 2019 to offset a large part of the scheduled cice decrease we will again strive to offset the net impact in 2019 with ongoing initiatives revenue in italy decreased 3 in constant currency to 404 million on a billing days adjusted constant currency basis revenues declined 5 italy also experienced a non recurrence of select client holiday related activity in the fourth quarter that contributed to the revenue decline we saw another consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in the staffing gross profit margin trend in italy during the fourth quarter permanent recruitment represented 6 growth in the quarter oup margin represented 7 our italy business is performing well in a more challenging economic environment as we continue to anniversary very high growth we expect a low to mid single digit percentage revenue decline into the first quarter we continue to believe that the dignity decree legislation in italy is manageable and we do not expect this legislation to influence our revenue trend significantly in spain revenues also decreased 3 in constant currency or 5 on a billing days adjusted basis we expect spain will have a similar level of revenue performance in the first quarter our northern europe segment comprise 24 percent of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue was down 7 in constant currency to 1 3 billion this represents a decrease from the 4 constant currency decline in the third quarter primarily driven by germany the netherlands and the uk oup decreased 6 in constant currency and oup margin was flat to the prior year included within oup is the previously referenced onetime gain of 8 million related to the sale of our language translation business in the netherlands the underlying decrease in oup was driven by germany and to a lesser extent the netherlands as discussed last quarter in addition to the declining market environment our germany business has also experienced reduced revenues and incremental costs associated with technology and operational improvement initiatives our largest market in northern europe segment is the uk which represented 31 of segment revenue in the quarter uk revenues decreased 3 in constant currency and represented a 4 decrease on a billing days adjusted constant currency basis this represents a decline from the flat growth in the third quarter our manpower business in the uk experienced a 13 constant currency revenue decline in the fourth quarter which included reductions in production from large automotive clients as mentioned last quarter conversely our experis business experience another quarter of revenue improvement and improved their constant currency revenue growth rate to 16 in the fourth quarter we expect the overall revenue trend for the uk business to experience a high single digit percentage decline in revenue in the first quarter due to the reduced volume in the large automotive client and to a lesser degree reduced activity in a few other select clients revenue in germany declined 18 on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter or 21 on a billing days adjusted basis this represented a further decline from the 14 constant currency decrease in the third quarter although we made progress during the quarter advancing key initiatives which will strengthen our business in germany we continued to experience further declines in the fourth quarter market activity in germany has been very difficult to estimate and as a result our revenue guidance for the first quarter is being set at the january today trends which approximate our fourth quarter rate of decline in the nordics we experienced the 1 constant currency revenue growth during the fourth quarter or adjusted for billing days a 2 growth rate this represents an improvement from the 3 decline in the third quarter norway has been the driver of the improved revenue growth we expect norway to continue to perform well in the first quarter which will offset the soft revenue environment in sweden for the nordics overall we expect to see a similar rate of revenue growth in the first quarter revenue in the netherlands decreased 15 in constant currency on a billing days adjusted basis during the fourth quarter this representative declined from the 4 decrease in the third quarter we had anticipated a further decline in the fourth quarter as our language translation business was a fee based business the sale in december 2018 will have a modest impact on the revenue trend in the netherlands going forward we expect the first quarter revenue trend will be similar to the fourth quarter trend belgium experienced revenue growth of 1 in constant currency during the fourth quarter this represented an improvement from the billing days adjusted 1 constant currency decline in the third quarter our belgium business has been performing as expected and we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter other markets in northern europe had a revenue decline of 1 in constant currency the asia pacific middle east segment comprises 13 of consolidated revenue in the quarter revenue was up 9 in constant currency to 732 million representing a decrease from the 10 growth rate in the third quarter permanent recruitment growth was 3 in constant currency oup was 27 million in the quarter representing flat growth in constant currency and oup margin decreased 30 basis points driven by gross profit margin mix as staffing gross profit increased at a greater rate than permanent recruitment fees revenue growth in japan was up 4 on a constant currency basis or 2 adjusting for billing days and represented a slight decrease in the rate of growth in the third quarter japan experienced gross profit margin expansion year over year as a result of underlying improvement in staffing margin oup and oup margin improved once again during the fourth quarter in japan we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter on the billing days adjusted basis revenues in australia and new zealand decreased 1 in constant currency which represented a decline from the 6 revenue growth in the third quarter this was driven by the timing of certain client volumes and we expect a similar revenue trend in the first quarter revenue in other markets in asia pacific middle east continued to be very strong up 17 in constant currency and represents a continuation of the third quarter revenue trend this was a result of strong double digit growth in a number of markets including operations in india greater china thailand malaysia and vietnam our greater china business which is operated through a joint venture owned a majority stake in a china based payrolling firm with the minority stake held by the founder as this activity was no longer considered core we sold the majority ownership stake to its founder in december 2018 and since then no longer consolidate the results of this business the impact of the disposition on oup was not significant in the fourth quarter and due to the low margin nature of this business it s not expected to significantly impact future oup trends in the apme region however the revenue trend will be impacted as a result our first quarter revenue guidance for apme will provide an additional organic constant currency growth rate to exclude the impact of this disposition separately our china joint venture in which we own a controlling interest continues to perform very well it has become a leader in china for higher margin workforce solutions and permanent recruitment we are pleased with our progress in china and are working closely with our jv partner on future market expansion opportunities our right management business experienced a 4 constant currency revenue decline in the fourth quarter this was driven by reduced outplacement activity the rate of revenue decline represents an improvement from the 7 constant currency decline in the third quarter and represents three consecutive quarters of improvement lower gross profits driven oup decreased 10 on a constant currency basis and the oup margin declined by 130 basis points i ll now turn to cash flow and balance sheet free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures was 418 million for the full year compared to 346 million in the prior year the fourth quarter experienced positive free cash flow of 156 million which compared to 99 million in the year ago period at quarter end day sales outstanding increased by two days consistent with prior quarters changes in our business mix have driven some of the overall dso increase we continue to execute our initiatives to improve the trend of dso capital expenditures represented 65 million during 2018 during the quarter we purchased 2 6 million shares of stock for 202 million bringing total purchases for the year to 5 7 million shares for 501 million as of december 31st we have 3 1 million shares remaining for repurchase under the 6 million share program approved in august of 2018 our balance sheet was strong at quarter end with cash of 592 million and total debt of 1 08 billion bringing our net debt to 483 million our debt ratios are very comfortable at quarter end with total debt to trailing twelve months adjusted ebitda of 1 2 and total debt to total capitalization at 28 our debt and credit facilities did not change in the quarter at quarter end we had a 500 million euro note outstanding with an effective interest rate of 1 8 maturing in june of 2026 and the 400 million euro note with an effective interest rate of 1 9 maturing in september of 2022 in addition we have a revolving credit agreement for 600 million which remained unused next i ll review our outlook for the first quarter of 2019 we are forecasting earnings per share to be in the range of 1 30 to 1 38 which includes a negative impact from foreign currency of 0 13 per share our constant currency revenue guidance range is a decline between 3 and 5 the impact of dispositions represents 50 basis points of our decline in the first quarter there are slightly fewer billing days in the first quarter as a result this represents a billing days adjusted organic constant currency revenue decline of 3 at the midpoint this represents the current trends in key markets particularly europe and the anniversary of higher growth rates in various markets from a segment standpoint we expect constant currency revenue growth in the americas to be in the flat to low single digits with declines in southern europe in the low to mid single digits we expect a revenue decline in northern europe in the high single digit range with about 70 basis points of the decline representing the recent disposition in the netherlands we expect organic revenue growth in asia pacific middle east in the low single digits as the impact of the china related disposition decreases first quarter revenues by about 4 we expect the constant currency revenue decline for the apme region in the first quarter in the low single digits we expect a revenue decline in right management in the low single digits our operating profit margin during the first quarter should be down 30 basis points which includes an incremental 10 basis points of increased costs and global technology related initiatives compared to the year ago period as we mentioned last year our global effective tax rate increases in 2019 due to the discontinuation of the tax exempt cice program in france we expect our global effective tax rate to approximate 34 for 2019 we expect our income tax rate in the first quarter to approximate 37 there have been reports that the government of france is considering deferring the scheduled 2 decrease in their corporate tax rate in 2019 as this has not been enacted we have not incorporated this into our guidance should france enact this change it would increase our global effective tax rate by 50 basis points as usual our guidance does not incorporate additional share repurchases and we estimate our weighted average shares to be 61 5 million reflecting share repurchases through december 31st our guidance also does not include any restructuring charges or estimate for hyperinflationary accounting related foreign currency gains or losses related to our argentina business with that i d like to turn it back to jonas jonas prising chairman chief executive officer thanks jack we see our q1 trends essentially similar to what we saw at the end of 2018 we don t know how long the current slowdown in some european markets will continue having said that we know permanent recruitment demand remains strong in many markets and companies looking for more operational and strategic flexibility in a more uneven uncertain environment will be looking for skills that our manpower business provides as companies invest in new digital infrastructure it creates demand for the technology skills that experis provides and finally we continue to see good opportunities to deliver our market leading manpowergroup solutions offerings in many european markets and support people transition to new careers with our right management offerings we also believe the us market will provide us with opportunities for revenue improvement in 2019 in addition our emerging market footprints continues to provide a solid growth outlook our diversified geographic footprint and business mix should provide us with opportunities to generate new business in growth markets against slowing business in some markets experiencing headwinds we will balance our investments in those markets that provide us with growth opportunities and always look for operational excellence cost optimization and productivity initiatives especially where we are experiencing softening demand lastly i want to take this opportunity to thank the entire manpowergroup team for their great engagement and disciplined execution in 2018 and we look forward to building on that progress in 2019 and beyond our people are the reason we were recently named one of fortune magazine s 2019 world s most admired companies for the 17th time also receiving top scores for social responsibility and global competitiveness this accolade is a testament to our people who are delivering on our commitment to help our clients win in the changing world of work while connecting millions of people to meaningful and sustainable employment every year and with that i would now like to open the call for q a operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from the line of andrew steinerman from jpmorgan your line is now open andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst good morning jonas and jack jonas you mentioned that you don t know when you ll see stability in europe instead of giving kind of the timing of when could you give us a sense of sort of what has to happen for you to see stability in europe and then another comment that caught my ear in your final remarks was that you saw opportunity for growth in manpower us which has been a segment of turnaround for you did you mean that kind of give us a timeline of when you think that segment could grow jonas prising chairman chief executive officer hey morning andrew this is the headquarters of the polar vortex so we re looking out at some very cold weather here and your first question on the outlook for europe and the timing of course that s difficult now we re in two consecutive quarters you might have seen the numbers from the eurozone growth at 0 2 for both of those quarters so it s all going to be a question of resolving some of the uncertainties that are related to trade brexit and some of the political issues that might be in some of the european countries but overall i would say to give you a sense of what our conversations with clients are like this still feels very much like a slowdown and not the beginning of the downturn because by the same token of looking back at the past quarters with lower economic growth in the eurozone you re looking at labor markets that are still that are now at a 10 year low in terms of unemployment so that s positive that s why we think we will have opportunities in a number of our brands in countries across europe and also when you look at the projected outlook for growth for the year it is significantly higher than what the current run rate is so if that were to happen there should be some good opportunities for a pickup and the question is of course when that would happen but our conversations with our clients still feel very much like a slowdown and not a downturn related to the question in the us we still think of the us as a good market for revenue improvement for us and we believe that we ll see some revenue improvements in the manpower business we were very pleased to see that experis continued to improve also in the fourth quarter so we think this is one of the markets where we ll have some good opportunities and we re adding recruiters here in the us because we think the market will be good here in the us andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of jeff silber from bmo capital markets your line is now open jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thanks so much i wanted to start actually focusing on right management can you just remind us what percentage of that business comes from europe and is the european business growing there would we expect that to be growing considering what s going on in that environment jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jeff i would say the biggest parts of the business are in us we have seen good progress in europe and it has been an opportunity for us the uk is a market where we have some concentration as well so i d say still trends overall trends are still being driven by the us predominantly but we ve actually seen very good opportunities in europe and we continue to see that as an area of opportunity particularly in 2019 as we look at the pipeline jonas prising chairman chief executive officer and even in 2018 jeff the europe is the best performing business in our right management business globally so you are seeing a reflection of some of this environment come through in the performance of that business jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great and then shifting over to just your capital allocation strategy given what s going on are there any major changes here over the next few quarters are you going to hold back on m a repurchasing stock is that something you might be accelerating your thoughts would be really appreciated jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jeff in terms of capital allocation i guess i d start by saying we really haven t changed our strategy at all it remains the same if there is acquisition activity that goes first that will be a use of free cash flow to your point there hasn t been and if there isn t then we re going to continue to look at share repurchases as a vehicle to return cash to our shareholders and you saw what we did in the fourth quarter and with share repurchases we do continue to do that opportunistically so we don t have a set amount that we declare that we have to do each quarter and we ll continue that approach going forward jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst all right great thanks so much operator thank you and our next question is from the line of kevin mcveigh from credit suisse your line is now open kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst great thanks hey nice job on the margins overall could you just remind us what the it sounds like there is a bit of an offset of an accrual against ccie headwind what was that and should we expect that kind of sensitivity over the course of 2019 jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes kevin regarding the gross profit margin impacts what we anticipated was the loss of the december cice in france and we called out that we expect that that would be about a 30 basis point drag in the fourth quarter what we effectively had were direct cost adjustments that pretty much canceled that out so on an underlying basis we re really where the reported amount is about 30 basis points down the majority of those direct cost adjustments came out of france there s always direct cost adjustments as part of the normal process but there was one larger one in france related to training fund accruals which was one of the bigger items but i would characterize it as more of a one off i wouldn t anticipate that that s going to be a trend that continues into future periods kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst got it and then just as this cice runs off how have the pricing conversations gone with clients around kind of the headwind on that or just any thoughts on pricing in general jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer so i would say in france particularly one of the items we ve seen in recent quarters if you put the cice decrease aside in 2018 we ve actually seen good underlying improvement so our objective is to try and offset the regulatory impacts and we did that in 2018 in a very successful way and we re continuing to see progress there for 2019 so i called out the change to the new subsidy the headwind that that will create of about 50 basis points and we re optimistic that we re going to continue to be able to offset part of that pressure as well doing the same things we ve been doing so i d say from that perspective it continues to be a good labor market and in view of the regulatory changes we are actually having good progress on bill pay spreads on an overall basis so that is an opportunity for us and i d say that it s not just unique to france we ve actually seen i called out the fact that we saw improvement in italy in our staffing margin during the quarter as well and we ve been actually making progress in the us as well and i ve talked about experis experis saw an expansion in their gross profit margin during the quarter as well so there definitely is opportunity for us when we look at pricing going forward and we re starting to see that come through and that s actually part of what s happening in terms of our outlook into the first quarter on gp margin as well jonas prising chairman chief executive officer and kevin just to add on your question on pricing what it looks like pricing remains rational overall it s as usual a competitive environment but pricing pressures have not changed and to jack s point we ve seen some positive evolution of our ability to be able to compensate for any direct cost increases through our pricing in a number of markets kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst super thank you both operator thank you and our next question is from the line of hamzah mazari from macquarie capital your line is now open hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst good morning my question is around the cost side maybe just any thoughts as to how much more room you have on the cost side either through technology or consolidation of back office in europe i think us is behind you and the reason i ask is because you had this big restructuring about five years ago i think you took out 180 million of costs so just as you look at the portfolio is there any incremental room on the cost side jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes hamzah i d say yes there definitely is i d really go back to our financial targets and when we talked about our ebitda margin expansion goals one of the key levers that we continue to pull are ongoing efficiencies particularly in our back office processes so you referenced the us we did a lot in the us and we are seeing that as an underlying improvement in our cost structure there that s helping fund the technology investments that we re making and we re looking at that in a very similar way in our other large businesses around the world we did some of that last year in europe and we expect we ll continue to be making advancements in our back office optimization in those key markets and that will continue to be an opportunity for us so in the current environment where we ve seen some deleveraging due to the revenue pressure that we ve seen you can t see that coming out as strongly as it was before but it is happening and it will continue to be an area that gives us some ability to continue to improve the bottom line and fund our technology investments george tong goldman sachs analyst great and then just a follow up question on the experis side i know you ve touched on it but any further color as to what s driving the improvement is that just a market is that just better execution your back filling projects because i know that business had not issues but it was slow relative to what you re seeing now in terms of improvement so just any further color there thank you jonas prising chairman chief executive officer i think it s just a continuation of our improvement in terms of our execution as we ve said before we want to improve the business we want to get to where the market is but we want to get there in the right way so we re gradually executing we re adding recruiters in the areas where we see good demand and overall i think in the us in particular we have continued to see very good demand so it s just a continued progress from improvements in execution jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer and the one item i would just go back to that we ve emphasized in the past as in the us particularly we ve been very focused on growing the right way and growing profitably and we have been emphasizing the expansion of gross profit margin in the experis business in us so we saw a 2 improvement in the rate of decline in the fourth quarter and we are making progress to jonas s point but we re doing it while very focused on gp margin and we expanded that again in the fourth quarter and as i said we do continue to see improvement into the first quarter for experis as well hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks hamzah operator thank you and our next question is from the line of mark marcon from rw baird your line is now open mark marcon robert w baird analyst good morning good cold morning hey with regards to france can you just talk a little bit about what you re seeing in terms of the ongoing impact from the yellow vest protest and to what extent do you think that potentially the fee on changes that are currently scheduled for the fourth quarter could potentially change and then i have a follow up with regards to germany jonas prising chairman chief executive officer good morning mark yes no i was in france last week and so i was of course very interested in hearing what the impact was as it relates to the yellow vest and the impact that has been noted is primarily in the retail sector around the seasonal shopping as well as hospitality i mean those are the two sectors that have been hit quite hard at the end of the year but at this point the protests seem to be well contained they re predictable which means people work around them they don t disrupt working life and president macron ph has instituted a number of initiatives that at least for now appears to have calmed the situation quite a lot so i would say that this is now manageable from the french government s perspective and they have instituted a number of different initiatives to try and placate the part of the population that feels that they ve been left behind we don t know whether any change would happen but i would say the initiatives that the government put in to reduce the pressure on budget did not include any change on the fee on subsidies the way they ve been projected to kick in on the 1st of october and of course i m sure that that was part of the consideration when they looked at how to bridge a budget gap as they made some other changes but at least for now what they have said is that no this is going to happen and the date is the 1st of october and that s as recent as last week with the meetings that i had with government ministers so we feel pretty good about them sticking to that commitment because in the end it is a commitment to make france more competitive by reducing the cost of labor and enabling companies to invest and grow their workforce in france so i don t think that it s likely that it will change at least at this point mark marcon robert w baird analyst okay and then with regards to germany can you just shed a little bit more color with regards to what is the major driver behind the decline i mean i know there s multiple factors including the auto industry and the emissions changes but how would you characterize it and when do you think that we may end up inflicting or is there any light at the end of the tunnel as it relates to germany jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer mark it s jack i d say on germany going back to what we talked about in the third quarter we highlighted the disruption we saw from some of the systems in delivery model changes but we did make progress in the fourth quarter advancing initiatives around that so these are all changes that are going to make our germany business stronger going forward but the reality is we re still working through some of that and we saw some of that trend in the third quarter continue into the fourth quarter in terms of some of that disruption at the same time in the fourth quarter the market deteriorated and that really goes to your point about the auto sector we certainly have a we re very manufacturing focused in germany the auto sector is a big part of our business there no with that being said we actually have seen stabilization as we look in 2000 if we look in 2019 in the first few weeks of january here it stabilized so as i said in my outlook what we re holding right now for the first quarter guidance is what we re seeing as we exit the fourth quarter so a trend similar to the fourth quarter but it is encouraging that we in january have seen stabilization now and i think it s going to be dependent on what happens in the market activity going forward mark marcon robert w baird analyst i guess what i m wondering is from your field people and from your client conversations are you hearing anything about when they think they re basically going to run through the inventory i m specifically talking about the auto factoring and when that potentially ends up turning jonas prising chairman chief executive officer well i think you have germany that is their economic growth has come down pretty sharply and the projections for 19 is of the growth rate is projected to be much lower than it was in 2018 the flip side of that is there s the labor markets are still very strong unemployment is at 3 3 so again in germany the feeling is certainly not of a discussion around a downturn it is more of a slowdown but it s hard to predict when companies are going to feel better i think it hangs together with the overall outlook for europe and global trade with china trade wars potentially with the us being settled so i think that could be an inflection point when that gets resolved mark marcon robert w baird analyst great thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of gary bisbee from bank of america merill lynch your line is now open gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst hi guys good morning i guess the first question so i want to go back to the capital allocation and just get any incremental color you can provide on your appetite for share repurchases and i ask against the context of obviously in 2008 2009 a much more difficult environment but the company basically went two years and halted buybacks and then in 2013 when there was a mild double dip recession in parts of europe there was 18 months without any buybacks both times moving to a net cash position on the balance sheet how do you think about like at what level do you think about moving to that more of a safety mode or is there something different today in how you think about the liquidity the business the balance sheet strength et cetera that might make you act differently if we do see some further weakening thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer gary i d say it is as you refer we have a very strong balance sheet currently so when we look at capital allocation as i mentioned before we continue to think share repurchases are a great way to return cash to our shareholders we do that opportunistically and you ve seen what we ve done in the last two quarters to your point in terms of how we think of that going forward i d go back to what jonas said in terms of his overall points about europe so we continue to think this is a slowdown we don t think we re currently approaching a recessionary environment we re in a recessionary environment in europe at the moment and as a result that s how we think about our balance sheet now with that being said one of our goals is to continue to have a very strong balance sheet and you ve seen us be prudent in the past in the way we look at our overall balance sheet and we ll continue to do that but at the moment we feel very good about our capacity and you saw what we did in the fourth quarter and i d say we ll continue to look at that very opportunistically going forward gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst great thanks then a quick follow up on the french margin just how they re trending the 50 basis points for the change in the regulatory environment you ve talked about but before that and excluding the accrual adjustments should we think that on top of that 50 basis points drag there s beginning to be some more meaningful just deleveraging from the weaker revenue or is some of the price discipline stuff you talked about really limiting that and i guess i m thinking more forward looking than what happened in q4 thank you jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i d say we don t really do a lot in terms of oup margin guidance by specific country gary but what i would say to kind of get to your question is we feel pretty good about the ability to make up some of that pressure we re going to see from the switchover to the new subsidies and france continues to be a pretty efficiently run organization for us so i think we feel good about the opportunity going forward revenue has been the trends we ve seen in revenue certainly over the last couple of quarters has been declining but with that being said we ve seen stabilization in january so we will continue to look at our efficiency on an overall basis i think as we move forward if we were to see more severe revenue declines then as jonas said in his comments we re very very good at looking at our cost structure and making adjustments as needed to protect the oup margin and we would we certainly would consider that if the environment dictated that going forward gary bisbee bank of america merill lynch analyst great thanks i appreciate the commentary operator thank you and our next question is from the line of tim mchugh from william blair your line is now open tim mchugh william blair company analyst yes thanks just a question i guess related to spending but the sales force i recognize you re kind of cutting broadly expenses as you try and drive efficiency but as you see a downturn like this how are you managing kind of your sales resources are you keeping capacity in the hopes this is just a temporary kind of slowdown and not a downturn jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes good morning tim i would so first of all we saw some great performance in growth in latin america asia pacific parts of the americas so clearly in those countries we re adding resources and feel that we have good growth opportunities and we do the same in the us when then it comes to countries where we have a slowdown that we can see is a reduction in demand we manage it very carefully because we know that things can change but of course we are very good at managing productivity and operational excellence as we make sure that we have an expense base that supports the business in the state that it s in and as you could see in the fourth quarter we re actually quite agile in terms of how we can do that and adjust and clearly as we were managing this with our thoughts around it being a slowdown we manage it prudently because we also don t want to miss opportunities in markets even though they might be slowing down now they could come back and also we have opportunities due to the tight labor markets in many of those countries so inaudible could be a good opportunity for us despite the slowing manpower business in some cases as experis and others so it s really it is really the experience of the management been through many different cycles over many years of their tenure in the business that enables us to optimize that those management actions tim mchugh william blair company analyst okay thanks and then just can you elaborate on italy that you made the comment the dignity degree is not having an impact i guess it s more market weakness that you attribute to declines too but i guess what do you inaudible for that jonas prising chairman chief executive officer yes that s right tim so first of all of course last year we were coming up against extremely high growth rates so that will be the first observation i would make and then the second observation as you may might have seen this morning italy is now technically in a recession the fourth quarter was in negative territory so the economy is not very good but we feel very good about our business in italy it s well managed our outlook for the first quarter remains positive although with a little bit of a weaker revenue outlook our profitability and our ability to manage our staffing margins is strong so we still feel good about our italian business tim mchugh william blair company analyst okay thanks operator thank you and our next question is from the line of george tong from goldman sachs your line is now open george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning operating margins came in at 4 this quarter which was ahead of guidance part of the improvement came from direct cost adjustments on the gain on sale from your language translation business can you unpack the remainder of the upside drivers this quarter and how these may carry over to 1q margin performance jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer yes george what i d say is you re right there are a couple of different moving parts there but i guess on the overlying basis what i d say is in the current revenue environment think of it as the underlying running of about 20 basis points down year over year considering the year ago period where we had very strong growth and as we look into the first quarter really i d say that s going to that trend s going to continue about 20 basis points down and we did call out that the first quarter is our latest quarter in terms of revenues and as a result of that our technology spend in the first quarter has another 10 basis points of an impact so think of it that way think of it as an underlying 20 basis points and then the additional technology spend is another 10 in the first quarter george tong goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful in france you indicated that you re seeing evidence of good underlying improvement in the labor market that s helping to offset the regulatory impact can you lay out the timeline over the rest of this year for how you expect regulatory changes to impact growth and margins in basis points and how effectively the underlying environment will offset these headwinds jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer george i was referring to the ability to have discussions with clients regarding bill pay spreads and the opportunity in view of what s happening with the regulatory environment with the changes in the subsidy programs which are additional headwind so that was what i was referring to i think if we look at the outlook for 2019 from a regulatory standpoint i think we know the major components at this stage i think it s going to be the transition of the cic program we have a pretty good handle on that and what i just go back to the point that we have a good opportunity to make up that headwind in france due to ongoing discussions with clients and we re seeing that momentum in the current quarter and we see that trend continuing george tong goldman sachs analyst got it thank you jonas prising chairman chief executive officer okay we have reached the end of our allotted time and that will conclude our call operator thank you everyone and that concludes today s conference thank you for joining and you may now disconnect duration 63 minutes call participants jonas prising chairman chief executive officer jack mcginnis executive vice president and chief financial officer andrew steinerman jpmorgan

following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap as well as certain non gaap financial measures such as the ongoing return on equity roe electric margin natural gas margin ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted eps generally a non gaap financial measure is a measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are adjusted from measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap xcel energy s management uses non gaap measures for financial planning and analysis for reporting of results to the board of directors in determining performance based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors non gaap financial measures are intended to supplement investors understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with gaap these measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies similarly titled non gaap financial measures ongoing roe ongoing roe is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of xcel energy or each subsidiary adjusted for certain nonrecurring items by each entity s average stockholder s equity we use these non gaap financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results electric and natural gas margins electric margin is presented as electric revenues less electric fuel and purchased power expenses natural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power and the cost of natural gas are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms as a result changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues management believes electric and natural gas margins provide the most meaningful basis for evaluating our operations because they exclude the revenue impact of fluctuations in these expenses these margins can be reconciled to operating income a gaap measure by including other operating revenues cost of sales other operating and maintenance o m expenses conservation and demand side management dsm expenses depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income taxes earnings adjusted for certain items ongoing earnings

fintech for the people keynote speech by benoît cœuré chair of the cpmi and member of the executive board of the ecb at the 14th bcbs fsi high level meeting for africa on strengthening financial sector supervision and current regulatory priorities cape town 31 january 2019 introduction thank you for the kind invitation to speak at this event the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs and the financial stability institute fsi are critical partners for the committee on payments and market infrastructures cpmi i am very supportive of initiatives such as this high level meeting to further our shared mission to strengthen financial stability in africa and elsewhere that said bill cohen and fernando restoy have given me the difficult task of speaking after my friend governor lesetja kganyago he is always a dynamic speaker and few can match his charm and wit hence it was with some trepidation that i accepted this invitation but who would refuse an opportunity to come back to beautiful cape town the south african reserve bank as a key member of the cpmi graciously hosted us here a couple of years ago and it was one of the most memorable occasions in my time as committee chair as the global standard setter for payment clearing and settlement activity the cpmi works to support financial stability by enhancing the risk management and supervision of financial market infrastructures in my remarks this morning i would like to focus on an often overlooked objective for the committee and many of our members enhancing financial inclusion expanding access to payment services is an integral part of our work and a key regulatory priority i will discuss fintech s potential for achieving greater access and the role that central banks and other authorities can play to help fulfil this potential i will argue that over the past decade significant progress has been made in expanding access to payment services a number of innovative solutions many from this continent have helped increase access for underserved populations in africa and around the world but i will also argue that there is still much work to do a significant number of people still lack the means to make fast secure and trustworthy payments and to conduct other financial activities that would integrate them into the broader formal economy in many cases this burden is unfortunately often carried by those who are most in need we therefore need to strengthen our efforts to expand access to everyone and to effectively regulate and supervise new payments activity i will argue that a failure to do so may lead to highly undesirable outcomes it may push people into using unregulated and potentially unsafe shadow payments that include the likes of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies these types of shadow payments may expose people to large financial risks it is our duty to protect consumers and ensure that the benefits of innovation reach everyone and not just a portion of the population financial inclusion in payments progress made but more work ahead five years ago the cpmi and the world bank established a joint task force on payment aspects of financial inclusion affectionately known as pafi to help countries expand access to payment services the 2016 pafi report outlines actions that countries can take including explicitly committing themselves to financial inclusion objectives establishing sound legal and regulatory frameworks in support of financial inclusion providing basic transaction accounts at little or no cost having strong information and communications technology infrastructures that underpin transaction accounts increasing financial literacy and shifting government payments from cash to electronic payments as we mark the pafi report s third anniversary it seems like a good time to review the progress made in expanding access to payment services the world bank estimates that in 2017 69 of the global population or 3 8 billion people had an account at a financial institution or mobile money provider this represents an increase of 7 percentage points since 2014 over this period more than half a billion people opened an account this is certainly good news chart 1 illustrates the progress made in africa alone between 2014 and 2017 more than 70 million adults in africa opened a transaction account much of this progress is due to the rapidly increasing pace of adoption of new technologies that help reduce transaction costs for users simplify the process of setting up an account and offer new delivery methods among other benefits according to one study africa is home to more digital financial services than any other region in the world the use of such services is now second nature for millions of africans chart 1 consider m pesa it revolutionised payments by making it possible to settle low value transactions without a bank account it cleverly turned sim cards and a mobile service account into a virtual wallet for peer to peer and customer to business payments i believe kenya has served as an inspiration for the payments industry worldwide since then we have seen the rise of new payment services in both emerging and advanced economies some by bigtech firms some by fintech start ups and some by incumbent banks these new payment schemes not only increase access but also improve competition and drive down transaction costs before the recent fintech revolution the cost of financial services remained astonishingly stable and surprisingly expensive in other words improvements in technology have often not been passed on to households and firms there are clear signs that this is changing but chart 1 also highlights another important point that more work is needed only seven african countries have achieved a 60 penetration rate in many african countries less than half the population has access to basic payment services chart 2 highlights the number of people who have neither a transaction account nor a mobile phone expanding payment access through solutions that require a mobile phone is limited to people who have one chart 2 financial exclusion of this type threatens the cohesion of our societies it often forms part of a much wider social exclusion faced by individuals who lack access to education insurance or healthcare also without access to basic payment services people are unlikely to have access to credit markets and without credit there is less trade less investment less education and fewer jobs the empirical evidence is overwhelming developing and emerging market economies with deeper credit markets tend to grow faster than others a material number of micro small and medium sized enterprises in developing economies still lack access to affordable financial services and credit one consequence of financial exclusion from payments is that it may lead to the rise of shadow payments if people cannot make payments through conventional systems they may look to unregulated arrangements such as informal savings clubs peer to peer platforms or cryptocurrencies in doing so they may find themselves using payment arrangements that lack operational robustness appropriate risk management legal certainty and consumer protection thankfully these types of arrangement do not yet serve as credible replacements for the conventional payment system but they may gain ground if we fail to expand payments access more broadly promoting the broadest access to payment services broader access to payment systems is therefore crucial it is the first step in the long journey towards truly universal financial integration central banks and other authorities should recognise this they should be explicit in their commitment to expand payments access we need to make it known to the industry and the general public alike that we as authorities are putting the emphasis on inclusion for everyone the cpmi is working with the world bank to review the lessons learned from applying the pafi framework to develop a toolkit for countries and to analyse fintech developments in the context of financial inclusion we are also part of the financial inclusion global initiative to provide targeted technical assistance to china egypt and mexico to expand electronic payments acceptance increase the use of digital identification for financial services and enhance payment system security infrastructure and technology the work of the cpmi and our partners supports the new imf world bank bali fintech agenda launched a few months ago with a view to fostering fintech solutions that promote financial inclusion and further develop financial markets to take this agenda forward i trust the leadership of governor kganyago in his capacity as chair of the imf s international monetary and financial committee fintech solutions are not limited to the private sector the cpmi recently conducted a survey on the potential issuance of central bank digital currencies that can enhance access to financial services for underserved populations the results revealed that many central banks from emerging market economies are in fact exploring digital currencies as a way to expand financial access you can see this in chart 3 chart 3 but we arguably still have a long way to go survey respondents are proceeding with great caution on digital currencies and in my view rightly so while they are likely part of the future for central banks digital currencies raise complex challenges related to their safety and broader impact on financial structures we also need to analyse much more deeply how they would support financial inclusion and how central banks aim to overcome the big hurdle of providing consumers with access to basic transaction accounts or a payment device recent experiments such as uruguay s e peso provide useful food for thought digital currencies are however only one way in which central banks can foster financial inclusion modernising our existing retail and wholesale payment systems is another in november last year for example the ecb launched a new market infrastructure to support fast payments target instant payment settlement tips allows payment service providers to offer funds transfers to customers in real time and around the clock across europe tips could be a role model for developing economies it not only has the potential to help better prepare incumbents for the challenges arising from digital giants such as alibaba apple and google who are integrating payment services into their ecosystems it also has the potential to be a catalyst for financial inclusion innovations like tips have the potential to curb the use of shadow payments in particular in the area of cross border payments as many of you know all too well making cross border payments is inefficient and expensive according to one study the average revenue per cross border transaction is more than 20 across payment methods values and corridors these existing barriers to fast cheap cross border payments are the main appeal of using unregulated cryptocurrencies in particular in developing economies where foreign workers want to send money home and where families want to finance education overseas in the cheapest and fastest way possible to date innovation and competition in cross border retail payments seem to have been focusing mainly on the front end of the market i e the one that faces end users as noted by the 2018 cpmi report on cross border retail payments expanding closed loop proprietary systems across borders and peer to peer mechanisms based on distributed ledger technology may also have the potential to bring improvement to the back end of the market upholding the global correspondent banking network by clarifying compliance requirements and by upgrading know your client kyc processes and utilities can also make a difference to which fintech can also contribute upgrading and interconnecting our domestic payment systems which are convenient and have earned public trust is certainly a complex undertaking but it can go a long way towards helping us rise to the challenges emerging from currently unsafe crypto assets i believe this should be a key priority for international action providing safe and effective regulation and supervision a second priority that should go hand in hand with public efforts to study and apply new technologies is making sure that our regulation and oversight is up to the challenges of fintech in the rest of my remarks i would therefore like to address three fintech related challenges to regulation and oversight the first is who and what should be regulated and supervised the second is how regulators can foster innovation and competition and the third is how to keep the system safe in the age of fintech let me start with the who and what entity based regulation and supervision may not be effective in the digital age fintech is indifferent to conventional organisational forms it cannot easily be covered by current regulatory conventions some fintech firms provide services similar to those of regulated entities but are not held to the same type of risk management standards and consumer protection rules this may incentivise regulated entities to migrate towards the less regulated parts of the financial system this is what charles goodhart called the boundary problem of financial regulation of course activity based regulation is easier said than done in some cases it may be difficult to determine who should be regulated and supervised take bitcoin as an example authorities will find it difficult to find a legal entity responsible for bitcoin and therefore may not be able to regulate it but they may be able to regulate the broader ecosystem authorities are now actively overseeing crypto asset gatekeepers such as exchanges and wallets service providers and financial institutions with respect to their bitcoin related activities a prerequisite for activity based regulation is stronger international cooperation fintech knows no borders new technologies may make regulatory arbitrage an even more prominent concern again using bitcoin as an example banning the cryptocurrency in one jurisdiction does not stop it from being used in that jurisdiction as a decentralised system bitcoin will continue to function if a jurisdiction or even multiple jurisdictions curtails its use unless we all pull in the same direction international cooperation in the financial stability board its regional fora and in standard setting bodies is therefore of the essence my second point relates to innovation and competition regulatory initiatives will affect the direction and speed of innovation in the financial sector for example if we intentionally or unintentionally protect incumbents and prevent new contenders from establishing their business then we might miss out on opportunities that could broaden financial inclusion on the other hand authorities also need to keep an eye on the stability of traditional financial intermediaries new entrants in the payments arena may give rise to specific concerns such as the winner takes all effect and the bundling of technical services provided by tech giants not to mention possible challenges to privacy regulation all in all with technological progress moving faster than ever before authorities are faced with the difficult challenge of protecting the stability of the financial system while also allowing new businesses to grow and new services to thrive my third and final point relates to keeping the system safe in the age of fintech at its core and its periphery financial market infrastructures fmis are the backbone of the global financial system and new technologies are challenging our ability to keep them safe the core of the system is being increasingly confronted with sophisticated cyber threats failure to effectively address cyber risks can be destabilising as i ve noted on other occasions leaving these issues unaddressed may trigger the next financial crisis our cyber guidance co produced with iosco provides details of how fmis should enhance their cyber resilience capabilities we are also working closely with fmis on establishing several industry taskforces to encourage greater cooperation among global fmis this work builds upon a similar european effort led by the ecb to foster greater industry coordination on cyber related matters and to secure the periphery the cpmi recently published a strategy for reducing the risk of wholesale payments fraud related to endpoint security mark carney as chair of the global economy meeting at the bank for international settlements and i recently invited central banks around the world to join us in the global effort to strengthen endpoint security conclusion enhancing financial inclusion and with this i would like to conclude needs to remain a key priority for policymakers over the last five years as chair of the cpmi i have seen laudable progress in reducing the proportion of people excluded from the financial system but we can do even better millions in africa and elsewhere do not yet have a basic transaction account and if people don t have access to basic payment services we may find them using risky and unsafe arrangements shadow payments that do not offer sound credit and liquidity risk management legal certainty and consumer protection rights we have an obligation to bring the financial system closer to the people so that everyone benefits from access to credit savings and insurance products and we have an obligation to ensure that the benefits of innovation reach everyone and not just a portion of the population we need to encourage fintech to be built for the people old and young rich and poor expert and layman alike thank you
by howard schneider and jason lange washington reuters the federal reserve on wednesday signaled its three year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the u s economy due to global headwinds and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations as it held interest rates steady the u s central bank also discarded its promises of further gradual increases in interest rates and said it would be patient before making any further moves fed chairman jerome powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks with neither rising inflation or financial stability considered a risk and cross currents including slowing growth overseas and the self inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the u s outlook less certain we are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong u s macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross currents common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity powell told reporters after the end of a two day policy meeting continued u s economic growth was still the likeliest outcome powell said but was now less certain than a month ago when the fed said the economy was just as likely to grow faster than expected as it was to face a sharp downturn combined with comments that the fed s balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected the fed s meeting this week may mark a somewhat anticlimactic end to its years long battle to normalize monetary policy after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession the current fed policy rate of between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent is well below historical averages and if it goes no higher the fed will have little room to battle any future downturn with rate cuts alone it may also raise questions about whether the fed s shifting stance until recently powell and other officials said monetary policy was unnecessarily loose is a response to pressure from volatile financial markets or president donald trump trump has repeatedly attacked the fed for raising rates arguing that it was undercutting economic growth powell took advantage of a new regimen of press conferences after every policy meeting to lay out the series of touchy changes and insist the fed was only reacting to economic data not other pressures he termed the fed s new posture one of wait and see not necessarily a hard stop on rate increases but he also made clear the central bank is no longer in any rush after raising rates almost every quarter during the past two years and that absent some threatening rebound of inflation or evidence of risky financial behavior the pause would likely last taken together with the balance sheet announcement the fed s statement gives maximum flexibility to a central bank criticized by investors who saw the fed itself becoming a source of market turbulence that was reflexively tightening policy even as economic risks mounted this marks a full 180 from what the fed was signaling just a few months ago said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz in newport beach california after the release of the fed s statement u s stocks added to gains with the s p 500 index ending the day about 1 5 percent higher while the dollar and short term yields fell as investors gauged an even lower probability of additional rate hikes any time soon market expectations of future rates fell further contracts tied to the fed s policy rate continued to price about a one in four chance of a hike in 2019 and contracts maturing in 2020 were signaling a small but rising chance of a rate cut then cloudier outlook the fed raised rates four times last year including in december when it signaled it would do so twice more this year the economic outlook however has become more clouded as a result of recent volatility in financial markets and signs that growth is slowing overseas including in china and the euro zone there are also ongoing concerns about the impact of global trade tensions and fears the recent 35 day partial shutdown of the u s government over a budget dispute may crimp consumer spending in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient in determining future rate hikes the fed s rate setting committee said in its policy statement the fed made no change to the 50 billion maximum monthly runoff of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities from its balance sheet some traders have urged it to slow or halt its pullback from the bond markets at least for now in a separate statement the fed said it had decided to continue managing policy with a system of ample reserves reinforcing the notion that the rundown may end sooner than expected overall this signals the fed will not be on autopilot going forward said justin lederer treasury analyst at cantor fitzgerald in new york the downgrade in the fed s language around rate increases included a change in its description of economic growth from strong to solid and it noted that market based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months the fed s policy decision was unanimous reporting by howard schneider and jason lange additional reporting by jonathan spicer editing by paul simao
stocks finished sharply higher wednesday after the federal reserve signaled it could hold off on interest rate increases in the coming months citing muted inflation technology companies powered the broad rally which snapped the market s two day losing streak the benchmark s p 500 index is now track to end january with its biggest monthly gain in more than three years and the gains pushed the dow jones industrial average above 25 000 points for the first time since early december the fed gave the market everything it wanted in terms of a dovish message said willie delwiche investment strategist at baird now it s saying maybe there will be rate hikes maybe there won t be the midafternoon fed announcement added to early gains as traders welcomed positive results and outlooks from several big companies including boeing the aerospace giant soared after blowing away analysts forecasts for earnings and as its annual revenue topped 100 billion for the first time the gain in boeing s stock accounted for about a third of the 434 point gain in the dow jones industrial average the s p 500 index rose 41 05 points or 1 6 percent to 2 681 05 the dow gained 434 90 points or 1 8 percent

than 10 percent this month jitters over the ongoing u s china trade conflict uncertainty over the path of interest rates and signs of a weakening global economy helped knock the market into a steep slump in december that left the s p 500 index 9 2 percent lower for the month the market has since rebounded with the index is now on track to end january with a 7 percent gain that would be the biggest monthly increase since october 2015 while concerns over trade and the health of the global economy remain the fed s announcement allays one of the market s biggest concerns that the economy and corporate profits could be hurt if the fed continued its recent pace of rate hikes stocks are certainly celebrating an increasingly friendly message from the fed delwiche said it s not just a more measured pace in rate hikes but it s questioning whether or not there will be additional rate hikes with pressures on the u s economy rising a global slowdown a trade war with china a nervous stock market the fed signaled wednesday that it is in no hurry to resume raising interest rates and with inflation remaining tame the rationale to tighten credit has become less compelling the situation calls for patience chairman jerome powell said at a news conference we have the luxury to be patient the fed s benchmark short term rate will remain in a range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent after having been raised four times last year the central bank also said it is prepared to slow the reduction of its bond holdings if needed to support the economy that would put downward pressure on long term interest rates such as mortgages an early rally had stocks notching gains hours before the fed s announcement as investors welcomed some encouraging corporate earnings reports boeing surged 6 3

nokia corporation financial statement release january 31 2019 at 08 00 cet 1 nokia corporation financial report for q4and full year 2018 nokia delivers strong growth and improved profitability in q4 strategic momentum in software and enterprise board of directors plans to propose a dividend of eur 0 20 per share for 2018 up 5 compared to eur 0 19 for 2017 this is a summary of the nokia corporation financial report for q4 and full year 2018 published today the complete financial report for q4 and full year 2018 with tables is available at www nokia com financials investors should not rely on summaries of our financial reports only but should review the complete financial reports with tables rajeev suri president and ceo on q4 2018 results nokia ended the year with a strong fourth quarter we saw the second consecutive quarter of year on year sales growth across all five of our networks business groups as well as improved profitability in both networks and nokia technologies the execution of our strategy also proceeded well with the work we have put into building a solid foundation for nokia software showing clear results and our enterprise business rapidly becoming a pillar of growth looking forward i expect nokia s performance to strengthen for the full year 2019 versus 2018 and our view of a fast and meaningful shift to 5g remains unchanged given that 5g rollouts will be staggered over the course of the year we expect 2019 to have a soft first half followed by a much more robust second half over the longer term we expect a virtuous cycle of investment where operators update their networks across multiple domains from optical to macro radio fixed wireless access to cloud core small cells to ip routing network agnostic software and more following this we expect a second wave where industrial customers will invest in private wireless technology including lte and 5g ready networks with our end to end portfolio nokia is well positioned to tap this

sales in q4 2018 were eur 6 9bn compared to eur 6 7bn in q4 2017 net sales grew by 3 year on year on both a reported and constant currency basis our robust topline performance reflects the strong competitiveness across our portfolio and that our strategy execution is tracking well we maintained good momentum with strong 5g customer engagement in all key markets particularly strong performance in nokia software and solid performance in our enterprise business non ifrs diluted eps in q4 2018 was eur 0 13 compared to eur 0 13 in q4 2017 particularly strong execution in q4 enabled us to achieve our full year 2018 operational guidance with year on year operating profit growth in networks as well as in nokia technologies on a recurring basis non ifrs diluted eps increased by eur 0 02 year on year on a recurring basis driven by our gross profit performance and continued operating expense reduction partially offset by foreign exchange hedging and higher income tax expenses reported diluted eps in q4 2018 was eur 0 03 compared to negative eur 0 07 in q4 2017 primarily driven by lower income tax expenses and our gross profit performance partially offset by lower one time licensing net sales foreign exchange hedging and higher financial expenses in q4 2018 net cash and current financial investments increased sequentially by approximately eur 1 2bn and we ended 2018 with a strong financial position in q4 2018 net cash from operating activities benefitted from strong seasonality and positive changes in net working capital consequently recurring free cash flow for full year 2018 was slightly negative annual distribution to shareholders the dividend to shareholders is nokia s principal method of distributing earnings to shareholders over the long term nokia targets to deliver an earnings based growing dividend by distributing approximately 40 to 70 of non ifrs diluted eps taking into account nokia s cash position and expected cash flow generation beginning with the distribution for 2018 nokia plans to pay dividends in quarterly installments in addition nokia intends to implement a dividend fee for american depository receipt adr holders for 2018 nokia s board of directors plans to propose that the annual general meeting in 2019 authorizes the board to resolve on the maximum annual distribution of eur 0 20 per share compared to eur 0 19 for 2017 to be paid quarterly during the authorization period unless the board decides otherwise for a justified reason the board would make separate resolutions on each distribution and such resolutions would be separately disclosed following the annual general meeting 2019 and in connection with our financial reports for q2 q3 and q4 the annual distribution would be paid as quarterly dividends from retained earnings and or assets from the fund for invested unrestricted equity at the end of 2018 the distributable funds on the statement of financial position of the parent company amounted to eur 17 393 million including eur 15 197 million of invested unrestricted equity the board proposal to the annual general meeting will be published in connection with other proposals later in the spring new financial reporting structure beginning q1 2019 nokia announced organizational changes to accelerate its strategy execution on october 25 november 22 and december 31 2018 nokia will revise its financial reporting structure to better reflect its strategy organizational structure and the way it evaluates operational performance and allocates resources as of the first quarter 2019 nokia will have three reportable segments i networks ii nokia software and iii nokia technologies in addition nokia will disclose segment level data for group common and other for each reportable segment nokia will provide detailed financial disclosure including net sales and operating profit additionally nokia will provide adjusted financial disclosure for its networks and nokia software reportable segments with amounts related to nokia technologies and nokia bell labs allocated 85 to networks and 15 to nokia software this is also in accordance with industry practice and improves comparability with peer companies in addition nokia will provide net sales disclosure for the following businesses i mobile access ii fixed access iii ip routing and iv optical networks which together comprise the new networks reportable segment nokia will also provide separate net sales disclosure for its different customer types i communication service providers ii enterprises and iii licensees net sales by region will be provided at the nokia level to provide a basis for comparison nokia will present a recasting of financial results on an unaudited basis for all four quarters of 2018 prior to publishing its q1 2019 financial report note that certain reclassifications will be made in order to reflect the new organizational structure of the company the most significant of which are i activities related to our cloud core offering will be reclassified from the former mobile networks business group and former global services reportable segment to the new nokia software reportable segment and ii activities related to the former mobile networks business group and former global services reportable segment that are not reclassified to the new nokia software reportable segment will be reported

of nokia s outlook net sales and operating margin for networks and nokia software are expected to be influenced by factors including our expectation that we will outperform our primary addressable market in full year 2019 and over the longer term driven by our strategy which includes competing in 5g more effectively due to our strong end to end portfolio focusing on targeted growth opportunities in attractive adjacent markets and building a strong network agnostic software business on a constant currency basis we expect our primary addressable market to be flattish in full year 2019 this is an update to earlier commentary for growth and to grow in full year 2020 the timing of completions and acceptances of certain projects particularly related to 5g based on the evolving readiness of the 5g ecosystem and the staggered nature of 5g rollouts in lead countries we expect full year 2019 to follow a similar pattern as full year 2018 a soft first half followed by a robust second half with a particularly weak q1 new commentary our expectation that we will improve our r d productivity and reduce support function costs through the successful execution of our cost savings program potential mergers or acquisitions by our customers our product and regional mix and macroeconomic industry and competitive dynamics net sales and operating margin for nokia technologies is expected to be influenced by factors including the timing and value of new and existing patent licensing agreements with smartphone vendors automotive companies and consumer electronics companies results in brand and technology licensing costs to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and the regulatory landscape additionally our outlook is based on the following assumptions nokia s recurring free cash flow is expected to improve over the longer term due to lower cash outflows related to restructuring and network equipment swaps and improved operational results over time non ifrs financial income and expenses to be an expense of approximately eur 300 million in full year 2019 and over the longer term non ifrs income taxes at a rate of approximately 28 in full year

2017 of one time licensing net sales grew by 6 year on year with growth across all five of our networks business groups as well as in nokia technologies driven by particularly strong execution in our networks business our order backlog was strong at the end of q4 2018 and we continue to see strong customer engagement related to 5g across multiple parts of our portfolio including radio cloud core transport ip routing and network agnostic software we continued to build momentum in our end to end strategy including good performance converting our sales pipeline into net sales at the end of q4 2018 approximately 41 of our sales pipeline was comprised of cross business group deals we also made progress with our strategy to diversify and grow with particularly strong performance in nokia software and continued solid performance in our enterprise business in our networks business higher operating expenses were due to customer trials related to 5g as well as higher pre sales expenses to drive future growth and higher returns partially offset by the benefits from our cost savings program and lower incentive accruals in nokia technologies the decrease in net sales on a year on year basis was primarily due to lower one time licensing net sales on a recurring basis we maintained our strong track record with 11 year on year growth also we continued to make good progress in patent licensing extending our patent licensing agreement with samsung and signing a new patent license agreement with oppo further validating our global licensing program nokia non ifrs diluted eps amounted to eur 0 13 compared to eur 0 13 in the year ago period non ifrs diluted eps increased by eur 0 02 year on year on a recurring basis the increase in non ifrs diluted eps on a recurring basis was primarily driven by higher gross profit across all three reportable segments of our networks business and improved recurring gross profit performance in nokia technologies as well as lower operating expenses in nokia technologies partially offset by a net negative fluctuation in other income and expense related to foreign exchange hedging higher income tax expenses and higher financial expenses nokia reported diluted eps amounted to eur 0 03 compared to negative eur 0 07 in the year ago period primarily driven by lower income tax expenses related to the re measurement of deferred tax assets which resulted in deferred tax expenses and allowances of eur 143 million compared to eur 738 million in the fourth quarter 2017 in addition nokia reported diluted eps was driven by higher gross profit across all three reportable segments of our networks business and improved recurring gross profit performance in nokia technologies partially offset by a net negative fluctuation in other income and expense related to foreign exchange hedging and higher financial expenses nokia january december 2018 compared to january december 2017 nokia reported net sales decreased 3 year on year on

extending our patent licensing agreement with samsung and signing a new patent license agreement with oppo further validating our global licensing program nokia reported operating loss amounted to eur 59 million compared to an operating profit of eur 16 million in the year ago period this was primarily driven by lower gross profit across all three reportable segments in our networks business lower one time licensing net sales in nokia technologies and a negative impact from foreign exchange hedging this was partially offset by lower restructuring and associated charges and lower impairment of assets nokia reported diluted eps amounted to negative eur 0 10 compared to negative eur 0 26 in the year ago period this was primarily driven by lower income tax expenses related to the re measurement of deferred tax assets which resulted in deferred tax expenses and allowances of eur 155 million compared to eur 815 million in full year 2017 in addition nokia reported diluted eps was driven by the absence of expenses related to the early redemption of debt partially offset by lower gross profit across all three reportable segments in our networks business lower restructuring and

fourth quarter 2018 nokia generated an increase in net cash related to net working capital of approximately eur 400 million excluding approximately eur 140 million of restructuring and associated cash outflows nokia generated an approximately eur 540 million increase in net cash related to net working capital primarily due to an increase in liabilities and to a lesser extent a decrease in receivables and a decrease in inventories the decrease in receivables was approximately eur 50 million primarily due to an increase in the sale of receivables partially offset by the seasonal increase in receivables the decrease in inventories was approximately eur 30 million primarily due to a seasonal decrease in inventories partially offset by our decision to ensure sufficient flexibility to deliver higher levels of equipment sales particularly related to 5g the increase in liabilities was approximately eur 460 million primarily due to the seasonal increase in accounts payable as well as our efforts to drive better accounts payable terms in addition cash taxes amounted to an inflow of approximately eur 10 million benefitting from a tax refund of approximately eur 110 million in the

morning everyone we have a lot to cover so i m going to hit on a few highlights from our 2018 results then i ll turn it over to mark to provide some additional details as i reflect on this past year one of the things that stood out to me is the momentum that we ve built on the top line we delivered our strongest growth to date as a public company with 8 organic revenue growth we saw healthy advances in each of our businesses with a number of important achievements including several successful new product launches and strategic project wins we also saw 9 organic orders growth this past year fourth quarter orders were up double digits and showed strength across all of our businesses we see continued strength in our bidding pipelines across the entire company we see strength across our transport and applied water businesses and it s worth noting that a growing portion of our orders and recent wins are for longer lead time projects in our treatment sensus and aia businesses this tells us that our markets appear to be very healthy over the near and long term and it further strengthens our conviction around our 2019 and longer term growth prospects for adjusted ebitda we saw an improvement of 80 basis points which was in line with our guidance of 19 5 for the year operating margins were slightly short of our guidance for the year at 13 7 up 60 basis points excluding purchase accounting year over year we saw benefits from productivity volume leverage and price realization which accelerated throughout the year partially offsetting these gains were inflationary pressures sales mix and funding our strategic investments much of that investment has been focused on our measurement control solutions segment this is aimed at capturing significant revenue opportunities across our businesses the investment also capitalizes on our first mover advantage in providing new digital and analytics solutions we expect this to moderate as we enter the second half of the year i m very pleased with the benefits that we re already realizing from this strategy since the sensus acquisition we ve won more than 100 million in contracts that will provide revenue synergies and we expect to announce another exciting and significant deal this quarter adjusted earnings per share were up 20 our full year free cash flow conversion was below our expectations we took measures in late q4 to maintain customer service levels impacted by component shortages by building inventory of critical items and we made strategic purchases to manage tariff impacts we remain confident in our ability to deliver free cash flow conversion at or above 100 in 2019 and beyond so in summary while there are certainly areas for us to work on i am pleased with our strong momentum as we head into 2019 let me now spend a few minutes on the progress we re making on our top strategic priorities that enable us to meet our long term financial commitments and maintain the company on a path of sustainable growth and margin expansion the first is accelerating profitable growth which encompasses our initiatives to drive commercial excellence grow in emerging markets and further strengthen innovation and technology first commercial excellence i m encouraged by market share gains across a number of our business lines i also want to expand upon our team s execution on price we can attribute about one point of the organic growth we saw this past year to our commercial team s pricing efforts and we see continuing strength throughout 2019 i m very proud of what our sales and marketing teams have demonstrated here in terms of commercial leadership in emerging markets we delivered 11 revenue growth and orders momentum continued in our key focus markets of china india and the middle east advancing innovation is another core element of our longer term growth strategy our team delivered 120 basis point increase in our vitality index to over 25 and we are pleased by the accretive growth rates and margin profile of these new offerings we re also excited about a number of new technologies that we ll bring to market in 2019 these offerings combine our data analytics and software capabilities with our installed base and this is enabling us to bring entirely new solutions to our customers as we aim to help them address their biggest challenges of water scarcity affordability and resilience as i already mentioned we remain sharply focused on our continuous improvement program in 2018 we achieved 157 million in savings a 6 increase in the previous year we still have plenty of runway on our ci journey and see more efficiency opportunities as we penetrate deeper in the company and across our functions to that end we are now planning the next stage of our business simplification efforts which we spoke about at our last investor day this is the next progression in our plan which we have timed to avoid disrupting our focus on growth and the integration of new businesses over the last 18 months this work will now further simplify our business structure eliminate waste and bureaucracy and allow us to move faster and with greater agility to better serve our customers we will also focus on further manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies from footprint optimization sku rationalization and improvements to our cost of quality we expect the execution of the majority of these actions to begin in the second half of 2019 we estimate up to 100 basis points of savings on a run rate basis with most of the benefit in 2020 and the balance in 2021 this work reinforces our confidence in achieving our 2020 targets and it positions us to be more efficient and focus for the long term we continue to put our capital to work in smart disciplined ways this allows us to develop organically as well as acquire the solutions we need to best address our customers challenges these investments have focused on disruptive technologies and solutions and we will continue to remain steadfast in our approach in that area we continue to return capital to shareholders today announcing a 14 increase in the dividend consistent with our commitment to growing our dividend in line with earnings growth we are very proud of our talent and we continue to strengthen our team through a number of investments in development programs strategic hires and the talent that joins us through acquisitions and finally we are a purpose driven company in 2018 we advanced our commitment to be a company that creates both significant economic and social value we have achieved our original five year sustainability goals one year ahead of schedule and we are set to release ambitious new goals this spring we are honored to have been recognized by a number of external organizations for these efforts yet we can and we will do more in terms of the solutions we provide are social impact in areas like disaster relief and our environmental footprint sustainability is increasingly important to our people our customers our investors and the community and it s a key priority for xylem so now let me turn it over to mark e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks patrick please turn to slide 5 and i ll begin with our full year results first i m very pleased with our top line performance this year as we beat the high end of our revenue guidance with 8 organic growth this reflects strong growth across all of our end markets we also saw robust organic growth in all major regions with emerging markets in the u s leading the way at 11 and 9 growth respectively our revenue performance benefited from solid underlying market growth but also from the outstanding work of our commercial teams to gain share and ramp up our price realization operating margins for the year were 13 7 up 60 basis points from the prior year excluding purchase accounting impacts this reflects continued traction in our productivity initiatives which delivered 157 million in savings as well as volume leverage and accelerating price realization partially offsetting these improvements were higher levels of inflation higher investments to drive longer term growth unfavorable mix and negative currency impacts adjusted ebitda margin was up 80 basis points to 19 5 we reported adjusted earnings per share this year of 2 88 an increase of 20 and at the higher end of our original 2018 guidance our free cash flow conversion finished below our expectations this year at 64 our cash conversion metrics in both 2017 and 2018 were impacted by large non cash tax items excluding these fourth quarter items our cash conversion was 75 this year which was below our target as patrick mentioned the primary driver of this miss was our working capital performance the timing of our strong sales growth late in the fourth quarter and the impacts of higher raw material inflation and strategic pre buys of inventory to manage tariffs and component stocks drove working capital higher by 140 million in the quarter as a result year end working capital increased 50 basis points over last year to 19 of sales to give you perspective on the impact that the timing of our q4 sales and strategic inventory build had on our year end working capital our 12 month average cash conversion actually improved by over 4 days from december 2017 so i m confident in both the improvements we re making to our working capital processes and that working capital improvement will once again become a source of cash for xylem in 2019 so please turn to slide 6 and i ll review the fourth quarter results we were pleased and a bit surprised by the strength of the acceleration in demand through the fourth quarter which drove sales above the high end of our outlook organic orders were up 10 with high single digit growth in both water infrastructure and applied water and 18 organic growth in measurement control solutions revenues were up 9 organically in the fourth quarter which was on top of 7 organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 acquisitions contributed 2 growth and foreign exchange was a 3 headwind from an end market perspective the utility segment was up 10 organically this growth reflects strength across nearly all regions and applications globally and is encouraging given the tough compare to the double digit organic growth in last year s fourth quarter industrial markets were up 8 driven by continued strength in north america europe and latin america commercial markets had a very strong quarter growing 17 with double digit growth in the us and asia pacific regions certainly some of the strong demand in the us was driven by the timing of announced price increases as a result we expect to see solid but moderating demand in our commercial business for q1 our residential business was flat in the quarter operating margin for the quarter was 15 1 which was up 30 basis points versus the prior year excluding purchase accounting this was lower than our expectations as continued margin expansion in water infrastructure and applied water were muted by margin contraction in the mcs segment i ll review the details of each segment s margin performance in a minute against the backdrop of supply chain challenges from tariffs and constrained electronic component supply i m very pleased with our team s performance in delivering earnings per share of 0 88 an increase of 16 year over year please turn to slide 7 and i ll review our segment performance for the quarter water infrastructure orders grew 7 organically year over year this growth was driven by sustained strong demand in north america and emerging markets particularly in treatment we exited the quarter with total backlog of 620 million up approximately 7 organically year over year of this amount 480 million is due to ship in 2019 which is up 6 on an organic basis our treatment bidding pipeline grew 10 this year driven heavily by us activity in large projects in india the treatment pipeline remains a strong barometer for us as to the health of the water utility market water infrastructure revenues grew 9 year over year on an organic basis and foreign exchange was a 24 million headwind revenue in the emerging markets was up 18 with much of the growth coming from our treatment business particularly noteworthy was the 37 growth in china we saw more than 40 growth in treatment and more than 30 growth in transport as we ve continued to see demand for our products benefit from both the new regulations around water quality as well as our investments in product localization india was down slightly in the quarter due to the lapping of large custom pump project deliveries in the prior year with our current backlog and growing project pipeline from new wastewater treatment regulations we expect india to be our fastest growing market in 2019 with over 30 organic growth western europe was up 7 led by a high single digit growth in transport where we saw strong opex activity across several countries the segment grew 4 in the us with solid growth in both the wastewater transport market and industrial dewatering business treatment growth was impacted by project delays that moved into the first quarter we were also encouraged by the high single digit organic orders growth during the quarter operating margin for the segment increased 80 basis points to 20 7 the highest level in our history this reflects our continued progress in driving productivity as well as volume leverage and accelerating price realization please turn to slide 8 applied water orders grew 8 organically over the prior year overall we exited the quarter with backlog of 200 million up 5 organically compared to last year our shippable backlog for 2019 is about 185 million which is up approximately 15 on an organic basis revenue in the quarter grew 10 organically versus the prior year the growth was driven by the commercial and industrial end markets which were up 17 and 7 respectively over the prior year in the us revenue was up 14 year over year with growth across all three end markets most of that growth was driven by strong project activity and price realization in both our industrial and commercial applications both of which grew double digits emerging markets revenue grew 13 reflecting strong commercial growth in china and india as well as for industrial applications in latin america segment operating margin in the quarter increased 30 basis points to 17 2 year over year strong productivity of 390 basis points and price realization of 220 basis points more than offset increased inflation which was impacted by tariffs and currency impacts now let s turn to slide 9 measurement control solutions orders grew 18 organically over the prior year and revenue grew 11 on an organic basis for sensus revenue in our water business increased 16 driven by growth in the north american market our gas business grew 23 mostly from large north american project deployments electric was down 5 in the quarter due to the lapping of project deployments in north america and our advanced infrastructure analytics business grew high single digits on a pro forma basis driven by the delivery of projects in the us and europe we continue to see success in bringing the aia platform solutions to new markets through existing xylem channels and relationships including first time wins in several countries we re also encouraged by the strong consumer interest in these new solutions and the order growth we saw this past year now moving to margins adjusted ebitda margins in the quarter were down 160 basis points year over year to 17 3 adjusted operating margin for the segment decreased 280 basis points to 7 5 we ve been accelerating our investments in these businesses to drive market share gains with our sensus solutions and capitalize on our first mover advantage in our advanced infrastructure analytics business our investments impacted margins by 270 basis points year over year in the quarter and were largely in line with our expectations during the quarter and despite the tremendous efforts of our supply chain team we saw increased supply constraints for electronic components this impacted both our material cost by an additional 100 basis points and revenue mix by over 100 basis points in the quarter and put more downward pressure on operating margin than expected we will continue to aggressively manage the electronic component pressures to minimize impact to our customers and expect supply constraints to ease after the first half of 2019 we expect component shortages and project mix to continue to impact margins primarily through the first quarter of 2019 with improving mix moderating investment levels and volume leverage driving strong margin expansion for the second half of 2019 and 100 basis points of improvement for the full year now let s turn to slide 10 for an overview of cash flows and the company s financial position we closed the quarter with a cash balance of about 300 million we invested 66 million in capital in the quarter and returned 38 million to our shareholders through dividends we repaid 200 million of debt in the quarter bringing our leverage down to 2 7 times this represents the midpoint of our target leverage range which we achieved as planned and for the first time since the sensus acquisition in 2016 and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating i ve already discussed our working capital performance and my confidence that working capital will be a source of cash flow in 2019 enabling us to deliver cash conversion of at least 105 please turn to slide 11 and patrick will cover our 2019 outlook patrick decker president and chief executive officer thanks mark as we discussed we entered the year with solid top line momentum and we re confident in our trajectory and focus on achieving our 2019 targets and long term strategic goals for 2019 we expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4 to 6 our adjusted operating margin is forecast to expand 100 basis points to 150 basis points to the range of 14 7 to 15 2 let me pause and acknowledge that we realized one of the keys to achieving our margin expansion in 2019 and staying on track to our 2012 target is to now begin delivering accretive margin improvement in the mcs segment we expect to drive 100 basis points of margin expansion despite continued investment and component supply cost pressure in the first half of 2019 now back to the outlook we expect adjusted ebitda to improve by 100 basis points to 150 basis points which will bring it to a range of 20 5 to 21 at the bottom line we expect to generate adjusted full year earnings per share in the range of 3 20 to 3 40 this excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about 30 million adjusted eps growth is projected to be in the range of 11 to 18 for the year finally as mark discussed we expect to continue to generate solid cash from operations and this will enable us to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 105 in 2019 please turn to slide 12 now let s review the expected end market growth for 2019 first utilities which make up about 50 of our revenue are expected to grow in the mid single digits as we saw in 2018 we expect water and wastewater spending to remain healthy particularly in the us and emerging markets this includes mid to high single digit growth in our water infrastructure business as well as mid single digit growth in the mcs business reflecting timing of project deployments in europe the outlook is mixed and we expect low single digit growth there in total we are encouraged by the continued infrastructure investments in locations like india where wastewater regulations are leading our healthy treatment backlog in both india and china we expect to grow double digits our industrial end market which represents roughly 35 of our revenue is expected to be up low to mid single digits growth in the us is expected to moderate slightly in the second half of the year compared to the last two years however still up mid single digits we expect the emerging markets to continue to gain strength in india and latin america industrial applications in the middle east are expected to soften a bit and we expect china growth to moderate slightly to low to mid single digits our commercial end market which constitutes about 10 of our revenue saw considerable growth in 2017 and 2018 we expect this to remain healthy in 2019 the us and western europe will provide low to mid single digit growth and overall we expect the commercial end market to grow low to mid single digits in 2019 and finally in our smallest end market residential which is about 5 of our revenue we anticipate low single digit growth with a flattening us housing market and a highly competitive replacement market us and european growth is expected at flat to low single digit levels emerging markets growth remains healthy as secondary clean water demand continues in china and greater asia now mark will give you a few additional details on the 2019 outlook e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer as we ve done in prior years we re providing the seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our 2019 planning assumptions on slide 13 as patrick discussed we re guiding to 4 to 6 organic growth for 2019 this breaks down by segment as follows we expect 5 to 7 growth in water infrastructure 3 to 5 growth in applied water solutions and 4 to 6 growth in measurement control solutions we re assuming a euro rate of 1 14 which was the average for the month of january we ve included our fx sensitivity table in the appendix and our estimated tax rate for 2019 is 19 5 moving to the first quarter we expect total company growth in the range of 5 to 6 led by continuing strength in the us municipal market and emerging markets growth we expect first quarter adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 11 3 to 11 6 representing 20 basis points to 50 basis points expansion over the prior year while we do expect modest margin expansion for the mcs segment on a quarter sequential basis we also expect the impacts of the component constraints in mix to continue through the first quarter of 2019 meanwhile we expect strong margin expansion in both our water infrastructure and applied water segments driven by continued cost reductions volume leverage and improved price realization with that please turn to slide 14 and i ll turn the call back over to patrick for closing comments patrick decker president and chief executive officer thanks martk 2018 was a year of solid momentum we re very encouraged by the health of our end markets as well as the growth in the organic and inorganic investments that we ve made we re also very pleased about the integration of our recent acquisitions which are allowing us to provide new disruptive solutions we are managing through near term challenges and supply chain disruptions in the marketplace and we are confident in our near and longer term targets based on growth and accretive margins in large deals as well as the additional opportunity we have to remove cost and inefficiency we are guiding in 2019 to what we believe is healthy top line growth and margin expansion to execute on our 2020 financial targets now with that operator let s open it up to q a questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question will come from nathan jones with stifel nathan hardie jones stifel nicolaus company incorporated research division analyst good morning everyone patrick decker president and chief executive officer good morning nathan nathan hardie jones stifel nicolaus company incorporated research division analyst let s just start on those 2020 financial targets i guess the big one is the 17 to 18 operating margin goal which clearly requires a big ramp up in margins in 2020 so maybe if you could just give us a little more color on how you get there what the buckets are that get you from 19 guidance here to at least at the bottom end of that range in 2020 patrick decker president and chief executive officer sure so it s patrick so i d say nate first thing first we believe we have a highly credible 2019 plan that we ve gotten to here to get at least 100 basis points expansion this year beyond that let me give you some of the large buckets that we see for 2020 first which is the biggest bucket is our savings from continuous improvement and cost takeout and that s all net of inflation so that s our biggest bucket that s again continued productivity on our procurement and lean journey we also have savings that begin to ramp late 19 into 20 from our global business services initiatives as well as the broader simplification that i outlined in my prepared remarks the second area is again the core volume and price leverage that we expect to get even at the low end of our long term revenue growth guide of 4 to 6 we expect to see very good margin accretion and leverage flow through there and then third is the large deals that we re getting right now from the sensus synergies and aia and those deployments start later this year and really layer on in fourfold ph in 2020 additionally as we commented earlier our investments in the mcs segment do begin to moderate later in 19 and then moderate once again in 2020 from our 2019 level so those are the four really big buckets that give us the confidence to be able to hit our margin guidance nathan hardie jones stifel nicolaus company incorporated research division analyst that s helpful thanks maybe on the mcs investments here you guys have obviously been investing heavily to drive growth there and demonstrating very good growth all across the portfolio so i don t think anybody will have a lot of problems with that maybe you can talk a little bit more about the things that have been achieved with those investments what s in the pipe to come to market maybe later in 19 and into 20 to continue to drive growth patrick decker president and chief executive officer sure yes so i d say with respect to first of all i d say we continue to invest in all aspects of our portfolio so we are investing certainly in our water infrastructure and our applied water businesses as well especially about bringing new products to market but specifically within mcs i think we re in the early stages of building out our offerings in embedded software and networking services and really looking to take full advantage of that first mover advantage and i d say given the strength and productivity we ve had across the entire company it s also afforded us the opportunity to accelerate growth investments in four really areas first is again building out this new advanced infrastructure analytics platform second is building out new offerings in electric and gas to support some of the large deals that we ve secured and won there we are investing in designing specific products and specs for some of the international deals that you ve heard me talk before about that we re pursuing and then again lastly building out a much broader networking and software solution capability beyond that and in terms of getting any more specifics i d probably hold back from there at this point in time there will be more to come in that regard but again we feel very good about the pipeline of deals that are out there that we re pursuing right now that really are a result of these new offerings andrew edouard buscaglia joh berenberg gossler co kg analyst okay and just one more on capex and mark thanks for the explanation on working capital that helps a lot on free cash flow capex has increased pretty significantly over the last couple of years i know a lot of that is growth capex localizing production capex for 2019 looks like staying at about the same level as 2018 where do you see that shaking out in the long run once you get through kind of this investment cycle to localize and drive growth e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer yes that s a good question certainly one that we talk about with the team and the board i think we are at the upper end when you think about capital as a percent of revenue we have ramped that up that has been a function of the investments we ve been banking so some of those investments that patrick talked about just a moment ago is for new products so there s tooling that we re building we ve got a lot invested in engineering and software some of which gets capitalized so clearly when you look at those components and then even dewatering this year we had a huge ramp up in demand and we had to build capital and some capacity to meet demand we re building out our smart hubs in aia and that requires not only p l related investment around on the ground support in sales and engineering but also you need tools you need pipedivers you need smartballs you need trucks and so we ve really hit a point i think this year and into next year where you re going to see a higher level of investment as a percentage of sales and that starts to moderate back toward where we ve been patrick decker president and chief executive officer yes i would just add nate i would say again this is patrick i would say much like mark talked about in his prepared comments around working capital and cash conversion i d say the same thing around capex and that is there is no structural change here and the capital intensity of this business it really is the timing around the things that mark alluded to here and we would expect that to moderate back to kind of normal levels so nothing that we are particularly concerned about here andrew edouard buscaglia joh berenberg gossler co kg analyst okay thanks very much for the help i ll pass it on patrick decker president and chief executive officer okay thank you operator the next question will come from mike halloran with baird mike halloran baird analyst hey good morning everyone patrick decker president and chief executive officer good morning mike halloran baird analyst so let s just start on the orders side in the pipeline obviously underlying trends remain healthy it doesn t sound like there is any sign of slowdown can you maybe give a little color on how customers are looking at the world right now any hesitancy in pipeline conversion from their perspective and any color around that would be great patrick decker president and chief executive officer sure mike this patrick so we re keeping our ears close to the ground obviously on each one of our end markets so let s start with utilities we really aren t seeing or hearing any indications of a slowdown again if you think about the 10 increase in our bidding pipeline on treatment which is a really good indicator and that s not a very big bidding pipeline so at some point in time you would expect that to kind of be tough in terms of year over year compares but it continues to expand there and that is consistent whether it be in north america and certainly in the emerging markets as we indicated we think europe is next it will moderate to kind of low single digit growth in 2019 but we re not seeing any change in trajectory here which is quite encouraging now we also feel that a fair amount of that is share gains but again the overall market seem to be healthy on the industrial side again 35 of our total revenue there our channel partners we go heavily through distribution they again continue to see strength in the market again we are calling for some moderation here in the second half of this year we re not seeing that yet but we re calling it we re expecting that there will be some tough comps year over year that are out there so not sure if that s helpful but we re just not we re not seeing it right now in terms of any any slowdown e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer just one comment yes it s all good but we re also mindful that there is a chunk of our business that s short cycle right so these and when these things hit they hit quickly and we re sober to that fact but as patrick said we have our antennae up we re talking to our teams and customers constantly we re all over the pipeline so right now we re not seeing those signs mike halloran baird analyst sounds good and then another customer question what s the receptivity been as you re trying to bring some of these mcs solutions the technology connectivity analytics to the broader platform particularly in the infrastructure side seems like it s good receptivity i know you ve referenced in the prepared remarks some incremental product offerings coming this year would love to hear some early thoughts there patrick decker president and chief executive officer yes so we ve been very encouraged i think the where i start mike is the we re able to have very different kinds of conversations today at different level of the organization more senior levels of the organization than we ve had before because if you think about any company going in and speaking to let s take utility irrespective of what the utilities biggest challenges are if you ve only got one or two products to offer or couple of pain points you can address you spend your time trying to convince them those are the pain points they need to be addressing we re able now to go win with confidence and first have a conversation around what are the biggest challenges that you believe you have or that the data shows that you have with a pretty high likelihood that we also then have the product the technology the offering to solve that problem and so we re able to be seen as even more objective and consultative in the conversation now that s early days we don t have that selling capability across the board i don t want to get ahead of ourselves but that s certainly where we re going and so i see a high degree of receptivity from the utility operators and ceos because they want to be able to have that open candid objective conversation where we see a lot of the opportunities here where we see a lot of synergies is new wins and interests across the emerging markets where if they re building new infrastructure they don t want to build dumb infrastructure they want to build smart infrastructure and so they need the help to be able to know how to best optimize that and that s why we re seeing a lot of the receptivity there and then when you think about the fact that previously pure and the other advanced infrastructure analytics businesses that we ve acquired were pretty much largely north america and to some extent european businesses not a lot of presence in the emerging markets and that s where we re seeing a lot of excitement from customers mike halloran baird analyst that s helpful and then last one just the water infrastructure margins obviously really robust in the quarter anything in there that you don t think is sustainable relative to revenue levels and normal seasonality e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer no it s pretty clean and what we saw is a real push on productivity and savings and really kind of a catch up on pricing to offset what had been a little bit of a headwind from inflation and really good progress on that so nothing unusual and we expect to continue to see that those trends in 2019 with more pickup on price patrick decker president and chief executive officer and i would just add there that i think it s important that we note that we are managing a portfolio here and so we re allocating capital every day every quarter each year and so we continue to invest in water infrastructure we continue to invest in applied water obviously as we begin to see the ramp up in mcs margins here that affords us the opportunity to further invest in those two pieces of our portfolio because there is a lot in the pipeline from a new product development standpoint and sales and marketing efforts that we d like to be able to do here but we ll continue to manage that as a portfolio over time mike halloran baird analyst thanks gentlemen appreciate it patrick decker president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from deane dray with rbc capital markets deane dray rbc capital markets llc research division analyst thank you good morning everyone patrick decker president and chief executive officer good morning deane deane dray rbc capital markets llc research division analyst hey i d like to start with the free cash flow guidance for 2019 the 105 ph or better and maybe could you just clarify whether you re baking in any of these working capital inefficiencies at the start of the year or any other tax noise the component shortages that are requiring you to add a bit more to inventory so any of those dynamics affecting the cash flow outlook e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely deane we definitely took it on the chin in the quarter relative to some of these strategic pre buys as well as in and whether that was for the tariffs or around the component shortages and we also as i mentioned in my prepared remarks saw a big ramp up in volume and quite frankly it was higher than certainly we had forecasted above the top end of the range and the timing of that in the quarter was such that there that was 90 million of cash just in terms of volume and that is going to normalize in both of those items along with continued progress on improving our processes and efficiency whether it s in receivables we ve got a lot of opportunity on the inventory side of things with supply chain in our s op and payables but those will reverse out in 2019 deane dray rbc capital markets llc research division analyst that s good and just sticking on the cash flow side a couple points one is you all talking about a higher volume at year end you re on the good side of being an outlier because we ve heard a number of the industrial companies that just the opposite that there was a lot of fall off in december so you ve got that high quality problem of handling that 90 million so that s a positive what about capex how much for this year any particular projects that you would highlight in terms of investment e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i think we really pushed hard and we did spend capital to grow out our aia platform as i mentioned we ve been running hard in terms of our engineering and development around a number of software components and products that ended up as capitalized software and back to your point about nice problem to have the demand in our dewatering business has really been running hot so we ve had to add capacity to the fleet as well so those are nice problems to have but certainly things that we needed to respond to as we look out into 2019 though deane the investment level we expect to remain flat part of that is a function of getting out ahead of the curve which we did in the back part of 2018 patrick decker president and chief executive officer yes i think to your question deane around are there any specific projects to be called out in 2019 one of the reasons why we re not able to say that it s moderating or declining is because we also need to absorb and it s not a big ticket item but we re going to be likely kicking off another greenfield expansion in india in terms of manufacturing capacity now that won t all hit in 2019 but we re certainly going to be starting that in 2019 it s not a big ticket item in and of itself but it s enough to kind of hold these numbers flat year over year and that s just really again to get ahead of the incredible demand we re seeing in india deane dray rbc capital markets llc research division analyst that s great to hear about those investment opportunities and if we re looking at that free cash flow target for the year it feels to us that there is further upside to that 105 ph but we ll see how this develops and then as a follow up patrick decker president and chief executive officer we are certainly i can assure you deane we re working at it so we were disappointed in q4 so it got our attention on the working capital side deane dray rbc capital markets llc research division analyst good and then in terms of the organic revenue guidance everything looked pretty much as expected if not a little bit better the one that kind of jumps out at me is mcs the 4 to 6 seems like they could be doing better and maybe it s because we re all excited about the opportunities in aia maybe they don t move the needle enough yet but what is that upside at mcs that could potentially do better than what you re forecasting today patrick decker president and chief executive officer yes so the aia platform is still a relatively small chunk of revenue for us at north of 100 million of revenue and that is going to be growing a very healthy double digit and is accelerating in 2019 versus 2018 both orders and revenue it really is the sensus piece of the platform and it really deane it s very straightforward it s assumptions around timing and project deployments so we ve got some very large deals that we ve won we ve have had some that we are likely going to be announcing here in very short order it just comes down to when those things hit most of them we believe will hit in 2020 which is what gives us great confidence around our margin expansion and growth in 2020 so obviously the timing of those things could move this around but we re giving you our view kind of right down the middle of fairway right now deane dray rbc capital markets llc research division analyst great thank you patrick decker president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from john walsh with credit suisse john walsh credit suisse ag research division analyst hi good morning patrick decker president and chief executive officer good morning john walsh credit suisse ag research division analyst so maybe just following back to that 2020 margin question if i can ask it a little bit differently so since you provided those targets you ve had fx tariffs you ve been getting some deals done i believe that was an organic number and didn t contemplate deal dilution at that time just wondering if you re filling this bridge with things that would have been sitting in a contingency bucket or if you re filling it by kind of over executing on other parts of the plan to think about this as not really an endpoint but as a step to drive margins higher beyond that kind of range over time patrick decker president and chief executive officer sorry this is patrick sorry for that it s a great angle on the question john the way i would articulate it would be yes there are things that have created levels of dilution on their own that being deals and things of that nature from an op margin standpoint and this is a journey over time it doesn t end in 2020 and obviously it won t be long and we ll be giving you targets beyond 2020 what i would say has changed here are a couple of things that give us the confidence one is that we do see further opportunities to drive simplification and efficiency across the organization part of that obviously is by way of some of the integration synergies from the deals that we ve done part of that is just simplification of our heritage businesses by further integration there and simplification so certainly we re leaning on that lever harder than we had necessarily laid out at our original investor day but it s based on opportunity two as we ve added other assets to the portfolio and we re getting more mature on our own continuous improvement the whole lean deployment journey we re now able to deploy those capabilities across those new assets and so we ve got a bigger pie to play with here in terms of driving efficiency both on the lean six sigma side but also on the procurement side so those are the areas that i would say that we are feeling even more confident about and then what we indicated at investor day was that as we integrated sensus we would get a better feel over time as to what the investment profile would look like on a year by year basis and so that moderates now that we re getting traction and seeing the benefits of what we ve already spent on e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer and i d just add to that yes in terms of the investments if you look at the model we ve run heavier sooner because of some of these opportunities that does moderate also in the model we didn t have as much inflation built in and we really got hit hard this year and we ve ramped up price and we re going to be continuing to drive that into 2019 so there s more there than we would have than we anticipated in the model as well patrick decker president and chief executive officer yes john walsh credit suisse ag research division analyst got you and then maybe just to follow on when you think about price there is obviously what you can get because of inflation where you re kind of passing through these costs but there s been a big kind of concerted effort to increase your pricing entitlement right from what you re doing from a technology perspective value based pricing can you talk about how if you had to deconstruct price what s more kind of value added xylem price versus kind of material or inflation related patrick decker president and chief executive officer yes i would say it s obviously hard to put a specific number on that but i would say that directionally if i use the 80 20 rule here i d say it s still 80 is just brute force get out there leverage leverage the fact that we ve got to drive price to cover inflation cover the tariffs those kinds of issues while at the same time certainly in each one of our businesses at least the three segments what i ve been really encouraged by is the highly accretive margin profile of the new products that we ve been bringing to market whether they be products or different business models and that s one of our big criteria in our new product pipeline is it s got to be accretive in terms of growth rate but also margin for the company so i d say that s the kind of 20 if i pick the number to say that has been more value based pricing capability e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer and also the opportunity i think patrick decker president and chief executive officer yes john walsh credit suisse ag research division analyst great thank you patrick decker president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions the next question will come from ryan connors with boenning scattergood ryan connors boenning scattergood inc analyst great thank you i want to actually stick with that very theme you were just talking about there and talking about the flip side of price cost and get your thoughts on if we do go into an environment of where raw material costs are more moderating than ramping up how does that impact your guidance assumption around margin you talked about 100 basis points 150 basis points of margin upside is pricing to what extent can pricing be sticky and if raw materials come down is there upside to that e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so ryan i d say historically in these businesses as we ve gone back and looked at it pricing has been pretty sticky when you ve gone through an inflationary period and you ve gotten price it s unusual to then be seen as giving it away there s obviously there s probably some on the fringe on the margin but it s not a step function change so if we were to see a either moderating inflation or slowing down of cost pressures there we would expect that to be some net level of benefit hard to put a number on it at this point in time it obviously depends on how much that price cost dynamic moves but it would should be a net positive for us ryan connors boenning scattergood inc analyst got it and then my other question just wanted to probe on china a little bit and we buy the story there of the new regulations and whatnot but just wanted to kind of play devil s advocate and get your response to the fact that the strength is coming from treatment which is generally a longer cycle business what would you say to the argument that maybe it s going to stay stronger for a little longer it ll roll slower than some of the shorter cycle industrial businesses out there and so just want to get your thoughts on that dynamic patrick decker president and chief executive officer sure yes so to kind of breakdown china a bit here so again we re expecting double digit growth in 2019 which does moderate slightly from the 23 growth that we had in 18 but it s still going to be we expect strong double digit growth now as you probably recall we actually two thirds of our revenue in china is in the utility space and that s historically been pretty well protected so when you think back what two three years ago when companies were going through the shock in china and the downturn we in the aggregate were down slightly but even within that our utility business never declined it grew throughout that cycle it slowed but it grew it was the industrial and commercial piece of the business the other third that took the big hit like our other industrial peers so your thesis is absolutely correct in that one the long lead time nature of the treatment orders in pipeline is what gives us great confidence that we don t see an overall slowdown impacting us in china in 19 certainly on the utility side of the business secondly we re seeing very good growth in transport on the pumping on the wastewater pumping side which is very good margin business that is more near term short cycle business that remains strong we are not putting we re not getting here but we are building into our guide some slowdown in the industrial and commercial building piece of the market in the second half of the year which is what really kind of helps moderate our growth from 2018 i should say help but leaves to that along the way but the other the other lever we ve got there is this new aia platform i mean we ve got tremendous adoption across the chinese customer base in terms of excitement in that area again a small piece of business but very promising for 19 and beyond ryan connors boenning scattergood inc analyst okay great stuff thanks for your time patrick decker president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from joe giordano with cowen joseph giordano cowen company analyst hey guys good morning patrick decker president and chief executive officer good morning joe joseph giordano cowen company analyst hey so i don t want to keep talking about margins but i m going to so apologies here if i look at 19 right so the operating guide i think at the midpoint it s something like 60 incrementals and then to get from there to 20 is another roughly 200 bps to get to the bottom end of that where you d have infrastructure already at a pretty high level i fully appreciate the comments about mcs and the spending and things like that that will moderate and lapping some of the big comps but i guess i m getting to it seems a lot easier to get there on ebitda and if you were in a situation where you d hit ebitda guidance but ebitda 2020 guidance but a little light on the operating side internally in the way that you re running your business is that a win is that something that you re driving toward in that way where you re meeting it but optically on the operating side it s a little different patrick decker president and chief executive officer no we re going after the operating piece we lay out the ebitda just because there is noise in there and deal accounting and things of that nature but no we are measured on operating income that s the third of our annual incentive plan the other third is organic revenue growth and the other third is working capital and so that s the way we re playing it joe e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer and i would say that for 2019 we re going to continue to see good volume leverage we re going to continue to drive price acceleration and that ramped up nicely throughout the course of the year we started q1 at 20 basis points we ended q4 at 140 basis points so that s a big element we continue to drive productivity and we ve got the actions that and opportunities that patrick talked about we haven t seen the ramp yet from global business services so there s a number of levers that we have that are going to be driving our operating margin expansion which will play through to ebitda as well joseph giordano cowen company analyst fair enough when you talk about the china you guys just kind of got into it can you size the china and india business for you guys right now patrick decker president and chief executive officer sure yes so china has now become our second largest market outside of the us albeit still relatively small so our revenue in china is roughly about 300 million and that was about 170 million just a few years ago just to give you a feel so again still not large numbers in the absolute but growing very nicely india is just under 100 million of revenue with an order book that is well above that here in 2019 but india is still a relatively small piece of our overall revenue but again going to be our fastest growing market in 2019 and 2020 operator the next question is from pavel molchanov with raymond james pavel molchanov raymond james associates inc analyst hey guys thanks for taking the question on the m a front you ve obviously been quite active this past year as you re looking at valuations across the of prospective deals across the three segments two kind of interlinked questions number one are those deal multiples higher than what perhaps they have been over the past year and secondly among the three segments which in your judgment present the most attractive m a prospectivity today patrick decker president and chief executive officer sure yes so we ve not seen i guess first of all the kind of deals that we do i m very proud of our m a team and our folks in the businesses as to how they cultivate these deal opportunities and relationships which has proven over time to help keep the multiples either in a really attractive spot or in a manageable spot and so we ve not seen any big move or expansion in multiples having said that not for those reasons you also though haven t seen us do a deal in the last 12 months and so it s kind of hard to say at this point in time as to what there maybe is a gap between seller and buyer expectations but we re not seeing any big move there at this point in time in terms of the question around the three segments we like all three they each have interesting opportunities but they play different roles and so i would say that if you look at our water infrastructure space and you look at our mcs space that s largely around the utility and i think there you will continue to see us do smaller bolt on tuck ins to build out this new analytics platform as well as strengthen the digital offerings of our product lines along the way but they re not going to move the needle in terms of capital outlay based on what we have line of sight to today but then when i turn to the applied water segment and you think about our industrial water business there we see potentially attractive opportunities in that space to further move that business up the technology curve and round out our solutions offering in that set so there are opportunities across the board obviously we re prioritizing the digital and software component but that s not at the exclusion of also defending our core product offerings when the opportunity presents itself pavel molchanov raymond james associates inc analyst all right appreciate it guys patrick decker president and chief executive officer thank you operator the final question is from brian lee with goldman sachs brian lee goldman sachs analyst hey guys good morning thanks for taking the question and squeezing me in here patrick decker president and chief executive officer good morning brian brian lee goldman sachs analyst good morning maybe a couple of modeling questions here first on mcs it does look like the growth derating ph here near term in q1 and then you did mention some of the bigger deployments later this year but maybe more fully materializing in 2020 so is it fair to say 2019 is a bit of a normalization year in terms of mcs growth and you d see acceleration in 2020 or do you actually think you can do better growth second half versus first half even this year with the comps being tougher as you move into the back half e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer yes brian this is mark and patrick had mentioned it i think briefly in the opening remarks but also in response to a question i wouldn t call 5 to 6 normalization it really reflects timing of some of the large deployments we ve had and you ve seen some of the big wins the orders growth and what s happening here is really just the timing of when those projects get deployed and so we do expect a little better growth rate in the back half of 2019 and certainly into 2020 we expect to see significant acceleration of revenue growth brian lee goldman sachs analyst okay fair enough and then second question just on the free cash flow topic i know there s been a number of questions here but if you just look through the first nine months of the year for 18 you were at 60 conversion and that was already tracking well below the levels that you were at the past two years at the same points in each of those respective years so wondering why was 4q shaping up to be such a swing factor for free cash flow conversion this year and was it all timing related or was there something else at play in 2018 and then maybe just to round it out why doesn t that repeat in 19 thank you e mark rajkowski senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sure brian good question typically we generate a lot of cash in q4 it s our best quarter and so what happened this year a couple of things and one is timing around the very strong growth we saw later in the fourth quarter and that was a 90 million impact on its own in terms of cash related to sales and receivables and then as things got a little bit more pressured in terms of the component shortages the teams got aggressive and we made some strategic buys there as well as some more on the related to tariffs to lock in better pricing and those both of those factors will work through and they ll be a source of cash in 2019 and we do expect we don t expect those to be recurring and we expect a more normalized picture around our cash flow profile in 2019 patrick decker president and chief executive officer yes brian i would just maybe wrap up that question with an additional view your question around maybe tracking below the previous year through the first nine months that was really being driven by a couple of things so we were tracking very well from a working capital improvement year over year standpoint through the first nine months of the year and so as a result of that we were also confident in our ability to fund some of the capex that mark alluded to around the dewatering fleet the cap ph software in sensus smart hubs and aia and then that s what drove some of the year over year declines in the first nine months but we were expecting before we had the issues that mark laid out around the supply chain constraints and just a big pop in receivables in december because of a heavy revenue month we were expecting to be able to claw that back and be at or above 100 free cash flow conversion and that really was the surprise for us so that s on us we own it we re rectifying it and we re highly confident we re going to be at or above the 100 in 19 and well beyond there is no structural change here operator at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to patrick decker for any closing comments patrick decker president and chief executive officer again thank you everybody safe travels appreciate your continued interest and support see you out on the road and we ll talk to you again after our q1 earnings call thank you

the federal reserve on wednesday signalled its three year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the us economy due to global headwinds and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations as it held interest rates steady the us central bank also discarded its promises of further gradual increases in interest rates and said it would be patient before making any further moves fed chairman jerome powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks with neither rising inflation or financial stability considered a risk and cross currents including slowing growth overseas and the self inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the us outlook less certain we are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong us macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross currents common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity powell told reporters after the end of a two day policy meeting continued us economic growth was still the likeliest outcome powell said but was now less certain than a month ago when the fed said the economy was just as likely to grow faster than expected as it was to face a sharp downturn combined with comments that the fed s balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected the fed s meeting this week may mark a somewhat anticlimactic end to its years long battle to normalize monetary policy after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession the current fed policy rate of between 2 25 and 2 5 is well below historical averages and if it goes no higher the fed will have little room to battle any future downturn with rate cuts alone it may also raise questions about whether the fed s shifting stance until recently powell and other officials said monetary policy was unnecessarily loose is a response to pressure from volatile financial markets or president donald trump trump has repeatedly attacked the fed for raising rates arguing that it was undercutting economic growth powell took advantage of a new regimen of press conferences after every policy meeting to lay out the series of touchy changes and insist the fed was only reacting to economic data not other pressures he termed the fed s new posture one of wait and see not necessarily a hard stop on rate increases but he also made clear the central bank is no longer in any rush after raising rates almost every quarter during the past two years and that absent some threatening rebound of inflation or evidence of risky financial behaviour the pause would likely last taken together with the balance sheet announcement the fed s statement gives maximum flexibility to a central bank criticised by investors who saw the fed itself becoming a source of market turbulence that was reflexively tightening policy even as economic risks mounted this marks a full 180 from what the fed was signaling just a few months ago said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz in newport beach california after the release of the fed s statement us stocks added to gains with the s p 500 index ending the day about 1 5 higher while the dollar and short term yields fell as investors gauged an even lower probability of additional rate hikes any time soon market expectations of future rates fell further contracts tied to the fed s policy rate continued to price about a one in four chance of a hike in 2019 and contracts maturing in 2020 were signaling a small but rising chance of a rate cut then cloudier outlook the fed raised rates four times last year including in december when it signalled it would do so twice more this year the economic outlook however has become more clouded as a result of recent volatility in financial markets and signs that growth is slowing overseas including in china and the euro zone there are also ongoing concerns about the impact of global trade tensions and fears the recent 35 day partial shutdown of the us government over a budget dispute may crimp consumer spending in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient in determining future rate hikes the fed s rate setting committee said in its policy statement the fed made no change to the 50 billion maximum monthly runoff of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities from its balance sheet some traders have urged it to slow or halt its pullback from the bond markets at least for now in a separate statement the fed said it had decided to continue managing policy with a system of ample reserves reinforcing the notion that the rundown may end sooner than expected overall this signals the fed will not be on autopilot going forward said justin lederer treasury analyst at cantor fitzgerald in new york the downgrade in the fed s language around rate increases included a change in its description of economic growth from strong to solid and it noted that market based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months the fed s policy decision was unanimous
u s stocks soar after fed decision to keep interest rates the same u s stocks surged and the dollar tumbled after the federal reserve signaled a stark dovish turn in its latest policy statement the s p 500 index rallied to an eight week high the dow jones industrial average jumped 500 points and the nasdaq 100 index added more than 2 5 percent after the fed said it will be patient on future interest rate moves and signaled flexibility on the path for reducing its balance sheet major gauges were already higher on the day as technology shares rallied after apple inc s results beat estimates and boeing co helped boost industrial stocks the federal open market committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support a strong labor market and inflation near 2 percent policy makers said wednesday advertisement advertisement the dovish statement helped ease fears that policy makers would continue with plans to raise interest rates even in the face of data suggesting the economy is cooling the latest corporate earnings offered some reassurance after a series of lackluster results in january all eyes will now be on tech giants including facebook and microsoft when they report later today meanwhile chinese negotiators are meeting u s counterparts in washington for talks to resolve the ongoing trade dispute policy makers took a step in a very dovish direction said brett ryan a u s economist at deutsche bank ag they re going to be on hold for a little bit the pound gained after losses tuesday when lawmakers voted against a key proposal that sought to rule out the prospect of the u k crashing out of the european union without a deal the stoxx europe 600 index s gains were led by u k companies members of parliament including prime minister theresa may instead backed a proposal to strip out the most difficult part of her proposed divorce package and re open talks with the european union elsewhere iron ore surged after brazil s vale sa the world s largest producer outlined plans to cut output after a deadly dam breach oil rose above 54 a barrel as a government report showed a steep drop in imports from saudi arabia stocks in japan and china slid while they increased in south korea australia and hong kong advertisement advertisement among key events in the coming days chinese president xi jinping s top economic aide vice premier liu he meets with u s trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin on wednesday and thursday tech giants microsoft facebook qualcomm tesla samsung and sony announce earnings these are the main moves in markets story continues stocks the s p 500 index rose 1 7 percent as of 3 07 p m in new york the stoxx europe 600 index climbed 0 4 percent to the highest in eight weeks the u k s ftse 100 index gained 1 6 percent the msci emerging market index rose 1 percent to a four month high currencies the bloomberg dollar spot index fell 0 5 percent the euro gained 0 5 percent to 1 1487 the british pound rose 0 3 percent to 1 311 the japanese yen rose 0 4 percent to 108 94 per dollar bonds the yield on 10 year treasuries fell two basis points to 2 69 percent germany s 10 year yield fell one basis point to 0 19 percent britain s 10 year yield decreased one basis point to 1 25 percent commodities west texas intermediate crude rose 1 8 percent to 54 26 a barrel gold rose 0 8 percent to 1 322 55 an ounce

morning everyone we re pleased to announce another quarter of strong performance with the 1 61 adjusted earnings per share a 91 7 increase over the prior year quarter a great way to start 2019 following the great year in 2018 where we achieved near term highs in revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share our team delivered impressive results in the quarter that reflected solid demand and strong customer metrics feedback from our customers regarding their businesses remains upbeat in contrast to some of the stock market headlines and the predicted direction of the economy this positive customer sentiment drives our increased outlook for 2019 an outlook that is supported by our expectations for continued favorable end market demand healthy backlogs across all four segments and an engaging and improving culture across the company is motivating and energizing our team members our strong results this quarter were led by double digit revenue gains in our access equipment and fire emergency segments more broadly we delivered higher operating income and operating income margins in all four of our segments as a result of our positive start to the year and improved outlook in our access equipment segment we are raising our expectations for adjusted earnings per share for 2019 to a range of 7 to 7 50 dave will discuss our 2019 expectations in more detail in his section please turn to slide four to begin the discussion for each of our business segments i ll start it off as i typically do with the access equipment segment our access equipment team worked very hard to achieve revenue growth of more than 30 in the quarter with sales up in all regions led by higher telehandler sales in north america if you recall last year at this time we reported orders for the first quarter of more than 1 7 billion and throughout the year we reminded you that we did not expect to surpass that figure in the first quarter of 2019 however first quarter orders did exceed 1 5 billion the second highest quarter ever for bookings reflecting continued strong demand for access equipment this segment has a backlog of 1 7 billion as we move into the second quarter of 2019 more than 100 million higher than last year which we believe puts us on firm footing for the year we continue to benefit from a strong rental market for access equipment in north america and most regions around the globe as evidenced by the robust sales and orders in the quarter utilization rates rental rates and used equipment volumes all remained healthy supporting the market conditions we are seeing in north america and the forecasts that we follow have broadly positive views on construction activity in 2019 we have overcome the staffing related challenges we faced as we ramped production in 2018 and our team has made great progress as they strive to build the world s best access equipment our workforce is stabilized and the business has maintained the productivity gains we discussed on our last call we are still experiencing periodic unplanned disruptions from some of our suppliers and we ll continue to combat those challenges december brought the publication of new ansi standards for aerial work platforms in the united states the new standards will be effective for units built starting in december of 2019 many of our recently updated products are already compliant with the new ansi standards and we are confident that all of our products will be ready when the new standard is effective for those of you who recall the transition to tier 4 engine emission standards we don t expect the cost or the market reaction to the new ansi standards to be nearly as impactful as tier 4 was finally we are proud to be celebrating the fighting spirit and innovative culture that john l grove started back in 1969 when he commercialized the very first aerial work platform and really ignited the whole industry that has improved safety rates on job sites and has grown to become a multi billion dollar global industry the jlg team has continued to innovate in the 50 years since the introduction of jlg number one and you will hear and see more examples of jlg innovation as we launch exciting new products and services over the next couple of years next turn to slide five for a discussion of the defense segment defense team started the year off on the right foot when they received a 1 7 billion order for 6 100 jltvs and a large number of associated kits this order takes our jltv backlog out to production through early 2021 our jltv has been in low rate initial production or lrip phase it will stay in that mode until sometime later this spring or early summer previously we had expected the joint program office to move the jltv from lrip to full rate production in our first quarter but that has been pushed out a bit as we update the design to address the us military s request to add some content to the vehicles we expect these changes to be finalized in the coming months and do not expect them to materially impact execution of the program there could be some minor impact on timing of international orders as the full rate production decision moves out but international interest remains strong and we don t view these modifications as negative to the long term international opportunities for the program defense team continues to enhance productivity with most recent example being the opening of the fabrication facility in jefferson city tennessee this facility will eventually employ approximately 300 oshkosh team members and supply fabrications to both our defense and access equipment segments the tennessee facility opens up to a new labor market and can serve multiple segments finally we had a few questions regarding the recent federal government shutdown we have not experienced any significant issues and do not anticipate any for our defense programs let s turn to slide six to discuss the fire emergency segment fire emergency team delivered another quarter of year over year sales and margin growth as they continued their simplification efforts it has been the case for the last several years new products in the ascendant class of aerials are proving to be very popular with fire departments our view is that the domestic fire apparatus market remains healthy as municipal tax receipts have continued to grow aging fire apparatus fleets need to be addressed there continue to be headwinds from people costs consuming a larger portion of municipal budgets but the industry seems to have found its stride and grew at a solid pace in 2018 we are forecasting slightly higher market volumes in 2019 please turn to slide seven and we ll talk about our commercial segment like earlier segments commercial started the year off on a strong note and continues to put the building blocks in place for successful execution of their simplification initiatives their new business unit structure has been in place for about a year now and we re seeing benefits already but we expect even better results over time as their initiatives mature the refuse collection vehicle market continues to be attractive the market for concrete mixers is not much different from last quarter when we talked about the market that is cautious and that remains at levels below long term averages multiple third party projections for construction in 2019 support a favorable market outlook but there s no doubt that the rising interest rates are impacting the housing market another factor for this segment is chassis availability chassis lead times have extended and some of the chassis suppliers are experiencing problems delivering chassis on time we don t expect it to be a material issue for the full year but we do expect it to impact q2 we are working closely with these suppliers to minimize the impact on the business last week at the end of world of concrete tradeshow in las vegas we introduced additional functionality for mcneilus concrete mixers with our innovative flex controls these productivity enhancing controls give operators additional data and greater control so they could be more confident in the quality of the loads they re delivering leading to higher customer satisfaction as well as improved safety mcneilus is a leader in this category and we tend to strengthen that leadership position with a greater support and functionality that these new tools offer to sum it up we continue to have opportunities in this segment we have a team that has grown stronger one that is hungry to drive continued improvements that support our positive outlook for this segment for 2019 that wraps it up for our core business segments i m going to turn it over to dave to discuss our financials and outlook for 2019 in greater detail david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thanks wilson and good morning everyone please turn to slide eight we re pleased to announce a good start to 2019 consolidated net sales for the quarter were 1 8 billion up 13 7 from the prior year quarter led by a 31 6 increase in the access equipment segment the sales growth in this segment reflected the continued favorable business conditions experienced by the rental company customers and improved production rates as the access equipment team was completing the move of north american telehandler production last year higher pricing to cover material cost increases also contributed to the higher sales defense sales were down mid single digit percent versus the prior year reflecting no international m atv sales this year partially offset by higher jltv sales as that program continues to ramp up production and an approximate 15 million impact from application of the new revenue recognition standard we ve added a new slide this quarter detailing the impact of applying the new revenue standard fire emergency sales increased 29 compared to the prior year fire emergency sales increased 29 compared to the prior year this increase included an approximate 26 million positive impact from the application of the new revenue recognition standard and the benefits of some sales that slipped from the fourth quarter of 2018 into 2019 as noted on our last earnings call and commercial segment sales were 8 lower than the prior year due to a significantly lower mix of package units where we sell both the third party chassis and our body in contrast to the lower sales dollars unit volume was actually up versus the prior year consolidated operating income for the first quarter was 160 5 million or 8 9 of sales compared to adjusted operating income of 93 1 million or 5 9 of sales in the prior year operating income margins increased 200 basis points or more in all four segments although defense s margin increase was due to applying the new revenue recognition standard access equipment segment operating income more than doubled compared to the prior year quarter reflecting the significantly higher sales levels price cost was also slightly favorable as a non steel material inflation was less than expected in the quarter partially offsetting these positive items were a less favorable product mix and the prior year benefit of a bad debt reserve reversal defense segment operating income grew by nearly 6 million compared to the prior year to 15 3 of sales on a 6 sales decline results for this segment included an approximate 19 million favorable impact related to the application of the new revenue recognition standard we now expect the full year operating income impact of applying the new standard to be immaterial to defense segment earnings implying that we expect a negative operating income impact from the new standard over the remaining three quarters of the year fire emergency operating income and margin were up 14 6 million and 250 basis points respectively compared to the prior year higher sales volume was the main driver of the higher earnings and application of the new revenue recognition standard favorably impacted fire emergency operating income this quarter by 5 8 million commercial segment operating income increased 7 9 million compared to the prior year adjusted amount and this segment s operating income margin grew 390 basis points to 8 4 favorable mix along with lower operating and warranty expenses contributed to the higher operating income margin corporate expenses were 3 million lower than the prior year quarter due to lower share based compensation costs and a decrease in post retirement liabilities adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was 1 61 compared to adjusted earnings per share of 0 84 in the prior year higher operating income was the largest contributor to the significantly higher results the first quarter also benefited by 0 08 per share as a result of share repurchases completed in the last 12 months we repurchased almost 2 6 million shares for 170 million in the quarter or nearly half of our 350 million full year share repurchase target please turn to slide 10 for a review of our updated expectations for 2019 we re pleased to be increasing our expectations for 2019 as a result of our positive start to the year and improved access equipment segment outlook expectations for the other segments remain unchanged from our last earnings call a reminder that our original expectations for the year as well as these updated expectations reflect the adoption and application of the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of this fiscal year last quarter we talked about a wider than normal estimate range for the access equipment segment as we exited the quarter we both narrowed and raised this segment s sales and operating income margin estimate ranges the new sales estimate range is 3 8 billion to 4 billion an increase of 200 million on the low end of the range and 100 million on the high end the new range reflects the strong order volume experienced in the quarter and the positive outlook jlg has continued to hear from its rental company customers the new operating income margin estimate range for the segment is 10 75 to 11 25 this represents an increase of 75 basis points from the previous low end of the range and 25 basis points from the high end as a result of these changes we are increasing our consolidated expectations as followed follows the new sales estimate range is 8 05 billion to 8 25 billion the new operating income estimate range is 685 million to 735 million an increase of 45 million on the low end and 25 million on the high end and the new adjusted earnings per share estimate range is 7 to 7 50 per share an increase of 0 50 per share on the low end and 0 25 on the high end our other expectations including corporate expenses adjusted tax rate capital expenditures free cash flow and share count remain unchanged a few comments on the second quarter outlook we expect modestly higher sales and flat to slightly higher earnings compared to the prior year quarter there were several positive drivers to last year s second quarter earnings that we don t expect to repeat this year we also expect the chassis availability issue that wilson mentioned to impact commercial segment second quarter results compared to the prior year overall there will likely be some lumpiness in our quarters this year however we are raising our full year expectations for adjusted earnings per share to be 10 to 18 higher than 2018 s adjusted results wilson i m going to turn it back over to you for some closing remarks wilson r jones president and chief executive officer thanks dave we just announced a very strong start to 2019 we re going to continue working hard and smart to drive strong full year results for 2019 and value for our shareholders i m proud of our team and i m confident that we will continue to execute on our strategic priorities to drive value for all stakeholders i ll turn it back over to pat to get the q a started patrick davidson senior vice president investor relations thanks wilson i d like to remind everyone please limit your questions to one plus a follow up after the follow up we ask that you get back in queue if you d like to ask additional questions operator let s please begin the question and answer period of this call questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session we ask that all callers limit themselves to one question and one follow up if you have additional questions you may requeue and those questions will be addressed time permitting operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of seth weber with rbc please proceed with your question seth weber rbc capital markets analyst hey guys good morning wilson r jones president and chief executive officer hey seth seth weber rbc capital markets analyst question on access margin you know coming off the strong first quarter it looks like you re sort of suggesting that margins are going to be flat or flat to down or you know kind of flattish year over year for the balance of the year to hit your the high end of your full year target so i m wondering why margins wouldn t be better if you re kind of getting better price cost and moving away from some of the manufacturing challenges that you have last year first question thanks david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer seth couple of things there one if you recall last year in the second quarter specifically we did have several favorable adjustments one was a customer that was on a deferral of profits and we they paid us off fully so we recognized that kind of a onetime item we also had a bad debt reversal in the second quarter last year so combined those are probably 10 million to 12 million worth of drag year over year the other thing that as we look at the outlook for the remainder of the year from a mix standpoint we now believe we are going to see a little heavier mix of telehandlers for the remainder of the year and that as you know is a little different margin profile down in the aerial work platform component seth weber rbc capital markets analyst okay but i mean i would think that the price cost is getting better here i mean can you just talk about where you are on price cost are you with the increases in the surcharges do you feel like you re covering your higher material cost your higher cost inflation at this point materials freight things like that david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer sure so first quarter we ended up a little better than we thought on steel specifically we ended up right about where we thought we would it was some of the non steel items where we ended up a little better and we think some of that is actually timing and we ll see that start to come through in the second quarter but overall we still believe q2 through q4 we re going to be largely at a cost neutral net cost neutral between price and cost we ve seen sheet steel come down or hot rolled coil come down like everyone but a couple items related to that one there is a lag effect so it s probably a five month to six month lag before we start to see that flow through our income statement just to the related to the way we buy and then secondly when we look at between sheet steel and plate we actually use more plate than we do sheet and plate steel has remained stubbornly high that s as we looked at it recently it s about 55 higher than it was as we entered into the beginning of fiscal 18 so if we do see some benefit and if sheet continues to stay at the levels it s at we might see some benefit later in the year but overall our view is still i would say neutral from a cost price standpoint in this segment seth weber rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks and then if i could just follow up with access revenue question you re exiting the first quarter with backlog of i think about 8 year to year you re only forecasting i think about 1 growth for the balance of the year for access to get to the high end of your range so i m just trying to tie those two numbers together thanks david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer yes seth i ll jump in on that when we started the year when we shared that our concern about the year being flattish possibly up a little bit and the main reason we were cautious going into the year as you will know is the price cost issue and we were coming out with the most significant price increases we ve ever introduced into the access markets and we knew those were going to be tough negotiations but i want really let that market know how pleased we are with our teams and the good work that they ve done working closely with our rental customers and helping them understand our total cost of ownership model and then the importance of supporting that that these costs are real so starting going back to the previous call to where we are today we re very pleased to advance where we are obviously the 1 5 million order quarter that was one that we weren t expecting it to be that successful but the team has done a really nice job but where we are today as you know the seasonal slowdown utilization will go down through the winter months just looked at our thermometer here in oshkosh it s minus 27 here today so i m guessing there s not going to be a lot of awps rented in this area today but what we re looking forward to is the upcoming ara show as we start to see our customers prepare now for the spring construction season that s where we ll as you know possibly will be able to adjust our forecast going forward but what you re seeing today is what we know from our customers and what their expectation is for the back half obviously we re going to always work to improve that as we have in the previous years seth weber rbc capital markets analyst okay no i appreciate that well it just seems likely given the backlog and kind of the guide it seems like there could be some conservativism in just the revenue outlook for access is all david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer and we still have some negotiations going on there s other customers that haven t come into the market yet that are planning for the back half of the year and as we progress with those then the opportunity might be there again hope is not a strategy but we hope you re right seth that there s some conservatism there wilson r jones president and chief executive officer thanks a lot seth seth weber rbc capital markets analyst thanks guys stay warm david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of charlie brady with suntrust please proceed with your question charlie brady suntrust analyst hey yes thanks good morning guys hey just on the commentary on defense about the kind of the push out to full rate production is there any margin impact to get positive margin impact from the design changes you re having to incorporate for the dod wilson r jones president and chief executive officer no charlie there s no margin impact david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer so charlie what we ll do is we ll work with the dod to finalize what that content they want added that will be a contract mod we ll retrofit vehicles if it don t have that on currently but we ll get paid for all that we ll negotiate with the government what the pricing is for that content to add charlie brady suntrust analyst okay but i guess what i m saying is i mean were these changes anticipated or is this something new that s just coming from the dod that wasn t the original kind of planning when you re talking about what s your margin expectation is for jltv wilson r jones president and chief executive officer charlie i would say this is a success you have with a low rate initial production where the customers is testing the vehicles and really kind of really dialing in the design tweaking it to perform best for our soldiers and marines and so this is normal in a program to make these types of adjustments and to dave s point it s good we add content and then we have retrofit opportunities also charlie brady suntrust analyst okay thanks and just a little bit follow up here on the can you maybe quantify a little bit more with the chassis impact could be on commercial and do you think that that pushes out beyond the second quarter impact thanks david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer based on what we know now charlie it s largely concentrated with one chassis oem and specifically on the refuse product line and based on what the team is telling us in the quarter it s probably a low to mid single digit 1 million impact on the quarter we do expect to make up some of that in the later part of the year but there will be a little bit of disruption but we do not expect it to significantly impact full year results charlie brady suntrust analyst great thank you david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thanks charlie operator our next question comes from line of tim thein from citi please proceed with your question timothy thein citi research analyst thank you good morning and wilson i bet the packer fan sitting at the table with you weren t complaining about the cold weather this morning it s just wilson r jones president and chief executive officer somebody has got to do it tim timothy thein citi research analyst yes here you go hey on the just back dave your comments on the implied incrementals for access i think the some of the ramp up costs the last year were estimated to be like 25 million and back to your you mentioned earlier that the staffing related challenges you think are largely behind you so is that maybe didn t go to zero but should we assume that that headwind largely reverses in 19 david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer so we did call out some of those last year tim and actually we moved some of those to non gaap because it was related to the overall restructuring program but in general we do not expect those to we expect those largely to be behind us we have continued to see as we mentioned in the prepared remarks a continuation of some supplier disruptions although the magnitude and frequency of those has declined but we do think we re going to see continue to see a little bit of that as we go through the remainder of the year as well timothy thein citi research analyst okay and then on the free cash flow guidance unchanged despite the call it 35 million increase to operating profits what s is it just a rounding or is there something offsetting that working capital et cetera or just what s weighing against that wilson r jones president and chief executive officer more so just assumptions around the working capital timing as we exit the year timothy thein citi research analyst okay understood thanks a lot david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thanks tim operator our next question comes from line of ann duignan with jp morgan please proceed with your question ann duignan j p morgan analyst hi good morning first question on defense i mean the way that defense contractors really make their money is when the government requests engineering changes so why wouldn t you anticipate that the margin guidance is probably at the low end of where it could come out given that the engineering changes would be on future content but also retrofit wilson r jones president and chief executive officer ann we re going to have to see how this all plays out in terms of the magnitude of the content at this time while there are content changes we don t expect it to be a significant quantity of changes so when you scatter that or blend that in across the whole whole 6 billion almost 7 billion program we ll certainly look at it but as we sit here today we don t think it s probably going to be enough to significantly move the margin on the program david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer and i think just to add to that ann we re still working through our government customers is looking at the alternatives on some of these changes and they re just not finalized yet at this point ann duignan j p morgan analyst okay and i appreciate that then on access was there any pull forward of deliveries on the telehandler side ahead of the price increases and then could you talk about how quickly you ll have to give up surcharges if the steel prices do come down particularly to your large customers because your competitor increased less price as opposed to you did less smaller list price plus surcharge so just wanted to get a sense of how quickly you might have to give up those surcharges should steel prices remain as it is or come back down wilson r jones president and chief executive officer well i ll just pull forward ann we don t believe there was a pull forward if you remember back in our q1 last year we were consolidating telehandler lines and so we weren t in the market as well as we needed to be a little the uptick in our quarter we believe was more related to having capacity having availability of products so price increase was it doesn t appear there was a pull forward there on the surcharges i ll let dave talk again about the lag effect we have on steel pricing and some of the other issues around materials david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer yes ann as i mentioned earlier so and wilson just alluded to it now with the lag effect it s probably five to six months before we see changes in steel price start to flow through the p l and as we also mentioned plate remains stubbornly high and while sheet is down it s still i believe about 15 above where it was when we began our fiscal 18 so it s still elevated although not as elevated as much as it was and if we do see some benefit we were probably talking fourth quarter of this year and that s assuming that it continues to hold and only time will tell on that but obviously the access team will continue to watch where our costs are and we ll continue to monitor that ann duignan j p morgan analyst yeah my question was more around how quickly will you have to give up those surcharges to back to your customers david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer it really depends ann on where our price where the costs end up we don t know yet and i m not sure that anybody knows if is sheet steel going to stay where if is it going to bounce back up again it s something that the team monitors on a regular basis and they re in contact in discussions with their customers on a regular basis wilson r jones president and chief executive officer yes i would just add in there to dave that when when you dial back ann and again our jlg team has done a nice job of explaining this and helping our customers understand if you go back to 2015 2016 where we had oil and gas we had the tier changes there has been some definite pricing erosion that we re still not caught up to that and so from a price increase standpoint i believe our customers understand the pricing needs to remain in place the debate will be as steel does move it moves down far enough we ll have those discussions but at this point it s still not down low enough to even consider from our standpoint ann duignan j p morgan analyst okay i appreciate the color i ll get back in queue thank you operator our next question comes from line of steve volkmann with jefferies please proceed with your question steve volkmann jefferies analyst great hi good morning guys i just need to make sure i understood this right i think you just answered this but all the orders that you took in this quarter had the higher price increase associated with them correct david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer that is correct steve volkmann jefferies analyst okay great and then i know you said wilson that it wasn t going to be nearly as big a deal but what s your sense on what the price increase with the new anti regulation will be just in rough terms wilson r jones president and chief executive officer well what we ve said steve is significantly lower than the tier change the tier change was around 5 000 for emissions and we again we said significantly lower because it varies by if you think of a scissor obviously it s going to be a higher increase on the scissors than versus an aerial work platform just because of continent but it s it s really around safety and load sensing systems there s some runflat tire that will go in without tipping some stability testing that s added in so it s again we haven t put a price on it because a lot of those models we said it s been introduced and that pricing has been discussed with the customers on the ones that we have finished but the ones that are still in queue those costs are still rolling up and those discussions will go on with our customers as we complete the ansi updates steve volkmann jefferies analyst okay great that s good color i appreciate it and then just finally quickly on fire emergency as we look forward is there going to be any impact that we should be thinking about from this accounting change on the third or second third and fourth quarters david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer yeah there s a little bit steve if you look at the schedule that we added to the slide deck we show the q1 impact and then the full year impact so it s probably a couple of million dollars yes we think most of that will probably flow through here in the second quarter and then after that 606 we don t expect much of an impact at all in the fire emergency segment going forward steve volkmann jefferies analyst all right thank you guys wilson r jones president and chief executive officer thanks steve operator our next question comes from the line of david raso with evercore please proceed with your question david raso evercore isi analyst all right thank you first just a quick modeling question the defense business the 18 million give back from the accounting change for the rest of the year to get to your full year impact total maybe i missed that i apologize what s the cadence of that of that 18 million give back over the next couple of quarters david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer it s going to be more heavily weighted david to the fourth quarter i think you ll see some in a little bit in the third quarter but mostly in the fourth quarter david raso evercore isi analyst all right that s helpful on access the sales guide increased to 150 million midpoint to midpoint was that largely all telehandlers or was there other used equipment sales aerials david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer it was more weighted to help to telehandlers david but it was not exclusively telehandlers david raso evercore isi analyst so was it also new sales of aerials or was it more david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer it was everything it was everything it was not one specific item patrick davidson senior vice president investor relations david remind ph the press release we ve got that break out right telehandlers and and aerials so at least that should give you some some indication david raso evercore isi analyst but on the guide you don t give the patrick davidson senior vice president investor relations correct thank you david raso evercore isi analyst the guidance increase because to that point pat i will say if you told me telehandlers we re going to be up 100 in the quarter and aerials only up 4 i would have guessed the lower margin so it s kind of impressive the margin being that high with what is least historically a pretty negative mix i know you re not going to divulge this exactly but can you give us some sense the run rate right now between the margin differential between tele s and aerials and again i thought the margins were a little higher than we would have thought with a negative mix like that david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer it is enough for us to tell you david that there is a difference there and that s as far as we re going to go david raso evercore isi analyst i appreciate that okay thank you very much wilson r jones president and chief executive officer thanks david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thanks david operator our next question comes from the line of jamie cook with credit suisse please proceed with your question jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning nice quarter sorry back to access again the strong orders that you saw in the quarter can you just talk about what you saw geographically in the u s and then sort of u s versus europe as well as sort of the customers sort of the larger rental customers versus smaller ones and then if you could talk about sort of lead times on tele s booms that would be helpful thank you david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer yes i would say it was a kind of a broad mix of customers jamie and geographically too we were up in all regions around the globe north america and pac rim we were up the most but europe was up up a little bit in latin america and up some in australia which was nice to see the mix of customers i would say obviously the nrcs were heavier on the order side that s just normal when we do our annual purchase agreements but we had good activity with the ircs also so dialing back to where we were when we started this quarter to where we are today we re just pleased with the progress we ve made the pricing discipline that our team has been working with and the good discussions that we ve had with our rental customers i think it s been a very productive quarter for discussions with customers and not just north america but around the globe and it shows in our orders so we re pleased with that second question jamie cook credit suisse analyst so sorry so one i was just wondering about lead times across the different product lines how extended they are and then my other question is based on the conversations that you re having with customers is there any reason to believe that how do we think about the cadence of orders for the remainder of the year is there any reason why normal seasonality wouldn t pull through or customers starting to get worried that orders in the fourth quarter which generally or seasonally weaker could be stronger because of concerns about lead times et cetera thanks wilson r jones president and chief executive officer so lead times as you d expect with the large telehandler order that we ve been receiving is they re out about five to six months on some models the rest of our booms our scissors they re all within about a 30 day to 45 day window which is very accepted in the marketplace today so other than telehandlers we re in a good spot from basically a delivery standpoint as far as the back half of the year and what customers are saying we re not hearing anything at this time that s troubling but we re certainly looking forward to the ara show next month and obviously as our customers navigate through the winter what that s going to mean coming out for spring construction so it s just early for us to call what q3 or q4 are going to be where we sit today but we ll know in the next call and be able to model that better for you jamie cook credit suisse analyst okay i appreciate the color thank you operator our next question comes from the line of chad dillard with deutsche bank please proceed with your question chad dillard deutsche bank analyst hi good morning guys david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer good morning chad dillard deutsche bank analyst so just a question for you on the guidance so ex rev rec you raised the full year by about 0 10 or about 2 but beat by 0 30 could you just kind of explain this differential is it conservatism conservatism are you seeing maybe some weakness in the second half any color on that would be super helpful wilson r jones president and chief executive officer well i guess maybe the best place to start chad is we didn t provide the quantitative guide for our q1 so the beat is i think versus collective street s view you know we looked at where we were coming in for access how the orders came in as wilson said we re pleased with how those orders came in we looked at the mix we looked at what else is going on in the business and that just it was kind of a bottoms up approach to how we looked at adjusting the margin we tightened it the range for access and raised it and it was just i would say a natural evolution of how we saw the quarter play out as well as the orders in the quarter for delivery in the remainder of the year here chad dillard deutsche bank analyst that s helpful and then your access guidance on the top line implies about 3 growth versus the prior guidance of flat can you just walk us through how much of this increase are you seeing from better price realization versus incremental volume growth wilson r jones president and chief executive officer well i think you re aware of the surcharges and price increase that we came out with and when we look at the top line overall what that would imply is pricing is certainly a major component to that volume overall underlying volume is i would say on the high end up a little but certainly pricing does play a component to that chad dillard deutsche bank analyst great thank you very much wilson r jones president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from line of mircea dobre with baird please proceed with your question mircea dobre robert w baird analyst yes good morning guys wilson sorry to beat this dead horse i just want to make sure that i m clear on this in terms of how your pricing works in fiscal 19 are the orders that that customers are placing in say january of 19 priced differently than the orders that were placed in november or december of 2018 or is pricing consistent from your q1 fiscal 19 to your q2 fiscal 19 and the rest of the year david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer mig it s dave i ll take that pricing is all based around timing of delivery so anything after march of last year would have had the surcharge associated and we re talking access segment specifically here and then as it relates wilson r jones president and chief executive officer any order that wasn t backlog david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer any order yes and then as it relates to the permanent price increase that was effective for deliveries on january 1 that was announced in i think september timeframe so any orders for delivery starting january 1 whether it was placed in october november december or january would all be at the same pricing mircea dobre robert w baird analyst got it that s really helpful thank you then i also want to ask a question about this other component of your access equipment segment growth there is has been quite good especially in the quarter can you maybe talk a little bit about all the elements that you have in there i know there s jerr dan you ve got some aftermarket you ve got some other things that you re selling what s going on with this portion of the business and kind of what s embedded in the full year outlook david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer jerr dan is probably the area mig where we saw the biggest growth that s really been a success story for us we don t highlight that a lot but the team has done a very good job there and i wouldn t say necessarily that the weather we re experiencing was a big driver of that but weather conditions like this certainly are conducive to continued strong demand for towing and recovery equipment but that s probably the biggest mover year over year patrick davidson senior vice president investor relations used equipment is in there as well mig right so again aftermarket jerr dan as dave said and used equipment and i think you ve heard from several of our customers used equipment market is strong mircea dobre robert w baird analyst right and if you can humor with one more on jerr dan can you maybe size this business for us and i m wondering how does this business compare rather in terms of cycle with what we would normally see in say class a truck orders david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer it s less than 10 of the segment revenue and as it relates to the cycle we don t see a strong correlation between demand for towing equipment and the what we see for the overall class a market you know if you look at vehicles on the highway today there certainly are more passenger vehicles than there are class a and that s probably as bigger bigger of a driver of demand for towing and recovery equipment mircea dobre robert w baird analyst understood thank you guys appreciate it david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thanks mig patrick davidson senior vice president investor relations thanks operator our next question comes from the line of jerry revich with goldman sachs please proceed with your question jerry revich goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning everyone nice quarter i m wondering if you could talk about your telehandler business so last year you folks had record sales and it sounds like with production constraints how much market share do you think your business for telehandlers has gained cycle over cycle and then i think normal seasonality is for telehandler sales could be up you know 35 or so fiscal 2q versus fiscal 1q and i m wondering is that how we should be thinking about the cadence for this year as well david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer jerry just in terms of if you dial back to last year you ll recall we were going through the process of moving production of telehandlers in north america and that did impact the output or production levels in that product line we probably lost some share there last year i think what you re seeing this year is a very nice rebound in terms of the teams getting back up to speed in terms of their cadence from a production standpoint and i haven t seen the market share information but i would assume that we ve had some recovery probably back to more normalized levels from a market share standpoint as it relates to the cadence sequentially we don t break it out by quantitatively in terms of what we re expecting for any of the segments or the product lines but generally as you know the second quarter is typically a stronger quarter sequentially than the first quarters and i don t expect that to be any different this year jerry revich goldman sachs analyst and dave just in terms of the really strong growth year over year we saw this quarter was would you characterize that any of that as factory catch up or were you folks effectively shipping to demand and obviously we ll see how 2q and 3q shape up but i m just trying to understand were there any one offs in terms of just catching up following the production move that really benefited the quarter david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer no that we were impacted that that was really a year ago and the cadence improved as we went throughout the year so our customers wouldn t wait nine to 12 months for us to catch up and get them their unit so really we were shipping to demand in the first quarter jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay thank you and on fire emergency you know you folks are performing really well in a tough environment can you just talk about if you have prospects for share gains over the balance of the year how has the coding process been you mentioned you expected the market to be flattish up a little bit are you folks optimistic on the share side for you wilson r jones president and chief executive officer yeah jerry i think the fire emergency store is a good store and we appreciate your compliment there the team is focused and working very close with their dealer channel we have the best distribution channel in the fire emergency by far and they work very close together they partner with the pricing discipline in the marketplace so i d say that to say that there are some low price type competitors in the market and we re going to make sure that when we do grow share we grow it profitably and then we certainly have good plans around the ascendant aerial that we ve delivered and the prospects there continue to grow and that s what we re going to focus on is the total cost of ownership model and really driving profitable market share so we see opportunities there again a lot of it s through some of the intellectual property that we have patent protected products that we write the spec and that s what the customer wants and they pay for that value of that patented product jerry revich goldman sachs analyst appreciate it thank you david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thanks jerry operator our next question comes from line of ross gilardi with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question ross gilardi bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good morning thanks for letting me in wilson r jones president and chief executive officer hey ross ross gilardi bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi i just dave i had a question on the cash flow the first quarter looked weak i mean is that and so therefore the full year seems fairly back end loaded is that tied to awp inventory build or something in the defense segment david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer the biggest thing versus it was a little more than we expected and the biggest driver of that was we actually saw a slowdown in the patent payment cadence from our u s government customer in defense and that was a little unexpected for us and actually i saw one of the larger defense primes yesterday call that out as well so it seems to be something that s multiple companies are experiencing but that was the biggest driver hopefully that gets rectified as we head through the second and third quarters here ross gilardi bank of america merrill lynch analyst do you have any color on it like why that is the case or what s actually going on there wilson r jones president and chief executive officer what we understand is they re referring to increased volume of invoices to process and i don t have any more color than that david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer again they re essential so they were working during the shut they weren t wilson r jones president and chief executive officer yes david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer this wasn t a shutdown issue ross they were working during the shutdown so it s their essential it doesn t so it s not related to the government shutdown ross gilardi bank of america merrill lynch analyst and just when you guys think about your your cash flow more in the out years i mean obviously you re expecting a very strong free cash flow year this year is there any reason to think that your cash conversion would change materially from where it is in fiscal 19 out in 20 and 21 i m not asking for guidance but just more like directional views on cash conversion david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so ross our what i would call our going in view is it over the course of a cycle we believe we should our cash conversion should be call it 100 but we do and historically have seen and likely would continue to see in the future some lumpiness from the year to year and that s largely driven by when we get involved in some of these larger international programs that tends to drive some swings in working capital that would be not typical for us ross gilardi bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay got you and this is the last thing i want to ask you more of a kind of a housekeeping thing but the top of your operating profit guide it seems to imply a higher than 7 50 of eps by about 0 10 to 0 15 i mean is there a big other expense line item baked into your numbers and if so what s that for or is interest rate interest expense for some reason go up over the balance of the year or income from affiliates david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer we don t we don t think so when we ran the numbers or put the model together internally we come up to the 7 50 so maybe pat can wilson r jones president and chief executive officer take that offline david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer take that offline with you and figure out what might be driving that difference ross gilardi bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great i ll follow up there thank you david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thank you wilson r jones president and chief executive officer thanks ross operator our next question comes from the line of stanley elliott with stifel please proceed with your question stanley elliott stifel analyst good morning guys thank you fitting me in a quick question on the defense business of the 6 100 units are you seeing anything in terms of expansion of the product scope or the mission scope like we ve talked about for additional units in the past or is this more what you re referring to in terms of kits were just more of minor modifications wilson r jones president and chief executive officer stanley when you say kits are you talking about the content changes that we that we referenced stanley elliott stifel analyst yes well i thought you said something in terms of some adjustments on the kits and probably i guess my guess is that probably one that the content modifications before you get to the full rate production wilson r jones president and chief executive officer in the prepared remarks we talked about the 6 100 units with associated kits david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer yes oh yes wilson r jones president and chief executive officer but so no really change stanley to what we ve been doing with our government customer that s been the normal cadence they have associated kits that come in with the orders where the changes will come in as if they make some adjustments here to the current specification the content will change the additional content and then we talked about retrofitting the units that have been delivered with that new content stanley elliott stifel analyst perfect and then switching gears you had mentioned a cautious approach on some of the concrete placement vehicles do you think the numbers you re seeing on kind of a year over year basis is that more seasonal what we d expect and we d expect that that business to pick back up or is that reflective of the cautiousness just trying to get a little more color there if i could david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer actually unit volume was up a little bit in the quarter stanley the sales dollars were down because of lower package units and just a reminder on that packages when we sell a third party chassis along with our body so we saw a mix in the quarter of more just body only sales wilson r jones president and chief executive officer customer supply chassis david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer customer supply chassis and that is negative from a top line sales standpoint but actually from our margin standpoint is a positive thing but overall as we said we continue to see in general a cautious concrete mixer market and i don t think we saw anything really in the quarter from a cadence standpoint that would lead us to conclude anything differently stanley elliott stifel analyst perfect thank you very much for the time and stay warm david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thanks stanley operator thank you our final question comes from the line of courtney yakavonis with morgan stanley please proceed with your question dillon cumming morgan stanley analyst hey guys good morning this is dillon cumming on for courtney maybe just flipping back to your order book and access real quick i understand your oil and gas exposure is a bit more limited but still indexed on the telehandler side and you guys see more positive on that piece of the segment so anything kind of notable that you guys would call out in terms of what you re seeing on the ground to suggest that maybe those markets are actually holding in a bit better despite all the oil price volatility wilson r jones president and chief executive officer yeah rig count is up i think it s up to approximately 1 100 now if you dial back to may we were down around 400 so as far as oil and gas it s positive we have said in the past that oil and gas is important but it s not a significant driver of our products on a normal rig you might see one telehandler on one aerial work platform so it s not a big driver but we do watch it because it s a metric that does play into our rental customers outlook dillon cumming morgan stanley analyst okay got it that s helpful and then maybe just sticking in the margin side there anything you might kind of labor and manufacturing capacity plans in that segment you know if we kind of end up seeing access sales at the high end or maybe even above your guidance range how much slack are you kind of seeing in the supply chain and how much flexibility do you think you have in terms of both manufacturing capacity and maybe putting out some extra shifts if you have to wilson r jones president and chief executive officer well we have capacity most plants are running two shifts some three but we have capacity to run up what helped increase our capacity this year dillon and then within the last year was getting our 600 team members up to speed that we brought on in the ramp up early last year so that s obviously increased capacity for us too another add was opening up a facility in jefferson city tennessee recently that s going to add fab and well capacity it s a labor market that s a good labor market with skilled labor and that s going to support both access and defense so capacity is not an issue for us the supplier question that you asked there that there s always a concern when we re ramping up a supplier and our supplier quality teams are dispersed and working closely with suppliers to help them with the ramp the key there just like for us for them too access to skilled labor and the labor market is very tight around the country another reason we ve spread out a little bit in tennessee there is labor available there and i would anticipate some of our bigger suppliers will be doing some of the same things and actually some of them already have so we re key is as you do ramp up obviously is to make sure your suppliers can ramp up with you and we ve certainly got a strategy around that dillon cumming morgan stanley analyst great appreciate the time guys david m sagehorn executive vice president chief financial officer thank you wilson r jones president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you we ve reached the end of the question and answer session i would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments wilson r jones president and chief executive officer thank you operator thanks all to for joining us today we appreciate your interest in

the issue 2019 will be another pivotal year across the map in the western hemisphere the region continues to battle several ongoing challenges the venezuelan crisis the u s mexico bilateral relationship under new mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador the rapid deterioration of nicaragua the fight for transparency in the northern triangle and an uncertain economic horizon seven countries will hold national elections argentina bolivia canada el salvador guatemala panama and uruguay each of which has the potential to affect domestic politics as well as geopolitical relations within the region introduction exactly 60 years ago on new year s eve fidel castro marched into havana and brought the cold war into the western hemisphere altering the geopolitical relationships of the region in fundamental ways that continue to reverberate today while the region continues to face ongoing threats to traditional democratic values and u s national interests they also face acute threats to the lives and prosperity of the region s citizens mass forced migration populism on the rise xenophobia rampant corruption and violence among other factors these are some of the concerns on the minds of citizens as they make their voices heard citizens of seven western hemisphere countries will do this by heading to the ballot box for national elections in 2019 in what will be a round of crucial elections across the map while citizens of other countries continue to protest in the street or decide to flee their country altogether ongoing regional and domestic crises coming into 2019 the year ahead is an uncertain time for the western hemisphere as a number of ongoing regional and domestic crises could very well either remain in status quo or reach an inflection point for better or worse one of these uncertainties is the ongoing political humanitarian and security crisis in venezuela the humanitarian disaster is clear and immediate with 3 million already having fled the economic debacle and the political challenge to hemispheric norms is increasing with the u s and a majority of the organization of american states oas declaring nicolas maduro to be entirely illegitimate as of january 10 the fate of national assembly president juan guaido s efforts to establish his own legitimacy as interim president of venezuela remains unclear but it will surely result in political confrontation at a minimum a second uncertainty is what the domestic and international policies of the new mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo will look like while amlo s policy strategies remain vague some of his initial decisions and actions have been promising by offering temporary sanctuary to central american and other migrants seeking asylum in the united states while their cases are under review amlo has diminished fears of a hostile bilateral relationship with the united states he also clearly understands the strategic response to illegal migration must be the development of the northern triangle countries ntc of el salvador guatemala and honduras which will reduce the push factors that propel migrants north furthermore his acceptance of the nafta modifications in the usmca also register as mature and a key to relations with the trump administration however mexico under amlo has shown reluctance to support lima group sanctions and statements condemning venezuela s nicolas maduro which puts into question his overall approach to international and regional policy a third uncertainty is the day by day deterioration of a functioning state in nicaragua as the ortega dictatorship digs in its heels in the second poorest nation in the region a fourth uncertainty is whether the northern triangle will be able to achieve anything like steady progress toward the rule of law and accountability in government and citizen security this poses a direct risk to the united states from president clinton to president trump u s administrations have offered rhetorical but practically inconsistent support for expanding economic opportunities and strengthening institutions in central america this includes not only helping those countries on smart security investments like plan el salvador seguro the international commission against impunity in guatemala cicig and the mission to support the fight against corruption and impunity in honduras maccih in honduras but also pressuring politicians not to undermine those anti corruption efforts or move backward by politicizing police and security forces a fifth uncertainty is the economic horizon the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean cepal released their annual look at the new year which anticipates that global uncertainty that will feed regional uncertainty it predicts 1 7 percent growth overall in the region with sharp differences between venezuela s economy that is expected to plunge another 10 percent argentina dropping 1 8 percent and panama growing close to 6 percent canada is expected to have similar growth with an estimated 1 8 percent growth the united states trade confrontation with china poses risks to global prospects and any chinese economic downturn will echo with force in the western hemisphere upcoming elections to watch the politics of the region and the lives of many citizens in the western hemisphere region will be further affected by the uncertainties that lie in the number of national elections slated to take place in 2019 below is a breakdown of some of the most important elections coming up this year and how they could affect the country and the region argentina argentina will hold presidential elections in october of this year although current president mauricio macri has yet to announce his re election bid formally he is the presumed candidate for the center right cambiemos coalition while macri s valiant efforts to open argentine markets globally and cut spending to reduce a stubbornly high federal government deficit have made him well respected on the global stage the resulting austerity measures and steep increase in the cost of utilities have seriously undermined his domestic support argentina came uncomfortably close to another financial default in 2018 with a run on the argentine peso feeding a currency depreciation of almost 100 percent and inflation that reached an estimated 48 percent by the end of the year the country was saved largely by a record loan from the international monetary fund and goodwill among g7 nations macri hit an all time low public approval rating in november of last year at 37 percent all this sets him up for a tough reelection campaign the opposition to macri a collection of peronist groupings remains divided between moderate and more leftist factions many leftists appear open to a new presidential bid from former president cristina fernández de kirchner 2007 2015 while moderates completely oppose the idea fernández is in the middle of several legal cases involving charges of corruption and illicit association as well as an alleged cover up of the 1994 bombing of the amia jewish community center in buenos aires however the ex president is polling at 26 percent behind only macri at 30 percent as of early january there are many peronist moderates who would like to earn the collective support of the peronist coalition although none have been successful in standing out from the others the only moderate candidate polling over 10 percent is sergio mazza but he is divisive and is rejected by most other peronists if as expected growth returns to argentina in the second half of the year based in part on an expected good harvest in 2019 and the competitive value of the peso macri is expected to pull through with a slim victory but uncertainty is still very much the watchword bolivia the october 2019 presidential elections in bolivia will prove to be a crucial inflection point for the state of the country s democracy the biggest question for bolivia is whether morales will allow the country to have truly free and fair elections this year current president evo morales was allowed to submit his re election bid for a fourth consecutive 5 year term despite a constitutional limit of only two terms morales held a failed referendum in february 2016 that would have eliminated term limits despite the fact that the majority of the bolivian population rejected the referendum morales supporter packed court overruled the referendum this ruling and the president s successful submission of his re election bid have resulted in widespread protests with the opposition divided morales support remains moderately strong in part due to a number of successful domestic policies under his presidency since 2005 morales has instituted a number of successful and popular social programs and bolivia has seen improvements in economic growth literacy public health and education that being said morales has continued to open up the country to funding from the chinese which has exploited bolivia s land and resources including indigenous territories within bolivia a move that has been damaging for a candidate who has built his popularity on a pro indigenous pro environment platform looking ahead to this year s elections bolivia has seemingly avoided the worldwide tendency of favoring political outsiders the top six candidates for president have all been president or vice president of bolivia in the past the current top contender to replace morales is carlos mesa a 65 year old filmmaker journalist and former bolivian president from 2003 2005 he leads morales by 5 points in a recent poll despite not being represented by a major political party canada justin trudeau must call national elections by october 21 2019 the crucial question facing canada is whether the populist wave that has swept through europe the united states and latin america will come to canada going into 2019 trudeau s liberal party remains strong in the provinces with the most seats although national polling in early december shows the liberals only 5 points ahead of andrew scheer s conservative party there are two other parties that will split the anti liberal vote nevertheless some indicators show warning signs of a potential populist revolt in canada between 2002 and 2017 the number of canadians who self identify as middle class has declined from 70 percent to 43 percent and only 1 in 8 canadians believe they are better off than a year ago economic displacement driven by perceived canadian losses on the new north american trade agreement and continuing u s tariffs on steel and aluminum may give rise to a hardening of attitudes towards unrestricted immigration and the united states itself even if a populist wave develops it would not necessarily benefit the conservative party scheer is running on a straightforward platform of economic growth in canada s energy sector specifically pledging to reverse trudeau s ban on pipelines eliminate the carbon tax and end the shipping ban in british colombia on immigration the conservative party opposes signing on to the un global compact for migration but from a sovereignty perspective otherwise no significant changes are proposed to canada s relatively generous immigration policies so far trudeau is campaigning on the environment and inequality if the conservatives start rising in the polls trudeau could pivot to issues that resonate more with blue collar workers and their collective sense of economic and social vulnerability el salvador el salvadorans will hold the first round of presidential elections on february 3 2019 in what will be the country s sixth presidential election since the end of its civil conflict the election will feature three major candidates vying to replace current president salvador sanchez ceren from the farabundo martí national liberation front fmln party nayib bukele carlos calleja and hugo martinez given public outcry over continued high levels of violence corruption and minimal economic growth it seems highly possible an outside candidate could win for the first time and in the first round in the latest poll outsider nayib bukele received more than 50 percent support some 20 points ahead of his closest competitor carlos calleja calleja comes from the country s traditional business elite holds an mba from nyu and easily won the conservative nationalist republican alliance arena party primary bukele s other major opponent hugo martinez the former foreign minister of the past two fmln administrations is even further behind however bukele who was seen as a strong mayor of san salvador was expelled from the leftist party for bucking party leadership and thus forced to run on the grand alliance for national unity gana ticket gana a spin off from arena is widely linked with corruption since its former leader elias antonio saca was sentenced to a 10 year prison term in september after pleading guilty to stealing hundreds of millions of dollars while president bukele calleja and martinez all are running on anti corruption platforms with an arena controlled majority in the unicameral national assembly bukele or martinez would have great difficulty in moving their legislative agenda forward guatemala guatemalans will go to the polls on june 16 2019 to elect a new president congress and local authorities the elections of 2019 might also prove to be a referendum on cicig the un backed initiative to combat widespread corruption in guatemala since its institution in 2007 cicig has implicated more than 600 people in corruption cases including former president otto perez molina and has supported the attorney general in attempting to bring a case of illegal campaign finance again current president jimmy morales morales is immune from prosecution until his term ends unless congress reverses its position and votes to lift his immunity as requested by the supreme court and is constitutionally barred from running for president in 2019 he has been a vocal critic of cicig has banned the colombian cicig commissioner iván velásquez from re entering guatemala has revoked the diplomatic credentials of foreign cicig workers and this month has ordered the expulsion of cicig only to have that order suspended by the constitutional court five parties have officially presented candidates for president and vice president with more announcements to come at the beginning of 2019 several of the presidential and vice presidential candidates are lawyers and have shown more support for cicig and one of the presumed candidates is thelma aldana the former attorney general of guatemala and staunch supporter of cicig and other anti corruption efforts finally 2019 is the first election in which guatemalan citizens living in the united states will be eligible to vote for both president and vice president which could add an additional 155 000 voters to the roster panama the upcoming panamanian elections on may 5 2019 will decide the presidency and vice presidency new legislators mayors and district representatives the race for the presidency is down to three serious candidates from the three major political parties all of which are considered traditional and neoliberal although it is set up to be a close election the current favorite to win is laurentino cortizo former president of the national assembly who is backed by the democratic revolutionary party prd and is polling at 36 percent as of early january cortizo is followed in the polls by rómulo roux the democratic change cd candidate with 23 percent and josé blandón the panameñista party pp candidate with 13 percent in addition to the impact from the 100 000 venezuelan migrants and refugees that have arrived in the country in the last few years key election issues will include the increasingly close relationship between panama and china under current president juan carlos varela corruption scandals involving former president ricardo martinelli social issues such as gay marriage and the country s economic slowdown young voters between the age of 18 25 are expected to make up 20 percent of the electorate this year a considerably high percentage of the overall portion which very well could make or break any candidate this year will also be the first election under new campaign finance laws which intend to control private contributions to campaigns and monitor campaign spending uruguay candidates for uruguay s october general presidential election will be determined through primary elections being held in june of this year the current president tabaré vázquez is ineligible for reelection due to term limits leaving open the door to a number of new candidates while it is still too soon to predict likely outcomes of the primary and general elections current poll data indicate that the closest contest will be between the partido nacional and frente amplio candidates in a recent poll the top pick for frente amplio voters is daniel martínez montevideo s mayor with 49 percent of the party s supporters trailed by minister of industry energy and mining carolina cosse with 27 percent of support from the partido nacional the likely candidate is luis lacalle pou a senator and son of former president luis alberto lacalle fifty nine percent of partido nacional voters expressed a preference for him over the other candidates while 28 percent preferred senator jorge larrañaga uruguayans will be primarily casting their vote based on the issues of crime and violence corruption and the economy rates of all types of violent crime increased in 2018 and some indicators show it was the most violent year in the past decade also last year there was a series of high profile corruption scandals featuring members of the ruling frente amplio party including the resignation of vice president raúl sendic in september 2017 following accusations of using public funds for personal use on the economic side the economic anxiety of slowing wage growth only 0 5 percent in 2018 will certainly be felt in the elections where issues such

the reserve bank kicks off its first meeting for the year next tuesday facing the same dilemma it did throughout last year it hasn t got easier the bank has a very public fairly clear objective to keep inflation between 2 and 3 but it keeps missing it over and over and over again and on the downside as the following chart shows inflation has been below the bank s target band for nearly all of the past four years during his decade in office the previous governor glenn stephens achieved an average inflation rate of 2 46 almost bang in the centre of the target band during his subsequent two and half years in the job philip lowe has averaged just 1 87 at no point during lowe s term of office has the average fallen within the target band the rate for december released on wednesday was 1 8 next wednesday lowe will make an unusual address to the national press club during which he will outline his thoughts about the year ahead it is a year which the conversation s forecasting panel predicted will be free of interest rate adjustments making it a record 40 months without a rate move lowe s entire term in office the rba has more than one target although the inflation target is an important part of the reserve bank s mandate it is also asked to focus on other things among them are gdp growth employment and probably less explicitly the australian dollar and house prices and therein lies the problem unless the rate moves needed to meet all those objectives point in the same direction the bank needs to make trade offs or sideline one or more of its objectives a classic principle of economics is that a policy maker needs one instrument or policy tool for each objective it is called the tinbergen rule after the 1969 nobel laureate the bank has four or five objectives but really only one tool the cash rate stuck at 1 5 since lowe took the job throw in the ability to partially shape market expectations through speeches by lowe and deputy governor guy debelle so called open mouth operations and maybe it has two since lowe took office the casualty of this imbalance between instruments and objectives has been the inflation target and it s unlikely to change for some time so why is inflation so low australia is not alone advanced economies around the world have had several years of low wages growth low productivity growth and low inflation populations are ageing less keen on spending and have a glut of excess savings add to this the fact that technology and international trade have made a whole range of goods probably permanently cheaper and it s hard to find inflationary pressure read more vital signs inflation misses again so where does the rba go next potentially making things worse in australia is the decline in house prices in sydney and melbourne eating into consumer confidence and with it spending with well over half of the economy coming from private spending already soft consumer spending could be hit further so far rba governor philip lowe has been doing an admirable impression of mr micawber in the charles dickens novel david copperfield when it comes to inflation he is hoping something will turn up but it hasn t even with historically low levels of unemployment worse still it doesn t even seem to really be ticking up in the united states despite the lowest year end unemployment rate since 1969 and why does it target inflation the bank targets inflation in order to maintain credibility the high levels of inflation in the 1970s and 80s despite quite high levels of unemployment led to the realisation that expectations had a lot to do with it put simply if people believe prices are going to rise sharply they will demand steep wage rises which will cause prices to rise sharply it becomes a wage price spiral macroeconomists and central bankers realised that a credible commitment to keep inflation low would remove the need for the large wage rises cutting off the spiral before it got going the bank describes the rationale for its inflation target this way the governor and the treasurer have agreed that the appropriate target for monetary policy in australia is to achieve an inflation rate of 2 3 on average over time this is a rate of inflation sufficiently low that it does not materially distort economic decisions in the community seeking to achieve this rate on average provides discipline for monetary policy decision making and serves as an anchor for private sector inflation expectations that s been the logic for the past 25 years we have certainly done away with inflationary spirals we are in the age of secular stagnation with an excess of savings chasing too little spending a world where since the turn of this century robust growth has only really been possible when accompanied with financial bubbles first in dot coms then in housing so what s a central banker to do there is an active debate among central bankers and leading macroeconomists about whether to abandon the inflation targeting framework luminaries like former us treasury secretary larry summers argue that inflation targets are to borrow from hamlet more honour d in the breach than the observance right now lowe faces a real dilemma if he doesn t cut rates the inflation target will become more and more of a joke it will add to pressure on him to articulate a new monetary policy framework for a new secular stagnation era if he does he risks re inflating the housing bubble boosting already sky high household debt and giving himself even less wiggle room if a recession hits on tuesday he ll leave the cash rate at 1 50 and on the first tuesday of the next month and the the next and the one after that but i think he ll begin serious internal discussions about a new monetary policy framework and the mechanics of getting into and out of a massive bond buying program otherwise known as quantitative easing or printing money if needed to ward off the next recession should the cash rate remain or get so low he can t cut it further he might have already started he might drop further hints on wednesday read more no surplus no share market growth no lift in wage growth economic survey points to

by shinichi saoshiro tokyo reuters asia stocks rose to a four month high on thursday after the federal reserve pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes signalling a potential end to its tightening cycle amid signs of slowing global growth the dollar struggled near a three week trough against its major peers and u s treasury yields were significantly lower as investors reacted to the fed s change in tone spreadbetters expected european stocks to follow asia s lead and open higher with britain s ftse edging up 0 05 percent and germany s dax and france s cac each climbing 0 3 percent msci s broadest index of asia pacific shares outside japan rose to its highest since oct 4 and was last up 0 9 percent japan s nikkei rose 1 percent the shanghai composite index climbed 0 3 percent despite data showing china s factory activity contracted for a second straight month amid weakening orders south korea s kospi added 0 3 percent the fed on wednesday held interest rates steady as expected and also discarded its promises of further gradual increases in interest rates the central bank said it would be patient before making any further moves amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the u s economy due to global growth risks and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations on wall street the dow and the nasdaq rallied 1 7 percent and 2 2 percent respectively on hopes the fed s pause would give the u s economy and corporate profits more room to run late in december the dow had sunk to its lowest level since september 2017 dogged by factors including worries over cooling economic growth and trade tensions adding pressure on the fed to reassess its tightening bias the fed s statements firmly confirmed its dovish stance which had already been on display at the start of the year market concerns towards the fed s rate hikes have now been put to rest said masahiro ichikawa senior strategist at sumitomo mitsui asset management in tokyo the mention of the balance sheet by the fed was a positive surprise the focus now shifts immediately to u s china trade talks but the equity markets could have enough cushioning to withstand negative news from the talks the u s central bank also said on wednesday that its balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected however while market expectations for fed tightening may have waned significantly some analysts suggested rate hikes still remained a near term possibility while many of the risks to the u s outlook remain in place there is little to suggest that the outlook has changed by as much as the fed communication says it has wrote michael gapen chief u s economist at barclays we worry that the fed has traded near term support for financial markets and the economy for another round of volatility later this year if it is forced to lift rates higher which remains more likely than not in our view with the fed decision out of the way investors focused their attention on a pivotal round of high level u s china trade talks aimed at easing a months long tariff war the two day talks which began in washington on wednesday are expected to be tense with little indication so far that beijing is willing to address core u s demands to fully protect american intellectual property rights and end policies that washington has said force u s companies to transfer technology to chinese firms if the two sides cannot reach a deal soon washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on chinese goods on march 2 in currencies the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stretched the previous day s losses and slipped to a three week low of 95 204 a weaker dollar helped nudge the euro to 1 1509 its highest since jan 11 the greenback was slipped about 0 3 percent to a two week low of 108 695 yen the pound was a shade higher at 1 3127 given some reprieve after slipping earlier in the week when british lawmakers voted down a proposal in parliament that could have prevented a potentially chaotic no deal brexit the benchmark 10 year u s treasury yield extended its decline to as far as 2 674 percent its lowest since jan 14 oil prices rose after u s government data showed signs of tightening supply and as investors remained concerned about supply disruptions following u s sanctions on venezuela s oil industry u s crude oil futures were up 0 7 percent at 54 59 per barrel editing by kim coghill

foreword this article is a bit lengthy but if you bear with me to the end i believe you will conclude that if we become the leaders we will enjoy yet another new age if we do not green extremists will come into our caves and snuff out our polluting candles assuming we have survived choking to death from breathing the filthy air outside armageddon the biblical story was about human governments refusing to bow to god my story today is about political â leaders who are wilfully refusing to accept that our present behaviour will ensure we die of pollution long before we freeze or boil to death as threatened by the armies of climate change â expertsâ paid by governments with our tax money and ignored by many of those governments anyway today we face a moment in history when the very thing created by man and that changed manâ s life in a positive way controlled energy generation now threatens to destroy that life unless we get two dangerous byproducts pollution and head in the sand political leaders disrupted this financial times article tells more about the environment many of us are being forced to live in and what we the people are doing about it paradoxically that pollution and increasing energy demand also provides excellent opportunities for people companies and investors to bypass those â leadersâ who ignore the threat of pollution for short term political gain we can do this by investing in skypull twingtec insolight innolith and abb nyse abb a recent report by the unâ s intergovernmental panel on climate change states the rise in global concentrations of carbon dioxide co2 has risen ten times faster in the past decade than for any sustained period in the past 800 000 years they concluded that these increases must fall to zero by the 2040s in 2019 greenhouse gas emissions are likely to rise again after hitting a record high in 2018 2040 is not far away in the lives of many of the worldâ s younger people today but the only outcome of such reports is solely an excuse to hold yet more climate change conferences around the world accordingly another was held in poland recently there the filthiest of coal is used to generate electricity and in the part where the conference was held childrenâ s lungs are in the same poor condition they would be after smoking several thousand cigarettes not bothering themselves with minor facts like that around 10 000 delegates plus hundreds of media reporters arrived from around the world on pollution generating aircraft to stay in hotels and attend meetings in vast conference halls requiring huge amounts of electricity for heating and lighting from those filthy coal fired power stations the many aircraft used so unnecessarily for that event added to the near 30 000 polluting european skies part of the near 200 000 flying globally each and every day i live in unterengstringen near zã¼rich in environmentally conscious switzerland the land of milk and money where we have clean hydro power in our house but outside the air can be anything but clean switzerland is one of europeâ s cross roads for truck train and air traffic and i took this photo from our garden recently this is typical of any time of the day with four or five planes always overhead pouring filthy emissions down on us on some days when the atmospheric conditions are not so good the stench is awful and sometimes falls on us like fine rain the rhodium group just reported that carbon emissions rose 3 4 in the us in 2018 much of that due to jet fuel use those planes also fly over some of tomorrowâ s power generating and pollution disruptors being nurtured by the european space agency business incubation centre esa bic that is part of one of europeâ s top technical universities eth three companies of the companies i mentioned above are in the esa bic fold skypull twingtec and insolight but first i will say more of that immediate threat to our lives pollution today the biggest producer of one of the most dangerous emissions co2 is coal ironically coal was an important part of the positive transformation of human life that started around 200 years ago with the industrial revolution it still produces 37 of our electricity according to the world coal association china uses it for around 80 and many people living in some cities there are choking to death the us has reduced its use to 30 thanks to cleaner low cost shale gas and no thanks to old king coal trump who would reverse that for short term political gain fortunately voters even in coal communities do not believe him and we are seeing signs of what i hope will become the norm businesses coming clean and bypassing such â leadersâ as must we all australia with a mere 0 3 of the worldâ s population produces 1 of global co2 emissions due to overuse of lignite and contributes much more via massive exports of coal to china and india india uses that for over 70 of their power generation at home in a country that has an abundance of natgas the australian prime minister is prioritising use of lignite instead of that much cleaner gas a combination of corrupted political power and pollution that surely needs a disrupter i do no want to get into arguments with supporters of coal i am well aware that carbon capture and storage ccs technology exists and am equally aware it has not been used to any sufficient extent i have focused on coal here but other gases such as methane produced mainly by the oil and gas industry are dangerous too but that industry is showing signs of cleaning up unlike coal producers that means hope and there are signs too among tomorrowâ s leaders we the people the political power and polluter disrupters australia may pollute above its weight but recently tomorrow s leaders todayâ s school children demonstrated for a cleaner environment they were well mannered intelligent and articulate instead of the countryâ s leader the prime minister meeting them and encouraging them he chose to tell them in only slightly politer words to shut your mouths and get back into classâ hopefully they will become the disrupters that country needs when they get to voting age they should also adopt an initiative signed recently by 13 000 students in france the manifesto pour un reveil ã cologique the manifesto for an ecological awakening their message is simple and will not be welcomed by the remote elites who have led their world into this mess â we students in 2018 refuse to continue on a trajectory that is destroying our societies and we will refuse to work for companies that do not play the sustainable development roleâ letâ s hope they one day do the same with their votes there are strong signs their parents are beginning a revolution of their own with the gilets jaunes primary objective being the removal of their elite president letâ s also hope those polish kids with coal damaged lungs and their parents do likewise around 75 of americans excluding president trump believe future generations will be harmed the combination of political power and pollution in the us obviously needs a disrupter too this 15 year old swedish girl greta thunberg has received world recognition for her views some of france s top companies are getting it right including saint gobain otcpk codgf and schneider electric otcpk sbgsf those future australian leaders should do likewise and refuse to work for the worldâ s largest coal exporter and one of australiaâ s largest companies bhp nyse bhp and in the us refuse to work for proctor and gamble who had indonesian rain forest a natural carbon dioxide sink torn down to grow palm oil to replace nasty stuff in their soaps their pr people loudly lauded the latter but kept silent about the rain forest destruction we the people are taking our lives into our own hands in important ways two very large californian pension funds have joined hands with other large investors overseeing 11 5 trillion in assets including schroders fidelity legal and general all run by we the people who have called on power companies to end coal use by 2030 they specifically named the main culprits in britain france and germany the power of money and the people behind it will win we the people are the political power and polluter disrupters people power that expression has often been used but it has yet to overcome the elites who have highjacked representational democracy so that it represents only them and big money the media are the courtiers of the elites and constantly try to prove that referendums votes are a threat to democracy they do not remind us that the word democracy came from ancient athens where only the elites got to vote and we their slaves did not people s power in its truest form has been working here in the direct democracy of switzerland since 1848 here the people are the highest political authority they make all major decisions via referendums at every level federal state and local the politicians implement those decisions no doubt there are imperfections but the people have managed better than the political â leadersâ in most countries i put more about that in switzerland land of milk and money i also described the mess the decaying power systems are in many countries in the supply section of my pass the candle article such little hope opens doors to new clean and profitable hope and i shall cover that later first a recap on todayâ s supply and demand status supply belgium is facing potential blackouts amid prolonged outages at two of its ageing generators leaving a potential two gigawatt supply gap this winter belgium sometimes helps top up neighbouring franceâ s ageing system the french system relies on nuclear for about 70 of its needs and was described as in an existential crisis in 2016 over two years on nothing has been done britain is approaching armageddon faster than most the latest news is that hitachi has pulled out of building a nuclear power station there that would have replaced 7 of worn out old power stations note the word replace it would provide no new supply the worldâ s most expensive nuclear power station ever under construction at hinkley point c might never get finished and the political system overseeing this under prime minister may is in a state of may hem her state minister for business energy and industrial strategy recently brushed criticism aside by blandly asserting in a letter published in the financial times that the supply problem for the 2030s is not one of shortages but â the much better challenge of abundanceâ that minister would not even be able to buy candles from china without adding to britainâ s mountain of debt according to official statistics that debt including unfunded obligations such as pensions exceeds 240 of national income germany is the worldâ s fourth largest economy and europeâ s economic power house but remains largely dependent on ageing coal fired plants in 2012 a political promise to phase out nuclear power by 2022 was made today barely three years from then nothing has been started to replace that in a country where it takes decades for anything to even get started due to the madhouse of bureaucracies there the political leaders spout about wind power in the north but say nothing about the missing link the transmission lines to the main industrial centres in the south the cost for which has been estimated at euros 80 billion by agora energiewende a berlin based environmental think tank and in the past few days a new political promise has been made to place out coal by 2038 i suppose it does not matter because recharging all those electric bmw mercedes benz and audi cars that will not get built in their factories in the south that have no power will not then overload the power generation system that is left only politicians could dream up that ingenious solution to the problem those same politicians have a similar ingenious solution called energiewende the change to clean energy but as with those north south transmission lines there is a missing link for that too money the respected frauenhofer research institute has estimated that implementing that solution would cost germany euros 30 billion every year up to 2050 neither my calculator nor my tiny brain can calculate what e30 billion by 31 years totals the mighty us is no better as in europe some of its transmission and distribution lines t ds were put up in the 19th century capacity is so stretched that even a single line cannot be taken out of service for maintenance because that would severely overload decayed connected lines the whole grid is vulnerable to cyber attacks hurricanes earthquakes solar storms terrorist strikes and electro magnetic impulses we saw evidence of what can happen when hurricane maria destroyed the entire power infrastructure in the us territory of puerto rico and the whole island lost power many more people died after than were killed by the hurricane yet political â leadersâ sat for years on the knowledge of what might happen and did nothing the us system has other problems too such as power company bankruptcies too bad about human life and the demands we have to keep on improving it demand i covered this also in my pass the candle article today less than 12 months later new uses for blockchain are adding huge new loads on the system calastone the london technology group will bring mutual funds on to blockchain this year calastone connects more than 1 300 financial service companies across 34 global markets bnp paribas ostrum asset management standard life aberdeen and columbia threadneedle are among others developing plans to use blockchain energy trading via vakt will be widely used within the next twelve months even sales of art are now being conducted on blockchain powered platforms maybe some of that will bring more business as well to switzerlandâ s crypto valley car makers including the german ones have continued to pour millions into electric vehicle ev development seemingly without answering the question of how they will be recharged by the already overloaded power generation system and much of that coal fired clean cars polluting rechargers data centres that require enormous amounts of power for cooling continue to be built quantum computing needs even more ibm never recovered after being disrupted by the apple mac but maybe it will make a comeback with the q system one recently came news of a quantum compass that may replace gps a new technology is being developed in israel called computer vision that will be used on everything from autonomous cars to farming algorithms and ai use for stock market trading is adding further new demand since we are nearly 20 of the way through the 21st century it is difficult for any person today except politicians to see where all that fits in a world where some of the transmission and distribution systems being relied upon were installed in the 19th century enough of the threats all threats bring opportunities and some of those are new age power and pollution disrupters from the land of milk and money the clean and profitable new age switzerland has many innovators as well as chocolate makers some of those innovators are being nurtured by the european space agency business incubation centre esa bic wind power is familiar to all and although it produces clean energy it visually pollutes lovely coastlines and countrysides and creates noise pollution and those ugly monsters often do not work when needed on the coldest days because there is no wind no wind there is plenty of wind if you know where to find it skypull and twingtec do above a certain altitude the wind is continuous and both these companies generate electricity continuously on the ground as a result they can be installed locally close to where the power is needed and thus need no costly transmission line connections to power generating plants far away india has around 32 million homes still without electrical power so skypull twingtec and insolight more later could serve local communities with clean energy unlike much of the country which is supplied by filthy coal fired plants and that would also solve local air pollution problems caused by using other dirty fuels for cooking there is more about what skypull does and how it does it here and here twingtec demonstrates their way in this video they will have to be installed away from aircraft flight paths in locations approved by local aviation authorities but many places they will serve are remote from those or the planes are flying at much higher altitudes it could also be that some of those places exist in the permian basin of texas where there is no electrical power and thus no shale oil and gas drilling at present another thing i like about both is they do not visually pollute beautiful coastlines and countryside as do the monster wind generators currently used those things are noisy too our â leadersâ tout their green credentials by allowing those things and so aid one pollution problem but ignore the visual and noise pollution they create also ignored is the huge cost of removing the giant steel reinforced concretes bases at the end of the usable lives of these monsters of necessity those bases are built to be indestructible by natureâ s forces the sun is the main other supplier of todayâ s clean energy it produces more energy in a second that the entire world needs for a year not all of that comes in our direction but we are still only using a minuscule amount of that which does and todayâ s solar panels are showing signs of ageing most still produce around the same amount of electricity per sq metre as those made in earlier years and are of very low efficiency 17 20 that leads me to a third esa bic company for tomorrow s clean energy age insolight insolight efficiency is far greater it could replace all existing panels because it can fit on any pv mounting rack and provide 10 or more electricity at lower prices whatâ s not to like one thing it needs when there is no sun and so do skypull and twingtec when producing at off peak times is storage another swiss company can provide that innolith this video paints a picture of many thousand words under supply above i mentioned the decaying t d systems many local communities we the people are taking action and bypassing those with local grid structures apart from the environmental benefits they provide twingtec skypull insolight and innolith can also be valuable components of totally new power generating systems that are built to serve localised needs throughout the us and other developed countries before many become underdeveloped in the not too distant future the capital cost of installing these localised systems will be massively lower and can be small or large to suit local needs in many places we are heading towards an era of smart cities that will be totally disconnected from existing power generation systems they will avoid the catastrophic risks that existing systems face and can be fixed local and rapidly if problems arise the central component of these will be microgrids a swiss listed giant can supply those abb abb around 130 years ago abb too was a start up by british engineer brown and german engineer boveri the a in the name came years later when their company merged with swedish company asea today that two man start up is a giant with around 147 000 employees working in over 100 countries it is a bit of a conglomerate but not in a mess like nyse ge and is becoming a bit more streamlined i especially like abb for its microgrids abbâ s share price has gone nowhere in the last five years and there has been no sales growth sales growth might look slow in the future but that will be partly due to divesting some activities and hopefully profits will improve taking up the share price in the medium term if you buy it on the swiss exchange symbol abbn you buy into the strong swiss franc and get a safe 4 dividend there are many individual companies now getting on with new ways for a cleaner tomorrow one of the worldâ s largest data centre operators digital reality nyse dlr is getting into solar together with major customer facebook nasdaq fb shell and nyse bp past naughty boys are going into solar for ev charging in a big way exxon nyse xom is fast following them pushed by shareholders to do so french company air liquide otcpk aiquf is investing heavily in the us building refuelling stations for hydrogen fuelled cars the world s largest oil producer saudi arabia is also getting into hydrogen refuelling that brings me to conclusion time will that conclusion be armagedon or its opposite serenity miracle wonder the word choice is yours it would be a miracle under todayâ s political leaders so i will choose wonder the wonder of what we the people will achieve and much of this will be achieved with private financing as well the wonder is happening fast and gaining an unstoppable momentum a few examples data centre giant digital reality dlr and green bonds boston properties nyse bxp and sustainability swiss property company psp otcpk pspsf and co2 reduction parts of the us such as iowa with its solar and storage project cps energy and clean power in san antonio texas apple nasdaq aapl is now running 100 on renewable energy south korea with solar and storage in agriculture too with the ripe work in illinois all this and more by the people is putting coal into a death spiral hooray for us the people power where next insolight skypull twingtec and innolith are not listed companies and early stage investors should contact them directly also for product availability information i am long

i hinted earlier that i may start my own start up my research into the many opportunities ahead has found an unfilled niche that could use products from each of the above from others and from abb a million dollars or so would help me get that off the ground but i doubt that will be thrown at me so if any reader is or knows a very experienced industrial electrical engineer in his her thirties who i can swap ideas with please say hello on my email address jbhanshaw gmail com if i am right maybe we can get it off the ground together i may buy into abb soon as its management is finally focusing its activities and cutting back on fat if they get it right it has huge potential bloomberg recently reported that corporations hunger for clean power has never been greater companies are made up of people shareholders executives and employees if the execs refuse to change then if you are a shareholder use your vote to change those execs readers will hopefully seek to invest in more of the many companies doing the right thing too and i hope you share those names with us in comments below including names of companies that have technology for removing co2 from the air and maybe water vapour too because water vapour is a problem also letâ s do our bit to strengthen people power one thing is for sure a movement that was slow to start is fast turning into an avalanche a very positive one

and supplemental financial data which are available on the for investors page of our website at www maac com i ll now turn the call over to eric h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer thanks tim and good morning we wrapped up 2018 slightly ahead of where we expected with ffo per share of 6 06 per share excluding the non cash mark to market accounting adjustment related to the preferred shares we re encouraged with our fourth quarter results as a positive trends and rent growth and high occupancy are clearly evident while the new supply pipeline in several markets will challenge near term rent growth we re encouraged with the continued strong demand for apartment housing across our markets our portfolio continues to benefit from strong job growth and overall high demand for apartment housing we continue to believe that new supply pressure in 2019 will remain elevated but down slightly from 2018 tom will cover more details concerning our higher concentration markets but broadly when weighted our market exposures by percentage of noi and refining the analysis to neighborhood specific assessments of new supply our latest update is very similar to the information we shared at nareit in november in summary we expect 48 of our portfolios market exposure will show some level of improvement in 2019 with lower supply as compared to prior year 44 of our market exposure is expected to see slightly higher levels of new delivery in 2019 and 8 of the portfolio exposure will see current year deliveries in line with prior year new deliveries assuming the demand side equation remains strong we expect the positive pricing momentum we ve seen over the back half of 2018 to continue through calendar year 2019 as we continue to work through the later stages of the current cycle we do expect to see developers get a little more aggressive with their lease up tactics and have dialed that into our expectations for 2019 with the goal of maximizing long term revenue results we remain focused on continuing to capture the encouraging trends in rent growth given where we are in the cycle we expect that it might come at the cost of a low current occupancy but let me be clear about this as al will outline in his comments we do expect to post strong occupancy in 2019 of 95 9 average daily occupancy throughout the year which represents only a slight 20 basis point moderation from the record high 96 1 average daily occupancy throughout 2018 as commented in our third quarter earnings release our merger integration activities are now complete we re very pleased with the results over the last couple of years in harvesting the expense synergies we had previously identified surrounding property level operating expenses and g a overhead costs we do expect to see year over year growth and expenses begin to normalize in 2019 as expected the opportunities on the revenue side of the equation surrounding various revenue management practices and significant redevelopment opportunities within the legacy post portfolio have been slower to capture than the expense side given the new supply pressures in a number of markets however despite this pressure the improving pricing trends within the legacy post portfolio over the past couple of quarters are encouraging and in addition we will be executing on our higher number of redeveloped opportunities this year within that part of the portfolio our four projects in lease up continue to become increasingly productive and in line with our expectations we expect to see all four properties stabilize over the course of this year we expect to see our new development projects in raleigh and denver begin initial leasing and occupancy over the back half of this year with our newest project in the frisco submarket of north dallas coming online early next year we started a new expansion project at our copper ridge community in north fort worth this month on existing owned land at this point we re also working pre development at new development projects in phoenix denver orlando and houston that were expect to start later this year in summary we re encouraged with the continued momentum in pricing that we re capturing despite the new supply headwinds in several of our larger markets we believe our portfolio focused on the strong job growth sunbelt region diversified across markets submarkets and price points appealing to the largest segments of the real ph markets continue to position maa for solid performance over the full real estate cycle our balance sheet is in a strong position and certainly able to support the external growth opportunities we re currently executing on in any others that may emerge after two years of merger activities that are now complete our platform is stable and stronger we look forward to the performance opportunities in 2019 i m going to turn the call over to tom now thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer thank you eric and good morning everyone our operating performance for the fourth quarter came in as expected with building momentum in rent growth continued strong average daily occupancy and improving trends that set us up well for 2019 the results of the integration work on the operating platform were evident in our leasing momentum during the quarter we saw blended lease over lease performance of the combined portfolio grow by 1 6 in the fourth quarter which is 150 basis points higher than the same time last year average daily occupancy remained strong at 96 1 as a result of the steady positive trend and blended pricing we saw revenues buck seasonal trends and they accelerated from 2 in the third quarter to 2 3 in the fourth quarter all elevated supply levels have pressured rent growth in several of our markets particularly dallas and austin we re still seeing good revenue growth in a number of our other markets among our highest concentration markets phoenix richmond tampa and orlando are our strongest revenue growth markets expense performance was steady for the fourth quarter at 3 this includes 5 8 growth in real estate taxes which was partially offset by reductions in building repair and maintenance as well as marketing for the year our total expense growth was just 2 while we ve captured the scale and labor opportunities available during this merger we still expect to continue our disciplined expense practices our annual operating expense growth rate since 2012 has been just 2 4 well below the sector average the favorable trends continued into january all pricing indicators are trending ahead of last year currently same store january blended lease over lease rates are up a healthy 3 1 which is 260 basis points better than january of last year average daily occupancy for the month is a strong 96 our 60 day exposure which represents all vacant units and move out notices for a 60 day period is a low ph 7 2 we are well positioned for 2019 our focus on customer service and retention coupled with social trends supporting steady renter demand continued to drop down resident turnover move outs for the overall same store portfolio were down 7 for the quarter move outs to homebuying and move outs to home renting were down 5 and 12 respectively on a rolling 12 month basis turnover was at historic low of 48 5 this level of turnover was achieved while increasing renewal rents at notable 6 1 on the redevelopment front in the fourth quarter we completed 1 600 units which brought us to a total of 8 200 unit interior upgrades for the year for 2019 we again expect to complete close to 8000 unit interior upgrades as a reminder on average we spent 6 100 per unit and charge an additional 11 in rent which generates a year one cash on cash return in excess of 20 our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 17 500 to 20 500 units our active lease up communities sync36 and post river north in denver post centennial park in atlanta and phase two of 1201 midtown and mount pleasant in the mount pleasant submarket of charleston are all leasing up in line with expectations looking forward as eric mentioned our overall supply in our markets is expected to improve modestly in 2019 we take the third party data and crosscheck this supply data with our own asset by asset information performance by market will vary but at this point we believe overall we will see some decline in deliveries our dallas and austin assets are expected to remain challenging with supplier levels continuing in the 3 to 4 of inventory range we expect charlotte to soften as supply picks up near our assets we expect the strength in jacksonville orlando tampa and phoenix to continue as all currently show supply decreasing we re pleased to have the merger integration wrapped up and greatly appreciate the tireless efforts of our associates as we retool the company over the last two years we are starting 2019 in a much better position than 2018 and we look forward to the coming year al albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer thanks tom and good morning everyone i ll provide some additional commentary on the company s fourth quarter earnings performance balance sheet activity and then finally on the key components of our initial guidance for 2019 ffo for the fourth quarter was 1 55 per share which included 0 02 per share of non cash expense related to the accounting adjustment of preferred shares acquired during the post merger excluding this adjustment our ffo per share for the fourth quarter was a penny above the midpoint of our prior guidance with majority of this outperformance produced by favorable interest expense during the quarter our overall same store performance for the fourth quarter is in line with our expectations as continued pricing momentum produced a 2 3 year over year growth and total revenues which accelerated as tom mentioned are from the 2 in the third quarter overall blended lease pricing growth combined new and renewal pricing finished the year the full year of 2 5 which was 80 basis points above the prior year same store expense growth of 3 for the fourth quarter was primarily driven by a 5 8 growth in real estate tax expense which represents 36 of total same store operating expenses as pressure late ph in there from certain municipalities primarily atlanta and dallas impacted in fourth quarter and for the full year real estate tax expense grew 4 2 as compared to our initial guidance of 3 5 to 4 5 for the year during the fourth quarter we completed construction of one development community an expansion community a phase of community in charleston which leads to three committees undeveloped under development at year end with a total projected cost of 118 5 million of which about 87 5 million remain to be funding as of year end we also acquired two land parcels during the fourth quarter one in denver and one in houston both related to planned new development projects expected to begin during 2019 given our current pipeline and planned new projects we expect total construction funding to increase in 2019 ranging between 100 million and 150 million we continue to expect noi yields of 6 to 6 5 on average from our development portfolio once they re completed and fully stabilized during the fourth quarter we had two communities completely leased up and reached stabilization which we measure as 90 occupancy for greater than 90 days and we saw four communities in lease up at year end including the recently completed community we mentioned earlier average occupancy for our lease up portfolio ended the year at 62 4 as tom mentioned leasing has gone well for the group and we expect growing earnings contribution during 2019 and to the 2020 as two of these communities are projected to stabilize in the first half of the year and the final two stabilizing later in the year our balance sheet remains in great shape at year end during the fourth quarter we had a fairly significant amount of financing activity as we paid off the final 80 million of fannie mae secured credit facility which matured in december and additional 530 million of secured mortgages maturing in early 2019 given the volatility of the credit markets during the fourth quarter we revised our financing plans and entered a 30 year fixed rate secured mortgage for 172 million and a 300 million variable rate unsecured six month term loan which we expect to replace in 2019 with additional fixed rate financing at the end of the year we had over 490 million of combined cash capacity under our credit facility our leverage as defined by our bond covenants was only 32 6 while our net debt to recurring ebitda was just below 5 times finally we are providing initial earnings guidance for 2019 with the release which is detailed in our supplemental information package we re providing guidance for net income per diluted common share which is reconciled to ffo and affo per share in supplement we re also providing guidance and other key business metrics expected to drop almost in 2019 also though we do expect to continue volatility in our nareit reported ffo results related to non cash accounting adjustment on the preferred years we did not include the adjustments in our forecast as these are both non cash and really impractical to predict net income per diluted common shares projected to be 2 11 to 2 35 for the full year 2019 ffo is projected to be 6 03 to 6 27 or 6 15 at the midpoint affo is projected to be 5 39 to 5 63 per share or 5 51 at the midpoint the main driver of full year 2019 performance is our same store guidance revenue growth projected to be 2 3 at the midpoint is based on continued strong average daily occupancy of 95 9 at the midpoint and projected average blended rent pricing which is new leases and renewals combined of 2 7 for the year which is a modest improvement over 2018 we expect operating expenses to grow at 3 1 at the midpoint coming off of two years of very low expense growth we expect real estate taxes to continue to produce the most pressure increasing 4 25 at the midpoint and this expected same store revenue and operating expense performance produces noi growth of 1 8 at the midpoint we expect the acquisition environment to remain competitive we project total acquisition volume for 2019 to range between 125 million and 175 million and to consist primarily of non stabilized deals we also plan to resume our portfolio recycling efforts projected disposition volume of 75 million to 125 million likely closing in the second half of the year we expect the end of 2019 with our leverage near current levels as a percentage of gross assets producing an average effective interest rate of 3 9 or 4 1 which is about 20 basis points above the prior year at the midpoint which represents an 0 08 per share impact to our earnings and a portion of this projected increase is related to the continued impact of rising short term interest rates with the remaining portion primarily due to the declining mark to market adjustment related to the debt acquired from colonial and post mergers as the favorable fair market value adjustments from both mergers essentially burned off during 2018 our guidance also assumes total overhead cost which we included g a and property management expenses combined will range between 96 5 million and 98 5 million reflecting more normalized run rate for 2019 which includes a full year carry of investments we made in our people facilities systems and web presence to improve our operating platform capabilities scalability our cybersecurity and with all of this which was planned as part of the merger integration efforts our total overhead cost for 2018 were actually below our original estimates for the year and actually declined from 2017 primarily due to timing of some of these planned investments and the impact of several non recurring items during the year which impacted legal casualty insurance and medical insurance policies for the year we expect our total overhead growth for the longer term to be around 5 annually which is in line with the sector average that s all i have in the way of prepared comments so operator we ll now turn the call back over to you for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and we ll go ahead and take our first question from trent trujillo from scotiabank please go ahead your line is open trent trujillo scotiabank analyst hi good morning and thanks for taking for taking the questions you called out supply pressures in austin charlotte plus dallas and atlanta continue to see high levels of permitting new supply and very much thank you for breaking out your nois into higher and lower and similar supply buckets for 2019 but how can you be confident in your ability to assert pricing power and show same store revenue acceleration at the aggregate level if these pressures persist in your largest markets and i guess another way of saying this can you maybe talk about the magnitude of supply increases versus the magnitude of decline h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer let me start trent this is eric and tom can give you some more specifics i mean our confident our confidence if you will as it pertains to 2019 rent growth despite the supply pressures is really based in what we see as continued very strong demand and we see no evidence that the demand side of the equation is weakening we continue to see very low move out occurring and the job growth numbers continue to be encouraging so with that level of demand when we start looking at our particular locations and as tom mentioned in his call we take the axio data and other sort of macro level data and we do a deep dive with it into specific neighborhoods and so forth where we re located and ultimately we do see this mix of roughly 48 of the portfolio suggesting slightly lower supply pressure 44 slightly higher and about 8 being pretty consistent but really the confidence that we have is really driven by the demand side of the equation as long as that s there we think the new trends that we re seeing are going to continue to hold up one other thing i ll add i do believe that as we get later in the cycle that developers may get evermore aggressive with some of their lease up practices in an effort to get little quicker and that s what really we haven t seen the evidence of that yet but i think it s the reasonable to expect that it may come in certain areas and that really led us to introduce the notion that we ll maintain strong occupancy but it may not be quite at 96 1 that we did in 2018 we believe that really to protect long term revenue growth that rent growth really matters and we wanted to continue to capture that rent growth trend that we re seeing we think we ll do so and to counter the cost of the little occupancy in 2019 we re ok with that we think that s in long term play to make thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer and then just underlying trend the confidence on the revenue side the rent trends i ll touch on for q4 and january just to put those in perspective for first quarter blended rents increase was 45 basis points better than last year and second quarter was 100 basis points better third quarter 60 basis points fourth quarter 150 basis points in january 260 basis points so we feel good about the underlying results that we re seeing on the pricing trends trent trujillo scotiabank analyst okay that s great color as it relates to the transaction market on the third quarter call eric you mentioned that you re seeing perhaps some early indications where deal flow might come back to you as things are starting to fray a little bit it may have been very preliminary but your guidance does call for some lease up acquisitions and you stated significant capacity on your balance sheet so can you maybe give us an update on how you re viewing the transaction market the deal flow what opportunities are out there what are you looking at and how competitive it is to find accretive deal that meet the standards at this time h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer so it s still very very competitive as you may know i mean the market tends to take a little bit of a breather during the very early part of the year i know our transaction team is out at the nashville housing conference for a broker event it has become almost annual meeting right now and they usually come back with a lot of leads if you will a lot of opportunities i know they re talking about this week there continues to be just a high level of interest by private capital in the space so we fully expect that this next year 2019 will be as competitive as what we saw in 2018 but having said that again we re just getting later in the cycle and i think that some of the lease up properties will perhaps run into a little bit more headwind than what they may have experienced in 18 and as a consequence of that we re hopeful that that may create a little pressure which create some better buying opportunities for us we are going to remain disciplined but we continue to have hope that the 19 is going to deliver a few more opportunities i mean the volume is still high but we re going to continue to remain optimistic about 19 opportunities trent trujillo scotiabank analyst all right thank you for the time appreciate it h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer you bet operator operator instructions we ll go ahead and take our next question from nick from citi please go ahead your line is open nicholas joseph citigroup analyst thanks it s been two years but now that the integration with the post is complete have you seen any difference in same store growth and margins in 2019 between the two portfolios thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer yeah hey nick this is tom what we re really seeing in mid america is 2 6 and portfolio to post is 1 7 what to me is most interesting is the rate of acceleration on the post side which was second quarter 0 4 and now 0 7 1 7 that s on the revenue growth side h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer yeah what i would say nick is that we saw incredible opportunities that we harvested in the first two years on the expense side of the equation as we renegotiated contracts and got some very huge benefits of scale that we re able to bring to the post portfolio on the expense side as well as sort of retooling some of the practices in turn activities and with labor cost and that s what really fueled some pretty low year over year expense growth that we ve had for the last two years not only and particularly in the post portfolio but in aggregate the overall maa portfolio had pretty strong expense performance but what s been slower to come online has been the opportunities on the revenue side and a lot of that is a function of really three things first of all you ve got a there s some training and then there s some people things that you have to sort of get stabilize and get right and that takes a little time two the market conditions as a function of higher supply levels have been more pressuring the post locations which is we re battling that and then a third we have to just basically get into the revenue management practices and as you know particularly when the opportunity lies in the area of rent growth it takes time for that momentum to build you have to go through a full leasing cycle and reprice portfolio and bring all of the training and all of the revenue practices together and as what tom is alluding to there which gives us a lot of encouragement is the improving pricing trends that we re seeing out of the legacy post portfolio are far superior than what we re seeing on the maa portfolio so it does suggest us that we re going to see continued momentum and then as i mentioned in my comments earlier too next year we ll be redeveloping more of the post portfolio as a percentage of what we do in terms of overall redevelopment so i think we re going to continue to see the momentum and the opportunities on the revenue side come together more so over the next couple of years nicholas joseph citigroup analyst thanks and then just on the total overhead obviously up pretty meaningfully over 2018 can you walk through the main drivers of that and then is this 2019 guidance a good baseline going forward or are there any onetime items in there albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer hey nick this is al i can walk you through that and i think 2019 certainly compared to 18 was a fairly significant increase but it has a lot to do really with some activity in 18 and there was a little bit of noise still in the year relates to some of the things going on so if you look at 2018 it actually declined from 17 and was a a little bit lower than what we had put out initially in our guidance early on in the year only for couple of reasons one as we re making investments for an integration and for the platform that we knew that we re going to put together we some of those came later than we expected as we wanted to get deeper into the project into the process and really zero on exactly what we wanted and what we wanted to invest in to make our platform and what we wanted to be in the future so 18 was lower 19 you feel the full run rate of that and then we had some onetime items in 2018 some cost that are due and payable that won t recur in 19 and some of the insurance and workers comp and real insurance and medical insurance since our medical costs were been lower we re glad to have that we don t think that will repeat in 19 so what i will say is 19 is a fairly large increase we would expect as you move in as you move to 2020 we have a more modest increase we think that 19 is a full year run rate of our platform that we expect and i think if you look at our three year windows i talked about the decline in 18 rise in 19 and a more modest rise in 20 we expect it to be in line with the long term sector average of 5 to 6 that s how we built it nicholas joseph citigroup analyst thanks its very helpful operator we ll go ahead and take the next question from austin from keybanc capital markets please go ahead your line is open austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst hi good morning you guys mentioned you started out the year with blended lease rates of over 3 in january but the average i think you re assuming for the full year is 2 7 so just curious what leads you to believe that lease rates will moderate later into the year h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer i ll start with that and tom can jump in i think one of the things going on is as you remember we had some pretty favorable comparison on some leasing activity late last year fourth quarter last year is when it really got challenging before since i think some of the new leases we re putting on and as we move into january are really strong comparisons i think as we move into the year as tom will say that that may moderate somewhat but we feel good that we ve got thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer no absolutely that sort of trend that i rattled off a little bit earlier we ll have to start comparing to that and so we ve got the comparisons we ve got good opportunity first part of the year but don t expect to keep freeline all the way through austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst is that a function i understand that that from a spread perspective that the spreads become more difficult but from an absolute level i guess is it just your you are cautious to push rent on the same tenant two years in a row at a consistent level or in order to kind of in order to sustain occupancy or i guess i don t fully understand the comp discussion in a stable supply environment i would think maybe you could still push i guess at a similar rate so can you just dive in a little bit there thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer i mean on the same resident back to back that s on the renewal side and renewals are strengthening and i feel very comfortable with that in the 6 to 7 range right now right now the variable is on the new lease rates and we do we think we will have good performance there just not the same gap that we had prior h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer but also adding to that we certainly intend and expect that our ability to push rents in 2019 will be comparable to what we did in 2018 we don t see any reason to suggest that we re going to have to back off and the only thing that is different if you will in 19 versus 18 is that we think as we continue that same level of push on pricing as we get later in the cycle and we get i think most of the information i ve seen for axio and others suggest that the we ve got the peak in deliveries in q2 rather than start of the spring leasing season it may come at the cost that that pushing on pricing may come at the cost of a little bit of a give up on occupancy and we just think it s important to be willing to make that trade off right now in order to sort of protect the long term revenue goals that we have so but to answer your question no we absolutely don t believe we re going to need to back off on pushing on the rents it s just that the prior year comparisons that we re comparing against are just a little harder as we get later in the year austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst that s helpful and then as far as the peaking in the second quarter i mean what have you seen as far as construction delays in your markets are you continuing to see them or have they started to slow a bit h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer yeah about all i can tell you is i m sure construction delays will continue i think there s been no evidence whatsoever that the labor issues have gotten any easier and that typically is what s causing a lot of the delays to occur the information that i alluded to that we saw from axio suggesting that it would peak in q2 i fully expect that to slide a little bit into q3 so i don t know at this point something we re watching very very closely but i wouldn t fully expect some of these projects to slip a little bit over the course of the year austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst thanks and just last one i m just curious if you in your forecast when do you see supply growth in your submarkets in dallas begin to moderate thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer we re seeing some early signs that it may moderate late in the year but i think dallas is going to be challenging for the pretty much for the full year its way too early to call the end on that one and we will be challenging particularly the first two quarters of the year austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst great thanks guys operator operator instructions we ll go ahead and take our next question from john kim from bmo capital markets please go ahead john kim bmo capital markets analyst thank you on your occupancy guidance for the year i relate it s only 20 basis points but do you believe as far as the turnover rate will increase during the year or it ll take longer to lease up vacant units or a combination of both h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer it s hard to know i would say likely i would think more likely it s going to come primarily through just slightly higher average number of days vacancy between turns i think that for all the reasons tom alluded to the retention rate and the lower turnover that we re seeing i suspect is going to continue to be low i mean the number one reason people leave us is because of some sort of change in their employment status and absent some sort of slowdown in the job market which we don t anticipate i don t think we re going to see more pressure on that front and then when you look at the number two reason people leave us is to go buy a house that seems to not becoming any worse for sure maybe even slightly better so as a consequence of that i think that i m optimistic that the turnover component remains fairly static in 19 relative to 18 we just think that some of these lease up projects will get a little bit more aggressive we as i mentioned are committed to holding as much as we can the trend and we think we can on rent growth and we think that it may require a little bit of concession on some of the days vacancy between turns on new move ins and we think that s the right trade off to make right now in order to protect the strong rent growth improvement that we re seeing take place and again looking to capture a very strong average daily occupancy of 95 9 i mean that s pretty darn strong and we think we ll do that this year john kim bmo capital markets analyst apologize if i missed this or if you ve already answered this but where do you think renewals will be this year versus 6 last year thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer i won t think we would be between 5 5 and 6 5 for the year trending a little higher than that in january but i would feel comfortable in the 5 5 to 6 5 range john kim bmo capital markets analyst okay on the expense side with tax increases of 4 25 ph overhead cost going up 5 i realize some of that in g a is 3 same store expense growth is the new norm for the foreseeable future albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer i mean i think if you look at the john this is al if you look at our long term average it s close to 2 5 i think the real estate tax i think what we have gone in the last couple of years is really good performance for two years 2 on average last couple of years driven by reductions in repair and maintenance and marketing some of the areas where we re able to capture strong synergies from our deals and we had a tax pressure offsetting that somewhat we have about 5 growth in real estate taxes over those two years and still where we put a 2 total expense growth forward so i think going forward what you ll see is personnel if those other lines will be under control but more close to normal level of growth personnel 2 to 2 5 repair and maintenance closer to 3 modest growth in other lines and taxes being one third of your cost in the fourth quarter range producing the majority h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer one way of looking at it is that even if you think about real estate taxes comprising the large percentage of our overall tax expense base that growth rate almost by the math implies a lower less than 3 growth rate on all of the other line items and so i think that the new norm is my guess is going to be closer to 3 in any given year a lot of it is going to be up or down as a consequence of real estate taxes albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer and we will help over time a couple of years real state in texas being to moderate but right now there s a lot of pressure from texas georgia and not surprisingly h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer the low cap rate environment fueling that john kim bmo capital markets analyst got it okay and then on your market commentary and as far as where you re seeing the greater supply pressure back in november nareit you guys are saying austin charlotte and dc were the three major markets it looks like dallas has moved up into the bucket i m wondering what changed in the last couple of months with dallas and also if d c is still on market we see how they will display h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer d c is still a market in the elevated bucket and then dallas just sort of dallas is very close to even in some looks it is slightly higher in others its slightly lower but john i would just expect it to be pressured about the same as next year albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think john we would say dallas is still kind of at the same bucket but it s still it s elevated both years but not necessarily getting way better or way worse austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst okay great thank you operator and we will go ahead and take our next question from rob stevenson from janney please go ahead your line is open robert stevenson janney montgomery analyst thank you tom which markets have the widest spend of likely same store revenue outcomes when you did your budgeting for 19 thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer meaning where do i think our strongest markets will be and where do our weakest or within the market which has the largest delta between assets robert stevenson janney montgomery analyst the largest delta between basically the up end the top end of the range and the bottom end of the range i assume that al made to pick the middle or somewhere below the middle or from a conservative basis in most of your markets when you were going through from an earning standpoint but like which markets are most likely to have a surprise to the top end or down side in 19 relative to where you guys set the median expectation thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer yeah and then it s sort of what i ll tell you is that comes down maybe to the change in the back half of the year and i would tell you that charlotte were relatively strong right now and but it is we re expecting some supply there especially later and so that may change over time and then nashville it looks like it s maybe better later half of the year but it s challenging very challenging right now robert stevenson janney montgomery analyst okay and then the 8000 units you expect to renovate this year are these all going to be on terms or are you going to take some units out of service thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer they will all be on terms robert stevenson janney montgomery analyst okay and then lastly for me al what s the known non cash or non recurring things impacting ffo in 19 albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer non cash rob it s a much cleaner year in 2019 the fair market value of the desk is pretty much burned off you would probably have the preferred but you know what we didn t not put that in our forecast because it s just almost impossible mostly impossible to predict but those are the key non cash items in 2019 i think as the good news as we ve had the bad news is we ve had a good bit of noise over the last few years for some of those items rob but i think as we move forward 19 20 beyond we re very glad to be in more stable years with less of that noise and should have more consistent growth h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer i ll add one point rob absent anything in the preferred which is non cash was about 500 000 or so less than that debt mark to market non cash and that s albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer virtually gone h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer that s pretty much it albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer yeah robert stevenson janney montgomery analyst okay so nareit normalized the core ffo should be at this point in the year you guys think would be fairly consistent but for anything that happens on a preferred and that 500 000 of debt albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer that s right excluding the preferred we think those numbers will be very close okay thanks guys appreciate it operator and we ll go ahead and take our next question from drew babin from baird please go ahead your line is open drew babin robert w baird co analyst hey good morning h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer hi drew good morning with regard to dallas atlanta and charlotte kind of being your three biggest markets those are the three markets where you had a lot of post legacy assets would you say the lease over lease blended pricing expectations are above the midpoint of the two to three range for the year for those three markets i mean if not what in the case of dallas i would assume they might be lower how this uptown stack up versus the northern suburban assets where i know there s a lot of supply inaudible thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer yeah no they re lower and dallas as you mentioned uptown it s under pressure but frisco plano and mckinney are all seeing their fair share as well atlanta and charlotte a little bit different inside the perimeter atlanta outside the perimeter atlanta two different markets we re very strong outside the perimeter end market in atlanta and the majority of the headwinds that we have on supply are peachtree road midtown downtown and it really inner loop and in charlotte it s sort of a similar picture where uptown downtown south church area seeing a little bit more supply and the suburb is broadly stronger so dallas a little bit wider spread and it s more targeted in the atlanta and charlotte markets drew babin robert w baird co analyst okay and we would say the post legacy assets if you kind of broke those out with some of the redevelopments and renovations would you say that those assets are doing better than kind of the 2 7 at midpoint on that lease over lease thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer yeah the number of renovations that we have done thus far on the post side of things drew is not enough to really impact that just yet it s building and it will come but those post properties are facing a little bit uphill battle on the supply right in their backyard drew babin robert w baird co analyst okay that s helpful and one question for al just on the line balance i think we re still over 500 million at the end of the year and i m not sure if that includes the turmoil or not but as you look out to maybe more permanently finance that what are the options on the table and guidance if we could start with that i have a follow up albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer right actually no the term loan is not in our line of credit outstanding balance drew it s a good point just in context we paid off about over 600 million just over 600 million of debt in the late in the year as we talked about and we had a plan as we talked about a few quarters to do bond it will active in the bond market late in the year but the market volatility really causes us to be little more patient there and so we talked about doing 600 million maybe some long term tenure and some normal tenure so what we did we revised our plans a little bit and did a little bit of a secured 30 year behind of 172 million we saw and we put 300 million term loan which is it was short term term loan which we would expect to be active in the bond markets only here to replace that so i think in going forward what you should see is you should expect in your model is a bond deal in the first part of the year replacing that 300 million and maybe a couple of hundred million more of debt whether it will be opportunistic whether it s bond whether it s mortgage secured mortgage averaging about 4 5 rates what we have in the forecast for us for the year so markets will give us what they give us and that s what we ve dialed in drew babin robert w baird co analyst okay and with the 30 year mortgage you did in the fourth quarter what was the rate benefit of doing that versus the 30 year unsecured and then as you look out to this year is the 30 year unsecured bond is still on the table albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer yeah absolutely one of the interesting things we saw late in the year was doing a 30 year bond as markets got volatile the spreads really widened on that as you d expect the perceived risk but on the secured market which is a more of private market it was much tighter and so we had 4 4 rate on that all in which is well below we could ve gotten the bond even when things were fairly stable so i think that was good execution we don t we obviously don t want to we want to protect our balance sheet we want to get too much secured debt but you could see use a little bit more because we have about 8 of our assets are encumbered right now so it s very very low so we could do a little bit more so you may see us next year do a little bit more of that if the rates are good and then have a bond deal in the 300 million to 400 million range drew babin robert w baird co analyst okay great very helpful thank you operator we will take our next question from john guinee from stifel please go ahead your line is open john guinee stifel nicolaus company analyst great thank you nice quarter when i look at your what i would call a true fab number after subtracting that revenue creating capex it looks like you re going to be in the 4 25 to 4 50 number in 2019 and i think you just increased your dividend about 4 after 3 84 how do you feel over time about being able to sustain a 4 plus dividend increase annually h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer this is eric we feel pretty good about that honestly we think that we re going to be in a position i mean we look at various points in the cycle obviously but we think we re trending back to a normal sort of same store internal earnings growth rate that s going to be in the kind of 3 range or thereabout on a year over year basis and as we outlined we do believe that the external growth front is going to get better at some point from an acquisitions perspective over the next couple of years we are increasing our ability to deploy capital and some pretty accretive yields on new development and so we think that over the next couple of years the external growth picture gets a little stronger and so it s going to add another 1 or 2 to that and then you could leverage on that you start to get to a and of course as we continue the recycling effort we ll be selling off older assets and redeploying into newer assets which is going to be beneficial from us more beneficial from a fab perspective with lower capex on a newer asset so i would tell you we feel pretty uncomfortable about a long term sustainable growth rate of that dividend in the 4 to 5 range john guinee stifel nicolaus company analyst great thank you very much h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer you bet operator operator instructions and we will go ahead move onto tayo okusanya from jefferies please go ahead your line is open omotayo okusanya jefferies analyst hi yes good morning everyone a question around the redevelopment of the apartment the cost per unit was a little bit elevated this quarter just curious whether that s mix or whether that s the case of construction cost are going up in general and if that s the case if it has any impact on the return on the yield thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer it s mixed tayo as we feather in more of the post portfolio that s 8 000 per unit average roughly and that s pulled by average up over time albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer and the good news on that tayo as the rent increases the economic returns are similar this is just relative to the large capital you get higher results higher rent increase thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer we don t compromise we don t compromise on returns omotayo okusanya jefferies analyst okay that s helpful and the second thing i want to kind of explore is 2019 guidance the blended rate again 2 2 to 3 2 so an average about 2 7 or so i m just talking about renewals of 5 5 to 6 5 so that means new rates will be kind of a 0 ish basically for the year and i m just curious you made the comment earlier on that given the backdrop for your portfolio you re more likely push price even at the risk of losing some occupancy but when i kind of think about renewals at 6 and new leases at about zero and the risk that you may have a couple of developers getting aggressive with pricing and your ability it sounds like this full year is going to boil down to the ability of kind of get 6 on renewals its like exactly the story this year and that new leases is going to be it is what it is albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer i ll start with that and tom can add some color on that tayo i think how we thought about the forecast was we are very happy with january performance but as we look for the full year we expect renewals to continue to trend so we saw the logic ph from last year we would kind of assuming 5 5 5 to 6 range 5 5 to 6 most likely for the year and so new lease pricing is going to be the most competitive part it has been and as we as the supply pressure continues in the market at high levels that will be the point of most competition so you re right doing the math that is flat to slightly positive i think is what that general expectation would be different market to market some markets will be negative but under more pressure and some are more positive so you want to give color on some of that tom thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer and we touched on it earlier new lease rate new lease rates will be under pressure in town atlanta charlotte later dallas and austin but that will vary from place to place we also see i think strong new lease growth from tampa orlando jacksonville phoenix so its hard to generalize omotayo okusanya jefferies analyst okay that s helpful thank you operator operator instructions we will go ahead and take our next question from hardik goel from zelman associates please go ahead hardik goel zelman associates analyst hi guys thanks for taking my questions i was just wondering on the land parcels you guys acquired in houston and denver how you came up on that opportunity how long have you been looking at that and how you re underwriting development today on those and just a sense for what the yield might be on those h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer well we have been looking at both of these opportunities for quite some time probably anywhere from six months to nine months in advance of actually getting to a point where we re able to put them under contract the opportunity in denver is in the areas just a little bit northwest of downtown sort of half between denver downtown denver and boulder an area called westminster that we are well into predevelopment on we expect to start later in the year and the kind of the august time frame but this is something that based on our initial we re still finalizing numbers and so forth but we would expect to stabilize yield out of this investment somewhere in the 6 5 range on the denver opportunity the houston opportunity is just kind of west of downtown sort of halfway between the galleria area and the energy corridor area just off of i10 again it s something it s an area going through some sort of regentrification we are pretty excited about the opportunity and again there we re looking at start sometime late this year probably in the november time frame and our early analysis on stabilized yield puts that about 6 4 so both very creative opportunities based on the underwriting we re looking at right now as we approach these opportunities i mean we talked with we ve got a group of developer group of contractors that we ve done a lot of business with and get preliminary pricing for them but we worked with them enough to have a lot of confidence that the numbers we get from them are something we feel pretty good about and then we assume some escalation factor in that based on what we do in predevelopment before the time we actually lock down the contracts and go to fixed price contracts so more to come on all of this but we feel pretty good about the opportunities at this point hardik goel zelman associates analyst and does that just as a follow up is that the same sort of hurdle you would describe to the emerging build acquisitions you re planning on making is that 6 5 or is it a little lower than that h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer yes it s probably a little bit lower than that it depends on the situation if we ve got an opportunity that we re working with right now in phoenix with crescent on essentially a prepurchase or something that they are going to build they will be the developer they will take the majority of that risk and so we re comfortable taking that down at a slightly lower yield it s still be low about 6 but i think that it depends on situation it depends on just the risk that we underwrite but all these opportunities we re looking right now are going to be well north of 6 hardik goel zelman associates analyst got it thank you that s all from me operator operator instructions and we can go ahead and take our next question from jim sullivan from btig james sullivan btig analyst thank you guys i just want to drill down a little bit more of the discussion about expenses for 19 i think back in nareit you were talking about a 7 million number i think of kind of credits and one off items that benefited the 18 numbers and if we adjust through that in the 18 totals that your report for both management property management and g a we re still getting an increase in 2019 of about 9 in the overhead line item and i think there were some comment that there was kind of annualizing some higher expenses that were put in place in 18 that accounts for that and but when i look at the individual items property management for example that s gone up it went up more than 4 went up about 10 in 18 it s going up about 14 in 19 and yet this is occurring at a time when same store revenue growth is not going up that much for all the reasons we have discussed what accounts for that dichotomy when i say dichotomy your operating expenses that you can control that is other than real estate taxes are going up as you ve indicated below 3 but management expenses are going up nearly 3 times that what explains that difference in yearly change albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer hey jim this is al i think as we about talked a lot it has to do with comparisons to 18 that you outlined we certainly we actually had a reduction in cost in 18 but in 2019 we will feel the full run rate of the investments we made in our platform that we talked about are long and very important to produce the results that we expect from the future in the people systems facilities web presence all those things that we talked about and so when you look at 19 to 18 it does look high but if you look at 18 to 19 and what we expect in 20 and you re going forward and looking at a little bit longer period it will land to more of a 5 to 6 growth rate over time and i m talking about both of those together we think of it as overhead which is the g a plus the property management together we sort of manage it as overhead as a bucket and so i think over a three year window we feel that sector average 5 to 6 growth is what we re doing we ll do there and so 2020 will be a little more modest because obviously we made meaningful investments and we ll be able to grow more efficiently in the nearby areas that s how we thought about the next year james sullivan btig analyst you do describe the two of those items together as a bucket adding summing it up to overhead but in 2018 the property management expense rose 10 and g a was down significantly presumably most of the credits that you have talked about the onetime items benefited the g a line as opposed to the property management line in 18 is that true albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer no they re all over the place because a lot of the people could be either one i mean so you re talk about people and systems cost typically in the property management so it can be the things that outline could be easily on either side of that and so i think that s one of the reasons we really try to look at it together and just as more simple say look we have overhead structure this total and we re managing it that way and so i think it s little easier to think about it holistically james sullivan btig analyst okay then a final question for me kind of a macro you ve kind of made two comments today about growth rates you ve talked about kind of a longer term kind of normalized same store noi growth rate in terms of expectation of something like 3 annually and yet when you ve talked about the overhead expense line you ve talked about i think it s been described two ways a long term growth rate of 5 is i think as you ve indicated in some of your presentations before and i think today on the call it was somebody mentioned 5 to 6 and i guess that dichotomy seems inconsistent with a scalable platform one would have assumed with the post merger that you were building a scalable platform and part of that conclusion would be that they be the overhead cost would not be increasing at the same rate as the overall revenues is that wrong am i thinking about that correctly albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer well i think what you have to think about is same store is that same store it s not assuming growth it s the same portfolio in this year compared to the production part of the previous year i think the important thing to think about an overhead in g a as you talk about growing companies for us and the sector where does the acquisition development or even many ways and so your g a over time is going to grow more than your same store for growing companies and i think if you look at the sector average over time that s what we re talking about a nareit over the last couple of years and what we mentioned earlier was if you look at the sector average over time for that area it s more like 5 to 6 growth h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer the only things you have to look at jim is you have to factor in external growth component as well because this platform the overhead platform if you will is supporting not only same store but supporting external growth as well and i think to the extent that we can capture organic internal growth and new external growth on a combined basis at a growth rate that is beyond the 5 then i think the margin component there that you re sort of alluding to i think starts to make more sense the other thing to keep in mind is that you re talking about 3 growth organic growth of a big number you re talking about 5 growth on overhead on a smaller aggregate dollar numbers so the dollar margin is still growing thomas l grimes jr executive vice president chief operating officer the only comment i would make on that latter point is that as you probably know many of your peers report noi and same store noi after property management expenses rather than before and if we were in your case to look at the same store noi computation you have in the sub and compute it that way the growth in same store noi would be lower it would be closer to about a 1 4 number so we understand the same store is total noi noi non same store noi tends to be about 7 or so of total noi so it s a much smaller number we do understand there s extra cost involved in that effort of course but still we tend to look at property management expenses as driven by revenue line and g a line i don t know i would content based on our analysis that over time the g a line has not grown as much as the overall revenue line for the company for most of the companies we cover so just a thought as you think about the scalability of the platform and i guess i can leave it at that james sullivan btig analyst i understand your point i understand your point operator and we will go ahead and take our next question from daniel bernstein from capital one daniel bernstein capital one analyst good morning just wanted to touch a little bit on the comment on the developers become a little bit more aggressive on leasing is that just the assumption you re making or you re actually seeing some of that more aggressive leasing with the discounting given three months so i just wanted to understand where that comments coming from h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer it s really more of an assumption at this point daniel tom can give you some perspective on what we re seeing and more specifically with the lease concessions but it hasn t really changed a whole lot over the last sort of 60 90 days but we just think that as you get later in the cycle and particularly some of these projects continue to face later deliveries and we get into the busy summer season we just think that it s entirely possible that you may see a little it ll vary by some market but you may see a little bit more aggressive prices but we have not seen any real evidence of that as of yet operator i m sorry go ahead h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer no that s fine daniel bernstein capital one analyst actually one here just that refers to the apartment developers have you seen increased concession or competition from single family residence rentals h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer no i mean i say no we re not tracking them move outs to single family rentals is such a small percentage and while there is a company that has reasonable scale they re scattered out and really don t affect our markets i could not speak to what their pricing is albert m campbell executive vice president chief financial officer our move outs to single family rental is only about 6 or 7 of our total move out it s been that way forever it hasn t really changed so it s not really a pressure point for us daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay that s all i had thank you operator operator instructions we ll go ahead and take our next question from john pawlowski from greenstreet advisor john pawlowski greenstreet advisor analyst thanks eric could you provide some thoughts on how your external growth strategy and your smaller secondary markets might look in a world where liquidity from fannie and freddie are declined meaningfully and those are away understanding now we know what s going to happen and we ve been waiting for 10 years for something to happen but would you expect to see more dislocation in pricing in your smaller southeast metros and would you act on that h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer the answer is yes and yes i would think that if fannie financing work to for whatever reason pull back i think you re going to see it to have more of an impact on transaction activity in some of the smaller market so it ll certainly have an impact in places like dallas and atlanta as well but i m thinking of markets like greenville and richmond and nashville and savannah and charleston and i think you could see more of an impact in those markets and yes we absolutely continued to feel very strongly about the merits and the value of having capital deployed in some of these higher growth more secondary markets believing that the long term performance profile from an earnings perspective over time out of those markets fits very much with our portfolio strategy and we would certainly jump on opportunities that might come about as a consequence of what you described john pawlowski greenstreet advisor analyst i guess sense for sensitivity again purely hypothetical do you think in your average smaller secondary markets values fall by 5 more than the atlanta of the world or 10 more how big do you think it could be if fannie and freddie went away overnight h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer i think to some degree it really depends on just how aggressive institutional capital continues to stay and direct their resources toward multifamily housing i think that while dallas or atlanta may not feel it as much as a secondary market as you know there s just a ton of capital out there that continues to want to deploy in multifamily and despite if the agencies pulled back for some reason well on the margin it will have an impact on some of these smaller buyers i think we are more well capitalized private capital balance sheets would probably not be as impacted and so some of these more dynamic secondary markets may still find a fair amount of interest and so it s hard to say to what degree a charleston south carolina is impacted versus a dallas i don t really know it just depends on how much interest private capital still has on a charleston large well capitalized balance sheet private balance sheet to have in charleston john pawlowski greenstreet advisor analyst understood last one for me what job growth assumptions underpin your 2019 revenue growth outlook h eric bolton jr chairman and chief executive officer yes i would tell you basically it s not on an assumption that things continue pretty much like they are right now i think that our forecast can withstand a little moderation in job growth but not a lot candidly and i think that if we saw the employment market and job growth trends severely pull back i think it s a different ballgame but we had as you know and i know you pointed out in a lot of your research that the job growth rates are going to likely moderate at some point and i think that there s no indication near term that we re headed to that sort of scenario so our 2019 assumptions are built on a continuation of what we see but frankly at some level i can t look forward to it happening and while it s going to be depending on where we are in the supply cycle it could be painful two or three quarters as we work through that but certainly we think that some of these lease up projects and some of the supply coming online will face some pretty severe pressure which is going to create new things and great opportunities to capture some value on an acquisition side and we ve got a balance sheet ready to jump on that shouldn t happen but anyway we think 19 looks a lot like 18 on that regard john pawlowski greenstreet advisor analyst all right great thanks operator and we will go ahead to take our final question from buck horne from raymond james please go ahead your line is open buck horne raymond james analyst no thanks guys my questions have all been answered so i will end the call there thank you h eric bolton jr chairman and chief

denver jan 31 2019 prnewswire m d c holdings inc nyse mdc announced results for the quarter and full year ended december 31 2018 larry a mizel mdc s chairman and chief executive officer stated 2018 was a banner year for mdc as home sales revenues increased 19 home sales gross margins expanded 170 basis points and pretax income rose to its highest level in over a decade in addition we ended the year in excellent financial condition with a homebuilding debt to capital ratio of 39 and enhanced liquidity following the increase of our homebuilding line of credit from 700 million to 1 0 billion in the fourth quarter furthermore we delivered on our goal of 10 active community count growth to start 2019 mr mizel continued the fourth quarter marked a strong end to the year as we made significant year over year improvements to our top and bottom line however order activity during the quarter was not as robust as it was last year a sign that buyers are being patient with their purchase decisions years of price appreciation coupled with recent uncertainty about mortgage rates have understandably made some buyers cautious and have resulted in a slower sales pace for our industry fortunately we have adjusted our strategy over the past few years to address the rising cost of home ownership by bringing down the price points of our homes our more affordable home offerings were well received in 2018 and we anticipate the same will be true in 2019 mr mizel concluded we continue to believe that the outlook for our industry remains favorable with rising wages
